HEADLINE: The Region;
Connecticut Begrudgingly Considers an Income Tax.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
About 20 years ago, Connecticut politicians tried tinkering with the state's tax system and brought on a political clampdown. They created and passed an income tax for the first time, but within weeks the law was repealed under a storm of public outrage. Tax reformers went underground, and a new generation of income-tax hard-liners within the state's majority Democratic party came to power.
Under Gov. Ella T. Grasso, elected in 1974, and her successor, Gov. William A. O'Neill, who will end 10 years in office next January, every mention of an income tax was greeted with a thundering vow of veto from the State Capitol. Across the state, politicians with higher ambitions took ''the pledge'' as it became known, promising unswerving opposition no matter how they may have actually felt. 
But now it appears the great thaw has begun. For the first time since the 1970's a Democratic candidate for governor has emerged who not only espouses an income tax at every turn but claims to have attracted enough support within the party to force a primary election - and thus force an open debate on the once unspeakable subject.
The candidate, State Representative William J. Cibes Jr., a little-known professor of political science at Connecticut College, advocates coupling a tax on wages with deep cuts in other taxes, especially the sales tax, which at 8 percent is the highest statewide rate in the nation. Connecticut now taxes unearned income like dividends, interest and capital gains, but is one of only 10 states without a tax on wages.
Mr. Cibes has announced that at least 20 percent of the delegates to the Democratic State Convention, which meets here next weekend, had pledged their votes to him, a key threshold in the state election law that would enable him to challenge the party's front-runner, United States Representative Bruce A. Morrison, in a primary election on Sept. 11. Even Mr. Morrison has conceded Mr. Cibes's gains and the likelihood of a primary.
And that's where it all starts to get a little murky, and the oddities of Connecticut's near obsession with the tax as a political issue start to become apparent. Many of those who would seem most likely to be cheering Mr. Cibes on - especially from the liberal wing of the Democratic party that has chafed against Mr. O'Neill and his adamant stand against an income tax - have not been entirely enthusiastic. Some of them support Mr. Morrison, who has long been identified as one of the more liberal members of the state's Congressional delegation, while others argue that Mr. Cibes's candidacy could in fact be a setback in their efforts to change the tax system.
Because most politicians expect Mr. Cibes to lose in September against Mr. Morrison, who is better known and better financed, the liberals fear that Mr. Cibes's defeat would be interpreted as a rejection of the tax and not simply of the candidate himself. ''Anybody who tries to elaborate tax reform proposals is almost certain to fail,'' said Stanley B. Greenberg, president of Greenberg-Lake Inc., a national Democratic polling firm retained by Mr. Morrison. ''The voters are too cynical, the medium for communication is too simplified, and there are too many people who have an interest in simplifying it.''
Mr. Cibes has seen his candidacy bolstered by what might seem to be one of the most unlikely sources of all: Mr. O'Neill and many of his supporters. Mr. O'Neill, while stressing that he opposes Mr. Cibes's ideas on tax revision, has gone out of his way recently to praise Mr. Cibes as a personal friend and a ''great asset to the Democratic Party.''
Mr. Morrison, among others, has said he thinks that most of Mr. Cibes's convention delegates are in fact former O'Neill supporters who do not believe in an income tax any more than the Governor does and who are supporting Mr. Cibes for other reasons. Revenge is often mentioned: Mr. Morrison was unrelenting in his criticism of Mr. O'Neill in the months before the Governor's withdrawl from the race in March, and many Democrats have yet to forget.
Pollsters say, however, that whatever odd twists may be occurring within the Democratic Party, public opposition to an income tax has not subsided. They say that many residents, still reeling from last year's record $800 million tax increase and perhaps facing another difficult budget next spring, are more suspicious about politicians and taxes than ever before.
According to a poll in April by the state's largest polling organization, the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at the University of Connecticut, only about 26 percent of the state's residents favored an income tax, down from a record high of 41 percent recorded in early 1989. Seventy percent thought taxes were too high, compared to an average of about 60 percent through most of the 1980's. ''Resistance to tax increases is the strongest I've seen in 20 years of polling,'' said Everett C. Ladd, the center's director.
A key question for Mr. Morrison is how far he can afford to go in opposing an income tax without alienating the liberal Democrats who back his candidacy.
Several weeks ago, for example, Mr. Morrison declared that as governor he would veto any income-tax bill unless it could be shown through a statewide referendum that a majority of state residents supported the idea. Mr. Cibes, who is co-chairman of the General Assembly's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, immediately declared that his opponent had ''taken the pledge,'' a charge Mr. Morrison denied. Some of Mr. Morrison's supporters said that if he moved much closer toward completely ruling out an income tax they would abandon him. ''There's been some uneasiness,'' said State Representative Miles A. Rapoport, a longtime income-tax advocate who is in Mr. Morrison's camp.
Of the others in the gubernatorial race, only the lone remaining Republican candidate, United States Representive John G. Rowland, has said that he would veto any income-tax package. And the candidate that most polls indicate is the front-runner, former United States Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican who is running as an independent, has appeared to back away from an income tax. Mr. Weicker, while not ruling out an income tax, recently said he would not favor one, at least right now while the state's economy is weak and unemployment is rising. A spokeswoman for Mr. Weicker, Avice Meehan, insisted, however, that all options would remain open.
''He has not taken the pledge,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Aid Can Answer a Soviet Question

 BODY:
Secretary of State James Baker says the United States won't stand in the way of allies who want to offer aid to the Soviet Union. And the Bush Administration is prepared to send technical assistance, but not to extend credits.
That's an improvement on Defense Secretary Cheney's outright opposition to aid. But it doesnanmatch the vision demonstrated by NATO leaders in London on Friday who charted a new course for the alliance and Europe. And it's too little and too slow to bolster Mr. Gorbachev against bitter Old Guard assaults on his foreign policy. 
Given the high stakes that the U.S. has in that policy, President Bush would do better to join other Western leaders in pledging Western economic aid at this week's economic summit meeting in Houston. In return, he'd have every right to expect the Soviet leader to accommodate him by cutting military spending and aid to Cuba.
Mr. Gorbachev faces no sterner challenge from the Old Guard at the Communist Party Congress than the question, Who lost Eastern Europe? Conservative critics like Yegor Ligachev blame Mr. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze for the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe.
''What socialism?'' Mr. Gorbachev lashes back. ''A variety of the Stalinist authoritarian and bureaucratic system that we ourselves have abandoned.'' Mr. Shevardnadze gives no ground to critics, either: ''It is high time to understand that neither socialism nor friendship, nor good neighborliness, nor respect, can rest on bayonets, tanks or blood.'' And he likens the Old Guard's question to the notorious McCarthyite query in the 1950's, Who lost China?
But the Gorbachev-Shevardnadze defense of new thinking in foreign policy can't rest on rhetoric alone. They need to show the Soviet people that withdrawal from Eastern Europe will yield other benefits, mainly Western economic help.
Mr. Bush says he has a hard time sending a big aid package to the Soviets when they're spending 18 percent of their gross national product on defense and about $5 billion a year on Cuba. That's good bargaining, but he can drive a better bargain by using carrots as well as sticks.
If Mr. Bush wants to encourage the Soviet move to markets, he does that best by joining the allies. That way, he can help direct aid to enterprises that have a chance of promoting competitive markets. Failure to act with the allies could limit U.S. influence in shaping Europe's future.
Prompt and prudent aid from the West, in the expectation of further real reductions in Soviet defense spending and assistance to Cuba, could help Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze defeat the Old Guard and thereby sustain a foreign policy that also benefits the West.

HEADLINE: Taxes in Other Countries Buy More Services

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With tax increases in the air, we are frequently exposed to the statement that United States taxes overall are lower than those of other major industrial countries. This statement is probably based on data in the Statistical Abstract of the United States (tax revenues - selected countries), which show about 30 percent of our gross domestic product (about $5,000 per capita a year) going to taxes, compared with about 38 percent ($3,800 per capita) in Britain. 
These figures are fairly accurate, as far as they go, but to make a comparison between countries, we need to know what citizens get for their taxes, what sort of public safety, public transportation, legal services or health services.
An excellent argument can be made in each case that the United States is deficient. Taking health services as an example, we know that all other major industrial countries deliver basic health services from tax revenues. Those of us lucky enough to have health insurance pay about $1,200 per capita a year, directly or through company benefits. Our expenditures for health care exceed 11 percent of gross domestic product.
Based on the health-services disparity alone and the resultant imputed tax on the individual, it appears that our taxes overall are far higher than those of other major industrial countries.

HEADLINE: Soviet Rural Life Looked at Through Urban-Colored Glasses

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It seems to me, as a specialist on Soviet rural areas and peasant behavior, that your coverage of the Soviet Union is too urban oriented. For instance, your June 24 front-page report on Leningrad notes that ''when state farms in the countryside issued their annual demand for city workers to help weed the fields and bring in the early vegetables, the city announced that it would no longer comply.''
Farmers, administrators and officials alike have complained for years about the difficulties involved in ''shefstvo'' (the system by which factories and other organizations contract with farms to supply labor or machinery for harvesting in return for agricultural products). But if the Leningrad City Council has to negotiate with the Baltic republics for meat, milk and vegetables, it means that the council has not been able to consider agreements with its own local farmers that would yield quicker and more reliable results. 
A report in March in Selskaia zhizn, showed that the state farms in the Leningrad area got only 70 percent of the help they had asked for, so they cut back on planting, and 40,000 tons of vegetables were not delivered to the shops. The farms were also given 20 million rubles less equipment and other industrial machinery than asked for. Assuming that the Leningrad City Council seriously wants to solve the problem of produce supply to the cities, it is going to have to come to grips with the fact that the farmers believe that perestroika has given them only ''remainders'' from the workings of the system.
Contrary to your June 15 front-page report from Moscow on increases in the price of bread, farmers feed bread to their pigs not ''because it is cheaper than animal feed,'' but because fodder is often not available at any price. Less meat is coming to market because many farm families no longer own livestock, and sometimes not even chickens.
State procurement prices are, given the labor involved in production, extremely low, and although an effort is being made to raise them, I question whether simply turning over failing agricultural enterprises to individual peasants or families will really solve the issue of ''socialist slavery'' and ''stoop labor,'' as Piotr S. Filipov of the Leningrad City Council seems to think.
Unless small-scale private farming has access to tractors, spare parts, trucks, gasoline and storage facilities, it's doubtful that small-scale farms have any advantage over the present system.

HEADLINE: The Conflict Within George Bush

BYLINE: By James Reston; James Reston, former Washington correspondent and executive editor of The New York Times, is writing his memoirs.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Being tired of reading George Bush's lips, I was reading some of my old newspaper clips the other day, and there in the middle of The Times's Op-Ed page of May 2, 1979, was a big headline: ''George Bush for President?''
The first paragraph said: ''By age (55), appearance (handsome), location (Texas) and reputation (exemplary), George Herbert Walker Bush is clearly justified by experience and character to challenge the older leaders of the Republican Party for its Presidential nomination.''
It went on to say that there was something reassuring about his past. Always at the beginning of his many jobs, he was praised for being ''competent,'' ''intelligent,'' ''experienced'' and ''decent.'' Always too, doubts were expressed about whether he could succeed, but there was ''applause for his record at the end.'' 
Well, the doubts remain, but halfway through his first term in the White House, he has convinced more than half the people who answer polls that he knows how to navigate the Potomac, a treacherous stream. Nobody's crazy about him, but nobody's very mad at him either. He knows where the rocks are. He tacks with the wind and he stays afloat.
He's not at all like Ronald Reagan. He works. He reads and listens - but he smudges every line. He doesn't call a spade a spade, but a useful agricultural implement. He didn't say he was wrong and would now ''raise taxes.'' He didn't say that he ''required,'' but that deficit reduction ''required,'' in addition to spending cuts, ''tax revenue increases.'' This could mean more revenue from existing taxes if the economy grows, or better tax collection or (maybe) more revenue from a cut in the capital gains tax. It speaks for itself, he said, but we're still reading his lips.
What is going on here much of the time is not merely a clash between the Democrats and the President but a conflict inside the President. It's a wrestling match between the Gentleman from Connecticut and the Politician from Texas. In the campaign of 1988, the Texas politician prevailed, but lately the conscience of the New England gentleman has been peeping through in one compromise after another, and what has emerged is ''Halfway George.''
President Reagan didn't respond to criticism - seldom ever noticed it, but that's not Mr. Bush's way. He's not impressed by the flatterers who tell him: ''Go to it, George. You can do it!'' But if he's told he can't do it or won't do it, he does it, even if it's wrong.
He was charged with being a ''wimp'' in 1988, so he ran a nasty campaign against Bob Dole in the primaries and then against Michael S. Dukakis. He was told he was being too easy on Lieut. Gen. Manuel Noriega, so he invaded Panama with an Army and a rock-'n'-roll band. This violated all the principles and treaty commitments he had proclaimed as the U.N. envoy. But he got his man, with casualties and costs he minimized, and now he doesn't know what to do with him.
When the primitives of his party complained that he was ungrateful for their support in the election and that maybe he was a closet liberal, he repaid them by dumping Dan Quayle on the country and insisting that this unfortunate baby-boomer was the best-qualified person to be Vice President. Normally a generous man, he didn't even thank the Democrats for nominating Mr. Dukakis.
He is, however, a very good politician. He ducked the press during his campaign, anticipating its questions about his silent partnership with Mr. Reagan and his tricky tactics against Mr. Dukakis, but once in the White House he held more press conferences, gave more interviews and appeared on more TV news programs than any President since the last World War.
President Reagan avoided the Democratic leaders of Congress whenever he could, regarding them as obstacles to his dream of cutting taxes and borrowing his way to prosperity, but George sees them all the time. He listens to their mystifying clarifications. He has them over to the house for dinner, pitches horse-shoes with them, takes them sailing and lets them share the blame for the housing and savings and loan scandals. It's quite an achievement, and it's fun trying to figure out who's ahead, George or his conscience.
Either way he has luck, which is the politician's best friend. He didn't win the cold war; the Communists just came to their senses when he was riding down Pennsylvania Avenue from the inauguration. And in addition to Mikhail Gorbachev as an opponent, he inherited the Democrats just when they had run out of candidates and ideas. He is also lucky in Barbara Bush, who is the most comfortable and appealing First Lady we've had since the foundation of Wellesley's school of manners.
So I don't regret that reckless endorsement of George Herbert Walker Bush in 1979. It wasn't too bad, considering the alternative. He's not very heroic. He beats around the bush. He thinks half a loaf is not only better than no bread but better than a whole bakery, and the American people like him, probably because they're sort of like him: friendly, optimistic, fairly prosperous and not too worried about the people who are left behind.

HEADLINE: The Broad Benefits of a Gasoline Tax Hike

BYLINE: By Charles H. Percy; Charles H. Percy, former Republican Senator from Illinois, is chairman of the Alliance to Save Energy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Do you wish gas prices were as cheap as they were in the ''good old days'' of the 1950's? If so, you might be surprised to learn that you would be hoping for an increase in gas prices. After adjusting for inflation, Americans now spend some 35 cents less per gallon of gasoline than they did in 1950.
The Bush Administration and Congress are searching for ways to reduce the deficit during their continuing budget summit meeting. One of the best solutions would be to boost significantly the current 9.1 cents per gallon Federal tax on gasoline. This single action would simultaneously have three beneficial effects - reducing the budget deficit, strengthening U.S. national security and the balance of trade and improving the environment. 
Yet raising the gasoline tax, perhaps even more so than increasing income taxes, has traditionally been viewed as politically risky. When I introduced legislation more than a decade ago calling for a 30 cent per gallon gas tax, not one senator joined as a co-sponsor. But times may be changing. A new NBC News poll found that, if new revenues are needed, 44 percent of Americans favor raising the gas tax, as opposed to only 26 percent in January.
Had this gas tax hike been enacted in 1978, the situation we face today would be radically different in several ways:
* Increased gasoline prices would have spurred more rapid development of fuel-efficient automobiles and alternatively fueled vehicles such as electric cars.
* Oil consumption would have been reduced by about 600,000 barrels a day, leading in turn to lower oil imports (now climbing to 50 percent of U.S. consumption). Lower oil imports would have enhanced our industrial competitiveness, not to speak of national security. Energy imports accounted for nearly 40 percent of our $109 billion trade deficit last year.
* Air pollution would have been reduced significantly. Although transportation-related emissions make up only a portion of total carbon dioxide emissions, a 30 cent gas tax increase in 1978 would have reduced by over half the increase in total carbon dioxide emissions between 1978 and 1988.
* The Federal treasury would have received more than $250 billion over the past 12 years. These funds could have been used to reduce the deficit or to address other critical needs, such as rebuilding America's transportation infrastructure.
While America did not capitalize on this opportunity 12 years ago, we can now. Current gas prices are rela-tively stable and taxes as a percentage of the pump price are low.
In fact, the percentage of gas prices attributable to Federal taxes has decreased by 35 percent since the early 1960's. The amount Americans paid in Federal gasoline tax for each car they drove has declined from an average of $108 in 1960 to only $52 in 1986, in 1989 dollars. Furthermore, the United States has the lowest total state and Federal tax as a percentage of gasoline prices of the major industrialized countries - 33 percent compared with 45 percent in Japan and 66 percent in West Germany.
What benefits would flow from enacting a 50 cent gas tax today (roughly the same after inflation as the 30 cent proposal of 1978)? Gasoline consumption could be expected to drop by 10 percent in the short term - twice that in the long run - with 250 million fewer tons of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere each year. The Federal treasury would gain about $40 billion annually.
Since a 50 cent tax hike would be a significant change, it could be phased in over the next five years to give both consumers and the ecomomy time to adjust. With or without a phase-in period, however, the new tax should be indexed to inflation to insure that revenues are not eroded over time, as they have been in the past.
To be sure, any new gas tax is difficult, both for political leaders and their constituents. But if Federal officials are serious about tackling the deficit, trade and environmental problems they must increase the gasoline tax by more than just a few cents.
Increasing the gas tax is good economic, energy and environmental policy. Each day we delay raising gasoline taxes makes future options that much more painful.

Airline Group Fights German Security Levy
Passengers embarking on planes in West Germany now have to pay a $2 security charge imposed by the West German Government. The levy took effect July 1 and affects all passengers on all airlines at all West German airports.
The move has been criticized by the International Air Transport Association, which represents the world's major international airlines.
''We firmly believe that the cost of maintaining security at airports, like anywhere else in a country, should be borne by the state in question,'' said Guenter O. Eser, the director general of association, at its Geneva headquarters.
Mr. Eser said that the association, which has 190 airline members, was not in favor of governments' using airlines as collecting agencies. In the past, he said, passengers paid airport taxes separately and knew what they were paying for and to whom. Now the levy is hidden in the price of the ticket, with the carriers legally liable for their collection and payment to the government, he said. 
 
A New Guide To Mexico
MEXICO CITY
As the favorite vacation destination of millions of Americans, Mexico is the subject of guidebooks galore, so the question arises: is there the need for another publication in so crowded a field? The answer must be a resounding yes if the work is as high in quality and thorough in detail as the new Michelin green guide to Mexico.
Using the same format as the Michelin guides to Europe, the book presents natural wonders, pre-Hispanic civilizations, colonial constructions and modern museums with a wealth of background information. Lesser known spots like Los Tuxtlas in Veracruz or the coastline of the state of Nayarit also get their due.
Particularly welcome are various tables and graphs. One table lists the main deities of Aztec and Maya mythology along with their attributes and powers; another enumerates the principal Indian groups and their location, language, religion, principal handcrafts and dances. Maps of principal cities and archeological sites are clear and easy to use, and there are color photographs of major churches and Indian temples.
For those interested in learning something about Mexico while sightseeing, this is the book to pack. - LARRY ROHTER
 
Vienna-Prague
Rail Fares Cut
To promote rail travel between Austria and Czechoslovakia, the state railways of the two neighboring countries have temporarily reduced fares by 30 to 40 percent for certain trains linking Vienna with Czechoslovak cities. For example, the round-trip fare between Vienna and Prague in second class is $38.50 (based on 11.7 Austrian schillings to $1) for the 1:29 P.M. train from Vienna's Franz Josef Terminal, reaching Prague at 7:36 P.M. The return trip leaves Prague at 6:13 A.M. and arrives in Vienna at 12:37 P.M. The round trip between Vienna and Bratislava is $12.82. The train leaves Vienna Southeast Terminal at 7:13 A.M., reaching Bratislava at 9 A.M.; on the return it leaves Bratislava at 6:45 P.M., arriving in Vienna at 8:28. Round trip, Vienna-Brno, is $21.40. Departing Vienna North Terminal at 7:37 A.M., the train reaches Brno at 9:59 A.M. It leaves Brno at 6:30 P.M., reaching Vienna at 8:15.
 
Beach Vacations
Gain Popularity
For the first time in three years, oceans and beaches are forecasted to lead the list of most popular destinations for summer travelers in 1990, according to the United States Travel Data Center. More than 329 million summer vacation trips are predicted this year, a 2 percent increase from last summer. Oceans and beaches will account for 27 percent of this total, while planned visits to cities dropped to 20 percent, from 30 percent in 1989.
The rise in ocean and beach destinations may be due to the trend toward shorter vacations. Day trips and overnight trips have become especially popular and are expected to account for 9 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of summer vacation travel.
Despite the rise in shorter vacations, the dropoff in travel to cities is extreme. From 1987 to 1989, summer travel to cities rose 2 percent. The 10 percent drop is the most drastic since 1982, when the travel industry suffered from the recession. Scott M. Dring of the Travel Data Center in Washington, said that the move away from urban areas to more natural settings has its roots in a renewed environmental awareness.
''It seems to be due to an ecology trend,'' Mr. Dring said. ''Earth Day and all the recent concern for the environment has made a real difference. Travel to national parks has also gone up in the past two or three years. Oceans have always been popular, but we haven't seen anything like the past six or seven months. The picture has really changed.''
The trend away from urban vacations has also resulted in increased demand for travel to other outdoor destinations, such as mountain and lake areas, and amusement parks.
 
St. Croix Resort
Resorts Reopening
St. Croix's largest hotel, the 150-room Carambola Beach Resort and Golf Club, is expected to reopen in September, a year after Hurricane Hugo. Repair work now nearing completion has focused on interiors of rooms, the golf course and clubhouse. A stretch of Carambola's beach that was washed away has been restored with truckloads of sand imported from Barbuda. A spokesman for the hotel said that although the interiors of rooms were saturated with seawater, the units suffered little structural damage. About two-thirds of the 1,800 hotel rooms on St. Croix, the island hit hardest by the hurricane, are scheduled to reopen in time for the winter season starting in December, according to the St. Croix Hotel Association. An official of the association said water and electricity supplies were back to normal.
One property that was heavily damaged, the 43-room Caravelle Hotel in Christiansted, reopened in May. Twenty rooms of the Caribbean View Apartments and the 65-room St. Croix by the Sea are expected to open this month. Among resorts scheduled to reopen in the fall are the Colony Cove, Gentle Winds Condominiums, Schooner Bay and the Sugar Beach Condominiums.
Divi Resorts says that it plans to rebuild and expand the Divi St. Croix on the southeast coast.
 
LONDON GALLERIES IN NEW DIGS
The Courtauld Institute Galleries in London have opened in their new home in the newly restored Somerset House in the Strand, which is a 10-minute walk from Trafalgar Square. The new quarters enable the Courtauld's art collection and the Courtauld Institute, Britain's leading center for the study of the history of art, to be housed together. Only 30 percent of the institute's collection could be shown at one time at the Courtauld's old galleries in Bloomsbury. The institute's study section had to operate in a separate building in Portman Square.
Included are such Impressionistic masterpieces as Manet's ''Bar at the Folies-Bergere,'' Van Gogh's ''Self-Portrait With Bandaged Ear'' and Cezanne's ''Card-Players'' and works by Renoir, Monet, Degas, Pissarro, Sisley, Boudin and Gauguin. Also on display are works by Rubens, Van Dyck, Goya, Botticelli, Tiepolo and Rembrandt. Address: Somerset House, the Strand, London WC2 R1LB; telephone: 837 2526. Open Monday to Saturday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., till 8 P.M. on Tuesday; Sunday, 2 to 6 P.M. Closed on holidays. Admission about $4.25. Access for handicapped visitors through the main entrance into the courtyard, turning right for the West Service Door, then ringing for an attendant. Nearest Underground stations: Temple (District Line) and Covent Garden (Piccadilly Line).

O Solecism Mio

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
At the biannual meeting of the Judson Welliver Society, the association of former White House speechwriters, the Kennedy Administration's Ted Sorensen rose to assail my use of biannual in the invitation: ''This word means 'twice a year,' not 'every two years'; either Mr. Safire has erred and should have said biennial, or I have not been invited to all the meetings.''
Kill biannual; the word causes more confusion than it's worth. If you mean twice a year, or twice a month, use semiannual, or semimonthly, or better yet, twice a year, twice a month - that avoids confusion. If you mean every other year, go with biennial as an adjective, or the universally understood every other year if you want to avoid having people show up on the right date but the wrong year.
Let us not correct ourselves out of fear, but let us never fear to correct ourselves. In that spirit, this farrago of corrections: 
 
Who Jests at 'Scarify'?
In a piece about bogies, I referred to ''Old Scratch,'' the devil, as a ''scarifier of children.''
This almost intimidated Richard Walsh of Bedford, Mass.: ''I feel sure that in referring to the bogeyman as a 'scarifier of children,' you were deliberately trying to entrap know-it-alls, but here I go falling for it.'' He went on bravely to write that the verbs to scare and to scarify were unconnected.
This was no entrapment or subtle mail pull; it is a mistake I must have been making all my life. Using the false analogy of horror to horrify, I assumed that another verb for the noun and verb scare was scarify. Wrong.
''To scarify,'' writes Carl Mezoff of Stamford, Conn., ''means 'to make a series of scratches or cuts in the surface of something,' and not, as I assume you had intended, 'to frighten.' '' (Some dictionaries do list scarify as a 1794 slang synonym for scare, but the standard sense of scarify offered by Mr. Mezoff dates back to the 16th century. Pronounce the slang term SCARE-if-y and the standard word SCAR-if-y.) He adds that the highway department will use a machine to scarify, or rough up, the surface of a road that is being blacktopped. Sheldon Flory of New Lebanon, N.Y., points out another sense of ''to scar ritually,'' as is done among some African and other tribal peoples.
 
Sex in the News
In a tirade leveled at Mikhail S. Gorbachev in my daily occupation, I denounced him for sending Western newsmen out of Lithuania before his economic crackdown.
''I'm one of those female 'newsmen' who was denied permission to stay in Lithuania,'' writes Alison Mitchell of the Newsday Moscow bureau. ''So are Esther B. Fein of The New York Times, Anne Imse of The Associated Press, Penny Fishlock of The Daily Telegraph, Bridget Kendall of the BBC and Pilar Bonat of El Pais.
''Now, I'm not a stickler on getting gender out of language,'' Ms. Mitchell advises. ''I don't like chairpersons and Congresspersons - but it does strike me as unnecessary and even inaccurate to use newsmen in such circumstances when there are perfectly good words around like journalists, reporters or correspondents.''
Right; newsmen may be used to refer to male reporters, but leaves uncovered female reporters; the sexist newshens has been banned, and the breezy newsies belongs in an informal category with media types. Using newsmen in that instance seemed to assume that only males were on the journalistic job in Lithuania, which is obviously untrue.
Ms. Mitchell is one of the reporters who were - not was - denied permission to stay. When the pronoun one is followed by a prepositional phrase (of the reporters), we must decide whether the relative clause (starting with who) refers to the one or to the many.
In this case, the Newsday reporter is not seeking to separate herself from the crowd to assert her singularity; on the contrary, she is expressing solidarity with her fellow female journalists, stressing the collective. Since the clause refers to the many, we use the plural verb were.
I am one of the newsmen who try not to offend journalists who are female.
 
Ad Infinitum
This is not the place to come for legal advice. Ignore all advice other than grammatical in this space.
In handing out this year's Bloopie Awards to advertising copywriters, I decided not to knock the car that Nissan Motors has named ''Infiniti,'' because it was not a misspelling of infinity: ''the deliberate substitution of a letter makes it possible to copyright the name.''
''Your statement bristles with error,'' thunders Prof. Phillip Edward Page of the South Texas College of Law in Houston. ''First, copyright law has nothing to do with the case. The protection available, if any, is the legally recognized value of the trademark. Second, misspelling is a merchant's gimmick to catch the eye . . . but is not in any way required to make the trademark protectable.''
From Grand Rapids, Mich., John E. McGarry points out that ''one cannot 'copyright' a name. Copyright is given to the writing of an author under the Copyright Act of 1976. A name does not qualify as a 'writing' under the Copyright Act.''
O.K., the verb I should have used was trademark. What about my notion that a properly spelled word was unlikely to qualify as a trademark?
''Equally erroneous,'' Mr. McGarry says. ''Ordinary words can function as trademarks so long as they are not merely descriptive of the goods. The classic example of this is the mark 'Camel' for cigarettes. The term infinity does not appear to be descriptive of the Nissan automobile or of a quality of the automobile and thus could have been used as the trademark.''
George P. Kramer of Hunton & Williams in New York informs me crisply (all letters from lawyers number the paragraphs; occasionally, an attorney will begin with a more informal ''First. . .'') that Nissan owns trademark number 1,478,618 for ''Infiniti.'' Other companies have trademarks registered ''Infiniti'' for golf clubs and hair-styling mousse.
''Under ordinary circumstances (and there are occasional legal exceptions),'' writes the careful Mr. Kramer, ''you cannot pre-empt an otherwise descriptive or generic word by simply substituting a letter. . . . Strawberry cannot be monopolized if you misspell it as 'strawberri.' ''
 
Heaven the Thought
''Perish Forbid,'' a port manteau of ''Perish the thought'' and ''Heaven forbid,'' was a nice malapropism of the 1940's. I speculated that it might have originated with the radio show ''Duffy's Tavern'' or with ''The Goldbergs.''
''My mother, Gertrude Berg,'' writes Harriet Berg Schwartz of West Nyack, N.Y., ''did not use a thick accent in her portrayal of Molly Goldberg, but made the audience laugh at and with her by using inverted word order, upward inflection and hilarious mispronunciations. 'Perish forbid' sounds like her, but I am not sure if she originated the expression. Of course, 'button your neck' is forever to her credit.''
The answer lies elsewhere. ''Goodman Ace was no plagiarist,'' writes Allan Davis of Levittown, L.I., and Helen R. Chapman of Key West, Fla., agrees: ''Perish forbid you should have forgotten the Easy Aces -Goodman and Jane. It was Jane who used to say, 'Perish forbid!' '' Ms. Chapman was so surprised at my oversight that ''As Jane also was noted for saying, 'You could have knocked me over with a fender!' ''

WRESTLING WITH THE ANGEL
A Memoir of My Triumph Over Illness.
By Max Lerner.
210 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $18.95.
 
TAKING HEART
By A. C. Greene.
222 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $18.95.
At the age of 78, shortly after leading a seminar in San Diego on - so help me - ''Eros and the American Family,'' Max Lerner received ''the news'' from his physician: ''My boy, you have a problem.'' That telephone call was the beginning of Mr. Lerner's tussle with three mortal diseases. His lively and candid journal of the good fight, ''Wrestling With the Angel,'' ends with better news. ''Ten and eight years after my respective tumors,'' he writes, ''my cancer-scarred lymph glands and prostate are still within me, causing little trouble. Six years after my heart attack, I have my heart, still pumping blood through tolerably clear arteries.'' 
That Mr. Lerner is now a feisty octogenarian is due to pluck, luck and the expensive revolution in modern medicine. But ''Wrestling With the Angel'' is more than a series of dispatches from the front lines of the cancer wars; it is also a touching apologia pro vita sua, an anthem of maturity and a very good read. This lifetime student of American civilization describes how his experience with illness permitted him to resolve the conflict between the strains in his - and this country's - temper: between East Coast reason and West Coast sentiment, between scholarly thought and spontaneous feeling, between the facts of science and the hope of healing. Years ago, he had appreciated that his hero, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, faced a similar task: ''There are varied strains in each of us, which it is the task of growth to reconcile and integrate.'' Mr. Lerner faced his maladies both as a ''child of New York and of its fierce intellectual rationalism'' and as one who had recently ''embraced selective elements of the Californian subculture . . . in the antechamber of what was becoming 'behavioral,' or 'holistic,' medicine.'' Both strains in his temper served him well.
His career, like empire, has coursed westward. Educated at Yale and the Robert Brookings Graduate School of Economics and Government in Washington, he was a ''premature anti-Fascist'' of the late 30's and 40's. In his salad days, he became the editor of the progressive magazine The Nation and New York's left-wing newspaper PM. He was also a liberal columnist for The New York Post and a professor of American studies at Williams College and Brandeis University. His dozen books include works on radical humanism, Thorstein Veblen, John Stuart Mill and Alexis de Tocqueville. More recently he has become a columnist for The Los Angeles Times, a house guest of Hugh Hefner's and a sometime convert to the ''California adventurism of will therapies'' at Esalen workshops. Happily, in ''Wrestling With the Angel,'' he reverts to his earlier habits of rigorous thought. As his tribulations increased, he became ever more confident that his will and rational choices were as important as - but not necessarily more important than - the opinions of the experts: ''I would pay due attention to doctors, tests, and all the paraphernalia of medicine. . . . My doctors knew more than I did. But in a crisis of conflicting judgments I would never forget that the final, critical decisions were mine to take.''
Some of these decisions involved choices between chemotherapy and palliation, others between castration and a new experimental hormone for prostate cancer. His youngest son, Adam, an oncologist at Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, seems to have got the story just right: ''After unpleasant and debilitating therapy, you emerged alive and apparently still full of a fair measure of pepper.''
Max Lerner, a beneficiary of the new molecular medicine, has little patience for those who would ration its costly products: ''Would I, at my unlikely age, agree to a heart transplant as a last desperate measure? . . . If there were no recourse but an artificial heart, I would embrace it and say, 'Pump away, oh Fabulous Artificer, while it is day, for the night comes when no heart can pump.' ''
A. C. Greene embraced his new heart with similar zest. In ''Taking Heart,'' he tells of his experience as the first patient in the new heart transplant program of the St. Paul Medical Center in Dallas. Readers will appreciate the book's low-keyed lack of self-reference and be vastly informed by a splendid job of science writing. This veteran essayist and commentator on the Texas scene not only spins a compelling tale of touch-and-go at the wrong end of the scalpel, but also provides us with a brisk review of transplantation biology, the nuts and bolts of a transplant program, the mechanics of an actual transplant operation (he went back to observe one after his own) and a fine primer of preventive cardiology.
Mr. Greene's prose is crisp and varies with his experiences. In the operating room he ponders: ''Does one actually die at the apogee of anesthetized sleep? Does the body retain too ancient a memory of death to accommodate medically induced stillness and suppression that mimic death? Is death itself imprinted on our genes?'' When it is all over, and the physical scars have healed, Mr. Greene tells us that ''even now I sometimes take a quick inventory of myself . . . [and] find it hard to get over, hard to grasp . . . the broad impact of restoration, the continuingly joyous outcome of it.''
A generation ago, medical students dared not dream that they would be able to cure lymphoma, arrest prostate cancer and transplant the human heart. Nor would that generation have believed it possible that our Government might withhold medical advances from the old or the poor because of cost. The famous, like Mr. Lerner and Mr. Greene, will always be able to tug at the strings of access, but when humbler folk are threatened by medical rationing (as has been proposed in Oregon), we should worry. Justice Holmes's father pleaded not for the mighty or famous:
 
A few can touch the magic string,
And noisy Fame is proud to win them
Alas for those who never sing,
But die with all their music in them.
 Max Lerner also argues their case: ''If the technology is in place, and the conscious and rational will to live is there, who possesses the moral authority to say who shall have its use and who not?'' That sounds like the old PM.
 
FEAR OF THE KNOWN
 Aging is a stage of life, death a finality. The fear of death is the fear of the unknown as well as the terminal. The fear of aging is the fear of the all too well known. Both prod us into activity. Along with the maladies in its wake, aging forms our early warning system of the approach of death. The fear of death spurs us to invent energies and busyness that will mask its terror from us. The fear of aging - limiting the compass of our lives, diminishing the time that still remains for fruitful functioning - spurs us to fall back and reinvent ourselves, to savor more fully the life that remains. This means to reimagine who and where we are, what we want of the rest of our lives, what we can whittle away as inessential, what becomes central.
To cope with a life-threatening illness at any time, and succeed in overcoming it, has to be in itself a life-changing experience. To be close to death ''powerfully concentrates a man,'' as Dr. Johnson put it. When the illness comes late in life, it adds a touch at once of pathos and piquancy. The pathos is that so few years remain for living with the renewed depth you have achieved. The piquancy is that you are spurred even more to rethink life, to reinvent self, to ask the embracing question: What shall I do with the rest of my life? From ''Wrestling With the Angel.''
 
SURGEONS AT CENTER STAGE
 There is a feeling of drama when the overhead surgical spotlights are switched on, illuminating the stage where the operation will take place and leaving the rest of the room in semidarkness, the way the theater takes on its sudden, mystical aura when the house lights go down and the stage lighting takes over the audience's suspended comprehension. The stage is small, no bigger than the human chest. Whether the curtain is going up or coming down depends on which side of it you are on. It goes up for the group of masked individuals, it comes down for the unseen individual upon whom the play is about to be performed. The stage is small, but the drama is the biggest in the world. It is the battle between life and death. The curtains of anesthesia close in, and the final act begins. . . . Masked and faceless worshipers gather around the altar, uniformly clad in the paper suits called scrubs. The surgeons' heads are encased in close-fitting caps of cloth, with wide masks across nose, mouth, and chin. . . . Along with the institutional greens or tans, rather rapidly a different color can and will be added to the scene when the chest is opened and removal of the organs is begun, and some artery may suddenly give a pop and spray color all over the cast. . . . Red. Blood. The most powerful color the human race is heir to. From ''Taking Heart.''

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Changeover in the Housing Agency;
Putting a Dinkins Imprint on a Koch Plan

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
The word that leaps from Felice Michetti's lips as she seeks to articulate the special stamp that the administration of David N. Dinkins will put on city-assisted housing programs is affordability.
''There will be more money to lower the rents in the vacant buildings program,'' said Ms. Michetti, the new Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, ''and more money for the small-homes program to bring the prices down.''
The vacant buildings program is the name under which most of the apartments in vacant city-owned buildings, acquired through tax foreclosure, are being gut-rehabilitated for a mixed-income population by small builders using private and city financing. The small-homes program has generated one- and two-family houses and condominiums for moderate- to middle-income buyers. Lower prices will make the houses affordable to more people with incomes of about $30,000 to $35,000. Currently, most buyers cluster in the $35,000-to-$38,000 income range. 
A mastery of housing language is an asset in conversation with the knowledgeable Commissioner Michetti, who has come up through the ranks to head the largest housing development agency in any American city. At 41 years of age, she is the sometimes brusque past master of city housing programs.
She is a native of the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx who went to work in the Bronx office of the Department of City Planning in 1973 and shifted to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development's neighborhood-preservation office on West Tremont Avenue in 1979. Later, she became deputy director of the Office of Property Management, which runs city-owned tax-foreclosed apartments; head of the Housing Development Corporation, the financial arm of the department, and deputy housing commissioner. She is a graduate of Fordham University and its law school.
Admirers consider her exceptional at both conceiving housing-production programs and making them work. Whether she will also play the broader role of advocate for housing in areas that go beyond the disposition of city-owned land and buildings - issues that include zoning, rent-regulation policy and the processes of land-use review - remains to be seen. In the Dinkins administration, it is not clear that anyone will assume that role.
Meanwhile, Ms. Michetti said that an understanding had been reached with South Bronx Churches, a nonprofit housing organization, to develop 400 to 500 housing units on sites in the vicinity of East 163d Street and Jackson Avenue in the Bronx. Trying to establish in the Bronx a low-income, for-sale housing program similar to the one mounted in Brooklyn as the Nehemiah Plan by East Brooklyn Churches, the organization staged a protest when the Koch administration decided to award a more centrally located urban-renewal tract known as Site 404 to a different developer.
Although no memorandum of understanding has yet been signed, South Bronx Churches is expected to develop one-family units in the town house and back-to-back styles on sites it was offered by the Koch administration. The houses probably will be sold at average prices lower than the builder will get for condominium units on Site 404 land - 4.35 acres in the Melrose section near the commercial district at Third Avenue and East 149th Street. There the Procida Construction Corporation plans to build 275 units in three- and four-story walk-ups, to be sold through the New York Housing Partnership.
On another matter, the Real Estate Board of New York has been asked to scale down by about 50 percent the density of what was to have been a 750-unit development called Tibbetts Garden in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx, and to find a builder prepared to develop the land on a limited-profit basis.
What this will mean is a redesign to a less-risky walk-up condominium development, probably in three- or three-and-a-half-story buildings, for buyers with incomes in the $30,000 to $55,000 range.
The financial risks for government will be reduced, since construction can be slowed in the event of poor sales. The original plan raised the prospect of a $60,000-a-unit city subsidy for middle-income housing - or more in a ''dead'' sales market.
As for the vacant-building program, Ms. Michetti said, the department will ''shoot for an average rent of $525 a month for a two-bedroom apartment'' in the vacant buildings that remain uncommitted to builders. This is lower than the typical $575 rent in these moderate-income projects; the city intends to add subsidy dollars to make the lower rent possible. Moreover, all of these buildings will have to have a lower-income component - 20 percent at a minimum.
The Commissioner said that the Koch administration's plan to look for revenue from market-rate condominium sales to subsidize new lower-income housing in the Seward Park urban renewal area on the Lower East Side and on large sites in Clinton is being re-evaluated. The Seward Park site was awarded to the Lefrak Organization; the Clinton land went to Milstein Properties.
Ms. Michetti, among other officials, have had reservation about relying on market-rate condominium sales to generate profits to apply to lower-income housing. They feel there is too much uncertainty about how many units would be built and when, and what the rents would be. An alternative plan is to be negotiated with community leaders and the developer.
The four-year capital spending plan envisions outlays of $2.1 billion for housing over the next four years, Commissioner Michetti said. That in effect would be a stepped-up expenditure of city money over what was expected when the plan began in 1986. At that time it was proposed that $4.2 billion in city money be spent or committed over 10 years, and half of it already has been. Under the current plan, the $4.2 billion outlay will be reached in eight years instead of 10.
In the early years the expenditures are mainly for existing programs, including those for the homeless, which means housing that is tenanted by the Department of Social Services. In the later years, more new mixed-income housing is to be financed. There is a $31 million commitment, for example, in fiscal 1993 for planning for the proposed Spring Creek Estates project of Starrett Housing Corporation east of Starrett City in the Spring Creek section of Brooklyn near the Queens line. And there is $50 million over two years for the new rental construction, which would be the first city-assisted new-rental program since one in the mid-80's that was financed by excess revenue from the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
In the latter program, 20 percent of the tenants were low-income and 80 percent were at a free-market rate. But builders in some locations could not readily achieve the market-rate rents that made the developments economically viable. Different formulas are likely in the new rental program.
In the end, the Dinkins program basically continues the 10-year plan begun by the Koch administration in 1986, with adjustments. This involves a commitment to complete 47,000 units of gut-rehabilitated housing and 37,000 units of new housing, plus the moderate rehabilitation of occupied apartments through a variety of loan programs.
Its successes have relied on the past failure of privately owned multifamily housing. The abandonment wave of the 70's, set off by a rise in operating costs and mortgage-interest rates after a decade of stagnant rents in the 60's, set the stage for the current costly production programs. The city must hope to avoid a repetition of the cycle.

HEADLINE: Grant Aids Laid-off Workers

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
WORKERS at the troubled UNC Naval Products in Montville have welcomed a United States Labor Department grant to help their laid-off colleagues. But they say they need contracts, not job training.
The Labor Department announced a $1 million grant in Washington on Monday to help hundreds of workers laid off by UNC after the Navy canceled purchases of nuclear submarine reactors. 
The money, approved by Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, will go toward on-the-job training or classroom and vocational training. The grant amounts to $2,650 for each worker, a figure based on the assumption that not all the laid-off workers will participate.
A UNC employee involved in an effort to save the company said that the grant was good news for the roughly 400 workers who have lost their jobs, but that it did not address the deeper problem of keeping UNC from closing its doors.
 
Shift to Single Contractor
''We're very glad to have it,'' said Bernie McKenna, a spokesman for Save Our State, a group of UNC workers lobbying for continued government contracts. ''But on the other hand, what it's doing is helping people who are out of work, and what we want to do is keep people at work.''
In March, the Navy announced that it wanted to rely on a single, Virginia-based contractor for providing nuclear submarine engines. Originally, the Navy preferred buying from two sources to promote competition. But with submarine construction expected to slow, the cost advantages of having two contractors diminished.
UNC announced after the Navy's decision that it would conduct monthly layoffs leading to the closing of its Montville plant on Jan. 1, 1993. A total of 1,135 workers will have lost their jobs by then, according to the Labor Department.
The main focus of effort by UNC executives, employees and members of the Congressional delegation has been working to avoid layoffs by securing business.
The president of UNC, R. Bruce Andrews, said the company is competing for work on an $8 billion supercollider project outside Dallas. Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Bozrah, whose district includes Montville, has been lobbying the Bush Administration to lift a security ban barring UNC from exporting its submarine engines to friendly nations.
 
Possible Research Role
''I always prefer to see the Government taking a pro-active stance, rather than a reactive one,'' Mr. Gejdenson said. ''Now it's time for the Department of Energy to do the right thing and find new work for UNC's incredibly talented work force before it's too late.''
And Representative John Rowland, Republican of Waterbury, ''has been working with an entity in the Federal Government that may possibly have some work for UNC,'' said a spokesman for Mr. Rowland, David Boomer. ''We're making progress with them.'' UNC employees have said the discussions involve a possible role in the Strategic Defense Initiative that involves research for an anti-missile defense system.
UNC opened a job placement center last winter when layoffs began, and a mini-employment center was established at the plant for job interviews with potential new employers. UNC also has a tuition reimbursement program for current employees.
Because UNC's efforts have focused on professionals and technicians, the Labor Department grant program will be used for vocational and classroom instruction as well as on-the-job training. The Labor Department estimated a 72 percent placement rate.

HEADLINE: Technology Helps the Blind On the Job

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AS technology spawns the production of higher-quality, less expensive computer, video and audio products, an increasing number of new tools are being made available to the blind and visually impaired that greatly widen their academic and career opportunities, experts say.
Recent advances in the development of artificial speech synthesizers, the use of optical scanning devices that recognize printed material and the increased presence of personal computers in homes, libraries and schools have all contributed to making otherwise unavailable information accessible to the visually impaired.
The New Jersey Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired, an 80-year-old state agency based in Newark, is actively involved in monitoring the rapidly changing technology and providing assistance and training for the state's visually handicapped residents. Anthony LaGattuta, assistant regional commissioner for rehabilitation operations in the United States Department of Education, said the New Jersey agency attempted to provide ''the broadest number of services for the visually impaired, from the cradle to the grave.''
The commission's efforts are reflective of a growing awareness of the needs of the handicapped, as evidenced by state and Federal legislation guaranteeing ''barrier-free'' access to public buildings and barring discrimination against the handicapped in education and employment. 
''There has been a revolution in the rights of the handicapped,'' said Winnie Stites, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Human Services. ''And with it there has been a change in resolving many misconceptions about handicapped people over the last few years.''
In the past, Ms. Stites said, a physical handicap was perceived as something that could never be overcome. ''Now we have the resources to enable handicapped people to do the absolute maximum of what they are capable of doing,'' she said.
Gerard P. Boyle, acting director of the commission, said an estimated 70,000 state residents, many of them elderly, have serious visual impairments. For those who are working or in school, the opportunities for career and educational advancement are more plentiful than before.
''The computer field has opened up new horizons for blind people,'' he said. ''It's incredible. There are now blind people in this state in almost every occupation.''
In the past, Mr. Boyle said, the blind had to settle for repetitive, manually oriented jobs. Career opportunities for the visually impaired, if they existed at all, he said, were limited.
Although educational material and popular literature have long been available in Braille and on audiocassettes, the technical information and financial reports that are daily reading for management personnel had to be laboriously converted into a form that a visually impaired person could use.
One of the first products to make such material more easily available was the Navigator, a device manufactured by TeleSensory, a corporation in Mountain View, Calif. The unit, which is attached to a personal computer, provides a one-line tactile Braille display of what appears on the computer's screen.
But because the Braille display itself is essentially a mechanical device, the units are relatively expensive. A Navigator can cost as much as $4,000 without the computer. When these are combined with a printer that makes Braille copies, the complete system's price can be more than $10,000.
 
'Impossible to Keep Up'
But the prohibitive cost of owning such equipment, along with the sophistication of the equipment itself, is rapidly changing.
''There is so much technology out on the market right now, it is impossible to keep up with all of it,'' said John Dehmer, president of the New Jersey Council for the Blind, an advocacy group for the visually impaired.
But the existence of such equipment is not meaningful, Mr. Dehmer said, unless potential employers know of its usefulness and availability. The State Commission for the Blind, he said, attempts to fill that void.
The commission's Technical Aid Center is in Newark and supervised by Carolyn Rhodes, a 43-year-old Maplewood resident who has been blind since birth. The center attempts to educate employers about the expanding abilities of the visually impaired.
''We teach everything, from basic typing skills to how to do a spreadsheet in Lotus,'' Ms. Rhodes said.
The center, she said, is used for both skills training and product evaluation of high-tech devices for the blind.
Along with several Braille display units, the center also has optical character recognition devices, speech synthesizers, visual scanners and closed-circuit television units that can enlarge print by as much as 60 times for those with some residual vision.
The speech synthesizer, Ms. Rhodes said, is the most recent and most useful technological advancement for the visually impaired.
 
Converts Words Into Sounds
''It took me half an hour to do this using the voice synthesizer,'' Ms. Rhodes said, referring to a report she had just written for the commission. ''It would have taken me half a day to do the same thing using a volunteer to help me edit.''
The voice synthesizer consists of a program that is loaded into a personal computer, which then converts the letters and words that appear on the monitor into sounds.
The operator uses the computer keyboard or a separate keypad to send commands to the computer, telling it specifically what to convert to speech. Single letters, words, sentences or even entire documents can be reviewed auditorily. This eliminates the time-consuming and expensive process of producing Braille copies of the material for review and permits instantaneous editing and revision.
Speech synthesis has also made it possible for the blind and visually impaired to run complicated software like financial spreadsheet and word processing programs.
At first, Ms. Rhodes said, the artificial voice systems were often slow and inaccurate and had difficulty ''pronouncing'' technical words and homonyms. The newer systems, however, are about 95 percent accurate, and use phonetics and word context for deciding pronunciation, she said.
 
'Just Me and the Machine'
Solomon Haile Selassie Mekonnen, a blind 33-year-old Ethiopian with master's degrees in law and political science from Columbia University, recently visited the Technical Aid Center to evaluate equipment he needs for Christian missionary work he does for international students.
''This will help me edit and publish the mission's newsletter myself,'' he said. ''I can make a million corrections if I want, because it's just me and the machine.''
Without the computer, he said, he would need another person to read what he had written to insure that it was accurate. ''I just wish I had found this earlier,'' he said.
During his school years, he said, he would have to rely on other people to proofread his papers and to read non-Braille text for him. ''It was a nightmare,'' he said. But another new device spawned by the computer revolution has made even reading ''normal'' text possible for the blind.
 
Scanners and Computers
Optical scanners like the Xerox-Kurzweil Personal Reader can read books, magazines and even some newsprint, and then convert that information into speech, Braille or large print. The device is either an independent unit or a computer-based peripheral that is connected to a speech synthesizer, printer or video monitor.
Jay Leventhal, a resource specialist with the National Technology Center of the American Foundation for the Blind in Manhattan, said new optical scanning units had been introduced that worked through the personal computer itself and used the computer's speaker and monitor for output.
''That cuts the price from about $10,000 to $3,000,'' Mr. Leventhal said.
Braille printers are also coming down in price, he said. ''There have been a cluster in the $3,000 to $5,000 range,'' he said, ''but one just came on the market and it's around $1,300.''
But lower prices, he said, are no guarantee that everyone who can use such a machine can afford one.
''Unfortunately,'' he said, ''many visually impaired people are still unemployed.''
Ms. Rhodes agrees. She said that finding ''quality'' jobs for the blind sometimes required more than just training on sophisticated equipment. As a result, she said, the commission will sometimes contribute toward the purchase of necessary equipment if the prospective employer will ''meet the commission halfway.''
 
Seen as a 'Joint Venture'
''If a company hires someone as a word processor, it would at least have to provide that person with a computer,'' she said. So if a prospective employer is willing to provide some of the basic equipment, and if the client has a specific need and no resources of his or her own, the commission will sometimes purchase the necessary equipment, she said. ''We see it as a joint venture,'' Ms. Rhodes said. But the main impediment that the blind face in obtaining satisfactory employment, experts say, is not necessarily training or economics; it is society's perception of the ability of the blind to function in a sighted world.
Changing that perception, said Leslie Ryan, a teacher with the commission for 15 years, can occur only as the visually impaired themselves minimize their limitations and accentuate their abilities, and that, she said, begins in infancy. Ms. Ryan, who this year was named a Teacher of the Year by the commission, has clients as young as 6 months old.
 
Can Be Socially Isolated
Too often, she said, visually impaired children are socially isolated and understimulated, even by well-intentioned parents. But a child's earliest years often determine that child's future self-image.
The sooner small children are encouraged to move about in the world, to take risks and to make use of whatever residual vision they may have, she said, the better they are later able to function when they begin school and attempt to socialize with sighted children.
And once a child is in school, she said, the commission will supply the child's family with whatever equipment and support necessary to insure the child's success.
One device that the commission provides for young children, she said, is a closed-circuit television that enlarges printed material so that a child with some residual vision can learn to read. As the units become smaller and less expensive, they become easier to use and more readily available.
''We deliver the machines, we set them up and we train the child on them,'' Ms. Ryan said. ''We take advantage of every resource that's available to us. We want to give these children every opportunity to be the best that they can possibly be.''

HEADLINE: ART;
Annual Camden Show Offers a Lively Selection of 44 Works

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: CAMDEN

 BODY:
THIS city looks better than it did 10 years ago, but not as prosperous as it appears in William Hoffman's painting of it - one of 44 works that are now on view in the Stedman Gallery on the Rutgers-Camden campus.
The show is titled ''Ninth Annual City of Camden Art Exhibition, and it was juried by David Ahlsted, a painter who teaches at Stockton State College, and by Alison Weld, formerly the curator-director of the Robeson Center Gallery at Rutgers-Newark and now assistant curator at the State Museum in Trenton.
Getting back to Mr. Hoffman's canvas, it is an impressionistic bird's-eye view that centers on Camden's City Hall skyscraper and takes in the surrounding buildings and trees. But it doesn't reach far enough to encompass the blocks of small battered houses that lack even a candy store for consolation. ''It's a hard time with so many unemployed,'' commented a resident who could have been one of them. 
But then the view also seems to omit Rutgers, which is a serene enclave of brick buildings and trees with the sky blue Benjamin Franklin Bridge for a backdrop.
Even so, it was no surprise to find that only one of the show's 40 artists comes from Camden and that more than half of them are from Pennsylvania, mostly Philadelphia. Perhaps as a result of this, the selection, though lively, is less charged than would be its equivalent drawn from the other end of the state.
There are some exceptions, however. One of them is Esther Rose Fisher's ''Toxicity No. 3,'' a large gray monotype where clouds like boulders dribble blackness over a vaguely defined urban landscape.
Another is R. L. Washington's ''Point of View,'' an interior with lurid yellow walls and a floor of bare wood beams. On a sofa sit three black youths, two of them engrossed in the television to their left, one deep in a book. Keeping them company from the floor is a large, fluffy yellow cat with an extremely pink nose. The scene is crudely painted by an untrained hand, but the action, such as it is, is beautifully observed; so are the personalities, the cat's included.
It is a smart jury that can spot R. L. Washington and remain open to the virtuosity of Gilbert Lewis's gouache portrait of a boy, theatrically illuminated by artificial light. Presumably, Mr. Lewis gets help from photographs, but in this case not enough to interfere with his color, which is radiant, especially in the treatment of the subject's eyes.
Other good but pastily colored examples of realism include a still life of paper bags, a milk carton and assorted breads and pastries by Jeffrey Filbert (the one contender from Camden) and Phyllis Laver's study of a man leaning on a desk.
Figuration otherwise runs from the trendy - Karen Smith's giant variation on a cup outlined in black and modeled in various reds - to the stylized and idiosyncratic. In this category are a vivid beach scene, crammed with bathers under a sun that is a flaming disk, by Jack Gerber; Laura Bockno's nighttime view of a huge man's head and one shoulder highlighted in yellow against a lake bordered by a cliff with buildings on it; a study of a child playing with crayons and paper in a doorway by Marlene Baron-Summers, and Lauren Holden's Precisionist composition of buildings lying low beside pylons tethered with wires.
Compared with these works, Elizabeth Heller's ''Nightfall: Manayunk,'' an ink and pastel drawing that suggests a citadel with trees, seems positively abstract.
The best of the abstractions is Rita Simienski-Smith's large untitled watercolor of angular and ribbony shapes on a gray ground blotched with black and gold that harmonizes nicely with the texture of the gallery's aggregate walls. The design and its quiet colors, meanwhile, recall Gladys Nilsson's compositions of weird personages.
Installed in a Plexiglas case, Annette Tannenbaum's assemblage of beads, sequins and camp memorabilia is punkily titled ''I'm Gonna Be Bad/Guns-n-Roses,'' but it seems like a sparse Alfonso Ossorio. Apropos similarities, Jackie Morfesis's large black-and-white drawing of a nestlike shape with an aureole of smudged gray hangs opposite Ken Hohing's black-and-white photograph of an actual bird's nest containing tinted eggs and superimposed on a sky filled with clouds.
A photographer in color, Clarence Guienze, focuses on what appears to be a glass jar containing a champagne-colored candle. Bisecting the mass is a vertical of light that, with the help of some well-maneuvered shadows, turns the pot and its contents into a female torso.
The show's one sculpture is Ted Warchal's modeled relief of a small shelf bearing a few unidentifiable objects and neatly titled ''Shelf Life.''
The show runs through July 21. The gallery, on Third Street off Cooper Street, is open from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Monday through Saturday.

HEADLINE: Emergency Room Remains Open

 BODY:
As I read your article ''Community Hospitals Adapt to Changes'' (May 27), I found it to be quite enjoyable and unfortunately accurate in describing the financial plight of most of New York States' community hospitals. There is a real financial crisis in the hospital industry due to reimbursement patterns of Medicaid, Medicare and third-party payers. 
However, your comments about St. Charles Hospital were erroneous. As the medical director of Emergency Services, I found your statement that our Emergency Room is closed in error. We have a staff of six physicians, and 30 nurses, all Advanced Cardiac Life Support trained, and Advanced Trauma Life Support certified, providing state-of-the-art emergency care for some 19,000 patients annually. I am hoping that some of our summer vacation residents will not be misled by your statement. Our Emergency Room is indeed Alive and Well, operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

HEADLINE: Business Says Enough Is Enough

 BODY:
Re: ''The Builders Are Trying to Undercut Us'' (May 27).
I wonder who the ''Us'' are that Richard Amper refers to. Is it the unemployed electrician, or the former engineer turned salesman? Or is it the young computer technician who is leaving my employ to move to North Carolina? Or is it my middle-aged neighbor who is moving to Florida? 
The topic of idle conversation I hear repeated more often these days is focused on moving away. Somehow in my conversations with all these people the issue of pine barrens or drinking water didn't surface. In fact, their main concern was economic. Are these people part of Mr. Amper's ''Us''?
The fine points that Mike LoGrande made were that we are tampering with Long Island's economy. We are in a severe economic crisis - and the sooner we face up to it the better. No one is arguing about turning back the clock on environmental concerns; what is being voiced by the business community is that enough is enough.
Mr. Amper's lawsuit isn't unique - it is a continuation of a decade of private and public policy on Long Island that has led us to the brink of economic disaster.
Exclusionary zoning and anti-development attitudes and policies such as Mr. Amper's have disenfranchised our youngsters, and many others, by making it impossible for them to stay here. By cutting off the entry level buyer we have thrown the entire marketplace into a tailspin - and the loss of these young people has put a severe crimp on the resources that enable Long Island business to grow.
History tells us to beware of those who create a scapegoat to further their message. Mr. Amper tells Long Island that ''The Builders Are Trying to Undercut Us.'' Yes Mr. Amper, the building industry is hurting, but you know what all of us on Long Island are hurting. What about ''you'' and your groups? Aren't ''you'' part of ''US?''

HEADLINE: State Is Disappointed By Gambling Revenues

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
GAMBLING revenues for the 1990 fiscal year, which ended last week, were disappointing, state officials said. But they expressed hope that several changes in the state lottery would increase the state's take this year.
''What I'm trying to do is get the lottery back to its basics,'' said Gregory P. Ziemak, lottery unit chief for the State Division of Special Revenues. ''The message I'm trying to get across is it's fun to play and fun to win.''
But Mr. Ziemak acknowledged that the state might be nearing the saturation point in lottery sales, and the operators of private parimutuel centers - including those that offer off-track betting, greyhound races and jai alai - are facing an even tougher time this year, with increased competition from the lottery, more people traveling to Atlantic City's casinos and the possibility of two casinos opening on Indian reservations in Connecticut. 
Operators of the parimutuels have asked the legislature for relief, in the form of video slot machines, which they claim would boost both their revenues and the amount that they turn over to the state.
''The parimutuels need the video slots,'' said Patrick J. Sullivan, a lobbyist for the state's three jai alai frontons. ''If you're going to a jai alai fronton to gamble anyway, why shouldn't the state help out the parimutuels and itself by giving them that opportunity?''
 
Decline in Revenues
Legalized gambling came to Connecticut in the form of the lottery in 1972. Today, in addition to 2,550 computer terminals that sell daily and lotto numbers, there are 14 storefront off-track betting centers, 3 jai alai frontons, a greyhound racetrack, and a theater in New Haven where bets can be placed on televised horse races. Another theater for simulcast races is under construction in Windsor Locks.
But gaming revenues transferred to the state general fund declined to $260 million in the 1989 fiscal year from $265 million in 1988. Though the books have not been closed on 1990, another drop is likely because of the problems of the parimutuels. State officials said 50 percent of the gaming revenue comes from the lottery, 20 percent from off-track betting and the rest from the other parimutuel operations.
Jai alai was hit by a strike in April 1988 that is still not over, though 70 percent of the players have returned to work. But the picket lines have affected attendance, said Buddy Berenson, owner of the Hartford fronton.
Mr. Berenson said that business at his fronton had been relatively flat compared with 1989. At the Plainfield dog track, business was reported down by 14 to 18 percent, and there there was no strike.
''There are a lot of other factors at work besides the strike,'' Mr. Berenson said.
More troubling are the weak economy and an Indian bingo hall that opened in Ledyard and attracted many high-stakes players, he said.
''And the major problem is the lottery keeps getting bigger and bigger, and there are only so many dollars in the gambling pocket,'' Mr. Berenson said.
 
Buses to Casinos
Mr. Sullivan said Connecticut gaming establishments also estimated that $400 million to $500 million a year is wagered by state residents in Atlantic City casinos.
''There are 300-plus busloads a day going down there from Connecticut in the summer,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
Mr. Berenson said the parimutuels are particularly disturbed by the prospect of two casinos opening in Connecticut. The Mashantucket Pequot Indians have applied to open a casino in Ledyard next to their bingo hall, and a tribe in Colchester has hired a Meriden contractor to build and operate a casino there.
Those casinos would pay nothing to the state, Mr. Berenson said, while private parimutuels hand over tens of millions of dollars a year.
''Anyplace casinos have opened, parimutuels cannot survive,'' Mr. Berenson said. But he said that 80 percent of the people who go to casinos play slot machines. If frontons, dog tracks and off-track betting centers were allowed to operate slot machines, he said, they would be able to recapture much of the casino and bingo business.
''I think they're the only way to save the parimutuel industry in Connecticut,'' Mr. Berenson said. ''If we were given the video machines, we could at least defend ourselves. Otherwise, the state is going to lose an awful lot of revenue.''
Mr. Berenson said legislators sympathetic to the problem introduced a bill that would have allowed the video slots this year, but it was blocked by Gov. William A. O'Neill. Next year, Mr. O'Neill will be gone, the state will be facing an estimated budget shortfall of $400 million to $1 billion, and the legislators have promised to reintroduce the bill.
 
Reversing Drop in Lottery
Mr. Berenson said he expects no relief from the lottery, which is capturing the majority of money spent on gambling in Connecticut now.
''That's the state's prime source of revenue from gambling, and I would not expect them to cut back,'' Mr. Berenson said. ''I would like them to, but I don't expect it.''
The special revenue unit has taken a number of steps to reverse a decline in lottery sales, to $495 million in the 1989 fiscal year from $514 million in 1988.
The amount turned over to the treasury from lottery sales dropped to $219 million from $225 million over the same period.
In February, the state began offering two instant lottery games, up from one, and two weeks ago introduced a third. Mr. Ziemak said sales in instant tickets had increased by 30 percent over last year.
Massachusetts now sells more instant tickets than lotto tickets, Mr. Ziemak said, ''and while we're not in that league at the moment, there's a lot of room for growth in that game, and we intend to see some increases.''
The number of outlets for daily and lotto numbers has also risen, to 2,550 today from 1,950 three years ago. The change to a field of 44 numbers from a field of 40 for the lotto game decreased the chance of winning but increased the size of the jackpots. Four of the top 10 jackpots have come since the change last October.
''The key to higher lotto sales is higher jackpots,'' Mr. Ziemak said. At the same time the payout was increased to about 53 percent of the ''handle'' from 50 percent.
 
More but Less
A spokesman for special revenues, Edward Harrigan, said the changes had apparently stopped the decline in lottery sales. Estimates are that the games turned over a record $228 million to the treasury for the 1990 fiscal year.
''We're talking about money that was made, and on that basis it was the best year we've ever had,'' Mr. Harrigan said.
The revenues unit actually estimated earlier in the year that it would turn over almost $234 million to the treasury.
''Six million dollars is a lot of money,'' Mr. Harrigan said. ''But when you're up that high, in the hundreds of millions of dollars, that's pretty close.''
But the state's budget depended on even more, said State Representative William J. Cibes Jr., Democrat of New London, chairman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
Mr. Cibes said the budget for 1990 anticipated changes in the lottery games would increase the state's gaming take from the $270 million predicted by the Office of Fiscal Analysis to as much as $290 million.
A bill giving the state and local police more money for drug education and enforcement was passed on those predictions, Mr. Cibes said.
''Fortunately, we did not tie the drug bill to special revenues, as had been proposed,'' Mr. Cibes said. ''In the end, we took the money out of the general fund.''
Mr. Ziemak also said there are questions about how long the state can sustain increases in its gaming take.
''When you're a mature lottery state, such as we are, there is a point of diminishing returns,'' Mr. Ziemak said. ''I think we are approaching the time when we have to consider whether we need more outlets for the lottery, and how many.''
Studies to determine whether the state has saturated the market with lottery sales outlets are under way, he said, but it is difficult to determine saturation because the number of stores in the state, the population, and the number of outlets are constantly changing.
''We're definitely not at a point where we're losing money on any of our terminals,'' Mr. Ziemak said. ''But we have to use common sense about expansion.''

HEADLINE: Americans' Support for Israel: Solid, but Not the Rock It Was

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAGINAW, Mich.

 BODY:
Like many Americans, Donald Power long counted himself an admirer of Israel. A Federal labor mediator who lives here in Saginaw, he marveled at the courage and spirit of the small nation, a fledgling democracy so imperiled yet so determined to survive.
But in recent years, Mr. Power says, his regard for Israel has waned. He has come, increasingly, to see the Middle Eastern nation as arrogant and even oppressive in the way it has handled the protests by Palestinians on the West Bank and how it has dealt with its Arab neighbors.
''I don't think they deserve all the support and the aid we give them,'' Mr. Power said. ''Maybe it's time to say, 'We're tired, we're poor, we have our own people without homes.' '' 
 
An Erosion Is Detected
Mr. Power's concerns are not unusual; they are reflected in a New York Times/CBS News Poll taken last month and in discussions with Americans in many cities in recent weeks. And these soundings all show some erosion in Americans' regard for Israel, a keystone of the special relationship that country has enjoyed with Washington since its founding in 1948. There is still an enduring core of support for Israel, especially when considered in relation to its Arab neighbors, but Americans no longer side strongly with Israel against the Palestinians within its borders.
The majority of Americans who say they favor sustained financial and military aid to Israel has been reduced, and a growing minority now advocates more sympathy for the concerns of Palestinians inside Israel.
Supporters of Israel in Congress and among Jewish organizations acknowledge that Israel's backing within the United States is not as deep as it once was, reflecting a tangle of factors, like Israel's role in putting down protests on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, and the perception that Israel is no longer so strategically important, given the fading of the Soviet threat.
Foreign aid decisions by Congress do not always follow every twist in popular opinion, and influential pro-Israel lobbying groups have helped to shore up official support for Israel despite the changes in public mood. The House of Representatives, for example, voted overwhelmingly last month to keep aid to Israel at current levels, estimated to be nearly $4 billion annually.
David A. Harris, the director of the Office of Government and International Affairs for the American Jewish Committee in Washington, said some of the slippage was, perhaps, predictable. ''We created a mythical image for Israel that neither Israel, despite all of its remarkable achievements, nor any other nation could ever live up to,'' he said.
Some Jewish groups also argue that erosion in support is only temporary, mirroring, among other things, what they describe as unfair reporting that depicts Israel as the villain on the West Bank. ''There is a cause to be watchful,'' said Stanley B. Horowitz, president and chief professional officer of the United Jewish Appeal. ''But the values which we share with Israel are so strong, I am not deeply worried. Support for Israel will shoot up again.''
 
Why Some Still Back Israel to the Hilt
According to the results of the Times/CBS News Poll, conducted by telephone June 5 to 8 among 1,084 people, 61 percent advocated sustaining or increasing levels of aid to Israel. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. In a Washington Post/ ABC News Poll in 1989, 72 percent favored keeping aid at or above the same level.
This continuing, though diminished, majority support was reflected in the view of Elmer G. Daniels, a Jewish businessman interviewed in suburban Baltimore. ''I would do virtually anything to assist Israel,'' Mr. Daniels said. ''It is the only democracy in the region, and the only country that has been, without equivocation, an ally of the U.S., representing our interests there.''
But 47 percent of those questioned in the Times/CBS News Poll, say they now support giving the Palestinians a homeland in the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, a proposal that the Israeli Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir opposes. In a 1988 Los Angeles Times poll, 40 percent favored a Palestinian homeland.
The slippage in United States opinion is even more dramatic when it comes to internal or domestic turmoil in Israel. In a 1988 Times/CBS News Poll, when asked whether the United States should be more sympathetic to the concerns of Palestinians in Israel, the American public said no by a 2-to-1 ratio, but in last month's poll American public opinion was split.
When it comes to Israel's external security, however, Americans continue to favor Israel over its Arab neighbors by a wide margin: 40 percent in the latest poll say they are more in sympathy with Israel, while 19 percent say they are more in sympathy with the Arab nations. But even that is a reduced advantage compared with past surveys. The Roper Organization, asking the same question, showed as high as a 5-to-1 advantage for Israel in the 1970's.
Despite the growing willingness to show sympathy toward the Palestinians, however, many of those interviewed said they still harbored sharp suspicions, particularly about Yasir Arafat and some of the Arab leaders.
Gene Mossner, a lawyer in Saginaw, said he regarded the Israeli Government as stubborn and intractable, but he did not trust the Palestinian leadership either. ''My sympathy is toward the people, but I am not sure about Arafat or many of the others,'' he said. ''There are no moderates on either side.''
 
Rumbles of Change In Politicians' Ears
These shifts in public opinion have not gone unnoticed in Congress. Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, the second-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that, while Americans still support a close relationship with Israel, ''there is a more of a doubt, in some areas, a resentment, of our high levels of assistance of Israel.''
Israel is the most obvious target of those broadly opposed to foreign aid, he said, because it receives more help than any other country.
''I don't think there is a seismic change,'' Mr. Hamilton said. ''But none the less, there are clearly changes taking place both within the American Jewish commuity and the public in general.''
In April, the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, provoked a sharp debate when he said his colleagues should be willing to consider cuts in American aid to Israel.
Mr. Dole said at the time that some of his fellow senators are privately as critical of Israeli policy as he is. ''I know people, and I know they won't say it out loud,'' he said. ''But they'll grab you in the cloakroom and tell you: 'You're right. I can't say it because I'm running,' or 'When I've been here as long as you have, I'll be able to say it.' ''
In part, the volatility in American public opinion toward Israel reflects the more turbulent relations between the Israeli Government and the Bush Administration, which has taken a more adversarial role in trying to fashion a Middle East settlement.
In Saginaw, Dr. Senen L. R. Asuan, a physician from the Philippines, said he shared the frustration of the Bush Administration. ''Israel has behaved like a spoiled child,'' he said. ''It could ask anything under the sun and Uncle Sam would give it the money.''
Thomas Murphy, a production worker from Garfield, N.J., said he once was a strong backer of Israel. ''But they aren't the little boy on the block anymore who need our help,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''They have the right to exist, but not to expand their borders. Just as the Arabs once threatened to push them into the sea, now they are trying to push the Arabs off their land.''
Charles Victor McTeer, a civil rights lawyer from Greenville, Miss., says the United States ought not to give so much support to a Government that refuses to negotiate with its adversary. ''It's easy for me, as a black American, to make a leap between Israel and the Palestinians on the West Bank, and South Africa and its black majority,'' Mr. McTeer said. ''At least the South Africans are talking.''
 
Shifts Around Globe Alter Views in U.S.
Behind the ambivalent mood is a flood of contradictory images that come out of Israel itself these days: Israeli soldiers firing on young Palestinian protesters on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip; armed guerillas from an extremist Palestinian faction mounting an unsuccessful speedboat assault on crowded holiday beaches; the sharp and sometimes angry political divisions within Israel itself over what should be done with the occupied territories.
But more and more, America's changing opinions about Israel are also being shaped by events far beyond Middle East. For some, the end of the cold war and the fading of the Soviet threat has raised doubts about the need to subsidize Israel, and other foreign clients, to the degree America has in the past.
There are those who argue that money ought to be spent inside the United States. ''You are asking a country that is broke right today, billions of dollars broke, to bail out these foreign governments,'' said Chet Latty, a bricklayer in Saginaw. ''How can we think of channeling money into Africa and East Germany and Israel?''
Toni Christian, a postal worker in Towson, Md., had a similar response: ''I definitely think we should give Israel less money because of economic problems in the United States.''
Some pro-Israel groups say such views reflect a kind of nascent isolationism among Americans. ''There is a growing preoccupation with domestic issues at the expense of overseas concerns, driven largely by the perception of a waning external threat to U.S. security from the Soviet Union,'' said Mr. Harris of the American Jewish Committee.
He described American public opinion as being too impatient with the complicated details and nuances of Middle East politics. ''We often find ourselves having to confront simple and ultimately false analogies that attempt to compare, for example, South Africa with the Middle East, or Nelson Mandela with Yasir Arafat,'' Mr. Harris said.
Mr. Harris said pro-Israel groups need to stress that American strategic interests remain at risk in much of the third world. ''In a perverse way, Saddam Hussein in Iraq has reminded all of us of the kinds of serious threats that still endure in the Middle East,'' he said.
 
Optimism Is Linked To Appeal's Success
Mr. Horowitz of the United Jewish Appeal said that, despite disagreements over Israeli policies among Jews and non-Jews, there is still strong support for Israel demonstrated by the willingness of Jewish donors and others to contribute money on Israel's behalf.
The most telling measure of this, he said, is the United Jewish Appeal's current giving campaing, which he said will raise more than $1 billion, a record, that will go to help resettle Soviet Jews in Israel.
As polls taken by the American Jewish Committee, among others, have shown, there is tension among Jews about Israeli policy. Glenn Nudell, a student at Towson State University near Baltimore, said he favored reducing aid to Israel. He said he questions the mentality ''that the Palestinians are evil and the Jews are good.''
''I'm Jewish, and I don't think the Palestinians are evil,'' Mr. Nudell said. ''I think Shamir and the rightist Government have got it all wrong.''
Among some Jews who were interviewed, the notion that public support for Israel had declined raised what they described as the troubling specter of anti-Semitism. ''I think there are people who, in their hearts, do not want the Jewish state to survive,'' said Seymour Attman, the owner of Attman's Delicatessen in Pikesville, Md. ''I think it has something to do with anti-Semitism.''
But Darren M. Margolis, another student at Towson State, said he thought Americans simply expected too much from Israel. ''It is not fair,'' he said, ''that we are trying to hold up Israel to a standard which applies to no other country.''
 
How the Poll Was Taken
The New York Times/CBS News Poll was based on telephone interviews conducted from June 5 to June 8 with 1,084 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were choses so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in eighter direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The percentages reportes are the particular results most likely to match what would be obtained by seeking out all adult Americans. Other possible percentages are progressively less likely the more they differ from the reported results. The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduct other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: U.S. PLANS TO SEND PEOPLE, NOT CASH, TO ASSIST SOVIETS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 8

 BODY:
President Bush plans to tell the United States' six main industrial allies this week that he is prepared to send teams of experts to the Soviet Union to help it rebuild rail and communications networks, grain storage sites, food distribution systems and other essential services, senior White House officials said today.
Disclosing this on the eve of the three-day economic summit meeting here of the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries, the White House officials emphasized that Mr. Bush continued to oppose a move for large financial aid to the Soviet Union, as proposed by West Germany and France.
Mr. Bush's view is that the allies should agree in principle to help President Mikhail S. Gorbachev bring about economic changes in the Soviet Union, but that each should act individually.
 
'Different Political Imperatives'
''Each country has different political imperatives,'' one official said. ''The President is happy to have each one help the Soviet Union in complementary ways.'' 
Whatever their differences, a top American official said today, the leaders were determined to avoid a shouting match over Soviet assistance. The leaders do not want to increase pressure on Mr. Gorbachev because the news from the Communist Party Congress in Moscow last week convinced them that the Soviet leader was even weaker politically than they had thought.
Consequently, aid to the Soviet Union is likely to take a back seat to other matters when this first post-cold war economic summit meeting opens here on Monday, officials from the United States, Japan, Britain, West Germany, Italy, France and Canada said.
 
Contrast With London Meeting
President Bush will find himself at odds with the leaders of the industrial allies on central points involving international trade and protection of the environment, and this could set off some fireworks. As a result, the tone may be in sharp contrast with the NATO meeting in London last week, where the allied leaders basically adopted the course Mr. Bush charted for military policy and East-West relations.
Here, the President seems likely to fail in what his aides describe as his primary mission - to persuade the other countries to abolish or at least limit their farm subsidies.
Mr. Bush maintains that worldwide economic growth depends on the successful completion of the current round of trade talks and that those talks are doomed unless agriculture policies in the industrial countries are changed.
And Mr. Bush is, as a Canadian diplomat here said, ''all alone'' in his reluctance to adopt an international strategy for dealing with global warming.
On aid to the Soviet Union, Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, said Mr. Bush did plan to discuss with the other leaders the letter he received from Mr. Gorbachev last week requesting economic assistance from the allies. The letter was seen by top diplomats as underscoring Mr. Gorbachev's political difficulties.
Mr. Fitzwater said the letter repeated topics raised in discussions Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev had in Washington this spring and did not ''raise any new issues or requests.''
The leaders understand that they have different domestic political needs when it comes to dealing with the Soviet Union, the officials said.
For his part, Mr. Bush wants to avoid the fire from the right wing of the Republican Party that he would surely receive if he asked for money for the Soviet Union when that country was continuing to aid Cuba. On the other hand, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who has pledged more than $3 billion to the Soviet Union, is eager for Soviet acquiescence in a unified Germany's membership in NATO.
 
Special Paris-Moscow Link
And President Francois Mitterrand of France wants to build a special relationship between Paris and Moscow.
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada opposes direct financial assistance to the Soviet Union, but he broke slightly with the United States today by saying that Canada might support some forms of credit for Moscow.
Neither the agriculture nor the environment issue is likely to be settled here this week. ''Detailed and complicated negotiations cannot take place at summits,'' said Henry R. Nau, a professor at George Washington University, who was Ronald Reagan's personal representative at several summit meetings in the early 1980's.
But the three days of talks will focus such attention on the disagreements that Mr. Bush, the host of the meeting, will be hard pressed to maintain the harmony of London.
The leaders of the Group of Seven nations began arriving here over the weekend.
 
Sessions With Each Leader
In addition to group meetings and dinners, President Bush plans to hold one-on-one sessions with each of the leaders. He met Saturday with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan and today with Mr. Mulroney.
The group has been meeting once a year since 1975, when the main topic was the explosion of worldwide oil prices. As world economic problems have changed over the years, so have the topics of the meetings.
Administration officials say President Bush wants international trade to be the main emphasis of the Houston meeting. ''From the President's point of view, there is nothing more important than the Uruguay Round,'' said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, speaking of the current trade liberalization talks that began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986 and are scheduled to wind up in December.
If the industrial countries do not lift their farm subsidies, the Administration fears, many developing countries will abandon the trade talks. Agricultural products are their main contribution to the world's markets. The result, American officials say, could be a breakdown of the free trade system. The allies, according to this view, might then divide into protectionist blocs, and the consequence would be to stifle world economic growth.
The European Community sets high tariffs on meat, fruits, vegetables and feed grains, subsidizes exports to make them more competitive overseas and gives generous support payments to farmers. Japan prohibits the importation of rice and keeps its domestic rice prices at many times the world market price.
 
Potent Political Force
Farmers in those countries are a potent political force. There are 10 million farmers in the European Community countries compared with two million in the United States, although the entire population in Europe is only slightly larger.
The United States and Canada, where farming is the most efficient in the world, are prepared to lift their trade restrictions, officials say, if the other countries go along. But a senior official of the European Community said he did not expect any concessions on this point.
 
Japanese Loans to China
TOKYO, Monday, July 9 (Reuters) - Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said today that Japan would unfreeze loans to China some time after this week's summit of industrialized democracies in Houston.
Kyodo News Agency quoted Mr. Sakamoto as telling a news conference here, ''I think loans to China will be resumed on Japan's own decision, in good time, after the Houston summit.''

HEADLINE: 2/ Loaf Is Family Heartbreak in Egypt

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, July 7

 BODY:
In a tangled part of town called Boulaq, all narrow streets and gimcrack homes and children beyond counting, a man called Hamid told a story the other day that said much about the problems confronting President Hosni Mubarak in the Arab world's most populous nation.
A year ago, Hamid said, there were two kinds of bread on the market, one costing the equivalent of 0.8 United States cents a loaf, the other - a newly introduced and supposedly higher-quality product - costing the equivalent of 2 cents. The authorities, who set the bread prices, slowly withdrew the cheaper variety.
For the Government, the change was just one step in trying to cope with the troubles facing a people growing in numbers faster than the land or the economy can sustain - poverty, debt, inflation and a persistent challenge from Islamic fundamentalists.
For Hamid, the extra 1.2 cents a loaf had an impact far beyond what one might think. Each family member usually gets one of the flat, dish-like loaves with each meal, so the bread expense for a family of six more than doubled, to the equivalent of $10 a month. This is a quarter of Hamid's income. 
Add the other basics - sugar for the tea, coffee, cooking oil, beans and vegetables - and together they might cost the rest of one family member's salary. Only on special days, Hamid said, would there be delights like fish or meat at a dollar or two a pound.
 
Deepening Economic Crisis
''If you are earning in a month only the same as an American spends on one meal, then you realize what our problems are and why small amounts matter,'' said Hamid.
His story reflected a much wider malaise. Since President Mubarak came to power in October 1981, when Islamic fundamentalists assassinated President Anwar el-Sadat, Egypt has confronted a deepening economic crisis that has brought soaring prices and unpredictable shortages to a fast-growing population that now exceeds 55 million.
The population grows by a million every eight months, according to estimates - an expansion that adds to the troubles whose roots spread through Egypt's recent history.
In the 1950's and 1960's, President Gamal Abdel Nasser, the charismatic champion of Arab nationalism, nationalized many enterprises and implanted a heavily bureaucratized, centralized economy whose clumsy paternalism still deadens individual initiative.
 
Dependence on U.S. Aid
Mr. Sadat opened up the economy, diverting money into individual pockets, but did little to fundamentally reorganize the economic system. Since then, falling prices for petroleum have meant less direct revenue from Egypt's relatively small oil industry, and also less demand in major oil-producing Arab countries for Egyptian teachers, engineers and other workers.
The remittances from people working abroad, along with Suez Canal transit fees, tourism and the oil exports provide almost all of Egypt's hard currency.
Then came a new problem related to Cairo's dependence on $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion a year in American aid. Of the total, $1.3 billion is set aside for military assistance and the rest is economic aid.
The package was intended to cement Egypt's peace with Israel and reward Cairo. But as the Egyptian armed forces switched from Soviet to American weapons, Cairo ran up debts in excess of $4.5 billion. Countries that do not pay the interest on military loans forfeit all United States assistance.
This year, about $600 million in interest on the military debt comes due. So, to meet the obligation and to qualify for further United States aid, the cash-strapped authorities must divert funds from other debt payments.
 
Strain of Loan Payments
With equal desperation, the Government is trying to stretch its income of $6 billion to finance imports that cost $10 billion and include more than half the country's food.
Egypt's overall foreign debt is more than $50 billion, and the crisis means that Cairo is reneging on commitments to other countries as it seeks to meet its military obligation to the United States.
''Aid from other donors is being largely suspended due to the failure by Egypt to repay loans due,'' the Western economist said. That is where the spiral tightens further.
Like many other third-world countries, Egypt has no option but to look to the International Monetary Fund, which demands market-oriented economic changes in return for its imprimatur on new credits. But the ambiguous offer of free-market salvation, in turn, implies further living cost increases and risks of unrest.
Mr. Mubarak, seeking to cast himself as the people's champion, has called the I.M.F. a ''quack doctor'' and ''the Fund of Misery.'' But in his annual May Day speech, he said, ''There is no way out and we will have to endure.''
He exhorted the Egyptians to be more productive.
The appeal inspired a newspaper cartoonist to depict an animated idle factory telling a couple with too many children that Egyptians had the wrong idea of what ''productivity'' meant.
The I.M.F.'s terms for an economic package mean higher prices because they gnaw away the state subsidies on bread and other necessities that have formed a kind of social-welfare system since President Nasser's time.
 
Fear of Food Riots
In the quest for book-balancing changes acceptable to the I.M.F., the authorities have already cut some subsidies on sugar, kerosene, bottled gas, gasoline, cigarettes and rice - and, by stealth, bread. The cost of living has increased between a quarter and a third over the last year, according to Western figures, while wages have not.
''Always at the back of the Government's mind,'' an Egyptian economist said, explaining the authorities' reluctance to meet the I.M.F. terms, ''are the food price riots of 1977,'' when cuts in subsidies provoked major disorder.
In a recent interview in The New Yorker, Mr. Mubarak spoke of his plight. ''I could make big headlines by removing the subsidies on bread, and a loaf of bread would double in price,'' he said. ''You know what would happen? It would make hell in the country. This is the nature of Egypt.''
The comment acknowledged the political challenge from Islamic movements, whose faith is the faith of the bulk of the population.
''The Muslim Brotherhood is an Islamic solution for all the people of the country, a political solution,'' said Seif el-Islam Hassan el-Banna, a prominent Muslim Brotherhood activist and son of the organization's founder. ''What we say is: 'There is an alternative to what's happening now. Islam is the solution.' ''
Mr. Mubarak's words also suggested the special status of bread in Egypt, and the central role it plays as much in the Government's thinking as on the tables of people like Hamid. Wheat From the U.S. The flat, hollow loaves of bread are the very core of most Egyptians' diet. The seven million tons of wheat consumed by the country each year puts it among the world's biggest per capita consumers of wheat. But Egypt grows only a fraction of the wheat it consumes. More than half of it comes from the United States, and between a third and a quarter of that is financed by concessionary aid programs.
It is symptomatic of the skewed economy that wheat prices for the consumer are kept low but corn prices are not. So people find it cheaper to feed their chickens with wheat or bread than with corn.
The Government has been negotiating with the I.M.F. for almost three years without clear results, reflecting its concerns about the repercussions of removing the subsidies that shelter Hamid and Abdel Aziz and millions of others from higher prices.
 
Life Is Getting Harder
''The last year has been particularly tough for the man in the street,'' said Galal Amin, an economist at the American University in Cairo. ''The rate of inflation is really unprecedented and they are feeling it more than ever.''
Meanwhile, he warned, there is continuous growth in ''the conspicuous wealth of a small number of people.''
''All the Egyptians I know work in two places and if the day was longer than 24 hours, they would look for a third job,'' said Amer Abdel Hamid, a 32-year-old college graduate who earns about $50 a month from his job in state-run radio, and up to $350 as an after-hours freelance writer. He is not the only one to improvise.
''A year ago you paid a little baksheesh to avoid a parking ticket,'' a professor said, using the Egyptian term that denotes something less than a bribe and something more than a tip. ''Now you pay a little baksheesh to park legally.''

HEADLINE: Greece and U.S. Sign 8-Year Pact Exchanging Arms Aid for Extended Use of Bases

BYLINE: By PAUL ANASTASI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATHENS, July 8

 BODY:
Greece's new Conservative Government and the United States signed an eight-year agreement here today providing Greece with more than $1 billion worth of arms in return for the continued operation of American military bases in this country.
Greece, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, will also get $350 million in military credits in the first year of the accord, starting October 1990.
The Greek Foreign Minister, Antonis Samaras, who signed the agreement in the presence of the visiting American Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, said the accord put an end to troubled relations between the two countries and inaugurated a ''new era of national reason in our relations with the United States.''
But the Socialist Party of former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and the Communists charged that the accord made Greece subservient to United States global interests. 
 
Greece's Rights 'Safeguarded'
The accord supplants a five-year bases agreement signed in 1983 by Mr. Papandreou's Socialist Government, which expired in December 1988. Mr. Samaras said the Greek Government had ''unshakable faith in the fact that our sovereign rights have been safeguarded, our national interests improved and the economic benefits multiplied.''
The agreement was signed only three months after the Conservatives were voted into office, succeeding successive weak coalition governments that emerged from inconclusive elections last year after the scandal-racked Papandreou Government lost power. The speed with which the Government of Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis struck the deal contrasted with the 17 rounds of inconclusive talks held previously between Washington and Mr. Papandreou's Government. Mr. Papandreou often used threats to close the bases to fan nationalist fervor and stir popular support.
The accord is subject to approval by the 300-member Greek Parliament, where the Conservatives hold a bare majority of 151 seats.
Mr. Samaras said the accord represented the fulfillment of the new administration's three-tiered foreign policy program. He described the three goals as improving relations with the European Community, beginning procedures toward the settlement of the dispute with Turkey over Cyprus and opening a ''new era of national reason'' with Washington.
Mr. Cheney said, ''This document provides a firm foundation for continuing our bilateral defense relationship on mutually acceptable and beneficial terms and will contribute to the strength of NATO.''
 
U.S. Keeping 2 Crete Bases
Under the accord, the United States is to keep two large bases on the southern Mediterranean island of Crete, which is strategically close to Libya and the Middle East in general. They are the naval and air base at Souda Bay, which is large enough to accommodate the entire Mediterranean Sixth Fleet, and the communications base at Gournes, Herakleion. Washington will also maintain a series of other communications relay installations in four parts of Greece, and the right to conduct certain back-up military activities elsewhere in the country, subject to approval by the Greek Government.
Two other bases in the Athens area, the Hellenikon air base and the communications bases at Nea Makri, are to be shut down this year as part of Washington's earlier decision to reduce its military presence in Europe due to developments in Eastern Europe. A number of other, smaller military installations will also close down. But the aircraft and installations for reconnaisance flights conducted from Athens will now be transferred to Crete, Mr. Samaras said.
Under the accord Washington is to provide Greece with 28 Phantom F-4E fighter aircraft, 28 A-7 Corsair long-distance fighter-bombers, 6 P-3A support aircraft and 4 guided-missile-carrying destroyers of the Charles F. Adams class. Mr. Samaras said this material, worth more than $1 billion, would came from stocks made available through reductions in America's arsenal of conventional weapons. He said Greece henceforth would be included among those countries to receive such equipment regularly. The United States also wrote off a $50 million military debt owed by Greece.
The Greek Foreign Minister also said the accord included two new provisions vital for Greek interests. The first, he said, was a commitment by the United States to ''actively participate'' in efforts to prevent an attack against Greek territory or to resolve the crisis should such an attack occur. The second, he said, was a commitment to provide military supplies, much of it at no cost, at levels that would maintain the 7-to-10 ratio of American military aid to Greece and Turkey, respectively. Turkey is also a member of NATO. Both provisions have long been sought by Greece, which fears an attack from Turkey of the sort that led to the 1974 Turkish invasion and continuing occupation of northern Cyprus. But the accord does not mention Turkey by name.
 
No Tilt, U.S. Says
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Special to The New York Times) - A State Department official said today that the agreement with Greece was not intended to alarm Turkey and ''does not represent a change of policy or tilt.''
''The Turks will have to speak for themselves on this, but we have assured them that the agreement is not aimed at any third country,'' said the official, who asked to remain unidentified.
He said that Congress would be notified of the executive agreement, but that it did not require Congressional approval.

HEADLINE: A Better Neighbor Policy

 BODY:
Revolution is sweeping Latin America and Washington, sensibly, wants to encourage it. For too long, Washington has subordinated vital hemispheric concerns to ideological contests in Central America. President Bush's new economic program for the Americas signals a positive shift in priorities that can benefit Americans from Point Barrow to Tierra del Fuego.
Mr. Bush's comprehensive package includes trade, investment, debt and environmental programs. It builds constructively on existing elements, like the Brady debt relief plan and debt-for-nature swaps in Bolivia and Costa Rica. Right now, it's only words; but the words go in precisely the right direction. 
Latin America already is being transformed by changes almost as far-reaching as those convulsing Eastern Europe. Generals have been replaced by elected democrats. Statist economies are yielding to freer markets. National budgets are being pried loose from the grip of politically entrenched oligarchs, opening the fiscal space needed to check inflation, improve public services and encourage private development.
But Latin reformers, like those in Eastern Europe, must overcome a legacy of economic insularity, environmental devastation, capital scarcity and foreign debt. Leaders like Carlos Salinas in Mexico, Fernando Collor in Brazil and Carlos Menem in Argentina know that the antidote to dependency is not some new form of international welfare. But what they and Mr. Bush recognize is that a temporary infusion of outside support is urgently needed to support wrenching transitions. Here's some of what Mr. Bush proposes: Trade. A generation of flawed development policies and a decade of debt crisis have cost Latin America its fair share of expanded world trade. Mr. Bush correctly prescribes wider trade patterns and lower tariffs.
Yet the rhetorical centerpiece of his package, a hemispheric free trade zone, is of doubtful merit. Global free trade, not competing regional trade blocs, is the most effective way to expand international commerce. But Mr. Bush recognizes that a hemispheric market is a distant vision, at best. And his proposals for the present are just right: freer admission of Latin American products to the U.S. and support for Latin positions in world trade talks.
The key trade issues are agricultural. Grain exporters like Argentina are victims of Europe's protectionism. Sugar growers like the Dominican Republic suffer from U.S. quotas. And U.S. duties against cut flowers hurt Colombia's efforts to wean its economy from dependence on drugs.
Investment. Years of economic mismanagement have encouraged the flight of Latin American domestic savings into foreign banks. And a decade of debt crisis and recession has cut off much of the region from new foreign investment. Mr. Bush proposes that the U.S., Europe and Japan each contribute $100 million a year to a new regional investment fund. He also proposes new investment lending by the Inter-American Development Bank.
Only countries pursuing economic reform would qualify. And the idea is to provide seed money and increase domestic confidence, not to replace private investment. Still, $300 million a year, spread over a continent and a half, seems not enough.
Debt. Diverting export earnings and tax revenues to debt service leaves little for domestic development and social needs. Mr. Bush proposes to expand the Brady debt reduction plan with new resources from the Inter-American Development Bank. He would break new ground by forgiving some debt owed directly to governments. And he would encourage more debt swaps at discounted prices. All are good ideas.
Environment. The land hunger of the rural poor and the reckless pursuit of industrialization have ravaged Latin America's forests, threatened plant and animal species and poisoned urban environments. The debt crisis itself provides a partial answer. Debt-for-nature swaps allow environmentally minded donors to multiply the effect of contributions by taking advantage of the deep debt discounts now prevailing in resale markets. Mr. Bush would encourage such swaps for debt owed to Washington.
By promoting Latin America's growth in these ways, the Bush plan reinforces U.S. prosperity and security. With the cold war over, it makes sense to reorient U.S. policy from fighting Communism to integrating Latin America's economy into the developed world. Some of the President's ideas need adjustment, and fuller funding. But his basic approach is sound.

HEADLINE: West Side Co-op Acts Under Law and Contract

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your report that New York City housing officials have moved to take over a subsidized middle-income housing cooperative on Manhattan's Upper West Side (news article, June 27) is incomplete. What is not made clear is that when 303 West 66th Street was chartered under the Redevelopment Companies Law in 1959, both the statute and a contract with the city gave the cooperative the right to reconstitute as a Business Corporation Law (private) co-op after 25 years.
The 25-year period ended June 30, 1986, with the expiration of the city contract, and since then the Lincoln Guild Housing Corporation, owner of the cooperative, has attempted to claim its contractual and statutory rights. The State Attorney General first threw up delaying roadblocks. After we had cleared these, a very small group of dissident stockholders, aided and abetted by West Side special-interest groups, have used the courts and the city bureaucracy further to delay the reconstitution promised by statute and contract. 
All references to the ethics and morality of removing 303 from its status as a redevelopment company and of ''moral abuses, as opposed to legal abuses,'' cannot obscure the legal, ethical and moral abuses perpetrated by the Attorney General, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the dissidents and the courts in denying to the overwhelming majority of tenant-stockholders (about 90 percent, according to our surveys) their legal and contractual rights.
If the State Legislature and the city did not want us to exercise our rights to reconstitution, they should not have included the 25-year time limit. But, since they did, it seems a violation of free-enterprise and our economic rights to renege at this late date.
It may be of interest to note that the tax abatement on each apartment is a small fraction of the rent. Our low rent is the result of prudent management, significant voluntary service from stockholders and a paid-up mortgage.

The Hazy Future Of Trying to Plan For the Future

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Skeptics say strategic planning is for people you can't trust with the present.
But with New York City again facing an uncertain future, it's arguable whether officials consumed by real crises can be trusted to plan for potential ones.
Years of lobbying finally led to the creation of a modest Office of Strategic Planning within New York's Department of City Planning in 1988. Last week, it was scrapped for a savings of about $500,000 - largely a victim of unforeseen budget gaps. 
''We no longer exist,'' said the office's former director, Ben-Ami Friedman.
Five years ago, William J. Dean, the chairman of a coalition of civic, philanthropic and planning groups called the Civic Affairs Forum, warned that without strategic planning, ''the city will, at best, fall far short of its potential. At worst, it will be overwhelmed by market forces, outwitted by international and interregional and intermunicipal competition and be defenseless against its internal weaknesses - the inertia of 'business as usual' and the local politics of 'not in my backyard.' ''
Two years later, that warning was echoed by Mayor Edward I. Koch's Commission on the Year 2000, headed by Robert F. Wagner Jr. A strategic planning office was created late in 1988, but it only got going the following spring.
Beset by turf battles, it never achieved its potential. But it made a start. It identified 26 issues that needed to be addressed and singled out these seven:
* Finding markets for recycled materials that the city hopes to separate at the rate of 7,180 tons a day by 1994 and 11,000 tons a day by 1997, up from 1,430 tons a day this year.
* Expanding day-care centers, particulary for preschool children eligible for publicly funded programs, to help meet an existing shortage of about 200,000 spaces and to anticipate demand for up to 17,000 more generated by Federal job and training mandates for parents on welfare.
* Increasing home-care services for the frail elderly to meet a demand that is expected to rise from 53,000 cases in 1988 to 93,000 in 10 years.
* Bringing more unemployed black and Hispanic youths into the labor force.
* Expanding a volunteer corps to help teen-agers become self-reliant adults while peforming community service.
* Intervening earlier to deter juvenile delinquency and providing more alternative detention programs to reduce recidivism.
* Reducing solid waste, projected to grow from 27,000 tons a day two years ago to 31,000 tons a day in the year 2000.
Mr. Friedman's office dealt with the first priority in detail. A 12-agency task force explored potential markets for waste paper, plastics, textiles and metal cans and reported in March on how and where they could be recycled to produce jobs and tax revenue.
Three months later, the planning office itself was out of business - unbeknown to Mr. Dean, to Mr. Wagner and to Eric Lane, who was counsel to the Charter Revision Commission, which redefined the city's planning responsibilities. The charter requires the city's Planning Department to appoint a deputy executive director for strategic planning and to help the Mayor in preparing a quadrennial strategic policy statement, due in November; a biennial 10-year public works agenda, and an annual statement on economic and social indicators.
''I came here to do planning,'' says Richard L. Schaffer, who is chairman of the Planning Commission and directs the Planning Department, which, he said, includes a fresh look at strategic planning.
He recruited Sigurd Grava, director of Columbia University's urban planning program, to integrate the charter requirements in what Dr. Grava called ''a continuous activity that could be called strategic planning.'' However it is defined, Dr. Grava cautioned, ''it's what you make of it.''
Perhaps nobody could have anticipated problems like AIDS or crack. But pragmatic planners with their heads in the clouds and their feet on the ground might better prepare the city for a period of recurring budget crises. While New York is being revitalized by new immigrants, a new economic engine to drive the city out of its slump - like the financial services industry did a decade or so ago - has yet to be identified, much less encouraged.
Vision cannot be mandated. But Mr. Wagner and others express concern that the reconstituted commission will become so consumed with the processes of reviewing individual projects that it may lose sight of larger issues as the millenium approaches.
With 2000 only 10 years away, planning, itself, is facing an uncertain future.

HEADLINE: In the Zodiac Case, Still More Riddles Than Clues

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Four months after the gunman who calls himself the Zodiac shot his first victim, the largest police task force assembled in New York City since the Son of Sam murders is still baffled by the central riddle of the case: how the gunman knows the astrological signs of his victims.
Investigators believe that if they can learn how the Zodiac came to know the birth dates of the men he has stalked and shot, they will have found a trail to the killer. But as they have dug into the past of the victims, in particular the first three, the police have failed to come up with any common thread.
''That's the mystery,'' said Chief of Detectives Joseph R. Borrelli. ''That's what we are trying to unravel.'' 
The police believe the gunman obtained the victim's birth dates either in casual conversations long enough before the first three shootings for the victims to forget, or by somehow gaining access to personal information about them.
Since one wounded victim said the gunman fired and ran, Chief Borrelli said, investigators have ruled out the possibility that the Zodiac rifled their pockets for identification after shooting them.
Only the last victim - a homeless man shot in Central Park - has recalled being asked his birthday by a stranger.
Detectives have had the other victims scour their memories for anyone who might have asked their birth dates or been given that information. The list of possibilities is long - census takers, bank tellers and even clerks at video stores or other places where applications are filled out.
But no one figure has surfaced who has links to each of the first three victims.
Since March 8, the Zodiac gunman has shot four men, all at close range, all in the early morning hours on a Thursday.
The last three shootings have occurred 21 days apart, leading the police to believe the gunman may strike again this Thursday in the early morning hours, three weeks after the latest shooting.
The first three victims were shot in a nine-block radius in the East New York section of Brooklyn and neighboring Woodhaven, Queens. The shooting in Central Park, on June 21, came after the police flooded East New York with officers.
Three of the victims survived the attacks. One, a 78-year-old Brooklyn man, Joseph Proce, later died of his wounds.
Each of the victims had a different astrological sign. The gunman scrawled the symbols for the signs of his first three victims in a pie-shaped picture in a note found at the scene of the third shooting. The same diagram appeared on two letters sent to news organizations a week later.
 
No Order Is Seen
After the last shooting, a fourth astrological sign, corresponding to the fourth victim's birth date, was added to the circle in a note left nearby and in a letter sent the following day to The New York Post. The gunman has attacked, in order, a Scorpio, a Gemini, a Taurus and a Cancer, the police said.
Astrologers say the series represents no particular order of signs and does not correspond to the months in which the victims were shot.
A task force of more than 50 detectives based in a two-story brick building in the Brooklyn Navy Yard has culled through the more than 1,800 tips called into a Zodiac phone line and pursued those that seem promising, Chief Borrelli said. They have interviewed at least 36 people but dismissed all of them as possible suspects.
''We haven't gotten one suspect we're zeroing in on,'' Chief Borrelli said. ''So far we haven't been able to put anything together that ties the victims together.''
 
Many Theories
While little is known about the gunman, there has been a wealth of speculation about him by journalists, criminal psychologists and astrologers. One columnist, Mike McAlary of The Daily News, has theorized that the gunman is laying a map of the constellation Orion across the city to choose the sites of the shootings - the first three in a roughly straight line corresponding to Orion's belt, the Central Park shooting being roughly where Orion's club would be.
But Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown in a recent interview called such theories ''pure speculation.''
There have also been theories that the gunman identifies with the mythical hunter Orion, and that his first victim was a Scorpio because in mythology it was a giant scorpion that killed Orion. Some newspapers have consulted handwriting experts, who say their analyses of the gunman's scrawl - it slants different ways, T's are crossed low and many words are underlined - show that he fears failure and authority, was traumatized as a child, grew up in poverty and is desperate for attention. #2 Mangled Bullets The police have few pieces of hard evidence: the six cryptic letters written in ballpoint pen on a type of paper without a watermark, which is commonly used in New York schools, one partial fingerprint found on a letter at the last shooting that seems to have no match in state or Federal fingerprint files and two mangled bullets.
The gunman has preyed on vulnerable men. On March 8, Mario Orozco, a 50-year-old man who used a cane because of a congenital limp, was shot in the back at Atlantic and Sheridan Avenues. On March 29, Jermaine Montenesdro, a 34-year-old factory worker, was attacked at Nichols and Jamaica Avenues while walking drunkenly to his father's home. On May 31, Mr. Proce, who used a cane, was shot in front of his house on 87th Road in Woodhaven. The last victim, Larry Parham, a 30-year-old homeless man, was attacked while sleeping on a bench on Literary Walk in Central Park.
Detectives also have a vague description of the Zodiac from Mr. Proce, who before he died said the gunman was an unkempt black man in his 30's, about 6 feet tall and 180 pounds, with a mustache and beard. While the other victims have said they cannot identify their attacker, Mr. Parham has given a description of the man who asked him his birth date several hours before the shooting, the details of which matched Mr. Proce's.
Ballistics tests show that the two recovered bullets were fired from the same gun, which could be .380-caliber or 9-millimeter, which are nearly identical calibers, the police said. The soft-lead bullets, one recovered from Mr. Proce's stomach and the other from the bench Mr. Parham slept on, bore scratches that showed they came out of the same pistol barrel.
 
No Cartridges Found
But they did not have the diagonal rifling grooves that typically appear on bullets that have been fired. The police believe that the gunman either made the gun from a piece of pipe or filed down the spiral ridges in the gun barrel that give a bullet its spin and make the diagonal grooves.
In the other two cases, surgeons decided not to remove the bullets.
No cartridges were found at the shooting scenes, although most .380-caliber and 9-millimeter weapons are semiautomatics that eject spent shells after firing. The absence of cartridges supports the theory that the gun is homemade and fires a single round, ballistics experts said. Regular weapons spit out shells up to 10 feet away, experts said, and it would be hard for a man in a hurry to find them in the dark.
In a letter to The Post, the gunman said ''all shoot with a .380 RNL or 9 mm no grooves on bullets.''
The police believe ''RNL'' stands for ''round nose lead,'' a kind of bullet usually used for target practice. The recovered slugs are round nose lead bullets, the police said.
 
Probably a Copycat
A psychological profile of the killer prepared by detectives describes him as a loner desperate for attention who has little education, lives alone, is probably unemployed and probably lives in the neighborhood where the first three shootings took place.
Chief Borrelli said the gunman is believed to be getting his ideas from a 1986 book called ''Zodiac'' about the San Francisco Zodiac killer. Although that killer was never captured, Chief Borrelli said investigators think the New York gunman is not the same person.
The book, by Robert Graysmith, is a detailed account of a string of at least six murders committed in California in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Someone who said he was the killer sent letters to local newspapers claiming responsibility for 37 killings and taunting the police to catch him.
The letters included in the book began with a phrase similar to the one that begins the six letters in the New York case - ''This is the Zodiac.''
The New York gunman has claimed to be the man who terrorized San Francisco. In a letter to The Post, in which he also claimed responsibility for the June 21st shooting, he wrote: ''You are wrong . . . it is one of the same Zodiac one Zodiac.''
The letter contains a drawing of a hooded executioner with a cross-hairs diagram on his shirt. It is identical to a drawing in the book which has not been printed elsewhere, investigators said.
 
Not as Cruel
Candice Skrapec, a psychology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who is an expert on serial killers, said the New York gunman may believe he is carrying on the unfinished work of the San Francisco killer.
But she said the New York gunman's psychological makeup is very different. The San Francisco Zodiac was sadistic, often torturing or sexually abusing his victims, sometimes using a knife, she said.
The New York gunman prefers to shoot vulnerable men from behind and then flee. Rather than cruelty, his motive seems to be ''a need for attention, a need to command our respect,'' Ms. Skrapec said.
Ms. Skrapec said the gunman may have a delusional obsession with astrology and may identify strongly with the figure of Orion, the hunter.
''He creates a scheme for himself that reflects these astrological motifs,'' said Ms. Skrapec. ''When we look at it, it may seem to be irrational; but for him it's probably charged with meaning.''
Mr. Graysmith said the New York gunman's twisted logic bears little similarity to that of the San Francisco killer, who usually killed his victims near bodies of water under a full moon. That Zodiac, who is believed to be white and an arms expert, did not choose his victims according to their astrological signs, Mr. Graysmith said.
Henry Weingarten, director of the New York Astrology Center, said the New York gunman seems to have only a cursory understanding of astrology. The gunman has not picked the times of his shootings according to an astrological pattern or attacked people with signs associated with the time of year.
''He's not a sophisticated astrologer,'' Mr. Weingarten said. ''He uses the signs the way a child would illustrate a grade school paper, with pretty pictures.''

HEADLINE: New York Told To Base Raises On Job Needs

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
As New York City begins contract negotiations with its largest municipal union today, a civic group says it should end the pattern of roughly comparable raises for all unions, in favor of a two-year freeze for uniformed workers and substantial pay increases for jobs with a shortage of applicants.
The recommendations of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group financed largely by businesses in the city, would markedly alter the past practices of the city and its work force, most of whose contracts either expired last month or will expire by this fall.
Negotiating new settlements with employees from teachers to police officers is a major challenge for Mayor David N. Dinkins, who was elected last year with heavy union backing. In the face of a stagnant local economy and an uncertain future, the city budget, which was adopted July 1, assumes annual wage increases of 1.5 percent, a figure the unions have dismissed as unacceptable. 
Raymond D. Horton, the president of the budget commission, said the pending negotiations and the city's fiscal difficulties called for innovations - and average increases below the inflation rate.
 
Unions Oppose Wage Freeze
''This has been a closed system for a long time,'' he said. ''Some of the rules of the game ought to be changed, in our view.''
Richard A. Levine, the commission's chairman, said, ''It is time for municipal wage policy to address the problem that some employees are overpaid and others are underpaid.''
Among the positions that the commission said should perhaps receive higher-than-average raises were engineers, lawyers, computer analysts and health professionals. Wage increases for civilian jobs that are not hard to fill should be held to about 1.5 percent, the commission said.
But the heads of the major uniformed unions quickly denounced the idea of a wage freeze. Phil Caruso, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, called it ''totally unrealistic,'' while Edward Ostrowski, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, said it showed an ''elitist, ivory-tower attitude.''
 
Cool Analysis but Hot Politics
Louis A. Sforza, president of the Uniformed Firefighters' Association, said, ''Once again, the Citizens Budget Commission is looking to balance the budget on the backs of working people.''
To be sure, the commission's report was animated by the cool utilitarian analysis that typifies its studies on such subjects, and senior city officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that some proposals were clearly politically unworkable. But they also said that some ideas, like giving extra rewards to workers who agree to productivity increases, or who could command much higher salaries in business, were intriguing.
District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest city employees union with 140,000 civilian members, begins negotiations today, and Mr. Dinkins is to go to union headquarters this morning for a ceremonial handshake of good faith.
Union officials said that that show of cordiality, after years of antagonism from the administration of former Mayor Edward I. Koch, augured well for the bargaining, although a spokesman for the local, Edward Handman, said a wage freeze and a 1.5 percent increase were unrealistic.
But Mr. Handman was more conciliatory on the notion of rewards for hard-to-fill jobs.
''They have put their finger on a sensitive point that is not adequately discussed,'' he said. ''The fact is that there are many jobs, in the professions particularly, that are not being addressed and the city is having trouble recruiting and retaining these people. So in principle that is correct. Such people have to start being compensated adequately to compete with a market that is taking them away.''
In recent years, contract settlements with the city's unions have also sometimes included ''equity funds,'' lumps of money to be distributed in varying amounts to workers in jobs with high turnover and vacancies.
Arguing for a freeze in uniformed workers' salaries, the budget commission noted that there are far more qualified applicants for each available post than can be hired. In recent Civil Service exams for entry-level jobs, for example, 84 people passed the test for sanitation worker for every one hired. The ratio was 37 to 1 for firefighters, 10 to 1 for police officers and 8 to 1 for correction officers.
 
Harder Negotiations Forecast
The commission acknowledged that freezing wages or granting increases below the rate of inflation would mean declining pay in real terms. But it said that salaries of most workers had risen significantly in real terms since 1983, putting them at adjusted income levels on a par with those at the onset of the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's.
With the city's fiscal condition again more precarious, the commission said, the city should restrict wage increases, even to less than the inflation rate in some cases, or even higher taxes and greater service cuts would be forced.
The commission acknowledged that adjusting raises based on particular positions would make negotations harder.
''To obtain the high quality work force the city deserves without wasting taxpayers' money, the next round of settlements should treat workers far more diversely than has been the practice in the past,'' its report said. ''This is more difficult than bargaining across-the-board increases, but it is essential for promoting efficient municipal government.''
Eric J. Schmertz, the city's labor relations commissioner, said in a statement that it was too early in the negotiating process to assess the commission's proposals.

HEADLINE: New Life for Hoboken's Ghost Waterfront? Vote to Decide

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J.

 BODY:
Brick and steel, bit by bit, the 90-year-old piers built here by German steamship lines to last for ages are reluctantly coming down, opening this Hudson River waterfront to a future filled with uncertainty.
As huge jackhammers strain to undo the Germans' fastidiousness - these fireproof piers replaced earlier ones destroyed in a fire in 1900 - Hoboken residents prepare to vote tomorrow on what the waterfront and the city itself should become.
Hoboken's mayor and other city officials want the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to help build a huge new complex of offices, stores, apartments and a park that will reflect a sophisticated new urbanity.
On the other side, a coalition of city residents, who in a similar vote last year unsuccessfully tried to have the piers turned into a 30-acre park, oppose the Port Authority plan. They say they will accept development, but only on a small scale in keeping with the city's 19th-century streetscape. 
The vote comes less than two weeks after the announcement that another waterfront fixture, the Maxwell House coffee plant, the last major smokestack industry on the river's edge, will close in 18 months.
 
Drastic Change in the Offing
Whatever the voters decide, it is certain that this city's relationship to its waterfront, one that in many ways shaped Hoboken's character, is in for a drastic change.
''It's sad to see it go,'' Donald Barrett, a retired Hoboken longshoreman, said of the pier during a recent trip to watch a wrecker's ball bounce off the doomed waterfront buildings. ''While it was here, it was home. But I don't think it means that much to the city any more.''
Once the waterfront was a place of pungent sights and smells that flavored the entire community. Here the community merges with the waterfront. East-west streets lead directly to the river, people live across the street from the docks and a long ball hit at the Little League field can plop down close to Pier C. At first this closeness was a splendid advantage. When the city was settled, the river's edge served as a gentle docking place for the world's first steam ferry and for harried New Yorkers looking to wile away a hot summer's afternoon. It was under such conditions that the first baseball game was supposed to have been played on the Elysian Fields, just above the waterfront, in 1846. In 1861 the first commercial piers were built, and soon seamen, merchants and immigrants started to fill Hoboken's streets.
By 1917 prosperous Germans ran the waterfront and City Hall, and many public- school classes were taught in German.
Then World War I broke out, and the United States Government seized the piers and the huge German-built ships docked there. Fearing spies and saboteurs, the Government placed the entire city under martial law, and a few old residents still remember seeing soldiers marching up First Street toward the port. More than a million doughboys set sail from here, vowing as they left to be in ''heaven, hell or Hoboken'' by Christmas.
It was in the 1950's, when its piers, shipyards and gloomy factories were bustling, that the waterfront defined Hoboken as a rough-and-tumble working-class town, a port of call where streets echoed with a dozen languages and cultures.
So well developed was that persona that Hoboken was selected as the film set for ''On the Waterfront,'' which etched indelibly onto millions of minds what a waterfront looked and sounded like.
 
No Room to Expand
Thoroughly modernized by the Port Authority in the early 1950's, the Hoboken piers were undone by progress and the long steel boxes called containers in which nearly all overseas cargo is now transported. The containers are highly efficient but voracious in their need for space. Hoboken's early advantage turned into a drawback because there was no room to expand.
So in 1971 the cargo-handling companies simply picked up and left for Port Newark-Elizabeth, now one of the world's busiest container ports. Hoboken's piers have been silent since, a backlot movie prop.
The Port Authority, which has a long-term lease for use of the piers, has been interested in developing them for the last decade. The agency got legislation passed in both New York and New Jersey that allows it to get involved in such a project, but then it had to overcome deep community opposition.
Finally last year, thinking all challenges had been met, the agency prepared to sign a final agreement with the city when a group of advocates gathered enough signatures to have the contract put before a public referendum for approval.
 
Problems of Bigness Feared
''It's just too big,'' said Susan O'Kane, a member of the Coalition for a Better Waterfront, the citizen group opposed to the Port Authority contract. ''Hoboken is just a little 19th-century town with 25-foot-wide streets that can't possibly absorb the traffic generated by development.''
If the plan is defeated tomorrow, the city will have to begin negotiations all over again. But planning officials are optimistic that voters will approve it and that something can be done with the waterfront.
Peggy E. Thomas, director of Hoboken's Community Development Agency, says it is unfortunate that a whole era is passing, and she believes that Hoboken will never be as cohesive a community as it was before. Change is unavoidable, she said, but in some ways it will be change for the better. For 90 years a three-block-long brick warehouse on River Street - called the headhouse - has blocked people from reaching or even seeing the river.
''The headhouse connected the waterfront to the city through work,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''Taking it down will connect them in a different way.''
 
Adjustment to Change Predicted
Mayor Patrick Pasculli, a lifelong Hoboken resident, said the city had been hit hard by the loss of the working docks and by more recent losses, like Maxwell House, but would recover.
''Just as a fine actor is able to adjust to many different roles, the city of Hoboken is resilient and will adjust to its new role, whatever that may be,'' Mr. Pasculli said. If the Port Authority plan is voted, a few bollards and cleats from the old docks will be salvaged and reused, and a monument to the World War I embarkation will be set up in the new complex. Otherwise all the history on the waterfront will be erased.
In its place will be residential and commercial buildings, one 25 stories high. The plan includes a marina, a fishing pier and a tree-lined promenade, all designed to open up the river to the people, something that has not been possible on a large scale since the days of the original Elysian Fields.
 
Lure of the River
Of course, some people have always found their way down to the water. On a recent hot afternoon, about a dozen people were on the crumpled concrete deck of what used to be the Stevens Institute of Technology pier on Frank Sinatra Drive, below Castle Point. Some fished; one man caught a blue fish as long as his arm. Another had a cooler of beer strapped to his bicycle, to share with two friends.
Carlos Marti, a 33-year-old industrial presser, said he liked to go down to the river to relax. He watched the tugs and other boats pass by in the brown river, and in spite of overflowing garbage cans and all the dirt, he felt in the air a little bit of the freedom that open waters have always represented.
Mr. Marti said he did not know anything about the history of the waterfront or what it once meant to the city. He only knew that when it got hot enough to make asphalt streets mushy, the breeze remained cool on the river.
''They should put something here for the people to use,'' he said. ''We got no other place to go.''

HEADLINE: $16 Billion Transportation Plan Proposed in Albany

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 6

 BODY:
A $16 billion program over the next 20 years to improve transportation in the Hudson Valley was proposed this week by a special task force of the State Department of Transportation.
It said that amount, and probably more, was needed to maintain and improve roads, bridges, mass transit resources and airports in the seven counties just north of New York City -Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange, Ulster, Dutchess and Columbia.
Calling the region the fastest growing in New York State, the task force forecast a travel increase of 68 percent by the year 2010, but noted that the existing transportation resources could not handle that growth. 
''Things are only going to get worse,'' said Russell W. Robbins, project manager for the draft plan, which was compiled at the department's regional office in Poughkeepsie. The plan is called ''21st Century Mobility: Moving People and Goods.''
 
Major Bottlenecks Already
Already, the plan said, the region is congested. It cited major bottlenecks in Westchester and Rockland Counties; lesser, although serious, congestion in Putnam, Orange and Dutchess Counties, and increasing problems in the more rural Ulster and Columbia Counties.
As the worst examples of road congestion, it cited Interstate 287 in Westchester and Rockland Counties, the Tappan Zee Bridge, Route 9 south of Poughkeepsie in Dutchess County and Route 211 east of Middletown in Orange County.
''The majority of traffic congestion is directly attributable to the limited capacity of the region's highways and Hudson River bridge crossings to meet the increased demands of single-occupancy motor vehicle traffic in the A.M. and P.M. peak commuter hours,'' the report said.
Mr. Robbins said that the plan recognized that building new roads was not possible. Instead, it proposed a three-point program to preserve the existing transportation system, to rebuild and widen major traffic arteries and to try to move more people on existing roads, bridges and mass transit systems by car-pooling, vans and trains. $3 Billion in Repairs ''Our first priority is to preserve and renew the present infrastructure,'' Mr. Robbins said.
That program is now under way, with money from the $3 billion 1988 Transportation Bond Issue causing temporary traffic dislocations on many of the region's major roads and bridges.
Although the draft plan estimated the cost for transportation improvements in the valley at a minimum of $16 billion over the next 20 years, ''The actual cost will be higher,'' the report said.
''This does not include operating needs, right of way or engineering and accounting for inflation,'' it said.
At a time of budget-cutting nationally and statewide, Mr. Robbins and other transportation experts conceded that such a large amount of money would not be available from either the Federal or state governments.
''Where are we going to find that money?'' said David Murray, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation. ''We simply do not know.''
Mr. Murray said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had ruled out another bond issue for transportation.
Mr. Robbins said one option was to increase the gasoline tax to provide dedicated money for transportation improvements. California recently voted a 9-cents-a-gallon tax for such purposes.
''Tax increases are obviously not popular,'' he said, ''but I think people are more receptive to new taxes if they can see the end results.''
The draft plan will be presented at public hearings in New Paltz on July 19 and in White Plains on July 24. After that, it will be modified, if necessary, Mr. Robbins said, and sent to the State Legislature and county legislatures.

HEADLINE: Zebra Mussel Threatens Economy and Ecology

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
Julie Kuberka stood on the edge of the Hudson River here, pulling in a laundry line cord with a white plastic tile at its end. Her assistant, Jennifer Curnow, sealed the tile in a plastic freezer bag, ready to be sent back to a laboratory for analysis.
The two women were searching for clues to the whereabouts of the zebra mussel, a recent aquatic invader from Europe that is spreading rapidly into the waterways of New York State from the Great Lakes.
''No, we haven't found anything yet,'' Ms. Kuberka said, after inspecting the tile for traces of the shellfish, which has become one of the major environmental pests in New York. She put her gear into a station wagon, and left for another area of investigation along the Erie Canal. 
Despite the indication that the prolific but inedible shellfish has not yet reached the Hudson River, it has been found in five new locations in the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River so far this year, according to the state's clearinghouse on zebra mussel information.
 
On the St. Lawrence River
''It went like wildfire,'' said Charles R. O'Neill Jr., a scientist at the clearinghouse, which is located at the State University College at Brockport. ''It is spreading faster than we thought.''
Mr. O'Neill said mussels had been found recently at Duluth at the western end of Lake Superior, the Snell and Eisenhower Locks on the St. Lawrence River, a cement plant dock in Kingston, Ontario, and the Bay of Quinte at the northeastern end of Lake Ontario.
Earlier, the mussel had been found throughout Lake Erie, off Green Bay in Lake Michigan, in the Niagara River, the Welland Canal and Lake Ontario.
Mr. O'Neill and David B. MacNeil have been collecting data on zebra mussels ever since they were first detected in the United States two years ago. They are members of the Sea Grant Institute, a state and Federal program that studies coastal water problems and runs the clearinghouse.
 
Loss of Business
They and other marine biologists and electric utility companies are worried about the spread of the mussel because of its potential for severe economic losses as well as ecological damage.
Huge clusters of the fast-growing shellfish can clog the pipes of power plants, drinking water systems and factories that take water from the lakes. The mussel also devours microscopic plants at the base of the food chain for fresh water fish, which could eventually kill off fish life.
According to a projection by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the expanding mussel population could cost nearly $500 million a year in added expenses for public utilities, water companies and industrial centers and loss of business in sport fishing, marinas and motels along the inland waterways of the nation.
The zebra mussel, named because of its dark brown stripes on a light tannish shell, was first noticed in the United States in 1988 in Lake St. Clair, east of Detroit. Experts believe it arrived when ships traveling from Europe through the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes dumped their ballast water.
Without any natural enemies, the mussels attached themselves to the hulls of commercial and recreational boats, navigational buoys, docks, ladders, and plastic bottles as well as to intake pipes.
 
Constant Source of Food
Already a major environmental problem, the small bivalves have an affinity for water intake pipes, which afford a constant source of flowing water with food for them. They multiply in the pipes, clogging them. They and their larvae spread rapidly by hitchhiking in bilge water and on the underwater surfaces of boats.
One of its major methods of spreading is in or on recreational boats that are used in one body of water and then taken to another, Mr. O'Neill said. He cited a recent case of a sports boat in Lake Chautauqua, which had been transported overland from Lake Ontario, with several zebra mussels on its hull. ''I'd lay odds that the mussels will be found in the lake soon,'' he said.
To monitor the spread of the mussel, the state's electric power industry, through its Empire State Electric Energy Research Corporation, contracted with Acres International Corporation, a private company in Amherst, N.Y., to trace the advance of the musssel in New York.
 
Collecting Water Samples
Under that contract, Ms. Kuberka and Ms. Curnow visit 22 stations once a month collecting water samples from the Chemung, Mohawk, Susquehanna, Delaware and Hudson Rivers, the Erie Canal and the Finger Lakes.
''There's nothing we can identify as a zebra mussel yet, but we have to send our samples to a laboratory for analysis,'' Ms. Kuberka said, as she finished her work the other day at a Niagara Mohawk power station south of Albany.
But Mr. O'Neill and his colleagues at the state clearinghouse in Brockport are convinced that it is only a matter of time before the zebra mussel makes its way into all the major waterways of New York and neighboring states.
''I expect to see it soon in the Erie Canal,'' he said. ''Once in the canal, it is a threat to the Mohawk and Hudson Rivers as well as the Genesee and Oswego Rivers and other waters in the state.''

HEADLINE: Henry J. Kuss Jr., 67, Negotiator Of Billions in U.S. Weapons Sales

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT

 BODY:
Henry J. Kuss Jr., an international military consultant who was the Defense Department's chief arms salesman in the 1960's, died of cancer Friday at Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Va., a family spokesman said. He was 67 years old and lived in McLean, Va.
Mr. Kuss was often called the most successful arms salesman in history, filling foreign orders totaling $15 billion over seven years. But he was modest about his selling talents, providing this assessment in 1967:
''We literally don't have to do a thing. We haven't had to go out and promote a sale since we started. We just make it known that it's possible to buy. If a country says to us, they can buy an item cheaper in another part of the world, then we say, 'Go ahead and buy it.' We just tell them they'd better make sure it's really cheaper.'' 
Associates said Mr. Kuss was a skillful negotiator who was adept at marketing the standardization, high quality and lower unit costs of American equipment. In 1965, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara presented him with the Meritorious Civilian Service Medal for his ''unparalleled ability as a negotiator.''
 
Studied Needs of NATO
Mr. Kuss was in charge of arms sales from 1962 to 1969. He had ample preparation for those duties, as a weapons technician for the Navy and in carrying out major studies of the long-range military needs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for the Defense Department. He was a resolute cold warrior dedicated to containing the spread of Communism.
After leaving the Government in 1969, Mr. Kuss founded two international consulting concerns, the American Trade and Finance Company and Calcussearch Inc. In 1985, the two companies were merged into DGA International, with Mr. Kuss staying on as a general associate.
Henry John Kuss Jr. was born on Nov. 10, 1922, in the Astoria section of Queens. He studied economics and mathematics at Holy Cross and St. John's universities and was a supply officer in the Navy in World War II.
He was a former vice president of the Howard Hughes Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., a member of the McLean Citizens Association and a president of the Potomac Hills Citizens Association.
Surviving are his wife, Johanna; two daughters, Linda Musick, of Burke, Va., and Karen Childs, of Augusta, Ga.; two brothers, Russell, of Burke, and Richard, of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Business and the Law;
For Lawyers, Few Big-Fee Deals

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
The rate of growth at many leading law firms slowed considerably in 1989, but the legal business was nonetheless highly profitable, a study scheduled to be released today has found.
Lawyers at the nation's largest firms said the latest figures reflect an economic climate in which premium billings from Wall Street deals have become a rarity.
But that has been offset somewhat by the continuing growth of litigation and new business from large corporate bankruptcies and the expansion of deals overseas.
 
Change in Strategy
''Every firm that has had a mergers and acquisitions practice has seen some slowdown in growth,'' said William M. Friedrich, a partner at Shearman & Sterling, New York's second-largest law firm, and the fourth largest in revenues, with $281 million. ''But we, like a number of other firms, have a corporate workout group that is substantially busier.'' He added that a significant number of lawyers who had previously worked full time in corporate finance are now spending more time on helping financially troubled companies. 
The study of the 100 firms with the largest revenues was conducted by The American Lawyer, a trade publication. It calculated that the average revenues per lawyer at the 100 firms increased in 1989 by 6.3 percent, compared with a 13 percent gain in 1988.
Total revenues for the firms rose to $12.4 billion, from $10.6 billion a year earlier. The study also concludes that 49 firms had revenues of more than $100 million in 1989. A similar study conducted for 1988 found that 37 firms had revenues above $100 million.
The method of measuring profitability on a per-partner basis does not necessarily reflect how much the partners took home because in many instances it does not account for deductions for such purposes as firm equity, pension plans or charitable contributions.
The latest figures do not reflect the declining business in mergers and acquisitions this year, and appear somewhat more optimistic for 1989 at a significant number of firms that are on a cash basis of accounting.
Using this method, these firms recognized profits last year for deals that actually occurred in 1988. Some of the biggest corporate deals that arose in the last quarter of 1988 - including the $25 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco, the $13 billion acquisition by the Phillip Morris Companies of Kraft Inc. and the $5.7 billion purchase of the Pillsbury Company by Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. -were largely billed in 1989.
The figures also do not accurately reflect the fourth quarter of 1989, a particularly slow period for Wall Street deals. Results from the quarter are expected to show up in legal billings for 1990.
''I was at a conference on legal management a few weeks ago and among the participants there was a considerable amount of gloom and doom about earnings,'' said Richard Pogue, managing partner at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, which with $320 million in revenues was ranked No. 3 in the study.
Mr. Pogue said that the flat economic growth generally had translated into less business for many law firms, adding that many in-house legal departments had been more aggressively trying to keep outside costs down.
Hardest hit by the Wall Street slowdown were the large New York firms, whose revenues per partner grew by 8.1 percent in 1989, after a gain of 15.1 percent a year earlier. The New York firms also suffered from a downturn in commercial real estate deals.
The Wall Street slump affects law firms in several ways. It means that they get less business from corporations that are interested in acquiring others and from those that are the targets of unsolicited bids. It also translates into less legal business from the investment houses, which in past years have provided a steady flow of business for many of the nation's most profitable law firms.
Changes in the market for high-yield ''junk bonds,'' in tax laws and in state takeover laws have made tender offers more difficult, and relatively high stock prices have made many companies too expensive to be attractive targets. Nonetheless, 9 of the 10 most profitable law firms in 1989 - measured on a per-partner basis - are based in New York, and most of them had large departments handling corporate mergers.
For 1989, like 1988, Cravath, Swaine & Moore had the highest profits per partner, at $1.76 million. Following were Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, at $1.59 million per partner; Cahill, Gordon & Reindel, at $1.51 million, and Sullivan & Cromwell, at $1.21 million.
Since then, Cahill, Gordon has lost its most lucrative client, Drexel, Burnham Lambert Inc., which earlier this year collapsed and had to file for bankruptcy protection. The investment firm is said to have accounted for more than a quarter of the firm's annual revenues. Cahill is now one of Drexel's many creditors.
The growing number of large and complex bankruptcies has provided steady, but less lucrative business for many law firms, causing several to strengthen their reorganization departments.
The latest sign of the growing popularity of reorganization work among large firms was seen last month in the announcement by Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler that it had acquired a prominent bankruptcy boutique, Levin & Weintraub, Crames & Edelman. Other major firms that have recently bolstered their reorganization practices include Willkie Farr & Gallagher of New York and O'Melveny & Myers of Los Angeles.
Another area of growth for legal business has been the savings and loan debacle, in which the Government is spending hundreds of millions of dollars retaining private law firms to augment its work. A number of firms are also profiting by representing collapsing savings and loans and their acquirers.
Among the firms that made significant advances in raising their average revenues per lawyer were Morgan, Lewis & Bockius of Philadelphia, Arnold & Porter of Washington, and Sidley & Austin of Chicago. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, New York's largest firm, continued to dominate the list of revenue earners, with $517 million in 1989, up from $440 million in 1988. The firm ranked fifth on the list of profits per partner, at almost $1.2 million. < In conducting the study, The American Lawyer said it solicited information from more than 120 law firms, and most of them cooperated. Whenever a firm would not disclose information, the magazine said, it made an ''informed estimate.'' The magazine warned of the ''increasingly troubling possibility'' that some firms that cooperated may have ''fudged the numbers upward.''
For the first time, the magazine also rated the firms by the amount of pro bono, or free public work, based upon the number of lawyers and the number of hours devoted for such service. None of the 10 firms with the strongest revenues received a rating better than ''good.''

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Chile and U.S. to Begin Talks on Freeing Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Chile, one of the lowest-tariff countries in Latin America, will open negotiations with Washington this week about establishing a free trade zone with the United States, Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley said Friday.
''Our national interest is to have access to expanded markets,'' he said at a news conference after two days of meetings with senior Bush Administration officials and the heads of international lending organizations.
Mr. Foxley, a former economics professor, is the first Latin American cabinet official to visit Washington since a June 27 initiative by President Bush that set as its goal a free trade system for all the Western Hemisphere. 
 
Working With Mexico
The United States already has free trade pacts with Israel and Canada, and last month, President Bush and Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico's President, announced that his nation and the United States would begin work on a similar pact.
In addition to the offer to work toward trade without barriers, Mr. Bush said that as part of his initiative, the United States was prepared to forgive a substantial portion of the $12 billion that Latin American countries owe the United States Government.
He also announced plans for creation of a $300 million fund to encourage Latin nations to open their economies to foreign investment. The President pledged $100 million as the American share and said he would call on Japan and the European Community to contribute the other $200 million.
With relatively strong economic growth and low inflation, Chile, which has pursued free-market economic policies since the mid-1980's, can enter ''with sure footing'' into free trade agreements with the United States and other countries, Mr. Foxley stressed.
 
A Favored Country
Mr. Foxley was making his first visit to Washington since Chile's new democratic Government under President Patricio Aylwin took office on March 11. Bush economists cite Chile as one of their favorite countries.
The vist came as Brazil's President, Fernando Collor de Mello, and Argentina's President, Carlos Saul Menem, are developing their own plans for greater economic integration.
Argentina and Brazil are expected to sign at least 20 trade-related agreements during the current state visit by the Brazilian President to the Argentine capital.
Mr. Foxley said that he welcomed the moves by Chile's two neighbors. ''We believe that we will sooner or later converge on a Latin American integration scheme that may well be more closely related to the U.S. market than we have ever envisioned before,'' he told the news conference at the Chilean Embassy.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Brazil Backing Computer Imports

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, July 8

 BODY:
The office of an American multinational company here recently received a knock on the door of the sort dreaded by business executives across Brazil: it was the computer police.
''They went wild when they saw 'Made in Taiwan,' '' recalled the American representative of the company, who insisted that he be identified only by his first name, John. ''They threatened to call a van and take away our fax and our word processors.''
Such scenes may soon be a thing of the past as Brazil, the world's sixth largest computer market, drops tariffs and liberalizes its economy. To make Brazilian industry more competitive and to fight inflation by making goods less expensive, the new Government of President Fernando Collor de Mello plans to do away with protectionist legislation gradually. 
 
Booming PC Market
During the 1980's, such laws hindered joint ventures with foreign computer manufacturers, tightly restricted imports and made this booming personal computer market the largest in the third world and the lucrative preserve of domestic manufacturers.
''We are effectively very backward because of this senseless nationalism,'' Zelia Cardoso de Mello, the Economy Minister, said Tuesday about Brazil's computer restrictions. ''We will be more pragmatic in this area, more open to foreign capital, to imports and to joint ventures.
''The computer problem effectively blocked Brazilian industry from modernizing,'' Miss Cardoso told Brazilian reporters last week. ''It does not make any sense to retain this cyst, which is the computer market reserve.''
Next month, the Government is to send Congress a bill to phase out gradually the controls on imports and on joint ventures. But the domestic computer industry, which employs 60,000 people, is expected to ally with nationalist lawmakers to fight the opening of the market.
''We are opening in exchange for nothing,'' Fernando Gasparian, a Sao Paulo deputy, said Thursday. ''An opening could kill our computer industry.''
To date, the only concrete step by the Goverment occurred two weeks ago, when it removed a $960 million limit on 1990 computer imports. Last year, the 31 multinational computer companies here had revenues including imports of $1.5 billion. In contrast, Brazil's 324 domestic computer industry companies had revenues last year of $3.6 billion.
The law cost Brazilian consumers about $600 million a year because of higher domestic manufacturing costs, said Jose Goldemberg, Secretary of Science and Technology.
 
Lag in Competitiveness
The new Government, which took power on March 15, has also been spurred by studies that indicate that during the 1980's, Brazil's industry lagged behind many major nations of the third world in terms of competitiveness.
In the late 1980's, computer controls became the single largest trade dispute between Brazil and the United States. After investigating Brazil's Informatics Law for ''unfair trade practices,'' the Reagan Administration imposed punitive tariffs on a series of Brazilian exports in 1987.
The tariffs were lifted last week after Robert A. Mosbacher, the United States Commerce Secretary, visited here. Mr. Mosbacher praised Brazil's ''ambitious program of open markets.''
The mood these days is a far cry from that of 1984, when Brazil's Congress overwhelmingly voted to reserve the market for micro- and minicomputers for national manufacturers for eight years. Sovereignty and national security were the bywords of an odd, if effective, alliance forged among the military, left-wing nationalists and businesses seeking protection from international competition.
In 1986, Jose Sarney, then the President, declared computer restrictions ''fundamental for our survival as a sovereign nation.''
In this nationalist environment, the computer police - actually treasury agents - started zealously enforcing restrictions.
Last year, police seized 20 Apple and Macintosh computers from classrooms at the American School in Brasilia. In May, Federal police conducting an anti-hijacking search of passengers on the Rio-Sao Paulo air shuttle detained one man carrying a Japanese laptop. Last week, Federal police near Brazil's border with Argentina seized a van loaded with fax machines, computers, computer parts and televisions.
 
Incentives to Smuggle
The incentive to smuggle is great. In the United States, a facsimile machine can be bought for $600; its Brazilian-made equivalent costs $4,000. Brazilian personal computers, often made of pirated technology, generally cost double the international prices of their foreign equivalents.
After six years of limited access to the world computer revolution, Brazilian public opinion is increasingly skeptical about the high domestic prices and about Brazil's ability to match computer research and development going on overseas. Manoel F. Thompson Motta, vice president of the Brazilian Association for the Development of the Capital Goods Industry, complained in a speech two weeks ago about how Brazilian computers were ''excessively expensive and technologically out of date when compared to their foreign equivalents.''
''This factor blocks increased competitiveness of Brazilian products in the foreign market,'' Mr. Motta said.
 
Relaxed Regulations
Even without new legislation, growing complaints have forced greater flexibility from the Special Informatics Secretariat, a high court of computer affairs. In the last six months, the secretariat has allowed three American companies - the International Business Machines Corporation, the Hewlett-Packard Company and the Digital Equipment Corporation - to enter into joint ventures with Brazilian manufacturers.
After a battle with the United States over the Microsoft Corporation's right to sell software here, a law went into effect in 1988 extending copyright protection to software. The Government is now discussing allowing foreign companies to distribute software here.
And in modern offices where secretaries look through door peepholes to check for computer inspectors, there is growing optimism.
''I think we are cooked on the fax, but we can keep the word processors,'' John said after the raid by the computer police. ''They are going around heavily this month because they know their time is running out.''

HEADLINE: Each Country's Agenda at the Economic Summit Meeting

 BODY:
UNITED STATES
A key aim of the Americans will be to persuade industrial parnters, especially the Europeans, to phase out trade-distorting farm subsidies and import quotas. The agricultural dispute threatens to scuttle the four-year-old Uruguay Round of negotiations to liberalize the world trading system under the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Bush Administration will oppose giving direct financial aid to Moscow, until there is geniune evidence of economic change in the Soviet union. The United States will also resist efforts to set a timetable for reducing emissionsof carbon dioxide and other gases. 
JAPAN
The Japanese will push for a resumption of loans and aid to China. Tokyo argues that continuing the economic sanctions against Beijing, which came after the massacre of striking students around Tiananmen Square last year, will only make the Chinese leadership increasingly isolated. Japan opposes direct aid to Moscow, because of the long-running territorial issue of four northern islands, which the Soviets have occupied since the last days of World War II. Tokyo will also try to resist dropping import curbs that protect its rice farmers.
WEST GERMANY
Financial support to the Soviet Union is at the top of the German agenda. It is pushing for a Western aid package for the faltering Soviet economy of up to $20 billion. Bonn hopes financial aid to the Soviets will ease Moscow's qualms about German political unification. On the environment, Bonn will press for curbs on emission sof carbon dioxide and other gases, along the lines of its commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions some 25 percent by 2005.
FRANCE
The French, like the Germans, will push for emergency aid to the Soviet Union. The Mitterrand Government is also seeking support from its industrial partners to offer debtr relief for a broad range of developing nations. The French will resist the American push to lower subsidies and import curbs that protect European farmers. And France will seek a new commitment on the environment urging reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide.
BRITAIN
The British expect the drive for a Western pledge of financial aid for the Soviet Union to be the key issue. Like the Americans, the British will resist. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher believes the West should first offer Moscow economic and technical advice on how to build a market economy before it gives President Mikhail S. Gorbachev money. Mrs. Thatcher has been somehwat subdued in international gatherings recently, partly because of her lagging popular support and economic difficulties at home, where inflation and interest rates are high.
ITALY
Italy is concerned that financing developing nations will suffer in the rush to help Eastern Europe. The Italians, like the French, will push for a commitment to new financing arrangements for less-developed nations, especially so-called middle-income developing countries. Rome does support aid for the Soviet Union, especially since Rome's trade ties with Moscow are expanding.
CANADA
On the key issue of assistance to the Soviet Union, Canada shares the cautious stance of the United States, Japan and Britain. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will use the summit meeting to try to assure his industrial partners that the recent consitutional crisis over the status of Quebec will not cripple Canada and that its economy remains sound and attractive to foreign investment. Canada also supports the American initiative to deal with the farm-subsidy issue in an effort to further open up world trade.

HEADLINE: Sandinista Protests Turn Violent; 4 Are Reported Killed in Managua

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, July 9

 BODY:
A faltering strike by Sandinista-led Government employees abruptly turned into a violent political showdown today as Sandinista workers and students built barricades and burned vehicles at major intersections throughout the capital, bringing it to a standstill.
Anti-Sandinista crowds, armed with sticks, machetes and firearms, reacted by attacking several workplaces occupied by the strikers, forcing riot police officers to intervene with clubs and tear gas. Hospitals reported that at least 4 men were killed by gunfire and that 42 people were injured in the violence.
In the course of the day, Sandinista-led workers expanded their shutdown of vital services, cutting off phone and power lines, occupying state-run radio and television stations, closing the national airport and border crossings, and blocking all major arteries in and out of the lakeside capital. 
 
Newspaper Is Blockaded
The major pro-Government newspaper, La Prensa, which is owned by the family of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, was surrounded by a crowd of armed Sandinista supporters, who prevented workers from entering. Outlying cities like Leon, in the north, were also paralyzed by Sandinista protests.
In an emergency address to the nation tonight, President Chamorro assailed the barricades as an ''unconstitutional subversion of public order'' and appealed for calm. She said she had ordered the army, which is still led by many Sandinistas, and the police to clear the streets of all obstacles.
But as Mrs. Chamorro spoke, strikers worked by the light of bonfires on blacked-out city streets to build new barricades, and there was no clear indication of how the Government, which broke off talks with the striking unions on Friday, intended to address what has now become the most serious crisis in its 10 weeks of power.
In a statement late today, the Sandinista leader, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, blamed Government economic policies for the strike and asserted that his party was making every effort to resolve the crisis. He accused ''extremist supporters'' of Mrs. Chamorro and warned against any Government attempts to break the strike.
''This conflict cannot be resolved by force,'' Mr. Ortega declared. ''Any such attempt would be an invitation to general chaos.''
 
Strikers' Demands Are Broad
In the past, the Government has shown itself willing to grant wage concessions to the striking Sandinista unions, but negotiations in the present strike have been made more difficult by the scope of the strikers' demands. These range from concessions on transportation fares to full participation in Government budgetary decisions. [In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman, Sandra McCarty, described the strike as politically motivated. ''Nicaragua desperately needs a breathing space to get economic reconstruction under way, but the Sandinistas appear determined not to allow that space,'' she said.
''They are putting their own political interests ahead of Nicaragua's recovery.''] Since defeating Mr. Ortega in elections on Feb. 25, Mrs. Chamorro has made conspicuous efforts to avoid an outright confrontation with the Sandinista leadership over political power. She has dealt gingerly with previous Sandinista job actions, and allowed a chief architect of Sandinista rule, Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, Daniel's brother, to remain as her highest-ranking military officer.
But the Government has been kept off-balance by continued high inflation and economic crises, which have inflamed political tensions and drawn it into deepening conflict with Sandinista-led unions that dominate the Government work force.
The present strike, which has been publicly endorsed by former President Ortega and other senior Sandinista political leaders, is the second major work stoppage brought against Mrs. Chamorro's Government. The first, in mid-May, ended in broad Government concessions after a weeklong standoff in which public transportation, telephone service and other key Government sectors were paralyzed.
Although neither strike has appeared to enjoy wide public support, unhappiness over the inconvenience caused by the first walkout diminished the force of the present strike when it began in scattered ministries and Government-owned industries a week ago. That weak response is believed to have encouraged a firm stand by the Government, which declared the strike illegal and, on Friday, announced that public employees who did not return to work this morning would be subject to dismissal.
Reacting to that announcement, Sandinista workers and student groups began scattered protests over the weekend. On Sunday night, coordinated groups of armed men and women seized dozens of intersections and key traffic points throughout the city, setting fire to mounds of tires and building barricades to stop transportation.
 
Barricades Reminiscent of '79
This morning, smoke from the burning tires created a caustic haze at intersection after intersection where bands of well-organized Sandinista youths and workers were reinforcing the distinctive paving-stone barriers, which became famous during the 1979 Sandinista revolution against the former dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
The barricades are built from octagonal paving stones that were once made by a factory owned by the Somoza family, and have long been a symbol of Sandinista heroism. A drawing of such a barricade appears in the logotype of the official Sandinista party newspaper, Barricada, which is named in honor of the fortifications.
Consciously evoking images of the revolution, many strikers wore red-and-black Sandinista kerchiefs across their faces to hide their identities, and assembled makeshift collections of weapons, from pistols to knives to iron rods with grips fashioned from electrical tape.
 
Strikers Rigidly Organized
At most barricades, the strikers were rigidly organized, with leaders wearing armbands and demanding identification documents from approaching journalists and other outsiders, just as Sandinista guerrillas did when they were a clandestine insurgent force a decade ago.
They appeared to have provoked an almost immediate reaction from pro-Government Nicaraguans in many neighborhoods as anti-Sandinista crowds formed to assault and dismantle the roadblocks. Fighting was particularly heavy on the road to the Managua Airport, east of the capital, where at least one man was killed by gunfire. But in several areas, the anti-Sandinista crowd succeeded in removing the obstacles and repairing the roads.
At several points, riot troops were called in to separate the factions. The troops, trained and equipped under the Sandinista Government, appeared to obey orders and maintain rigid discipline. But in most cases they limited themselves to halting the violence, and appeared under orders not to intervene on one side or the other.

HEADLINE: THE HOUSTON SUMMIT;
U.S. PUSHES TO END FARMING SUBSIDIES

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 9

 BODY:
The leaders of the seven richest Western nations began their 16th annual summit conference in the tropical heat of Houston this afternoon, with an intractable dispute over trade policy threatening to disrupt the unity of the three-day meeting.
At an opening ceremony punctuated by the thunder of howitzers and a brassy chorus of national anthems, President Bush asserted that ''a new world of freedom lays before us'' and urged his summit partners to join him in insuring that it becomes ''a world where peace endures, where commerce has conscience and where all that seems possible is possible.''
But offstage the United States, supported by Canada, was fighting hard to break down European resistance to Mr. Bush's proposals for the eventual elimination of agricultural subsidies, which he sees as a major threat to free trade. 
The environment also proved a disruptive topic, one on which the United States appeared to be isolated. The Europeans accused the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, of blocking any effort for an accord on how to combat global warming. Only a year ago, in Paris, the environment was the dominant topic, but here it has been shoved from center stage. [Page A10.] On the issue of eliminating farm subsidies, American officials threatened that Washington would walk out of the current round of international trade negotiations, effectively bringing it to an end, unless the Europeans committed themselves here, in specific language in the communique to be issued at the end of the summit meeting, to negotiate in good faith on an agreed timetable.
According to key negotiators for three countries, the dispute led to the exchange of unusually bitter words between Mr. Bush and Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community, on Sunday night.
In discussing the elimination of farm subsidies, Mr. Sununu said: ''It is crucial. It is critical. It should and must be done now.''
Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said of the European nations: ''They simply have not been engaged in the process. We cannot negotiate with ourselves.'' The subsidies make it difficult for food items produced cheaply in countries like the United States and Australia and in the third world to penetrate major markets.
 
'Farmers Would Go Bust'
Guy Legras, the director-general of agriculture of the European Community, said that Europeans were willing to negotiate, however much the Americans might insist that they were not. But he argued that any elimination of subsidies, however gradual, would create such price fluctuations that ''the farmers would go bust.''
Bill Brock, a former special trade representative in the Reagan administration who is here in an unofficial capacity, painted the direst picture, predicting that not only the United States but all the world's underdeveloped countries would walk out of the trade negotiations if farm subsidies were not ended ''because they have nothing else to sell but agricultural products.'' The result of such a walkout, he said, would be ''rampant protectionism and economic decline.''
The negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round, began more than four years ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay, under the auspices of the 105-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The next meeting is scheduled for Geneva on July 23, and the round is due to be completed during the first week in December at talks in Brussels.
Aid to the Soviet Union appeared to be receding as a potentially disruptive issue at the summit meeting, with Mr. Bush, President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany agreeing in effect to disagree, and each country offering a different kind of aid for its own domestic political reasons without criticizing the other. Mr. Sununu, speaking at a pre-summit briefing earlier today, said the United States continued to oppose huge direct financial aid, like the $15 billion proposed by Mr. Kohl, but would favor sending teams of experts to work on such problems as grain storage, the banking structure, transportation and other items.
''The approach is one in which we understand that others may have a different sequence of decisions and timing of decisions to be made,'' Mr. Sununu said.
According to members of the Canadian delegation, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney suggested that the summit nations send a team to the Soviet Union to evaluate the scope of that nation's economic needs. Mr. Bush, whose aides have said he was eager to help President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in ways that would not involve sending direct aid, appears to have taken up the idea with some enthusiasm.
After a rodeo Sunday night, several meetings between pairs of leaders and other preliminary events, the summit conference began shortly after noon with the opening ceremonies. Mr. Kohl, Mr. Mitterrand and Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy arrived only this morning, Mr. Kohl and Mr. Andreotti having stayed in Rome for Sunday's World Cup final in which West Germany defeated Argentina by 1 to 0. Mr. Bush, the man of all sports, congratulated Mr. Kohl and informed the somewhat incredulous German that he had played intercollegiate soccer for Yale University in 1945.
 
First Meeting for Kaifu
The late arrivals, along with Mr. Delors, Mr. Mulroney, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, attending his first such meeting, were greeted by President Bush in the Academic Quadrangle at Rice University. The temperature was near 100 degrees as they stood on a covered platform in front of Lovett Hall, the Romanesque revival administration building designed by Ralph Adams Cram and built in 1912. Air conditioners had been built into the platform's floor to afford a measure of relief.
Mr. Bush, in his chattiest form, had a word or two in German for Chancellor Kohl and a phrase or two in French for President Mitterrand as they moved inside, into the building's Founders Room, for their first working session, which lasted about two hours. The leaders sat around a huge oval desk, wearing headphones for simultaneous translations.
After Mr. Bush outlined the main topics facing the conference, he urged his guests to speak their minds freely and frankly, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said. Those presentations occupied most of the session, the spokesman said, and ''demonstrated that there are differences, to be sure.''
 
Warning From Thatcher
Mrs. Thatcher was said by British officials to have been particularly pointed in warning against the emergence of three trade blocs - Europe, the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific - which, she warned, would be ''a step backward'' and ''politically stifling.''
Tonight, all the leaders attended a working dinner at Bayou Bend, once the home of a philanthropist, Ima Hogg, and now a museum of American decorative arts. The food, which included tortilla soup and grilled red snapper with basil lime sauce, was prepared by three of the region's premier chefs: Robert Del Grande of Cafe Annie and Robert McGrath of the Four Seasons Hotel, both in Houston, and Dean Fearing of the Mansion on Turtle Creek, in Dallas.
A senior member of the Italian delegation said that talk at the dinner, which was dominated by discussion of aid to the Soviet Union, had centered on a new proposal by the United States. Outlined by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, the proposal sought to establish some common ground between the United States on one hand and France and West Germany on the other.
Negotiators for the seven nations went into session just before midnight to explore the possibilities of a compromise based on the Baker paper.
The United States had sought all day, in a series of public briefings and background conversations, to keep the pressure on the Europeans on the issue of agricultural subsidies. But by the end of the day, David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said there had been ''no progress in closing the gap.''
The most intransigent of the Europeans was said to be Mr. Kohl. On a continent with generally inefficient agriculture, the West Germans have the poorest agriculture. Small farms dependent upon subsidies are especially predominant in Bavaria, an area crucial to Mr. Kohl's electoral coalition. He faces elections on Dec. 2, just when the final meetings of the Uruguay round are due to be taking place in Brussels.
American officials took some pains to indicate that they were ''not naive enough,'' as one put it, to expect a detailed settlement here. But they said they needed a firm agreement on a timetable or Congressional pressure for protectionist legislation would soon resume.
Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said that success in the trade talks would provide the world with ''an economic renaissance for the 21st century.'' Failure, she asserted, would mean that ''the world will have a dangerous decline in economic prosperity.''

HEADLINE: New York Is Reportedly Chosen For '92 Democratic Convention

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

 BODY:
The Democratic Party will hold its 1992 Presidential convention at Madison Square Garden, Democrats in New York and Washington said yesterday.
The Democratic chairman, Ronald H. Brown, has made the final selection between New York and New Orleans, the two remaining competitors, and is to announce his decision officially tomorrow, his spokeswoman, Ginny Terzanno, said.
Various officials said Mr. Brown had decided to take the party back to New York, his hometown and the site of the Democratic conventions that nominated the party's last President, Jimmy Carter, in 1976, and the last incumbent President to be defeated, Jimmy Carter, in 1980.
New York's quest for the convention was bolstered in the last few days by the Louisiana Legislature, which passed the strictest anti-abortion law in the country and set off protests from many Democrats against having the convention in New Orleans. 
Mr. Brown said in an interview a few days ago that the abortion dispute would be a factor in his decision. But many Democrats said they also felt that he had personally favored New York all along.
The decision was a victory for Mr. Brown's close friend Mayor David N. Dinkins, who lobbied vigorously for the convention. Mr. Dinkins had traveled to Indianapolis at one point to buttonhole party officials at a national meeting and sent a videotape on the joys of New York to every Democratic state chairman.
 
Celebration Set for Tomorrow
Mr. Dinkins also made great inroads with his argument that a convention in New York would be far more effective than one in New Orleans in raising money for the party.
City Hall officials said that they had not been officially notified of the decision, but that they were confident of the results. They are planning a celebration tomorrow for the announcement.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has been invited to the celebration. But a mayoral aide said City Hall hoped that he would not attend, to avoid any impression that the New York convention might serve as a platform for whatever Presidential ambitions Mr. Cuomo may harbor.
Although the political effect of holding the convention in New York is difficult to predict two years in advance, city officials have not been shy about predicting its economic impact. Aides to Mr. Dinkins said the convention could mean $100 million in spending in the city, as well as adding gleam to its image.
''We're very, very happy,'' a vice president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, Jack MacBean, said. ''It's not only a great prestige item for the city. The other conventions brought a great deal of publicity to New York City. At the last convention in 1980, the Texas delegation unfurled a banner that said, 'Texas Loves New York.'
''The publicity is of incalculable value. It focuses attention on New York City for months and even years to come. It's not necessarily the largest convention to come to New York City. But no other convention is covered extensively as this.''
Indeed, the main purpose of the modern political convention is to generate television coverage.
Although concerns have been expressed in both parties that New York would be a difficult place logistically to run a modern convention, Mr. Brown has repeatedly said he was confident that the Garden, far smaller than the Superdome in New Orleans, would be adequate for the crush of broadcasters and newspaper reporters, a group that has grown far larger than it was at the 1980 convention.
 
Negotiations on Dates
The city has promised to spend just over $20 million on construction at the Garden and on police protection outside, among other activities. Twenty thousand hotel rooms have been set aside for the convention.
The 1976 convention generated $20 million in economic activity and the 1980 convention $30 million, according to the Mayor's office. The 1984 convention in San Francisco generated $55 million and the 1988 meeting in Atlanta totaled $70 million.
The 1992 convention will be in mid-July. The exact dates depend in part on discussions about revising its basic format. The Democrats are considering cutting the convention to three days or holding it over the weekend, to counter complaints from the television networks that the convention does not deserve days of prime-time coverage.
Many Democrats have said they believed that from the outset Mr. Brown wanted to have the convention in New York as a gesture toward Mr. Dinkins, who as a district leader in Harlem was a friend of Mr. Brown and his late father, manager of the historic Hotel Theresa on 125th Street.
In the closing days of negotiations, New Orleans was dealt a severe blow when the Louisiana Legislature passed the strictest anti-abortion measure in the country. Gov. Buddy Roemer vetoed one version. He was sent another on Sunday night.
 
'Some Other Dynamics'
Supporters of abortion rights argued that the Democrats should hardly go to a state with such strong anti-abortion attitudes when the party was stressing its support for abortion rights as an important issue that distinguishes Democrats from Republicans.
''We know what New Orleans has to offer,'' a spokeswoman for that city, Jinx Brusard, said. ''We also know there are some other dynamics that are involved.''
Ms. Brusard cited the belief among top Democrats that they could raise more money in New York than in New Orleans and that there was ''a bit of concern regarding what has been happening in our State Legislature.''
Some Democrats, particularly those of a conservative bent, had expressed concern that New York, with its image of crime and racial strife, might not be an ideal site for the convention either. Bruce Reed, policy director of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that tries to steer the party to what it calls the mainstream, said:
''The important question for 1992 is what kind of candidate does the Democratic Party nominate, not which city does the honors. Atlanta couldn't save our last nominee. New York is not going to do in our next one.''
The head of the Hotel Association of New York City, Joseph E. Spinnato, said the decision would be a particular help for the hotel business in the city, because the State Legislature has recently increased by 5 percentage points the tax on most hotel rooms.
''Now the tax rate is 20.5 percent,'' Mr. Spinnato said. ''This could have had an impact on the Democratic National Convention and on other conventions. Other cities have a lot to offer at inexpensive rates.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
51 Albanians Fly to Prague and Quickly Receive Political Asylum

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Tuesday, July 10

 BODY:
Fifty-one Albanians who had sought refuge in the Czechoslovak Embassy in Tirana, the Albanian capital, were flown to Prague early this morning, where they were granted political asylum, officials here and in Tirana said.
The 51 are among an estimated 6,000 Albanians who have crowded into about a dozen Western embassies in Tirana in recent weeks seeking to flee Eastern Europe's last Stalinist Government. They are the first of those seeking refuge to leave the country.
Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry officials said late Monday that the 51 Albanians in the embassy in Tirana had been issued passports and had left the country. Albania has promised that all those now in foreign embassies would be given passports. 
The Prague Government sent a Tupolev-154 jet used by President Vaclav Havel to pick up the refugees - 49 men and 2 women.
The Czechoslovak Deputy Foreign Minister, Vojtech Wagner, said that clothing and some money were secured for the emigrants, the official press agency reported.
On arrival here, the Albanians walked briskly down the steps of the plane. Most of them appeared to be in their early 20's and wore casual dress like short-sleeved shirts or T-shirts. The first man to disembark carried a picture of President Havel.
The Albanians answered no questions posed by journalists. They boarded a bus provided by the Government, to be driven to Government-supplied accommodations.
Mr. Wagner indicated that he thought most would not stay long. ''What will happen later on cannot be said, because with the exception of two of them, all want to go somewhere else,'' the agency quoted him as saying. Most of the Albanians are expected to seek entry to Australia, the United States or West European countries. [In Washington, a State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said he had no information about requests for travel to the United States and had no comment on what American policy would be on such requests, The Associated Press reported. There is no United States Embassy in Tirana.] Those seeking asylum, some dodging police bullets, began taking refuge on June 28. The Albanian authorities pledged on Saturday that they would receive travel papers.
 
Beginnings of Change
Albania's Communist leader, Ramiz Alia, has begun this year to institute some cautious economic changes in an attempt to alleviate shortages and raise the standard of living by creating incentives for workers and farmers.
For 45 years, travel out of Albania has been virtually impossible. But Albanian leaders have sought better ties abroad since 1985, and they recently began to carry out reforms.
A package of new regulations that took effect last Tuesday entitles all Albanians over the age of 16 to have passports.
About 3,000 of those seeking asylum have been on the grounds of the West German Embassy in Tirana.
Hanns Schumacher, spokesman for the West German Foreign Ministry, said in Bonn that a United Nations envoy was representing the West German, Italian, French and Greek embassies in talks with the Tirana Government.
In addition to those Albanians in the Czechoslovak, West German, Hungarian and French embassies, about 1,000 are in the Italian Embassy and 30 are in the Greek Embassy.
Western officials have complained that the Albanian authorities have not granted them permission to fly in badly needed supplies to care for the refugees. But the embassy is badly overcrowded, with the emigrants sleeping in corridors and a garden, in conditions described by diplomats as deteriorating.
The French Foreign Ministry in Paris said that the formalities of obtaining passports for the 550 refugees at its embassy in Tirana were moving rapidly and that ''we hope they will be finished by the end of the day.''

HEADLINE: THE HOUSTON SUMMIT;
Europeans Accuse the U.S. of Balking on Plans to Combat Global Warming

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 9

 BODY:
Senior European officials at the economic summit conference accused the United States today of frustrating their efforts to reach a new accord to combat global warming.
The European officials, including members of the British, French and Italian delegations who asked not to be identified, angrily complained that John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, had taken the leading role in organizing American opposition to the global warming initiative.
Asked at a news briefing this morning why the United States was resisting a West German proposal to set a target for reducing gases that cause global warming, Mr. Sununu replied, ''The issue is being addressed with a level of haste.'' He added, ''There seems to be some propensity to deal with the issue without putting all the data on the table.'' 
In a letter sent to summit leaders last month, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany called for ''internationally binding regulations with ''radical measures to limit'' gas emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect.
Chancellor Kohl said: ''We must view the threat of climate change as a global challenge to all mankind. The world expects the seven summit countries to come up with far-reaching, specific proposals.''
Mr. Sununu insisted today that the Bush Administration had endorsed limits on some emissions through the Clean Air Act, but he opposed new emission limits, contending that they would require major changes in the American way of life and the nation's industrial structure.
He noted, for instance, that because the United States was much larger than Japan or any of the European nations it had a greater reliance on cars and trucks to transport people and products.
Commenting on Mr. Sununu's position, James T. B. Tripp, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund, a Washington-based advocacy group, said, ''These statements may serve to explain why United States per capita consumption of fossil fuels is so high compared to Western Europe and Japan, but they are not legitimate excuses for United States refusal to limit carbon dioxide emissions and take steps to use energy much more efficiently.''
Although President Bush has mustered allies to support his views on the two other major issues being addressed at the summit talks - aid to the Soviet Union and international trade - he now stands alone on the third area of the agenda, the environment.
As the summit meeting's official sessions began today, European officials worried that the United States would block their effort to win a commitment to stabilize and then reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. Many scientists believe that these gases trap heat from the sun that would otherwise escape back into space. The trapped gases then produce a gradual warming of the earth's atmosphere.
 
Pledges Made by Others
Except for the United States, all the industrial nations represented at the summit meeting have now pledged to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions, at least by early in the next century.
Even Britain and Japan, which formerly sided with Washington in insisting that more scientific and economic information was needed before taking action, are developing plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. West Germany has taken the lead, with a goal of reducing such emissions by 25 percent in the next 15 years.
President Bush's apparent determination to block a global warming initiative at this summit meeting stands in sharp contrast to his embrace of major environmental commitments at last year's economic summit talks in Paris.
In the final communique of that meeting, the national leaders declared that ''decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect the earth's ecological balance.''
On the issue of global warming the communique stated, ''We strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threaten to induce climate change, endangering the environment and ultimately the economy.''
Even as the summit delegations began gathering here this weekend, European officials hoped that the Houston talks would build on the rhetoric of the Paris communique. But at a meeting Sunday night American officials raised a series of paralyzing objections, a European participant said.
''We had thought we were making progress,'' the European official said today, ''but at last night's meeting it was discouragingly obvious that Sununu was back in the ascendancy, and the United States was yielding nothing.''
European officials said that the first sign that President Bush would resist a global warming initiative came when William K. Reilly, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was left behind in Washington. Mr. Reilly was a prominent member of the Bush delegation to the Paris talks.
In Mr. Reilly's absence the role of chief adviser on environmental matters has been assumed by Mr. Sununu, who has publicly disagreed with Mr. Reilly on assessments of environmental dangers. At the news briefing this morning, Mr. Sununu rejected the kind of joint commitment to specific limitations on gas emissions that the West Germans among others are pressing the meeting to adopt.
He said, ''There is a concern that this idea of a permanent cap in perpetuity does not understand not only our growth needs, but the growth needs of the developing countries of the world.''
He added, ''So what we are seeking is a commitment that is broader, a commitment that would allow both the industrialized countries and the developing countries to address the broad issue of greenhouse gases without picking them one by one, setting caps on them individually.''

HEADLINE: Americans Voicing Anxiety on Japan As Concern in Tokyo Seems to Soften

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

 BODY:
The American public's concern over the economic might of Japan appears to have risen sharply, heightening sentiment for limits on foreign investments, as Americans worry more about Japanese economic power than about Soviet military power.
This surge in anxiety is occurring even as Japanese attitudes toward the United States, while tinged with resentment, appear to be softening somewhat on trade issues.
The findings are the results of a matched pair of public opinion polls conducted in the United States by the New York Times and CBS News and in Japan by the Tokyo Broadcasting System.
The surveys revealed the complex and ambivalent domestic attitudes that both President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu must contend with as they try to manage what many analysts now describe as each country's most important bilateral relationship.
 
Pointing at Each Other
While leaders from seven industrialized nations are seated at the economic summit table in Houston this week, Americans and Japanese point squarely at each other in the public opinion surveys when asked to identify their country's strongest competitor. 
Substantial majorities in both countries continue to express friendly attitudes toward the other. Indeed, the 75 percent of Americans who say their overall feelings toward Japan are generally friendly represents a slight rise from the 67 percent registered in January. Sixty-six percent of Japanese said their current feelings toward the United States were generally friendly, also a slight rise from the 57 percent measured a year ago, when that question was last asked in Japan.
Yet this generally friendly attitude coexists with increasing anxieties in the United States, particularly about economics, and bad feelings in both countries that seem largely cultural.
 
Attitudes on Investment
Sixty-four percent of Americans, up from 45 percent in 1987, now say that investment by the Japanese in the United States poses a threat to American economic independence. Sixty-one percent favor restrictions on foreign investments in American real estate, up from 53 percent in a May 1988 CBS News poll.
Americans do not find European investment nearly as disturbing, the survey found. even though there is more of it. Only 37 percent of Americans said they thought that increasing European investment was a threat.
This disparity has led some Japanese to perceive racism in America's reaction to Japan's trading success. Seven of ten Japanese in the current survey said they thought Americans looked down on them. Nearly half of the Americans said they thought Japanese looked down on Americans.
Tetsuya Tsukushi, anchor for TBS in Tokyo, said he and his colleagues were struck by the ambivalence in American attitudes.
''We are a little bit surprised so many people do not want to have Japanese investment,'' he said in a telephone interview from Tokyo after broadcasting the poll results last night. ''It's much more of a protectionist flavor. At the same time, much more than we expected, Americans have high regard for Japanese ability and Japanese people.''
Attitudes among the Japanese were similarly complex, he said, comparing the relationship between the two countries to a marriage. ''They cannot divorce because of mutual interest,'' he said. ''The question is what kind of marriage will continue. Which is the husband and which is the wife?'' This, he said, was an analogy that would make more sense to the Japanese, where marriage is not thought of as quite the ''equal partnership'' many Americans say it is.
The poll in the United States was conducted among 1,084 Americans reached by telephone from June 5 to June 8. In Japan, 1,468 people were interviewed in person from May 31 to June 7. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points for each poll.
 
Less Fear of Moscow
Many of the same questions were asked in both countries. Asked to identify their own country's strongest competitor, 57 percent of Japanese picked the United States and 58 percent of Americans picked Japan.
Among Americans, the second most often mentioned country was the Soviet Union, cited by 19 percent. A separate question showed that, by 58 to 26 percent, Americans now view the economic power of Japan as a greater threat to American security than the military power of the Soviet Union. Only a year and a half ago, a Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 50 percent of Americans saw the Soviet Union as the greater threat, while 44 percent at that time cited Japan. Subsequent Post/ABC News polls showed that Japan had emerged as the greater perceived threat by the beginning of 1990.
Among the Japanese, West Germany and South Korea were cited next most often as Japan's chief competitor, picked by 6 percent each.
American optimism has clearly declined. In a CBS News Poll a year ago, 47 percent of Americans said the United States would be the No. 1 economic power in the next century and 38 percent picked Japan. But in the current survey 50 percent of Americans picked Japan and 32 percent picked the United States.
But this was not matched by a rise in Japanese confidence, according to Tokyo Broadcasting System polls. Forty-five percent of the Japanese picked Japan a year ago to be the No. 1 power of the next century, and that declined to 39 percent in the current survey. Forty-two percent of Japanese said the United States would be the No. 1 power, statistically unchanged from the 40 percent who said that last year.
Protectionist sentiment was clearly evident in the United States. One of four Americans said they thought the United States should restrict Japanesse goods ''a great deal.''
By contrast, only 3 percent of Japanese said the same about American goods. Indeed, the Japanese attitude toward American trade seemed generally to have softened somewhat. In 1987, a time of intense complaint in the United States about Japanese products, 77 percent of the Japanese said America was blaming Japan for its own economic problems and only 16 percent said Japanese companies were competing unfairly.
But in the latest survey, the number of Japanese who said their country was being blamed for America's economic problems declined to 68 percent and the number who agreed that Japanese companies compete unfairly rose to 26 percent.
Sharp differences remain in the views of the two nations' people. For example, asked if the Japanese Government had made enough of an effort to correct the trade imbalance with the United States, 10 percent of Americans and 63 percent of Japanese said it had. Fifty-two percent of Americans and 61 percent of Japanese say no when asked if the cold war is over.
Prime Minister Kaifu said before his arrival at the economic summit meeting in Houston that he opposed aid to the Soviet Union until the two countries resolve a dispute over four islands the Soviets seized from Japan at the end of World War II.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The New York Times/CBS News/ Tokyo Broadcasting System Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted June 5 to 8 with 1,084 adults throughout the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, and on personal interviews conducted May 31 to June 7 with 1,468 adults throughout Japan.
In the United States the sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted telephone numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and the number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In Japan, the survey was conducted by the Nihon Research Center under supervision of the Tokyo Broadcasting System. Personal interviews were conducted in communities throughout the country to yield a statistically representative sample of the Japanese public.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults, or all adult Japanese.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the polls.

HEADLINE: Thornburgh and Sessions Assailed for Traveling on Confiscated Jets

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
A Congressional report criticizes Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and William S. Sessions, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for their official travel aboard three executive jets seized from drug traffickers.
The report, to be issued Tuesday by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, says the Justice Department failed to determine whether the use of the planes for travel by the two officials was economical.
The report contended that the department should have compared the cost of the planes to commercial flights or other forms of secure air travel, like private air charters, asserting that such a financial analysis is required under Government budget policies.
Spokesmen for Mr. Thornburgh and Mr. Sessions defended the use of the planes on security grounds. The report noted that Justice Department officials had told the accounting office that the Attorney General had received ''numerous threats against his life.'' 
The report does not charge that either official used the planes for unauthorized purposes. But it said Mr. Thornburgh and Mr. Sessions followed different practices in reimbursing the Government for travel on the planes by their family members.
 
F.B.I. Policies Cited
Representative Bob Wise, Democrat of West Virginia, said Friday in a letter to the two officials that he requested the report because the use of the planes appeared to interfere with F.B.I. policies that restrict the use of confiscated planes to ''law-enforcement purposes, including narcotics control and counterterrorism efforts.''
The Government acquired the planes under a program that allows Federal law-enforcement agencies to seize boats, planes and vehicles used in the transportation of drugs. The planes were turned over to the F.B.I., which operates a fleet of 84 aircraft.
The issue of air travel has been a source of irritation in the Justice Department in the past. Shortly after Mr. Thornburgh became Attorney General in August 1988, he cut back on employee travel in a move that seemed intended as a statement of frugality after the heavily criticized travels of Edwin Meese 3d, Mr. Thornburgh's predecessor.
In its review, the accounting office examined flight reports, travel vouchers and other documents to compile a record of travel by Mr. Thornburgh and Mr. Sessions from August 1988 to July 1989. In that period, the two men used the planes for a total of 75 trips. ''Most of their trips were to give speeches, attend meetings or visit field locations,'' the report said.
 
Security Concerns Noted
A Justice Department spokesman noted that the report recognized that security concerns effectively ruled out flights on commercial aircraft. ''The noncommercial flights are used for the personal security of the Attorney General and the F.B.I. Director and for security of documents and communications,'' the spokesman said.
Both the Justice Department and the F.B.I. submitted financial data to the accounting office in May showing that the use of the confiscated planes was cheaper than the use of leased aircraft. The department's analysis showed that the Government saved about $460,000 a year using the seized aircraft.
But the G.A.O. report rejected both comparisons, saying they were incomplete and excluded certain costs. The department has agreed to prepare a fuller financial assessment.
The Attorney General paid the Government $1,032 for himself and his family members on three personal trips. Last April he reimbursed a total of $2,128 for eight trips by his wife on Government aircraft.
Department policies do not require such payments, the report said, noting that Mr. Thornburgh's wife, Ginny, perferred to pay for her travel ''in an exercise of caution and to protect against unfair publicity.''
 
Wife With Sessions on 15 Trips
The F.B.I. Director reimbursed the Government $280 for personal travel aboard the Government planes that he and his wife, Alice, used. A member of the Director's staff said that Mr. Sessions did not use the confiscated planes for private business and that his wife, who joined him on 15 of his trips, only accompanied him in connection with his official business.
Last year Mr. Thornburgh was criticized when he and five aides flew to a legal convention in Honolulu aboard an otherwise empty Government Boeing 727. At the time a Justice Department spokesman defended the flight, saying it was the cheapest that could be made on a Government aircraft that was both available and could make the round-trip flight from San Francisco to Hawaii.
The accounting office did not address the cost of that flight because it took place after the period studied in the report.

HEADLINE: A Summit Challenge: Farm Subsidies

 BODY:
The leaders of the seven major industrialized nations may arrive at decisions in Houston this week that can make or break the present Uruguay Round of multinational trade talks. If they listen to food exporting countries, especially in the third world, they will hear this: Open up markets, or forget about new trade rules on services and intellectual property. That message, so critical to trade and growth, needs to be heard. 
If the Houston summit participants follow the European Community, which offers a vague and not very stringent approach to subsidies, the Uruguay Round will fail. But if they take heed of the U.S. position, that developed countries should end their protectionist farm policies, there's a good chance of a new trade pact, with benefits for almost all.
Disagreements over farm subsidies won't be resolved in Houston. But the leaders can make a crucial start with a ringing declaration to their trade negotiators to phase down farm subsidies.
None of the participants arrived in Houston with clean hands. Japan bars rice imports; the U.S. blocks sugar imports from desperately poor Latin American neighbors. Western Europe, however, is the worst sinner. It protects inefficient farmers by blocking imports and keeping internal prices high. It then dumps the enormous surpluses on foreign markets by subsidizing exports.
This bailout costs European taxpayers and consumers a whopping $100 billion a year. And low-cost third world farmers are wiped out by the influx of artificially cheap European exports and blocked access to Europe's markets. The monumentally wasteful system is testimony to the political power of Europe's 10 million farmers.
The Bush Administration is fighting to turn all this around. Mr. Bush is pressuring Japan and the E.C. to phase out protectionist farm policies. This would hurt protected growers, but help overall U.S. exports. Countries still could provide farmers with income supplements unrelated to production - welfare. But subsidies or any other interference with market prices would end.
The Administration's specific recommendation is to convert protectionist policies into tariffs, which would be phased down. The advantage of tariffs is that they are visible and easily monitored. ''Tariffication'' is how industrialized countries eliminated barriers to trading manufactured goods; it's also the best way to handle farm goods.
The Europeans prefer to work with an ''aggregate measure'' of protectionism, as yet undefined, which they would lower. That would allow them, for example, to reduce some tariffs and raise others. The problem is that an aggregate measure would be hard to interpret and could easily disguise the impact of specific protectionist policies.
The Uruguay Round is beginning to take on the flavor of trade union bargaining. Everyone waits until the midnight deadline to compromise. But delay here could be fatal. The issues are too complicated for a last-minute compromise; and there are scores of countries, each with its own internal constituency, to placate.
The leaders meeting in Houston don't need to resolve all the details. But they do have to stand up to farm blocs and give the orders to make the Uruguay Round succeed.

HEADLINE: Still a Cold War for Aliens

 BODY:
For 38 years, the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act has allowed the U.S. to bar foreign visitors whose ideas the Government finds offensive. The number of visitors kept out each year varies, but the Government maintains a list of more than 350,000 people to be excluded. At a time when world tensions are easing, that's an astounding victory of narrow-mindedness over good sense. 
Passed in 1952, the McCarran-Walter Act reflects the hysteria of the McCarthy era. One of the most troublesome of the law's 33 exclusionary provisions allows the Government to bar visitors or migrants who would advocate ''economic, international and governmental doctrines of world Communism'' and other subversive activities.
Those foreigners deemed inadmissible are put on a ''lookout'' list, formally known as the National Automated Immigration Lookout System, or Nails, and kept by the State Department and Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Last month the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a civil liberties group, received an edited copy of the list under the Freedom of Information Act. Although names and occupations were omitted, the list contained 353,324 entries, of which 238,140 had been added since 1980. Duplication accounts for some inflation in the total, but the Lawyers Committee estimates that at least 300,000 individuals have been denied visas, the vast majority because of their ideological beliefs.
An overhaul of McCarran-Walter is still pending in Congress. But earlier this year, President Bush signed into law a sensible prohibition on excluding visitors solely because of ''past, current or expected beliefs, statements or associations'' that the Constitution protects for American citizens. In practice, however, visitors seeking visas must first declare whether they have, or have ever had, Communist affiliations. Only then may they obtain a waiver for admission.
That undermines the spirit of the new law. If the State Department and the I.N.S. were faithful to that spirit, they would eliminate such background questions. And for those seeking to stay for longer periods, the Government ought to purge the ''lookout'' list on a regular basis. Until the Government thus acknowledges a changing world, McCarran-Walter's fearful ghosts will reign triumphant.

HEADLINE: Make Farm Programs Work as They Should;
For Truly Free Market

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Get Fat Farmers Off Welfare'' (editorial, June 19), which backs the proposals of Representatives Dick Armey of Texas and Charles Schumer of New York to curb the agricultural support program, is commendable. But because the West is encouraging Eastern European countries to adopt a market economy without modifications, perhaps the United States should itself attempt to operate such an unsubsidized economy. There would be no national deficit if we withdrew all agricultural subsidies and endorsed, as national policy, a free market economy.
We subsidize everything from growing tobacco (while we also spend more than a $100 million warning against its health hazards), peanuts, soybeans and sugar to production of milk and withdrawal of land from production. Because most subsidy money goes to agribusiness, rather than to small family farms, little distress and dislocation would be caused.
Perhaps the United States is the model that Mikhail S. Gorbachev has in mind when the Soviet President speaks rather enigmatically of a ''controlled market economy.'' Let us put into effect the ''free market economy'' that we advocate for Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
U.S. Takes the Lead

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Just when the noise level of complaints about lack of American vision in response to the new needs of Europe was reaching screech point, the Bush Administration came up with an impressive new plan.
Despite allied grumbles, it won warm support because it goes a long way toward meeting problems opened by German unification and collapse of the Warsaw Pact. Presumably, resentment at Washington will evaporate as governments get on with remodeling NATO.
Last year's NATO summit meeting produced the same sense of Administration drift, mounting tension and -at the last minute - Bush proposals that brought accord. This time there wasn't even a quick tour by special envoys to brief allied leaders on what was coming in London. There were just letters and phone calls from the President, which made Europeans feel shut out of the preparations. 
Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James Baker like this kind of personal diplomacy, but it has a price. It contributes to fears that the new ''special relationship'' is the Washington-Bonn axis, and that both Britain and France are being left in the cold. The French sniff that the U.S. is foolishly backing any whim of Chancellor Kohl of West Germany, although it is Paris that has been pushing hardest for Mr. Kohl's scheme to buy Moscow's blessing.
President Mitterrand of France didn't want a NATO meeting until late in the year (and there may be another in December) so as to work out what he calls ''the European identity in security affairs.'' It's not clear what he means, but Paris has reversed gears for the time being.
For at least six months, France was edging toward formal involvement with NATO's military structure, which would make it much easier to solve problems of reform. Now, miffed, Mr. Mitterrand is saying France's defense is entirely independent. Further, in tart asides, French officials suggest the U.S. is blocking useful change. ''The Americans always get annoyed when Europe starts to emancipate herself,'' Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said recently.
This kind of jockeying for position and spurts of personal pique are probably to be expected in a period of difficult diplomacy launching a new basis for allied relations. Too bad there wasn't more finesse, but the underlying agreement is solid.
The Europeans want NATO to continue and they want Americans in Europe, even as they also want to offer Mikhail Gorbachev the assurances he says he needs to accept new German arrangements.
There is strong evidence supporting Britain's Foreign Minister, Douglas Hurd, when he said in a newspaper interview, ''I've never known a time when there was less anti-Americanism in Europe, whether in Britain or on the Continent.'' His judgment that ''American engagement is absolutely fundamental to stability'' is widely shared.
The Soviets are coming around to the same view, but it costs them, particularly in Mr. Gorbachev's tense internal politics. There is evident difference between the Foreign Ministry and the military establishment, smarting at Eastern Europe's ''loss.''
Soviet diplomats are aware that they caused some of their own problems, by arguing too insistently that a united Germany in NATO was unacceptable. Now they need a way to back out, and Mr. Bush is providing that. He has wisely said or done nothing to humiliate them.
The grievance of most Soviet officers is not leaving Germany but having no housing, no jobs to go home to. The idea of staying on is not as attractive as the military planners claim. Already there have been attacks on their soldiers, and the East German Defense Minister said some had been disarmed to prevent retaliation, which could lead to grave incidents.
There is a good chance that the new NATO plan can be the keystone for a series of agreements with the East and adjustments in the West to construct the transition Europe needs after the cold war. The long term, the ideal of a workable all-European security pact, isn't the problem now. It is getting there.
After floundering, Washington has produced some sensible and sensitive ideas to carry out Mr. Bush's pledge of going ''beyond containment.'' The proposal to send experts, not just a flood of billions, to help the Soviets make their railroads, their grain storage system, their food distribution work is another example of identifying the critical needs and addressing them. This is the way to proceed, concretely. Leave the grand designs to historians' hindsight. Even with rumpled edges, this is statesmanship.

HEADLINE: Unions Loath To Strike Daily News

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
Six months after the opening of what both sides knew would be difficult contract talks, the 10 unions at The Daily News remain far from a settlement with the management. But in recent weeks, they appear to have won some maneuvering room.
Despite the entry of a Federal mediator in talks involving three important unions, there has been little progress in meeting the proposals of The News for up to $70 million in labor savings, as well as accepting a ''management rights'' provision that would allow the publisher free rein to make huge cuts in staffing and other changes.
The publisher, James Hoge, who ended all union contracts in the spring, has said that only through ''regaining management rights to hire, supervise and assign work'' can the 71-year-old newspaper hope to survive in the competitive tabloid market in New York City.
But the unions, backed by funds and advice from the Washington office of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., have managed to defy their own predictions of a confrontation by July 1, the deadline they asserted that management had set to provoke a strike. 
 
Move by Cuomo Administration
The unions may not have acquired any advantages at the bargaining table, labor leaders say, but they have clearly won additional time to generate some leverage.
The unions' cautious optimism was bolstered last week when the Cuomo administration, alarmed by signs that a major clash might be imminent at The News, began laying the groundwork for a possible state inquiry into the dispute. At the same time, the unions have been talking about organizing an advertising and reader boycott of the paper.
From organized labor's perspective, the stakes are high. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., which recently brought in a veteran labor lawyer from Detroit to help coordinate bargaining strategy and organize the boycott, views the confrontation at The News as a struggle of the same symbolic dimensions as the air-traffic controllers' strike of the early 80's. That walkout was ultimately broken by the Reagan Administration.
George McDonald, president of the mailers' union and head of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella group for the 2,400 full-time union workers at The News, said he was convinced that the unions' tactic of refusing to strike, combined with what may be precedent-setting management setbacks in the Greyhound bus walkout, might have forced The News to rethink the timing, if not the substance, of its strategy.
The unions said they believed that the newspaper's original plan was patterned on past incidents - some at news organizations owned by The News's parent, the Tribune Company of Chicago - in which unions were broken after having been provoked into striking. In the last 10 years, the tactic, used in a variety of industries, has frequently turned the unions' most effective weapon, the strike, into an instrument for their own destruction.
For months, union leaders at The News had asserted that management hoped to provoke a strike no later than July 1, probably by declaring an impasse in the stalled talks and posting new work rules like halving the 410-member complement of pressmen.
The union leadership has had its hands full trying to maintain discipline in the face of potentially provocative actions, including what the unions said were management's deployment of aggressive out-of-town security guards in its three printing plants and the layoffs of scores of workers.
 
Tactic to Provoke
The layoffs, beginning early last month, were for what management said were strictly economic reasons, which are permitted under the terms of some of the contracts that expired on March 30. But union leaders, including Barry Lipton, president of largest union at The News, the 700-member Newspaper Guild unit, asserted that the layoffs were another tactic to provoke, and finance, a walkout.
Spokesmen for The News insisted that there was no master plan for provoking a confrontation.
''The unions' predictions about when we're going to reach impasse have been pretty miserable,'' the chief spokesman for the paper, John T. Sloan, said. ''First it was March 31. Then something was going to happen in April. Then it was Memorial Day. Then Father's Day.''
But people with first-hand knowledge of the management thinking said the strategy called for The News to declare an impasse and impose new work rules no later than June 25.
The company's hope, those people said, was that this would spark a walkout, especially if the new working conditions were posted for traditionally militant unions like the pressmen or the 688 deliverers. That would allow The News to make good on a vow to continue publishing with replacement workers, having shed itself of what it has called financially ruinous union contracts.
 
Finding Against Greyhound
The unions' only real hope in the face of such a move would be a finding by the Federal Government and the courts that The News had not negotiated in good faith before declaring an impasse. The unions' faith in such a possibility was bolstered a few months ago in an incident that labor analysts say could parallel future developments at The News.
Greyhound Lines broke off talks with its 6,300 drivers late last winter and began hiring more than 3,000 permanent replacement workers. In May, the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint that the company's actions constituted an unfair labor practice, a finding that could make Greyhound liable for $13 million in back pay for every month the strike continues.
If such an accusation were made against The News and upheld by the courts, the newspaper would have to pay millions of dollars in back wages, benefits and interest to workers affected by the collapse of contract talks.
Union officials said they hoped they could sustain such a charge against The News because of the broad language of its proposed management-rights clause to set hours and working conditions without bargaining.
''It's their duty under Federal labor law to bargain on wages, hours and working conditions,'' said Theodore W. Kheel, a veteran labor lawyer who is the unions' chief adviser. ''If they say, 'Starting tomorrow we're changing the delivery routes, so we'll have 68 fewer drivers,' without having first bargained in good faith to impasse, then I think they would be committing an unfair labor practice.''
But such a finding, by the labor board, could take years to sustain in court and run up a fortune in legal fees.
''It's a lawyer's dream,'' Mr. Kheel said. ''But still, the Tribune Company has to be concerned, principally in light of the Greyhound experience, that the N.L.R.B. might hold that any such action came without bargaining in good faith on specific items.''
Asked about that, an executive of The News declined to discuss whether the Greyhound case had prompted a re-evaluation of strategy. The executive, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, acknowledged:
''Some have speculated that the unions have done things that we did not anticipate. And there are a lot of rumblings and rumors now that as a result we are looking at other areas such as additional economic layoffs'' that could result from the closing of individual printing presses or even a plant, possibly in Garden City, L.I.
 
'Evaluating Various Options'
''I can't confirm or deny that we're going to shut down a press or a plant or whatever,'' Mr. Sloan said. ''But I can say that we are carefully evaluating various options in both the production and distribution side of our business.''
Yesterday, an aide to Mr. Sloan, Virginia Woo, said The News opposed a state inquiry into the situation, citing a statement by Mr. Sloan in the July 2 issue of Crain's New York Business saying, ''Our position is that the best approach to solve our problems is face-to-face negotiations with our 10 unions, not an outside party.''
A state board, mandated under a seldom-invoked 39-year-old statute, could involve a 60-day cooling-off period, which the unions hope would make it difficult, if not impossible, for The News to declare an impasse over the summer, when low advertising revenues would make a strike strategically advantageous for management.
City Labor Relations Commissioner Eric J. Schmerz said he strongly supported creating a board of inquiry.
''The law is designed to provide a procedural forum to aid parties who are not doing very well in direct negotiations,'' Mr. Schmerz said. ''This is a major dispute that could turn into a very serious confrontation. A legendary newspaper's existence is involved, along with the jobs of thousands of workers and the economy of the city.''
Union leaders acknowledged that they suffered from a distinct lack of leverage at the bargaining table and that they faced a formidable foe in the chief negotiator for The News, Robert Ballow (pronounced ba-LOO), a tough-talking lawyer from Nashville with a long record of success in fighting newspaper unions.
Underlying the unions' fears are financial projections suggesting that losses by The News could force the Tribune Company to close the newspaper. Last month Merrill Lynch & Company estimated that The News could lose $45 million this year, a sum that the financial house said would force the paper to reorganize ''to generate a reasonable return, or it will cease to be a factor in the earnings'' of the company. Apparently the implication is that The News will have to win its struggle against the unions or else be sold or closed.
In an effort to forestall the point at which management might seek to declare an impasse, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has advised the unions to slow the negotiations, on the ground that Mr. Ballow is purportedly ''there for the express purpose of not negotiating,'' said a confidential memorandum on June 17 that bears the initials of an A.F.L.-C.I.O. strategist in Washington, Joe Uehlein.
Mr. Sloan said it was apparent that the footdragging at the bargaining table had begun long ago, citing detailed statistics demonstrating how many times various union negotiators had arrived late, taken long lunch hours or otherwise sought to keep the talks moving at what he called a glacial pace.

HEADLINE: New York City Spurs Anti-Apartheid Fight

 BODY:
A New York City Council committee unanimously approved a bill yesterday that would further limit city business with banks or companies that have ties to South Africa and seek to reward banks that put pressure on the apartheid government there.
Mayor David N. Dinkins has long urged the measure and testified at a hearing of the Government Operations Committee. The full Council is expected to approve the measure today.
The bill would expand existing laws that bar the city from doing business with companies that have ties to South Africa and would establish a rating system to judge the posture of banks in dealing with South Africa. When choosing among banks with comparable services at comparable cost, the bill would direct city agencies to deposit or invest city funds in banks with the highest ratings.
City officials conceded that the handful of banks without ties to South Africa would not be large enough to handle most city transactions, but they said the measure would prompt discussion and perhaps changes in the practices of bigger banks.

HEADLINE: New Microbial Agents May Help Kill Crop Pests

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
ARMIES of bugs and microbes, their powers enhanced in some cases by genetic engineering, are being unleashed in fields and laboratories in a widening effort to control destructive agricultural pests without resorting to chemical pesticides.
The effort includes a major expansion of the classical form of biological control, in which insects' natural enemies are imported and set loose in the fields. More and more farmers are now deploying mass-produced battalions of pest-killing insects and parasites, and the number of biological agents available to them has more than doubled over the last decade.
But beyond that, researchers are deciphering the ways in which a wide variety of microorganisms kill or suppress other microbes, weeds, fungi and insects that destroy crops and diminish agricultural yields. They are using this knowledge to custom-design better new biological agents through genetic engineering. 
Although biological control accounts for only about 1 percent of the $20 billion spent globally on pest control each year, research is rising sharply.
''There's a big information explosion,'' said Dr. R. James Cook of the Department of Agriculture's biological control research unit at Washington State University, who headed a 1987 study of the subject by the National Academy of Sciences. Ten years ago, he said, perhaps 1 percent of the 500 or so scientific papers presented at annual meetings of plant pathologists dealt with biological control; today, 25 to 30 percent do.
Eleven microbial pest-control agents have been approved for commercial use by the Environmental Protection Agency since 1980; five of the approvals have come in the last two years, and at least three more are expected this year. About half of all applications from pesticide manufacturers for permission to do field research now involve biological controls, said William Schneider, a microbiologist in the agency's office of pesticides - an ''almost exponential'' rate of growth.
On one research frontier, scientists are isolating and mass-producing genes from one strain of bacteria that produces an antibiotic that kills disease organisms. They are transferring the genes to other varieties of bacteria, creating new strains that can use the same antibiotic.
By such gene transfers, they hope to tailor-make microorganisms that can control diseases in environments where none otherwise would; to enhance the potency of control microbes; to make a single strain of microbe effective against more than one pest, and to design control microbes that will commit suicide after doing their job. In a parallel effort, they are also trying to incorporate disease-resistant genes in the crops themselves, and some of these agents are expected to be commercially available in the next five years.
Scientists are also delving into the enormously complex ecology of the soil to understand the teeming microbial communities whose interactions partly determine the health of crops. Biological control is primarily an exercise in manipulating this largely unexplored micro-environment. There, microbes and higher forms engage in a constant struggle, in which organisms harmful to crops are often held in check naturally; humans are seeking to enhance, augment and guide the process.
 
Fungus 1, Moth 0
In a striking display of pest control occuring spontaneously in nature, a wild fungus first identified only a year ago has greatly reduced the defoliation of Northeastern forests this summer by what scientists had feared would be one of the most destructive gypsy moth infestations in years. A lot remains unknown about the fungus, but scientists hope they can ultimately understand it well enough to adopt it as a weapon against gypsy moths in many parts of the country.
The resurgence of interest and research is being driven by a number of pressures. Many scientists and environmentalists believe that chemical pesticides are contaminating the environment. They say, furthermore, that production of the chemicals depends too heavily on energy from fossil fuels to be indefinitely sustained, and that some chemical pesticides are losing their effectiveness as pests develop resistance to them. And an aroused public, fearing dangerous residues in foods, is turning thumbs down on chemical pesticides.
Some experts believe that biology will eventually overtake chemistry as the predominant means of pest control. ''It's going to have to,'' said Lester E. Ehler, a professor of entomology at the University of California at Davis. But he and many others say biological agents are not a total answer.
''It's dangerous to rely solely on biological control because it doesn't always work,'' said Dr. Ehler. Ideally, he and other scientists say, biological controls should be used as part of an integrated approach that also involves crop rotation, new strains of disease-resistant crops and some chemical pesticides - with chemicals used sparingly, as a last resort.
''It is not a quick-fix silver bullet,'' Dr. Cook said of biological pest control. As promising as it is for a broad range of plant diseases and insect pests, it is much less so for weeds and some fungi.
On the other hand, he said, chemical pesticides fail to control many diseases, particularly root diseases of field crops. ''I see biological control as filling a major gap that has simply been left by the inadequacies of chemical control,'' he said.
 
Microbes Have Their Limits
Whatever their inadequacies, synthetic chemical controls have ruled modern agriculture since World War II. Overshadowed by the chemicals, research on biological languished until the 1980's. Part of the difficulty has been the limitations inherent in biological control.
A microbe might work in one part of the country but not another, or in one season but not another. And although biological agents tend to be more stable and longer-lasting, they generally do not bring about the dramatic kill that chemical pesticides can; rather, they hold the pests within tolerable bounds. All this makes companies reluctant to stand behind guarantees.
Biological agents have a big economic drawback as well: unlike chemical pesticides, they do not control a broad spectrum of pests. A given agent works against one pest on one crop and may require only one application. This creates a narrow ''niche market'' that many large manufacturers find unprofitable.
Much of the resurgent research is aimed at overcoming these limitations.
For a century, farmers have been practicing ''classical'' biological control: the loosing of predatory insects, parasites and nematodes against insect pests and weeds. Today, about 50 such agents are sold in the United States. This is more than double the number available a decade ago, Dr. Ehler said, ''and the list is growing year by year.''
''A farmer can call up a supplier and say, 'I need 50,000 parasites,' and put them out,'' he went on. In one of the best examples so far, he said, mites that afflict California strawberries have been successfully and routinely countered by turning predatory mites loose against them.
''Growers have started opting for biological control,'' Dr. Ehler said. ''It's been available for 30 years, but they've only recently started using it because they've been forced into it by problems with pesticides.''
 
The Scientific Obstacles
Even so, there are scientific obstacles. Two-thirds of all natural enemies introduced as classical control agents have failed to become established, said Dr. Ehler. The challenge, he added, is to predict what will work and what will not.
But even greater challenges confront scientists who are trying to turn microorganisms against crop diseases. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have lately discovered a new control agent, bacillus cereus UW85, and are unraveling the mechanism through which it suppresses the fungus phytophthora, which attacks the roots of alfalfa and soybeans.
They have found that late in its growth cycle, UW85 produces an antibiotic that attacks the fungus. So they applied bacteria of the right age to soybean seeds and planted them.
The results were mixed, said Jo Handelsman, the leader of the project. Over four seasons, soybean yields increased by as much as 42 percent in some fields but not at all in others. ''It works very well in the upper Midwest, but does not seem to work in the South,'' she went on. ''In Missouri and Mississippi, it was a total and complete washout.''
Researchers in the Department of Agriculture laboratory at Washington State University have had a similar experience with a bacterium that controls a fungal disease called take-all. A major pathogen for wheat crops around the world, take-all can cut crop yields in half and is not well controlled by chemical pesticides.
But again, said Dr. Cook of the laboratory, ''we have a certain number of failures because the organisms do not like the environment we put them in.''
 
Custom-Made Bacteria
One way to overcome such inconsistencies may be through genetic engineering. So the Washington researchers are trying to customize bacteria for given environments. They have discovered the mechanism through which the bacterium works: an antibiotic, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, that it produces on wheat roots. In studies conducted by Dr. Linda Thomashow and Dr. L. S. Pierson, the gene responsible for producing the antibiotic has been isolated and cloned, and is now being inserted into other bacteria.
A next step would be to insert the antibiotic gene into bacteria that would flourish in environments where the original antifungal bacterium cannot. It might also be inserted into bacteria that control other diseases. Some researchers envision the genetic engineering of microorganisms that would attack a variety of pests, as chemical pesticides now do.
Other researchers foresee using genetic techniques to make biological control agents more powerful. ''What we'd like to be able to do is increase the virulence'' of an agent, said Olen C. Yoder, a plant pathologist at Cornell University, ''but retain its specificity so that it would never harm anything but the target.'' Furthermore, he said, it should be possible to construct biological agents so that they ''do their job and then commit suicide so that they don't persist in the environment,'' where there is a remote chance they could exchange genetic material with natural organisms.
Other researchers are inserting pest-control genes into plants. At the Monsanto Company in St. Louis, for example, scientists are routinely introducing genes into nearly three dozen vegetable crops, hoping to enable them to repel insects. Commercial introduction of some of the agents is planned for the mid-1990's.
 
Against 'Magic Bullets'
Some scientists warn against such strategies, especially if they are viewed as magic bullets to be used in disregard of the ecology of the fields, much as chemical pesticides have been. ''That's a simple-minded solution,'' said Dr. Majorie Hoy, an entomologist at the University of California at Berkeley. Introducing pest-control genes into plants might work, she said, ''but it certainly can induce resistance in pests, and it can have negative effects on beneficial insects.''
Many scientists see the proper use of biological controls as being inseparable from a broader strategy of manipulation of the microenvironment of the soil and the field. So some are focusing their research on understanding the ''communities'' of microbes, harmful and beneficial, whose interactions in large part determine the health of crops.
Chemical pesticides tend to destroy these communities, but researchers are finding that the communities themselves, if left to function freely, can hold plant diseases in check through natural competition. ''It's there, but it's not breaking out as a disease or a pest,'' said Stephen Gliessman, an agricultural ecologist at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
 
When the Chemicals Stop
Chemical pesticides wipe out not only pests but also the beneficial organisms that compete with them. In a three-year-old study of the ecology of plots of strawberries, a group headed by Dr. Gliessman is looking at what happens when the use of chemical pesticides ceases. ''We predicted that we were going to get a buildup of pathogens, fungi primarily, that would force us to abandon the soil after a couple of years,'' he said.
The disease organisms did multiply. But to the researchers' surprise, so did a whole range of other microorganisms that began to function as a balanced whole, with no one strain of organism winning out. ''It's the diversity and the numbers that keep pathogens in check,'' said Dr. Gliessman.
The next step is to try to identify the ways in which the organisms interact, with an eye toward manipulating the microecology so that beneficial organisms, genetically engineered and otherwise, can operate in it effectively and permanently.
''In biological control, we talk about a balance,'' said Dr. Hoy. ''You maintain some pests at low levels to maintain the beneficials; they've got to eat something.''

HEADLINE: In Hong Kong, a New Confidence

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 9

 BODY:
To the list of fictional acts of derring-do attributed to the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles, the popular cartoon characters, many in this British colony now add a real feat: helping rescue the Hong Kong stock market.
The stock of the Hong Kong company that manufactures these toy characters, Playmates International Holdings, became a standout this year and helped to fuel a stock market rally.
Playmates' demonstration of entrepreneurial flair was followed by two other developments that warmed Hong Kong's chill: President Bush's decision at the end of May not to suspend China's most-favored-nation status in trade, and China's decision to permit Fang Lizhi, the dissident who fled to the United States Embassy after the military crackdown in Beijing on June 4, 1989, to emigrate to Britain. The move was viewed as an indicator of a more open China.
 
Stocks Rebound
As a result, share prices in this beleaguered capitalist enclave, which plummeted after the crackdown, have rebounded sharply. They rose nearly 5 percent in June. Today, the key market indicator, the Hang Seng index, surged to a post-crash high of 3,385, up more than 44 percent from the period a year ago. 
Many in Hong Kong still expect the worst when China regains control over Hong Kong in 1997. But resilient entrepreneurs here interpreted the success of the pizza-munching turtles as a sign that there are opportunities in the short time left to do what they do best: make money.
Playmates International is among the stock market's hottest performers. Its stock closed at $14.40 a share (Hong Kong) today, or $1.84 in United States currency, up from $1.60 (Hong Kong) at the beginning of the year.
''That was when Hong Kong started to feel good about itself again,'' Eric A. Rasmussen, an economist here for Jardine Fleming Broking, a regional securities firm, said of Playmates' success. ''People felt they could still do it.''
Nonetheless, he added, ''One shock from a stupid move from China and the market could drop right through the floor.''
 
A Different Kind of Rally
He and several other economists also pointed out that this rally in Hong Kong has been different from others. The money fueling it is coming primarily from Hong Kong and other Asian investors, including Taiwan and Japanese institutions. Western capital has played a less important role than in the past.
These changes make Hong Kong less of a financial bridge between the West and Asia, its traditional role, and more of a regional hub. ''Hong Kong has become more of an Asian financial center rather than a global financial center,'' said Alan A. McLean, chief economist at the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, the colony's dominant financial institution.
Much of the investment in Hong Kong is going into factories that take advantage of China's low wages. Hong Kong's economy has been slowly merging with that of neighboring Guangdong Province in China, economists say. For instance, two million Chinese work in Hong Kong-run factories on the mainland, Mr. McLean said, nearly triple the 780,000 who work in factories in the colony. More than 80 percent of Hong Kong's re-exports, the fastest-growing sector of the territory's trade, are coming from or going to China. A re-export is merchandise imported and then shortly exported to a third country, usually with new packaging and in only slightly altered form.
 
Tourism Hurt
But these links cannot counter the pessimism many in Hong Kong feel when they consider life under Communist rule. Stung by the harsh face the Chinese Government showed in last year's crackdown, Hong Kong's economy posted no growth in the first half of this year, and inflation is close to double-digit levels. Tourism and hotel occupancy are down significantly.
More than 1,000 people a week are emigrating from Hong Kong, in part to avoid living under Communist rule, causing a serious brain drain. Now there is a worry that commercial fraud, already a problem, may flourish as many accountants depart.
Improbable as it may seem, these serious problems have not completely squelched the territory's economic spirit. Nearly every conversation in Hong Kong is interrupted by the sound of jackhammers or other construction equipment as old buildings fall and new ones go up at a furious pace.
From the top of the new 70-story Bank of China tower, the famous harbor looks like a spoiled child's bathtub full of toys. The water last week was jammed with ferries, lighters, tugs, dozens of container vessels and an American aircraft carrier.
Making the best of a bad situation, one company has even been marketing Rice Paddy Babies, toy dolls dressed up as Chinese and described as Hong Kong residents seeking to emigrate and looking for ''sponsors.''
The stock market's sudden surge is regarded as similarly opportunistic. ''We have been surprised by the strength of the market,'' said Mr. McLean of the Hongkong Bank. ''We thought it would take the whole year to get back where it is.''
 
Many Are Cautious
Pleased as many are with the market's new life, there remains an unmistakable undercurrent of caution.
''It's a difficult feeling to come to grips with,'' said Philip L. Tose, chairman of Peregrine Capital Ltd., a merchant bank. ''Sure, things are bubbly on the surface, but you crack that surface and just underneath there are real problems. Confidence today is very shallow. We are going to have more shocks in Hong Kong.''
Mr. Tose is among those who have benefited most from Hong Kong's revival. He founded Peregrine with some partners in January 1989 after leaving the securities unit here of Citicorp. The company weathered the stock crash after the June 4 crackdown in China, and went on to conclude two takeovers and several asset sales, reaping tens of millions of dollars in windfall profits and a listing on the Hong Kong stock market.
''We've made much, much more money than we thought we would,'' Mr. Tose acknowledged. ''Frankly, luck is better than brains. But there's still a lot to do here.''
He added: ''Everyone was deeply shocked by what happened last June, and that won't go away. People are skeptical now, but on the whole they want to stay here. Hong Kong is a great place to do business.''
 
Trading Status Stressed
Many also emphasize the importance of President Bush's decision on China's trading status in rebuilding confidence in Hong Kong. There had been pressure on the United States to suspend favored-nation status for China because of the country's reported human rights violations. Many members of Congress, which must confirm the President's decision, still express those concerns.
The most-favored-nation listing sharply reduces tariffs and duties charged on products originating in China. Since so much of China's trade flows through the colony or is produced in Hong Kong-owned factories, a crimp in China's exports to the United States would have hit hard here.
What heartened many was the role Hong Kong played in the Administration's decision. ''Were it not for Hong Kong, most people would have been in favor of suspension,'' said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who held hearings on the matter in Congress and was in Hong Kong last week.
''For the first time since last June 4, we believe Beijing saw Hong Kong as a political asset, not just an economic asset,'' added John Kamm, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, which fought to keep the favored-trade status for China.
But perhaps the most comforting aspect of the decision was that it suggested that politics was taking a back seat to basic economic interests, analysts here said.
''The real question for people here is whether they feel China or the United States will be pragmatic,'' said Mr. Rasmussen, the economist. ''They don't trust ideologies.''

HEADLINE: Telling Nation's Fortune: Does Consensus See All?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEDONA, Ariz.

 BODY:
In the mid-1970's, as Robert J. Eggert was about to retire as chief economist for RCA, he figured the company would want to continue his practice of conducting regular private surveys of what economic forecasters thought about the future. After all, he had begun the surveys with the encouragement of RCA's chairman, David Sarnoff.
Mr. Eggert was wrong - and mildly offended - but, as it turns out, hardly sorry. He took the idea with him and in the last 14 years the erstwhile agriculture specialist has built his Blue Chip Consensus newsletter into a publication that provides a six-figure income and has made him the nation's best-known tabulator of prevailing business sentiment. 
 
Polls 51 Analysts
From an office overlooking spectacular red-sandstone buttes here in north-central Arizona, Mr. Eggert, who is 76 years old, polls his stable of 51 business, bank and academic analysts at the end of each month on the outlook for the gross national product, inflation and a dozen other economic gauges. He mails the results to reach his roughly 1,500 subscribers by about the 10th of the next month.
The newest report, dated Tuesday, July 10, finds the consensus predicting that the G.N.P. will expand 1.9 percent this year, the same pace that had been forecast last month. That is two-tenths of a point higher than the 1.7 percent consensus given when the group took its first stab at 1990 growth in January of 1989.
Such a lackluster output has been predicted for more than four years now. The top of Blue Chip's cover has been yellow - indicating caution -since the spring of 1986. The top of the cover may also be red or green, depending on the analysts' view.
As it happens, the Government's first-quarter figure for the annual rate of expansion - after a large downward and a large upward revision - was 1.9 percent. The Government's first estimate for the second quarter will come out on July 27.
The latest issue also forecasts that G.N.P. will grow 2.2 percent next year, a tenth of a point lower than expected last month. If that comes to pass, an economy that looks fragile today will set a record late next year for uninterrupted expansion, breaking the 1961-69 mark, which was helped by the Vietnam War.
But like many other economists, Mr. Eggert's group has for several years predicted a recession just over the horizon. After seeing the economy move ahead for nearly eight years, the group sees the so-called inevitable downturn two years from now, in 1992. In most past surveys, a recession was seen in the following year.
 
Record Hard to Assess
It is hard to verify conclusively, but Mr. Eggert calls his newsletter's record a good one, with an average miss on inflation-adjusted G.N.P. during his first 13 years of one percentage point.
In the 1977-83 period, the difference between the G.N.P. as predicted in October and the actual outcome 14 months later averaged 1.1 points. This included an embarrassment in 1982, when the consensus failed to anticipate the 1981-82 recession, the worst of the postwar era. Blue Chip predicted a 2.2 gain and the result was a 2.5 percent decline - a 4.7-point disparity.
For the 1984-89 period, the performance improved to an average miss of nine-tenths of 1 percent.
In seven years Blue Chip was too low, in five too high and in 1980 it hit G.N.P. right on the nose. G.N.P. is generally considered the most important single broad indicator of economic strength.
While the markets do not quiver in anticipation of the Eggert surveys, which cost subscribers $439 a year, there appears good reason to take them seriously. Considerable evidence in economic literature indicates that over time, the consensus of a large group of forecasters outperforms the predictions of any individual.
''The consensus seems to have that uncanny ability,'' said Mr. Eggert, who has been forecasting one thing or another, including livestock prices and automobile sales - since 1936. He includes his own independently calculated predictions in the survey.
 
Missed 1981-82 Recession
But many of Blue Chip's readers say they do not rely heavily on the numbers it publishes. Some use the 8-to-10-page survey mainly as a benchmark against which to measure their own views or to see what people they hold in particular esteem are saying.
That list includes such Blue Chip Consensus participants as Stuart G. Hoffman, head economist for the Pittsburgh National Bank.
''You can scan the list of those with a good track record and see how they stack up,'' Mr. Hoffman said, adding that he also looks at the forecasts of some other people or institutions that have been wrong, hoping they have a different outlook than he does.
This is one of the features that sets Blue Chip apart from most other forecast tabulations, like the quarterly finds of the National Association of Business Economists, whose respondents are more numerous but anonymous. Another publication, the twice-yearly Livingston Survey, identifies its participants but reports their aggregate expectations.
 
Some Criticism
But despite Blue Chip's frequency and specificity, some subscribers, like Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, are not totally enthusiastic. In Mr. Platt's case that is partly because the consensus figures shift so slowly that he says they fail to pick up, for example, quarter-to-quarter swings vital to people managing stock or bond portfolios.
He says he feels no need to be reassured that he is swimming with the crowd. ''Being part of the consensus is not a major factor in my thinking,'' Mr. Platt said. Mr. Eggert, who grudgingly succumbed to requests and added quarterly breakdowns about 10 years ago, says he is not fond of them himself. Another disagreeable practice, he says, is the increased use, particularly at the White House, of presentations showing economic performance from fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter rather than year-to-year, which he says further complicates analysis.
 
Policy Counters Excesses
Critics also suggest that the records of Mr. Eggert and other consensus-reliant forecasters may appear more praiseworthy than is deserved. This is because Government policy makers are constantly tugging at the economy in ways that tend to counter excesses, pulling actual results back toward the consensus.
Mr. Eggert draws on a long career as a college professor, associate director of marketing for the American Meat Institute, wartime Government price controller, and forecaster and market researcher for the Ford Motor Company leading up to his eight-year stint at RCA.
He says Lee A. Iacocca, the Chrysler Corporation chairman, was not the father of the Mustang when he was at Ford. Mr. Eggert says that his wife suggested the Mustang name after reading a book on horses and that he did much of the market research for the hugely successful car aimed at a new generation of youthful car buyers.
When not polling his ''cooperators'' by telephone or facsimile machine, which allows Mr. Eggert to boast of the highest telephone bill in this town of 12,000, he is breeding quarter horses, making speeches or playing tennis.

HEADLINE: Talking Business; with Berry of Dominion Resources;
Electricity Use Expected to Rise

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Because of the heat last week, the demand for electricity rose so greatly in Washington that the local power company blacked out parts of its territory, again raising the question of whether electricity supplies are adequate.
Dominion Resources Inc. of Richmond sees the question from two sides; its utility subsidiary, the Virginia Electric Power Company, serves much of eastern Virginia and North Carolina and sometimes supplies excess power to Washington, while an unregulated subsidiary, Dominion Energy, builds independent power plants around the country and sells the electricity to utilities. The company's chairman and chief executive officer, William W. Berry, talked about what will be built, and why.
Q. Virginia Electric has predicted it will need 40 percent more power by 2000. Why? 
A. We have a very vibrant economy down here that's been going strong for seven or eight years steady, with very robust growth, in the 4 percent range per year. We're expecting the 2.5 percent range in the 90's.
Q. Will you build or buy from independent producers?
A. We're going to do both. A big block of it will come from independents. We're buying and building, choosing at any particular time which of those two would be the best deal.
Q. The current law bars utility holding companies from having majority interest in a large number of independent power producers.
What is the effect of barring companies like yours from full ownership?
A. The cost of electricity will be higher than it needs to be. Economical projects that would have succeeded in the marketplace will not be there. So the next best project will be purchased, and it will cost more.
Q. Is building those plants a good business?
A. The competition is ferocious. Utilities that go out for bids are getting 9 or 10 times the offers that they need. It started out with very high returns, a very profitable business with the early independent contracts. Then everybody and his brother runs into the marketplace, and profit margins tighten up. Some people fail, other folks gobble them up. There certainly is a shakeout going on in independent power plants right now. But that may be good news for utility customers.
Q. Should all utilities be soliciting bids from independent producers?
A. A utility would be foolish not to test the marketplace. That doesn't mean they should blindly go out and buy from an independent. We've had cases in Virginia where bids offered were higher than what we thought we could build it for, and we in fact built it for less than we estimated. But certainly it is prudent management to test that market and find out what prices are. It puts a market test on utility construction. Then they go back to the state regulator and say we can build it cheaper than anybody else.
Q. Can't energy efficiency cut the need for new plants?
A. We are not getting as much conservation as we should, because we are not showing the customer the right price. In many places, we are underpricing electricity. We are selling at the historical cost, instead of the marginal cost. You can have current marginal costs that are considerably above prices that are based on history. There are two solutions to that. You can change the price of electricity, or devise some mechanism to encourage that conservation outside of price. The second is more complicated, but probably politically more acceptable.
Q. How do you encourage conservation apart from price?
A. You can do it with information, for example, with an Energy Saver Home certification program. Builders promote that, if the house is certified by Virginia Power as being energy efficient. Or, you can make the direct subsidy. I can give you $100 if you get more efficient refrigerator. But making that fair to everyone is complicated. The second problem is people don't invest in measures that make sense because the market is inefficient. The best example is a renter who is not paying electric bills.
Q. Should we be trying harder to conserve?
A. Yes. In the second half of the 90's, prices are going up again, and you're going to see a lot of conservation. It's too bad we're out of sync. We should be seeing that conservation now.

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Rose By $3.9 Billion in May

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
Americans took out $3.9 billion more in consumer credit than they paid off in May, 10 times the amount incurred only a month earlier, the Government said today.
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.5 percent, up from the previous month's six-tenths of 1 percent growth rate. Net new debt in April totaled $390 million. 
It was the highest annual rate of increase since a 7.5 percent rate in October, when Americans borrowed $4.4 billion more than they paid off.
The May increase was concentrated in credit card debt, which rose $3.1 billion, or an annual rate of 18.5 percent.
Consumers, who account for about two-thirds of United States economic activity, had appeared to be more cautious in their borrowing and spending in recent months.
Analysts had attributed the slower pace to high interest rates, waning confidence because of adverse economic news and to the high level of debt already held by many Americans.
 
Annualized Rate of Credit
The annualized rate of credit growth for the first five months of 1990 was 3 percent, down from the 7.6 percent for all of 1989 and 8.5 percent for 1988.
At the same time, Americans' savings rate - savings as a percentage of disposable income - has been pegged above 6 percent for several months after dropping to a low of 3.2 percent for all of 1987.
Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, said varying methods of computing economic statistics were used by different government agencies and occasionally produced different results.
The Commerce Department's retail sales reports, which have fallen for three consecutive months, do not include services, like health care, and have a smaller survey sample than the Fed's consumer credit reports, Mr. Benz said.
He also said that April borrowing was weak and that the May borrowing was ''somewhat of a payback.''
''Consumers are not dying,'' Mr. Benz said. ''Perhaps they're a little more cautious, definitely slowing, but by no means do we have a recession scenario.''
Automobile loans continued to decline in May, but at a slower rate, They dropped $87 million, a four-tenths of 1 percent rate of decline, compared with a net decline of $2 billion in automobile debt the previous month.
Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose $533 million, a 3.1 percent annual rate, after a 4 percent annual growth rate in April.
Borrowing for mobile homes increased $325 million, a 17.2 percent annual rate of growth, after a three-tenths of 1 percent decline the previous month.
The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of May at $724.7 billion.

HEADLINE: Lease Improves Trump's Financial Picture

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
The long-term lease that Donald J. Trump signed yesterday with Galeries Lafayette is worth between $50 and $65 million, bankers said.
The 25-year lease for 80,000 square feet in Trump Tower, which represents the largest retail real estate deal in New York this year, is substantially more profitable for the developer than the previous lease that was held by Bonwit Teller, which closed earlier this year.
But while nearly double the annual value of the Bonwit lease, the new contract has several protective clauses for Galeries Lafayette. It also offers the retailer free rent for the first year. 
Galeries Lafayette's rent for the prime retail space is structured on a sliding scale, with the first five years costing more than $6 million annually and gradually rising to about $9 million annually thereafter, the bankers said. It has the option to renew the agreement after 15 years. Bonwit was paying Mr. Trump about $3.5 million annually and that sum was scheduled to increase to about $4.2 million next year.
The French retailer will not move into the space until sometime next fall, but according to the Trump Organization, it will take possession of the space within a few days. According to the Trump Organization, Galeries Lafayette will spend eight or nine months redesigning the space and will pay for all improvements.
 
A Strengthened Market
The Bonwit Teller lease was signed in September 1979, while New York was in a financial crisis and the local real estate market was extremely depressed. In part, the higher rent for Galeries Lafayette reflects an improved New York real estate market.
While the Bonwit lease left Mr. Trump with the rights of approval over almost everything concerned with the space, like lighting or exterior design, the lease negotiated by the French retailer is structured to minimize Mr. Trump's control. It stipulates that Galeries Lafayette can remain in the space even if Mr. Trump has to file for bankruptcy protection or sell Trump Tower.
Bankers said that the French retailer was concerned that the developer might have been forced into personal bankruptcy during his cash shortage last month, while negotiations on the lease were going on.
At a news conference yesterday morning, Georges Meyer, the chairman of Galeries Lafayette, praised Salomon Brothers and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz for putting the deal together.
The Galeries Lafayette lease helps improve the developer's financial condition because he can borrow between $50 million and $65 million against the lease and because it adds income to the Trump Tower property against which the banks can better secure their loans to the developer.
David Sklar, a vice president of the Trump Organization, said Mr. Trump had turned down other more lucrative offers for the space.
''We had several choices and we opted to go with Galeries because we thought it would be more exciting than other stores in the New York area,'' Mr. Sklar said.

HEADLINE: Mitsubishi Trust in U.S. Options Deal

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 9

 BODY:
Eager to give its corporate clients worldwide an opportunity to deal in futures and options, the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation of Japan said today that it would form a venture with the Chicago Research and Trading Group Ltd., one of this country's leading traders of options and futures.
A spokesman for the 50-50 venture, Michael Weiser, said that broadly speaking Chicago Research would contribute expertise, Mitsubishi Trust would contribute most of the $150 million in start-up capital and both organizations would contribute personnel. But all the terms of the joint venture, which will focus on futures and options contracts in interest rates and currencies, were not disclosed.
 
Changes for Both
The deal will enhance Mitsubishi Trust's ability to compete globally with other banks that already offer futures and options, and at the same time will make Chicago Research a different sort of firm. Until now a proprietary firm - that is, one that traded principally for its own account - Chicago Research, after the joint venture, will be working with outsiders, chiefly corporations and other institutional investors. 
Malcolm Hanney, a Chicago Research executive vice president, added that the deal ''will provide Chicago Research serious access to the Japanese market and corporate business in Japan.''
The joint venture appeared to be unusual in a number of ways.
Although Japanese financial institutions have entered into business arrangements with United States financial institutions in the past - Sumitomo Life, for instance, owns part of Goldman, Sachs; Nippon Life owns part of Shearson Lehman Hutton, and Yasuda Life owns part of Paine Webber - the Japanese have been passive investors in those deals. Similarly, in a highly publicized joint venture operating in Japan, Wells Fargo is a passive investor in a money management joint venture with the Nikko Securities Corporation.
 
Active Japanese Involvement
In the Chicago Research-Mitsubishi Trust joint venture, by comparison, both partners will have exactly 50 percent ownership. Moreover, the Japanese are expected to send representatives to Chicago to be actively involved in policy making.
Additionally, this appeared to mark the first time that the Japanese were formally joining forces with an American firm that dealt strictly in futures and options in this country. Another major futures and options trading firm based here, O'Connor & Associates, a direct competitor of Chicago Research, has a link with the Swiss Bank Corporation.
For its part, Mitsubishi Trust has been eager to learn more about and participate in the options and futures fields. Many of its corporate clients do business globally and would like to use futures and options for protection against swings in interest and currency rates. But Mitsubishi Trust does not own a seat on either the Chicago Board of Trade or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the two principal futures exchanges here. Mitsubishi Bank, which does own a seat on the Mercantile Exchange, is a separate organization.
 
'Seeking Out Expertise'
''They are seeking out expertise, and this will significantly enhance their ability in these areas,'' said Mr. Hanney, the Chicago Research executive vice president, referring to Mitsubishi Trust.
The joint venture will solidify what has been an informal but increasingly close-knit relationship between Mitsubishi Trust and Chicago Research. The two first started talking about doing business together in April 1987, when Mitsubishi provided Chicago Research with $37 million in capital by purchasing subordinated bonds. Those bonds were rolled over last year, when Mitsubishi increased its money outstanding to Chicago Research to $45 million.
A Mitsubishi Trust official in New York, Makoto Oikawa, referred requests for comment to Mitsubishi Trust's headquarters in Tokyo. Because the announcement was made in the middle of the night in Japan, there was no answer there.

HEADLINE: Sallie Mae Prices $600 Million Issue

 BODY:
The Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae, priced a $600 million issue yesterday in its regular monthy sale. The Government-sponsored public corporation usually sells short-term floating-rate notes on the Monday before the second Thursday of each month, The notes, due Jan. 10, 1991, were priced at par to yield 25 basis points more than the bond-equivalent yield of the 91-day Treasury bill and are expected to begin trading today. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Sallie Mae said the interest rate, which is to be adjusted on the day after each Treasury bill auction, would be paid at maturity.
The notes are being offered in the United States and in the Eurodollar market through various securities-dealer selling groups managed by Sallie Mae.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed in Light Day As Pound Continues to Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed in light domestic trading yesterday as currency traders kept a close watch on the economic summit meeting in Houston but had little news to act upon.
Gold prices, meanwhile, fell. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery slipped $2.90 from late Friday to settle at $358.20 an ounce. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $357.40, off $2.80. 
Currency dealers said trading in the British pound yesterday was the most active feature of the foreign exchange markets.
Sterling was helped by continued expectation that Britain would soon join Europe's exchange rate mechanism. The mechanism limits exchange rate movements, and the markets expect it will strengthen the currency.
The pound was also supported by comments from Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, that the recent strength of the pound was no fluke but reflected the currency's true value. He spoke at the Houston meeting of the leaders of the seven richest industrial nations.
''Sterling remains extremely strong across the board,'' said Robert Hatcher, a corporate currency dealer for Barclays Bank P.L.C. in New York.
In London, a pound was quoted at $1.8055, up strongly from late Friday's $1.7865. The pound had not been above $1.8000 in London since Jan. 4, 1989. Later, in New York trading, a pound cost $1.8080, compared with $1.7865 late Friday.
Against the Japanese currency, a dollar bought 151.15 yen in New York trading, down from 151.70 yen late Friday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar had closed at 150.70 yen, down 0.25 yen from Friday's close. And in London, it was quoted at 151.10 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.6528 West German marks, up from 1.6515; 1.3965 Swiss francs, down from 1.3983; 5.5460 French francs, up from 5.5435; 1,211.25 Italian lire, down from 1,211.50, and 1.1586 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1619.
Gold in London was quoted at a late bid of $358.15 an ounce, down from late Friday's $361.25. In Zurich, gold was quoted at $357.90 an ounce, down from $361.25 late Friday.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Graduates Find Tighter Job Market

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
THIS year's college graduates are having a harder time finding jobs than did the class of 1989, say Lee J. Svete, director of the office of career planning at St. Lawrence University, a liberal arts college in Canton, N.Y., and Vicki Lynn, director of the career development center at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy.
Mr. Svete said last week that he believed that the job market had not been so competitive since 1982, although he added that ''I have no statistics yet to back my statement.''
The difficulties at some Wall Street firms have had ''a domino effect'' on other companies that had hired regularly on campus in the past, he said.
A few years ago Mrs. Lynn was pleasantly surprised at the large demand for Rensselaer graduates by Wall Street firms. Now, she says, job openings there have almost vanished, except for a small demand from J. P. Morgan & Company, and some other large commercial banks. 
''Overall demand has been slow or flat this year with a few exceptions,'' she said last week.
Of the 800 members of the Rensselaer graduating class, the 30 chemical engineering majors fared the best, Mrs. Lynn said, adding that ''they received multiple offers and all have found good jobs at $35,000 and more.'' Also, there is a nationwide shortage and strong demand for civil engineers, she said, because of the need to repair the nation's infrastructure - bridges and roads mainly.
Many big companies that traditionally hire young engineers from schools like Rensselaer have been virtually out of the recruiting market this year, she said, citing electronics and computer companies.
''I.B.M. did virtually no recruiting here and Digital Equipment pulled back, as did many of the Route 128 companies in Massachusetts like Prime Computer and Wang Laboratories,'' she said. Similarly, Eastman Kodak, in past years a large recruiter, as well as Xerox, did little recruiting on Rensselaer's campus, she added.
However, among the more traditional recruiters, General Electric offered jobs to 15 seniors this spring, and United Technologies, despite cuts in military spending, took eight seniors.
''The whole hiring picture has changed, and the bulk of the recruiting this year has come from firms that did not have much visibility in previous years with us,'' Mrs. Lynn said.
For example, the Andersen Consulting Company, an affiliate of Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting firm, has been ''scooping up all the graduates who might have gone in former years to I.B.M. -about 30 of them this spring,'' according to Mrs. Lynn.
Most openings at Andersen Consulting called for systems analysts to help solve business problems for clients. Mrs. Lynn said the students liked the idea of joining Andersen because many graduates in previous years had reached the partner level in the consulting firm.
She believes that graduates in recent years tend to stress the quality of life and interest in free time more than they did formerly, and they have less drive for working on a fast track with a big company.
''I saw a 1989 graduate the other day,'' Mrs. Lynn said. ''He had a 3.5 grade point average and had been very active on campus. He came for counseling, saying he was unhappy at I.B.M. and now wants to teach at the high school level.'' As a chemical engineer graduate he could teach physics, mathematics and chemistry, she added.
In fact, she said, Rensselaer had recently developed a teaching component so that its engineers or scientists could take courses to fulfill state teaching requirememts.
At St. Lawrence University, one antidote to the more competitive job market is the emphasis on double majors, according to Mr. Svete. He cited the example of a 1989 graduate, a psychology major, who now worked for Chicago's Brookfield Zoo.
He said the number of double majors had increased almost every year. In an annual follow-up survey of the class of 1989 he found that 79, or more than 14 percent of the class of 553 students, had taken double majors. ''Double majors are on the rise, especially for liberal arts graduates,'' he said, ''because they offer more flexiblity.''
His study, ''What Happened to the Class of 1989?,'' showed that 32 percent obtained jobs through direct application to employers and 29 percent found jobs with the help of personal contacts. He thinks the personal contact route, especially contacts with alumni, will be a growing source of jobs in the future. He plans a survey of the class of 1990 this fall.
At Rensselaer, Mrs. Lynn stresses meetings with parents so as to tell them how their sons and daughters should approach the job market. About 69 percent of the students get in contact with her career office before graduation, she said, but she would like to see 100 percent, starting in the freshman year.
''Career planning should be mandatory,'' she said, explaining that her office can inform students of prospects for certain careers, tell them about research projects where they can gain experience and advise on summer jobs and on how to meet alumni who can help.

HEADLINE: United Parcel to Alter Its Trucks In Los Angeles to Use Natural Gas

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 10

 BODY:
The United Parcel Service said today that it planned to convert its 2,700 delivery trucks in the smog-choked Los Angeles area to run on cleaner-burning natural gas in the first major step by a company to comply with strict new vehicle-emissions laws here.
The action by United Parcel, which operates one of the nation's largest truck fleets, was applauded by local officials as evidence that the region's new anti-smog rules, the nation's toughest, can be met on schedule and as evidence that Southern California can be a model for nationwide efforts to improve air quality.
''This is a major breakthrough in alternative fuels that we think will be a harbinger of things to come,'' Mayor Tom Bradley said at a news conference announcing the company's plan.
 
Plan for the Next Century
The Los Angeles basin has more than 7.5 million vehicles and suffers from the worst smog problem in the country, with air quality failing to meet Federal standards more than half the days of the year. Air quality regulators last year approved a plan calling for 40 percent of cars and 70 percent of trucks in the region to run on cleaner fuels like natural gas, methanol and electricity by 1998. By 2007, the plan calls for all vehicles to use such alternative fuels. 
United Parcel will begin by converting 20 trucks in conjunction with the Southern California Gas Company and operating them, starting early next year, in downtown Los Angeles. Assuming the initial conversions work as expected, the company and Government officials said, United Parcel would convert the rest of its more than 2,000 gasoline-powered trucks in the next five years, followed by several hundred diesel-powered vehicles.
Siro DeGasperis, a vice president of United Parcel, said the company eventually plans to convert to natural gas all its trucks in cities with air problems. He said such a shift would involve about half the company's total fleet of more than 100,000 distinctive brown trucks. There was no timetable for the changeover, he said.
Conversion involves installing three cylinders capable of holding 15 gallons of compressed natural gas, enough to drive 60 to 80 miles on city streets, within the daily range of a United Parcel truck in an urban area. The system also requires regulators to reduce the pressure of the gas as it is fed first into a device that mixes the natural gas with air and then into the truck's standard gasoline engine.
 
Test Program in Brooklyn
United Parcel has been running a test program in Brooklyn with the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, involving 10 natural gas-fueled vehicles, and plans to expand the program into Manhattan in conjunction with the Consolidated Edison Company of New York. Mr. DeGasperis said the company is also planning projects soon in Dallas and Houston.
''Ultimately, nationwide, our goal is to experiment and expand the program to most urban areas with an air quality problem,'' he said.
In the Brooklyn test, each of the 10 vehicles cost $3,000 to $3,500 to convert to natural gas, with the bulk of the cost paid by Brooklyn Union Gas, Mr. DeGasperis said. He said United Parcel is negotiating with Southern California Gas about sharing the cost of converting the trucks in the Los Angeles program.
The company also said it is working with the Acurex Corporation of San Francisco to develop a new natural gas-fueled engine specifically for its vehicles.
In the mid 1970's there were shortages of natural gas in the United States that led to rationing in some Northern and Eastern cities during winter months. But after natural gas prices were deregulated in the Carter Administration, exploration and drilling picked up so much that by the mid-1980's there was an abundant supply of natural gas.
Industry executives say supplies should remain more than adequate in coming years, even if natural gas becomes the alternative fuel of choice for vehicles. Among its advantages as a vehicle fuel, natural gas does not need to undergo any refining or processing, as methanol does, and it does not require any further technical breakthroughs, as electric-powered cars do. In addition, natural gas already has a widespread distribution network, with lines running into many homes and businesses.
 
Experiments With Buses
Spurred by California's regulations and the increasingly tough Federal rules, state and local governments, the automobile industry, oil companies and suppliers of electricity and natural gas are all working on programs to develop less-polluting vehicles.
A number of public transit authorities in California are experimenting with buses fueled by methanol, an alcohol-based fuel. The General Motors Corporation is developing an electric car that could be on sale here by the end of the decade if consumers show sufficient interest and if some technical hurdles can be overcome. And General Motors is expected to announce within the next several weeks that it will build trucks specifically designed to run on natural gas, eliminating the need for costly conversions from traditional gasoline and diesel engines.
There are currently about 30,000 vehicles in the United States that can run on natural gas, most of them operated by gas companies and other businesses with large fleets of vehicles that return to a central maintenance and refueling station each night. Many were converted from gasoline in the 1970's, when high gasoline prices made natural gas an attractive alternative on economic grounds.
But most of the research in the field is now driven by air quality concerns rather than fuel prices. Natural gas costs about 25 percent less per mile than gasoline.
Based on its test program in Brooklyn, which began a year ago, United Parcel said use of natural gas significantly reduced emissions of the gases that cause smog. Emissions of carbon monoxide were reduced by 85 percent, nitrogen oxide by 25 percent, carbon dioxide by 23 percent and hydrocarbons by 13 percent.
In another move intended to cut the pollution on California's roads, the Ford Motor Company plans to announce Wednesday that it will give a $700 rebate to residents of the Los Angeles area who trade in older cars without pollution equipment when they buy certain new models of the company's cars.
Company officials acknowledge that the program, which will affect only about 1,000 vehicles, is largely a symbolic gesture that will have little effect on air pollution.
To qualify for the Ford plan, the vehicles must have been manufactured before 1971, and they must be registered to residents of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino or Ventura counties.
The $700 certificates issued by Ford will be good toward the purchase of one of the company's smaller models, including Escort and Festiva.

HEADLINE: THE HOUSTON SUMMIT;
SUMMIT IS DIVIDED ON AID TO MOSCOW

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 10

 BODY:
The leaders of seven major industrial democracies effectively agreed today to go their own way on the matter of aid to the Soviet Union, European and American officials said tonight.
Failing to establish a unified approach to the aid issue in hard-fought negotiations on the second day of the economic summit meeting here, the leaders instead agreed to establish a joint task force and to study the question and make non-binding recommendations by the end of the year.
The industrial nations also issued a political declaration today, which included an acknowledgement of recent lessening of repression in China and an agreement to ease sanctions imposed last year if the progress continues. [The text of the political declaration is on page A4.] The action on Soviet aid cleared the way for West Germany and other European countries to give President Mikhail S. Gorbachev an immediate reward for his liberalization efforts, even though the United States has continued to argue against quick moves to financial aid, British and West German officials said. 
 
Role by Big Lending Agencies
The study task force, to be coordinated by the International Monetary Fund with the assistance of four other lending and development institutions, will issue its findings by the end of the year. The summit nations will be free to accept or reject them, the European officials said.
A senior White House official said the study would be ''a good mechanism for forcing change in the Soviet Union.''
The official said the Bush Administration had not committed itself to embarking on financial aid, regardless of what the task force reported. He added, ''They could say that lending money to these people is stuffing money down a rat hole.''
An economic statement to be released Wednesday will include the details of the Soviet aid agreement and other matters.
The position taken on China was the result of a heated negotiating session among top officials that lasted until 1:30 A.M. today, as the Japanesse insisted on the need to reward Chinese moves toward liberalization and the French, among others, argued for maintaining the tough line adopted after last year's crackdown on the democracy movement, Japanese and French officials said.
 
Fight Over Farm Subsidies
On another contentious topic, agricultural policy, the leaders and their advisers continued to debate well into the night over the extent to which the countries would agree to reduce their farm subsidies.
As the three-day meeting passed its midpoint, officials of the seven nations raced to find broad diplomatic formulas that would maintain the appearance of a collective approach while permitting individual leaders to pursue their divergent courses.
On China, the talks appeared to have succeeded by adopting a vaguely worded compromise while deferring action on concrete steps.
On the Soviet Union, which was the leaders' major preoccupation, the search for a consensus produced a joint effort to study the Soviet Union's problems, rather than dictating specific means to address those problems.
And on agricultural subsidies, which became the most time-consuming issue, the national leaders fought a battle over economic prerogatives and the protection of their rural domestic constituencies.
 
U.S. Presses View
President Bush made a commitment for a worldwide reduction in farm subsidies his highest priority at the economic summit meeting. Officials from other countries said they were surprised by the force with which Mr. Bush pressed the view that agricultural price supports should be lowered and eventually abolished.
The Americans maintain that if the industrial countries do not lift their farm subsidies - tariffs and quotas on imports, subsidies for exports and price supports for farmers - the current round of trade-liberalization talks will break down.
The result, Mr. Bush has told the other leaders, would be to stifle worldwide economic growth. But the European countries, which subsidize farmers much more generously than do the United States and Canada, continued to balk today at making firm commitments to change their policies.
Mrs. Thatcher offered a European proposal this morning that became the basis for the day's debate, but it proved unacceptable to Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada.
The Thatcher proposal would have committed each country to reducing its total farm subsidies but would have set no timetable for doing so.
British and West German officials said throughout the day that they hoped the plan would lead to a breakthrough.
 
Comment by Brady
But United States officials rejected the proposal, as they have in other forums over the years, on the ground that it would not lead to abolition of export subsidies. The Americans view those as the worst form of agriculture protection.
As the staff experts worked late in search of a face-saving compromise, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady declared: ''The European Community has a well-defined position. The United States has a well-defined position. Those positions basically haven't changed in essence.''
Concluding almost two weeks of discussions that began at the NATO conference in London last week, President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany agreed to take distinctly different approaches to Soviet aid, officials of both nations said.
Whatever formula emerges will permit West Germany to offer Moscow immediate and direct financial assistance as the price of Soviet acquiesence to rapid reunification of Germany while the United States continues to insist that only technical assistance, but not cash, are appropriate until Moscow is firmly committed to reorganizing its economy on a free-market basis.
Presenting the meeting's political declaration this afternoon, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d insisted that all seven nations supported the process of economic and political liberalization in the Soviet Union, ''so I would hope and believe that with respect to the question of economic assistance to the Soviet Union, a way could be found for a positive response and reaction to the request that has come from the Soviet Union.''
But, he added, ''We still have to resolve the questions of the scope and degree and extent of assistance to the Soviet Union.''
 
German Aid to Soviets
Secretary Brady said tonight of German plans to begin an aid program for the Soviet Union, ''There was no discussion on their part of slowing down or reducing their aid to the Soviet Union.''
A senior German negotiator described the following timetable for future decision-making: A study of the Soviet economy commissioned by the 12-nation European Community at its meeting in Dublin last month will be delivered in October.
Then, the study commissioned today will be delivered at the end of the year. The group of seven nations meeting here will only formulate collective policies after both studies have been completed, and in the meantime each will pursue its own initiatives.
Chancellor Kohl came to the Houston talks promoting a $15 billion package of aid to the Soviet Union that would begin soon. President Bush said that while he would not try to stop the Germans or criticize them, the United States did not favor financial assistance until economic reforms progressed enough to create a working market economy. Instead, American negotiators promoted technical assistance as the best form of aid.
On Monday night, Mr. Baker attempted to break the impasse by presenting the concept of a study commission to a dinner meeting of foreign ministers. He suggested that the two Washington-based lending institutions should evaluate Soviet progress in moving toward a market economy.
 
French Are Cautious
At a full session of the conference this morning, President Francois Mitterrand of France and other European leaders expressed reservations about giving the two banks such an important role, because they often impose very strict conditions on governements receiving aid.
President Mitterrand's spokesman, Hubert Vedrine, explained France's reservations this afternoon, saying, ''We have to remember that the Soviet Union is a sovereign country that can easily be humiliated and we must avoid that.''
Other European officials expressed concern that the formula proposed by Mr. Baker could potentially give the United States too strong a role because of its influence over the two international banks.
As a result, the seven foreign ministers were directed to meet this afternoon to resolve the question. After four hours they emerged with the task-force plan. In addition to the IMF and the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development based in London and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development based in Paris will take part in the study. Also, the European Community study group will collaborate with the summit task force. How Cordial? Mr. Vedrine said tonight, ''This is a summit where there is a good deal of work being done because the major issues were not resolved in advance and some still are not.''
Asked by a reporter whether this could be described as a summit of ''cordial misunderstanding,'' he responded, ''I will leave that to you.''
Cordial misuderstanding perhaps most appropriately described the handling of China. Radically different assessments of what is happening in that nation were offered by different Governments here, and in the end the summit leaders agreed to a hastily formulated statement that allowed each to pursue its own China policy.
The one paragraph in the political declaration begins by stating, ''We acknowledge some of the recent developments in China, but believe that the prospects for closer cooperation will be enhanced by renewed political and economic reform, particularly in the field of human rights.''
A senior Canadian official who took part in drafting of the statement said that positive developments like the release of the dissident leader Fang Lizhi ''are not enough to constitute a clearly visible trend.''
Taizo Watanabe, chief Japanese spokesman, said this afternoon that his Government wanted the summit ''to send a message to China that it should make further reforms and that they would be appreciated by the West.''
As a result, European officials said the meeting adopted language proposed by the Japanese stating that Chinese reform efforts would be kept under review ''for future adjustments to respond to further positive developments in China.''
Mr. Watanabe said that Japan took this statement to mean that it could now proceed with a previously planned five-year, $5.2 billion loan program to China.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Ads That Bash the Japanese: Just Jokes or Veiled Racism?

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
American advertisers are stepping up their attacks on Japan and its people, attempting to thwart sales of Japanese products through commercials that feature ominous references to the late Emperor Hirohito, photographs of Samurai warriors, exaggerated accents and veiled ridicule of the Japanese physique.
Some advertisers say their commercials are meant to be humorous; others say they are seriously trying to exploit economic tensions between Japan and the United States to sell products. In either case, worried business executives and others with a special interest in Japanese-American relations say these marketers are crossing the thin line separating business competition from nationalism and even racism.
''People are concerned about the whole tone of the relationship,'' said John Wheeler, the vice president of the Japan Society, a private organization devoted to enhancing understanding between the two countries. ''There's so much at stake that these glib, facile cheap shots don't help.'' 
One current television commercial for Pontiac dealers in the New York metropolitan area opens with an announcer darkly projecting the future. ''Imagine a few years from now,'' he intones. ''It's December, and the whole family's going to see the big Christmas tree at Hirohito Center.''
''Go on,'' he says. ''Keep buying Japanese cars.''
The five commercials in the Pontiac series conclude with two words, written in stark white letters against the black screen: ''Enough already.''
Seigi Hinata, the director of the Japan Information Center at the Japanese Consulate General in New York, said, ''I can tell you that since Mitsubishi bought a part of Rockefeller Center, we have been seeing sentiments against Japan, and the Japanese in general.''
Mitsubishi acquired 51 percent of the New York landmark for $846 million late last year.
Most of the ads have been running on local television and radio stations throughout the country, as well as in newspapers and magazines, some since spring. The majority come from American automobile dealers, especially in the Northeast, who are being hurt by Japanese auto makers.
Local automobile dealer associations are independent of the auto manufacturers, and are generally free to hire their own ad agencies and develop advertising strategies without interference. In most cases, the manufacturers have neither commissioned nor approved of the Japan-bashing ads. The dealers believe they work, but some manufacturers apparently fear they might offend consumers.
Philip Guarascio, the head of advertising for the General Motors Corporation, the parent of Pontiac, would not comment directly on the issue, but questioned the ads' effectiveness. ''When you do comparative advertising, it should meet a certain set of standards, based on consumer needs,'' he said. ''And consumer needs tend to be positive in nature, not negative. To the degree you veer from that, you run risks.''
Japanese car makers produced a record 28 percent of all automobiles sold in the United States during the first half of 1990, up four percentage points from the comparable period last year. The market share for American-made autos dropped four percentage points, to 65 percent.
A commercial in the New York area for the Tri-State Oldsmobile Dealers compares the average height of American men with the shorter average height of Japanese men. The ad, which promotes the Cutlass Ciera, concludes, ''That's why our car is built for our size families, not theirs.''
The spate of anti-Japanese advertisements began last winter with a controversial campaign for Chrysler that featured the auto company's chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, complaining that consumers refused to believe that American cars could be as good as Japanese cars. But those commercials concentrated heavily on specific product attributes, and held Japanese manufacturing up as a standard of excellence. The ads worrying Japanese officials and scholars are less product-specific, and include references to the Japanese people and their culture.
Anti-Japanese ads have not gone unnoticed or uncriticized. In the spring, a consortium of Bell telephone operating companies placed a newspaper ad to promote legislation that would allow them to enter the information-generation business. The headline read: ''First it was consumer electronics. Then it was the automobile industry. Is our telecommunications industry next?'' Underneath was a photograph of a stern Samurai fighter, crouched and seemingly ready to pounce.
The ad was pulled and the agency, J. Walter Thompson, was dismissed after the Japanese Embassy complained about it, a Thompson spokeswoman said.
And Americans who do business with the Japanese say such advertisements could harm America's economic interests.
William Zeckendorf Jr., the chairman of the Zeckendorf Company, one of the nation's largest real estate developers, said Japanese investment had become increasingly important for American developers as domestic financing has tightened. He called anti-Japanese ads inappropriate. ''We need their financing,'' Mr. Zeckendorf said.
 
Imagery During War Recalled
Several scholars say the pictures and sentiments in these ads are uncomfortably similar to the anti-Japanese imagery that flooded American popular culture during World War II.
In his 1986 book, ''War Without Mercy: Race and Power in the Pacific War,'' John W. Dower, a historian at the University of California at San Diego, wrote that American mass-media portrayals of the Japanese as ''subhuman, inhuman, lesser human, superhuman'' were so pervasive during the war that they ''remain latent, capable of being revived by both sides in times of crisis and tension.''
Gerald L. Curtis, the director of the East Asian Institute at Columbia University, expressed concern that anti-Japanese ads were contributing to a cycle of escalating tensions between Japan and the United States.
The advertisers responsible for the ads say they are not meant to offend any group. Brett Shevack defended the Oldsmobile dealers' commercial created by his agency, Partners & Shevack.
''We think it is legitimate to bring in the differing heights because we did it with a sense of humor,'' Mr. Shevack said.
The executive director of the New York-New Jersey-Fairfield County Pontiac Dealers Advertising Association, Robert G. Conroy, said of his group's ''Enough Already'' ads: ''We don't think of them as anti-Japanese. We think of them as pro-American.'' Still, appealing to American nationalism was a conscious part of Pontiac's strategy, said David Deutsch, who runs Deutsch Advertising, the Pontiac dealers' ad agency.
''People are saying, 'We're buying all these Japanese products and they won't let ours in their country,'' he said. '' 'Enough already,' as we say it in the commercials, is our interpretation of the feelings people have.''
Mr. Conroy said he believed that the Pontiac dealers' commercials, which are aimed at men and women between the ages of 26 and 40 with annual household incomes of around $40,000, have been effective. Preliminary sales figures for June, he said, indicate that Pontiac sales among the 86 dealers in his association were the same as last June, despite a 38 percent drop in Pontiac sales in the Northeast during the first half of 1990.
Asked what he would consider going too far in a commercial, Mr. Conroy responded, ''When we mention Pearl Harbor, I guess.''

HEADLINE: Citing Extra Costs at 5 Airports, American Adds Ticket Surcharge

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
American Airlines, reacting to what it calls ''excessive charges'' imposed by five airports, plans to add ticket surcharges of $1 to $4 beginning next week for its flights from those airports.
Some consumer groups are objecting, saying the charges are another example, albeit an unusual one, of how airlines have tried to pass on costs to passengers.
American, the nation's largest airline, said yesterday that it was adding the surcharges on flights from LaGuardia Airport, Newark International Airport and airports in New Orleans, West Palm Beach, Fla., and Fort Myers, Fla. The airline is complaining that the fees it is charged for construction and other projects at these airports are excessive. 
More Than $4 Million crease American's revenues by more than $4 million each year, At La Guardia, the issue centers on the type of floor covering the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is using in a $14 million construction project in a terminal area shared by many airlines. American said the Port Authority had chosen a more expensive material than necessary. A Port Authority spokesman, Bill Cahill, said no other carrier had objected to the project.
Airlines have adopted similar surcharges in the past to pass on costs of fuel, security and other expenses, but rarely have they designated specific airports.
Robert Crandall, president of American, has a reputation for making bold moves - sometimes ruffling passengers' feathers and sometimes caressing them. It was American, for example, that began the frequent-flier program in the early 1980's that is now an industry staple.
Passengers already pay an 8 percent tax on all airline tickets, which is funneled into the Aviation Trust Fund for airport expansion, new air-traffic-control equipment and other improvements. The fund currently has a $6 billion surplus, but critics complain, that the Bush Administration has not used the money in order to help mask the budget deficit.
Legislation that would permit airports to impose a passenger facility charge, about $3, is under consideration in the House of Representatives. The bill, which has the support of the Administration, has mixed support from the airlines. Among its supporters is Mr. Crandall.
Some critics contend that Mr. Crandall is testing the waters with the new surcharges. The surcharges are small enough that they are not expected to significantly affect American's competitive position.
American expects to carry 1.5 million passengers from La Guardia and 455,900 at Newark this year. Based on those projections, the surcharges will generate $1.5 million annually at La Guardia, where the charge will be $1, and $1.8 million at Newark, where the fee will be $4., The surcharge will generate $685,000 at New Orleans, where the cost will be $1.50; $201,000 at West Palm Beach, where the fee will be $1, and $221,000 at Fort Myers, where the surcharge will also be $1.
At Newark, where American is expanding from three to six gates, the Port Authority is charging a higher gate fee than it did Northwest Airlines, which previously used the gates. At New Orleans, American added the surcharge because of what it called ''excessively high landing fees.'' At the two Florida airports, American made general objections to the fees it was charged.
David Shipley, a spokesman for US Air, which also has many flights from Newark and La Guardia, said it had no plans to adopt a similar surcharge, as did Neil Monroe, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines. A spokesman for United Airlines declined to comment.
Some consumer groups and passengers objected strenuously to news of the impending charges, which are scheduled to take effect on Sunday, and some airport officials accused American of using the surcharges as an excuse to raise profits.
''I find it offensive,'' said Chris Witkowski, executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a consumer group based in Washington. Mr. Witkowski said he feared that airlines ''will start assessing surcharges for every expense.''
David Livingston, president of Airline Passengers of North America, a consumer group, also objected. ''Every time the price of a legal pad goes up, you don't automatically pass it on to the client,'' he said.
 
'Need to Recover Costs'
Al Becker, a spokesman for American, a subsidiary of the AMR Corporation, said the surcharges were necessary and were intended merely to compensate for what the airline viewed as excessive airport fees. ''We are running a responsible business here and we need to recover costs,'' he added.
The surcharges will be included in the total fare quoted to consumers, both in telephone inquiries and in advertising.
They will be listed separately, however, on the ticket, and the specific reason for the surcharge will not be listed because of a lack of space, said Tim Smith, another American spokesman.
The surcharges will be added only once on a round-trip ticket and do not apply to connecting passengers.
Robert Inman, properties manager for West Palm Beach Airport, said American was attempting to ''make the public think'' that the surcharge was the airport's fault. He said that the fees American pays at West Palm Beach will actually drop by 14 percent beginning in October.
 
Less Than 10 Percent of Costs
Airports charge the carriers landing fees, based on airplane weight, and monthly rental fees for gates, terminal space and other facilities. These charges account for less than 10 percent of an airline's expenses, said Lee Howard, chairman of Airline Economics, a consulting firm. In recent years, as one or two airlines have come to dominate each airport, the carriers have enjoyed greater influence with airports in negotiating fees, and now have veto power over major expansion projects.
David Blackshear, director of airports for New Orleans, said that while the fees there were among the highest in the country, they were needed to generate the money for airport improvements. ''This is a gimmick to justify increased fares,'' he added. Mr. Blackshear, like other airport officials, said American had yet to inform him of its surcharge plan.
In the early 1980's, when fuel prices soared, many airlines imposed fuel surcharges. More recently, some airlines have imposed fuel surcharges of $5 or less at airports where the costs of the fuel they buy are inflated by local taxes. Such surcharges are not normally shown separately on a ticket. In addition, some airlines, such as Pan American World Airways, add a $5 security surcharge on international flights.
In 1986, American imposed a surcharge at Las Vegas over a dispute with the local authorities over the cost of renting terminal space. Eventually, an agreement was reached with airport officials and the extra fees were dropped.

HEADLINE: For British Politician, Faded Dream Dies

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 8

 BODY:
Dr. David Owen turned 52 years old a few days ago, a month after the failure of his decadelong attempt to create a European-style Social Democratic Party outside the British Labor movement.
''The S.D.P. ended its days as it began,'' its leader said in his office in Parliament the other day, meaning that his party had bowed out of national politics in early June rather than scramble to find a niche further to the right.
His critics, including many of his former allies, believe that much of the failure springs from his own arrogance, a characterization he rejects. But that he has arrived at a dead end is something he does not deny. 
''I expect to be leaving politics at the next election,'' he said, and though he left open the possibility that he might run in his Plymouth Devonport parliamentary constituency, the polls show that he is in trouble even there. ''I think the odds are that it's over,'' he said.
 
Seeking a New Career
He said that he thought it unlikely that the Labor Party would make him an attractive offer to return to the fold, and he said he had been too long away from his medical specialty, the chemistry of the brain, to return to that.
''I'm young enough to have a completely new career outside,'' he said. He talks as if he were reading the want ads, or ready to take one out himself -executive seeks attractive offers from British, American or European companies with a strong interest in international affairs.
Politics is the roughest and most unforgiving business, and few thought a decade ago that the brilliant and self-confident Cambridge-educated doctor, only 38 when he became Foreign Secretary in the Labor Government in 1976, would finish in a political dead end.
Defeat by Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979 turned the Labor Party inward, and in 1981, exasperated by its sharp turn away from Europe, NATO and the realities of the market economy, Dr. Owen and three other Labor notables known as the Gang of Four broke away to form the Social Democrats. #3 Members of Parliament In the mid-1980's, their party seemed to be riding the wave of the future, and in alliance with the old Liberal Party, they seemed to have a good chance of relegating Labor to history. But the alliance fractured after the 1987 elections, the other members of the Gang - William Rodgers, Shirley Williams and Roy Jenkins, now Chancellor of Oxford University - fell away.
When Labor returned to the center ground with new defense and social policies last year, Dr. Owen suddenly seemed to be running a one-man party that had no future.
Early last month, he admitted it. ''We still kept the shell, legally,'' he explained, and with three Members of Parliament the Social Democrats still exist in Westminster. ''But on a membership of 6,000 people you just can't support a national party,'' he acknowledged.
It was only one of many disappointments.
 
Joined for Gaitskell
He said he joined the Labor Party in 1959 to help Hugh Gaitskell, in his struggle against Clause 4 of the party's 1918 constitution calling for ''common ownership of the means of production'' and against the growing movement in support of unilateral nuclear disarmament. ''But Gaitskell turned against British membership in the European Community, and it broke my heart,'' he said.
Critical British commentators have also treated his relationship with the Gang of Four and the Liberals, who changed their name to Liberal Democrats last year, as a series of lovers' quarrels provoked by his refusals to compromise at important points.
Dr. Owen said: ''It was a fatal flaw in the S.D.P.'s history that Roy Jenkins and the other prominent members of the steering committee never said that they thought we should have joint membership with the Liberal Party until after we formed the S.D.P. It was the subject that never dared to speak its name.''
With the strains, and the differences, kept under wraps, the Alliance won 25.4 percent of the vote in the 1983 election, while Labor's share sank to 27.6 under the left-wing leadership of Michael Foot. Though Dr. Owen replaced Roy Jenkins (now Lord Jenkins) as leader after that, he said the damage had been done and that within the Alliance, ''by 1985 the best seats were going to the Liberals.''
 
Surprised by Kinnock
In 1987, the alliance won 22.6 percent, and the Liberals moved to absorb their smaller partners. When Dr. Owen contested the takeover, the alliance was dead, and instead of taking the center ground from Labor, Social Democrats and Liberals were losing it to Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives.
Dr. Owen said the big surprise for him was Neil Kinnock, the former ban-the-bomb campaigner who became Labor's leader in 1983, lost to Mrs. Thatcher in 1987, and has since led his party out of the unilateralist, hard-line socialist desert to a wide lead over the Conservatives in public opinion polls for more than a year.
''I did not expect him to sign up for three British Trident nuclear submarines,'' Dr. Owen said of Mr. Kinnock. ''Whatever one says, it required courage for Neil Kinnock to eat his words. The question now is whether people accept that he really believes these things, and can they hold the center vote for 18 months'' - when he believes Mrs. Thatcher will call the next election.
At the end of the day, he also believes he can take some credit for Labor's transformation. ''If we hadn't done this, the Labor Party wouldn't have changed so fast,'' he said. ''But it isn't a continental social democratic party -not yet.''

HEADLINE: SUPPORT FOR BUSH DECLINES IN POLL

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
In the first public opinion survey to be released since President Bush abandoned his ''no new taxes'' pledge, the Gallup Organization reports that just over half the public disapproves of his new stand while 4 out of 10 approve.
The poll found that Americans were less worried about Mr. Bush's willingness to raise taxes than about other financial matters. Fifty-eight percent said they disapproved of his handling of the savings and loan crisis and 64 percent said they disapproved of his handling of the Federal deficit.
The combination of the President's reversal on taxes and rising disapproval on domestic matters, including the environment, education and the drug war, pushed his overall performance rating down to its lowest level in a year, according to George Gallup Jr. and Dr. Frank Newport, who conducted the survey over the weekend. 
 
A Quarter Disapprove
Still, Mr. Bush remains at least as popular as most modern Presidents at similar points in their terms. Democrats said the poll supported their contention that Mr. Bush's political strength was shaky, but Republicans called the erosion modest and noted that it was heaviest among groups whose support for a Republican President had been surprisingly high until now, notably blacks.
The telephone survey of 1,240 adults found that 63 percent said they approved of the job Mr. Bush was doing; that is down from 69 percent in June and the record 80 percent approval he reached in January, shortly after the invasion of Panama.
It was his lowest rating since May 1989, when 56 percent approved of his performance and 22 percent disapproved. In the latest survey, 24 percent expressed disapproval of Mr. Bush's handling of his job, the highest level of disapproval since he took office. The margin of sampling error for each poll was plus or minus three percentage points.
 
No Mention of Campaign Vow
While some Republican Congressional candidates have been furious with Mr. Bush for abandoning the no-tax pledge that figured so strongly in his 1988 campaign, his political aides say the issue will fade and add that the public will understand that he did what was necessary.
The Gallup question on taxes was worded in a way that may have minimized disapproval with Mr. Bush's position. Making no mention of campaign promises, it asked, ''Do you approve or disapprove of President Bush's recent announcement that he would consider increasing taxes if necessary to reduce the deficit?'' About 54 percent said they disapproved and 41 percent said they approved.
Despite his recent drop, Mr. Bush's standing remains higher than that of his two immediate predecessors after a year and a half in office. During a deep recession in July 1982, Ronald Reagan received a job approval rating of only 42 percent in a Gallup Poll. In July 1978, Jimmy Carter's approval rating was 40 percent.
Gallup noted that Mr. Bush's approval rating was similar to that of three other Presidents at a similar point: Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon.
Mr. Bush's standing on foreign policy remains strong, Gallup said. Eighty-two percent of the public approved of his handling of relations with the Soviet Union, and 62 percent expressed overall approval of his handling of foreign policy.
Asked to cite Mr. Bush's greatest achievement, 37 percent mentioned foreign policy, particularly the changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. In February, 18 percent mentioned the Panama invasion and 9 percent mentioned the war on drugs. But by last week both had faded, with only 3 percent mentioning Panama and 4 percent mentioning drugs.
 
G.O.P.'s Forecast: Sunny
The survey matches the findings of recent polls conducted for Republican candidates. A Republican who has analyzed the data said Mr. Bush was losing support among people who had no clear reason to be with him in the first place.
Among blacks, Gallup said, approval of Mr. Bush's performance fell to 42 percent in July from 58 percent in February, while disapproval rose from 28 percent to 42 percent. The margin of sampling error for subgroups is larger than for the population as a whole.
The survey said Mr. Bush's support fell noticeably among conservative Democrats. Gallup said this was significant because these voters often support Republican Presidential candidates.
But Robert Teeter, a poll taker whose clients include the Republican National Committee, said the falloff he had noted was among low-income whites, who tend to be more strongly Democratic in any case. Selection Research (Gallup)

HEADLINE: Budget Talks Resume Amid Brewing Dispute Over Cuts in Military

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
After a break of almost two weeks for the Fourth of July recess, White House and Congressional budget negotiators resumed their bargaining today amid a brewing dispute among Democrats over military spending.
The dispute is twofold: not only how much to cut military costs, but also whether those cuts should fall more heavily on personnel or on weapons programs. It pits Senator Sam Nunn, the conservative Georgian who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, against Democratic colleagues in both the Senate and the House of Representatives who favor deeper Pentagon cuts than he has recommended.
Senator Nunn has proposed that the Pentagon spend $10.5 billion less next year than in the current fiscal year, after adjustment for inflation. That cut would be more than three times the one recommended by the Bush Administration, and about what the House approved in a budget bill adopted in May. 
But liberal Democrats in both houses favor Pentagon cuts of at least $13 billion, and the budget negotiators, looking for ways to slash $50 billion to $60 billion from next year's Federal deficit, have yet to reach a compromise.
 
Two Military Spending Plans
''I suspect that if anything comes out of this summit at all, then we are going to have to cut $13 billion,'' said Senator Jim Exon, a Nebraska Democrat who serves on the Armed Services and the Budget committees in the Senate. ''If we can't get to $13 billion, then we are not doing our job.''
Enter Senator Nunn, whose Armed Services Committee today began drafting the legislation that sets annual program guidelines for the military. Impatient with the pace of the budget negotiations, he has directed his subcommittee chairmen to come up with two military spending plans: one following his recommendations, the other assuming the $13 billion in cuts.
But liberal Democrats charge that Mr. Nunn is rigging the numbers to show that Draconian cuts in personnel would be needed to meet the Budget Committee's recommended spending level. ''Senator Nunn is not setting the defense numbers for the negotiators,'' said Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Budget Committee and is a member of the negotiating team.
The spending figures Senator Nunn has proposed would reduce troop strength next year by 100,000 from the current 2.1 million. Congressional officials familiar with today's closed deliberations of the Armed Services Committee say the figures Mr. Nunn is using to illustrate the deeper spending cuts that liberals favor would reduce troop strength by 285,000.
 
Politically Sensitive Cuts
''We're going to show that you can get it out of personnel or procurement,'' Mr. Nunn said, defending his methodology. The problem, he added, is that if the cuts come from procurement, lawmakers would have to slash the long-term military budget well below the levels that even liberals are recommending.
Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said a cut of $13 billion in military spending would be ''devastating to the all-volunteer force and extremely unfair to the men and women who have made a commitment to serve.''
Personnel cuts are the most politically sensitive in the military budget, and liberals insist that the savings they seek could be achieved less painfully with cuts in major weapons programs like the B-2 bomber or the ''Star Wars'' anti-missile defense system. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has already called for a reduction in purchases of the B-2 to nearly half of the 132 planes the Pentagon had sought.
But many Congressional Democrats, and some Republicans, favor outright cancellation of the program. Mr. Cheney, who cut short a trip to Europe and the Near East this week to participate in the budget deliberations, is expected to meet with the negotiators when talks resume on Wednesday.
In a related development today, the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, reiterated President Bush's support for a proposed constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. In testimony before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Darman said such an amendment would provide a strong incentive for the White House and Congress to reach ''a politically negotiated settlement'' on the budget.
The proposed amendment is scheduled to come before the House next week.

HEADLINE: For New York, Happier Days

 BODY:
The Democrats could not have picked a better time for the announcement expected today that they'll hold their 1992 convention in New York City. Much of the news emanating from the city lately has focused on racial strife, crime and a growing impatience of New Yorkers about life in their city. But as the Democrats' impending choice demonstrates, New York remains a vibrant political capital. Mayor David Dinkins deserves a salute for his energy in making that choice happen. 
New York is a media center. It is, especially for Democrats, a fund-raising center. It certainly knows how to throw a party, as it has demonstrated so many times - with the Bicentennial and Operation Sail (1976), Liberty Weekend (1986), the 1976 and 1980 Democratic National Conventions and the recent celebrations for Nelson Mandela.
Such events always boost the economy and, perhaps more important, the city's morale and stature. The Bicentennial celebration and 1976 Democratic convention went a long way toward repairing the city's image when it was struggling with fiscal disaster. Despite its problems, the city is in better shape today, but Mayor Dinkins may well have had that summer in mind when he began his successful campaign for the 1992 convention.
Many factors led to the Democratic National Committee's choice. It helped that Ron Brown, the national chairman, is from New York and an old friend of the Mayor's. It helped, too, that the Louisiana legislature passed the strictest anti-abortion bill in the country, turning many Democrats against the other convention finalist, New Orleans.
But it's likely that, without Mr. Dinkins, the 1992 Democratic Convention would be somewhere other than in New York City. The Mayor put his charm and energies behind the city's effort months ago, when the idea of wooing the Democrats seemed a long shot and the city's efforts were flagging because City Hall was in transition. Mr. Dinkins did a superb job of persuasion, making a more personal, persistent pitch than his competitors did.
City officials, working with a host committee, put together an attractive proposal for the Democrats. The planning should help in 1992, as will a renovation of Madison Square Garden. The building's new shape will make the convention floor less cramped than in 1980. The city also plans to use the Javits Convention Center and the Fashion Institute of Technology for party caucuses and media space.
With the rise of the primary election campaigns, the nominating conventions no longer choose nominees. But thanks to the Dinkins drive, the Democrats have made a clear choice of where to ratify their nominee. For New York City, that means happier days are here again.

HEADLINE: What Fundamentalism Offers Arab World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In attributing the victory of the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria's regional elections to deteriorating economic conditions alone (''Militant Muslims Grow Stronger as Algeria's Economy Weakens,'' front page, June 25), you ignore the more pervasive causes of the Islamic revival in much of the Arab world.
What brought the fundamentalists to the fore in Algeria and elsewhere is the prevailing stasis in the condition of Arab society. The dual goals of modernization and democratization without, however, disturbing the traditional mores and juristic imperatives of Islam have long eluded Arab regimes. In the early 1960's, while Amar Ouzegane, a leading National Liberation Front fighter and minister in the first Algerian Government after independence, was incarcerated by the French in Fresnes prison, he wrote ''Le Meilleur Combat'' (''The More Worthy Struggle''), an incisive search for Algeria's national ethos. 
In it he criticized the Algerian Communist Party, to which he once belonged, for failing to realize that a modern-day rebel could quite normally be at the same time a student of the Koran, Marxism and the principles of objective criticism. A stimulating thought, but in reality the incompatibilities are quite obvious.
Nor did ideological alternatives abound. Soviet Communism was shunned as too alien and materialistic, while the more familiar Western capitalism was burdened by the offenses of colonialism, of which the tragedy of Palestine continues to fester.
At a recent colloquium organized by the leading Cairo daily, Al-Ahram, Egyptian educators and authors gathered to consider the effects on Muslim society of the changes taking place in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The consensus that emerged was not unpredictable: The reconciliation between East and West - now that Communism has disintegrated and Western culture has prevailed - presents the Muslim world with a fatal challenge that only a revitalized Islam can meet and overcome.
It seems to me that the merchants of the Aguiba marketplace in Algiers and their more illustrious compatriots in Cairo have, in their own quite different ways, spoken the same basic message.

HEADLINE: Increases Voted on Rent-Stabilized Units

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
In a decision that dissatisfied both landlords and tenants, the New York City Rent Guidelines Board last night approved rent increases of 4.5 percent for one-year leases and 7 percent for two-year leases in rent-stabilized apartments.
Leases on about two-thirds of New York's 840,000 rent-stabilized apartments are expected to be renewed under the guidelines, which will affect leases signed between Oct. 1 of this year and Sept. 30 of next year.
The board also voted to allow owners to increase the rent by an additional 5 percent after a tenant leaves a rent-stabilized unit, and it decided to do away with a surcharge on apartments that rent at very low rates. The surcharge, which has generally been $5 or $10 a month, was dubbed the ''poor tax'' by tenant leaders because it primarily affected low-income tenants. 
The vote came after an unusually raucous three-hour session in the auditorium at One Police Plaza, during which at least 300 landlords and 100 to 200 tenants chanted, demonstrated and generally tried to silence board members with whom they disagreed. The meeting was halted a half-dozen times because board members could not hear one another amid the uproar.
 
Rent-Controlled Apartments
The rent increases were approved by a vote of 5-to-4. The board's two landlord representatives and two tenant representatives all voted against the rent increases. The five nonpartisan representatives, all of them appointed by Mayor David N. Dinkins, voted in favor.
Rent stabilization generally covers apartments in buildings constructed between 1947 and 1974 and those built after 1974 with city tax abatements.
There are another 140,000 apartments in the city that are governed by rent control. These are in buildings constructed before 1947. By law, owners cannot raise rents on rent-controlled apartments by more than 7.5 percent a year. The maximum increase permitted each year for such units is set by the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
In May, the Rent Board proposed increases of 3 percent on one-year leases and 5 percent on two-year leases for rent-stabilized apartments. The proposal, if approved, would have been the lowest increases ever granted.
 
'It's a Disaster'
Landlord representatives contended in public hearings last month and again last night that the proposed increases would not come close to meeting their increased costs over the last year, including sharply higher property taxes and additional fuel and labor costs.
After the board approved the increases of 4.5 and 7 percent, John J. Gilbert 3d, the president of the largest owner's group, the Rent Stabilization Association, said that it would not be enough even to pay for many owners' increased property-tax bills. ''It's a disaster,'' he said.
Tenants insisted that rents should be frozen because increases granted in previous years had been unconscionably high.
''The owners don't need rent increases,'' said Michael McKee, the director of the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition. The approved rent increase ''is going to be a burden to many tenants,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Rinfret and London Slug It Out as Cuomo Steps Deftly Aside

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
While Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was campaigning upstate yesterday, two opponents spent most of a half hour in a Manhattan television studio challenging each other's credentials and credibility.
''It's sort of like putting on Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark,'' said Michael Kinsley, a senior editor of New Republic magazine, in introducing the candidates on William F. Buckley's ''Firing Line'' program. The taped program was to be the first involving all three candidates, but the Governor declined to participate.
His two opponents, Pierre A. Rinfret, the Republican, and Herbert London, the Conservative, participated with a vengeance on and off the air that belied the fact that Republicans had tried to persuade Mr. London to be Mr. Rinfret's running mate for lieutenant governor. 
 
Strong Differences Apparent
Their sniping could help Mr. Cuomo win a third term by dividing the anti-Cuomo vote. Mr. London and Conservative leaders have said that a major goal is to become the principal alternative to Mr. Cuomo and what Mr. London calls the ''Demrep Party.''
The candidates' strong differences also pointed up what many believe is an ideological struggle in the Republican Party between what Mr. London called ''Rockefeller Republicans'' and ''Reagan Republicans.'' Mr. Rinfret's chief sponsor, State Senator Roy M. Goodman, the Manhattan Republican leader, is considered one of the state's more liberal Republicans.
Mr. Rinfret, an economist, said Mr. London, a New York University dean, was trying to ''destroy'' the Republican Party, while Mr. London said Mr. Rinfret had ''no particular interest or knowledge about the issues of the campaign.''
''Herb is off on the wrong foot,'' said Mr. Rinfret. ''He and I have a common enemy, and the enemy is Cuomo, not each other.''
He said the Republican Party was ''rather courageous, rather daring and rather innovative'' in going ''outside the party'' to nominate him.
 
'Political Amnesia' Charged
Mr. London, who was a Manhattan Republican district leader until his recent resignation, chided Mr. Rinfret for having ''political amnesia'' in saying that he was an enrolled Republican who voted last year, when Board of Elections records show otherwise, and for denying that he had asked Mr. London to be his lieutenant-governor running mate at a three-hour Memorial Day meeting in Mr. Rinfret's Fifth Avenue apartment.
Mr. Rinfret said the purpose of the meeting was ''just to say hello to each other.''
Mr. London said he wanted to change the Republican Party leadership, including the State Senate's Republican leadership, which he said was responsible, along with Mr. Cuomo, for the state's fiscal problems. Despite that criticism, almost all Republican state senators, including the majority leader, Senator Ralph J. Marino, have been endorsed by the Conservative Party.
Trying to outdo each other as fiscal conservatives, Mr. Rinfret appeared to disagree with President Bush. Saying ''a mistake has been made in not controlling spending at the Federal level and trying to make up in a tax increase,'' the candidate added that the Bush tax program was still veiled in ''a fog.''
 
Cuomo on Campaign Trail
While his opponents were battling each other, Mr. Cuomo was touring plants in Big Flats and Horseheads, participating in a tree-planting ceremony in Elmira and speaking to the New York Sheriffs Association convention in Corning.
In the ''Firing Line'' debate, Mr. London accused Mr. Rinfret of ''excoriating'' President Reagan for his 1982 tax cuts. Mr. Rinfret replied that Mr. London was ''loaded with misknowledge'' and that he had favored the tax reduction but had warned against ''mega deficits.''
The tone of the program was set at the outset when Mr. Kinsley, in introducing Mr. Rinfret, referred to questions about Mr. Rinfret's claim to hold a doctorate, while emphasizing that Mr. London had ''earned'' a doctorate. Mr. Rinfret smiled wanly but did not respond.
Mr. Buckley, responding to a Kinsley question, declined to endorse either candidate. But a June 25 editorial in the National Review, the magazine Mr. Buckley edits, questioned Mr. Rinfret's credentials and said that state Republican leaders had nominated ''pushover nobodies'' for governor. Noting Mr. London's candidacy, the National Review continued: ''Real Republicans won't have to think very hard about whom to vote for.''
The ''Firing Line'' program will be aired on the last weekend of the month.

HEADLINE: Many Drug Dealers Found With Jobs

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Many street-level drug dealers in the District of Columbia hold legitimate jobs and spend less than four hours a day hustling cocaine, heroin and other drugs, a study made public yesterday says.
The $300,000 study, financed by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Rand Corporation, found that the dealers typically earn $30 an hour from drug sales with annual incomes averaging $24,000 to $43,000, the study found.
David Tell, the deputy chief of staff to William J. Bennett, the Director of National Drug Control Policy, said that while the people who wrote the study cautioned against extrapolating their findings nationally, their work ''tends to confirm the operative assumptions of a lot of experts.''
 
Study Based on 186 People
The study was based on criminal records, police statistics and interviews with 186 people from 18 to 40 years old who identified themselves as dealers and who had been convicted and placed on probation for drug offenses and other crimes. 
The study did not include those with long criminal histories and those who managed to elude the police. It also did not include juveniles who have been arrested in increasing numbers for drug-selling offenses.
The researchers said their estimates on income might be somewhat low because of some of the people omitted from the study. They also noted that because the last data were gathered in 1988, the study does not reflect what is believed to be a slight decline in drug activity in Washington and, presumably, a drop in dealers' incomes.
The study estimated that there are some 24,000 street-level drug dealers in Washington, about 4 percent of the total population, including about 11,600 dealers who sold drugs a few hours a day and nearly 13,000 who sold one day a week or less.
Two-thirds of those whose records were reviewed and three-quarters of those interviewed said they had held legitimate jobs while they sold drugs. Several worked as deliverymen, office clerks, cooks and construction laborers. One said he was a letter carrier and another said he had been the assistant manager of a pharmacy.
 
Results Surprise Researchers
The researchers said they had not expected to find so many dealers legitimately employed and had not thought to include in their survey a question about why the dealers chose to work at regular jobs that paid an average of $7 an hour instead of devoting all their time to the more lucrative drug trade.
But Peter Reuter, a 45-year-old economist who was the principal researcher, said in an interview that he believed the nature of the drug market dictated dealers' working hours. Sales are most lively from about 6 P.M. to 10 P.M. daily, he said, and on weekends.
''You can't say I'm making $30 an hour so let me work 50 hours,'' Mr. Reuter said. ''because the market doesn't support that. It's hard to turn drug selling into a primary job in terms of time.''
In a briefing on the study yesterday in Washington. Karen Hastie Williams, the chairwoman of a civic organization called the Committee on Strategies to Reduce Chronic Poverty, which had requested the study, said her group had hoped ''to identify employment and training strategies to convince drug dealers to end their involvement in the underground economy and join the legitimate work force.''
But, she said, ''the findings indicate that a job alone does not offer enough of an incentive to lure current adult dealers away from the trade.''
 
How to Stop the Dealing
Ms. Williams said the committee has concluded that instead of trying to convert drug dealers, the ''only way to reduce drug dealing'' is to persuade Americans to stop buying.
Mr. Reuter said: ''Even creation of considerably higher paying legitimate jobs probably wouldn't get us very far. Dealers would still have smaller total incomes than they can earn now by supplementing their regular wages with drug selling.''
Another disincentive to leave the trade, the researchers found, was that more than three-quarters of the dealers used drugs themselves and through their work, were able to get discounts to sustain their habits. They reported typically spending $400 a month on drugs in addition to what they withheld from sales.

HEADLINE: Education;
The Lessons Learned When College Officials Run Public Schools

BYLINE: SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHELSEA, MASS.

 BODY:
A year after Boston University became the first college to run an entire public school system, the schools of this poor, largely immigrant community are catching up but are not yet in the vanguard of public education.
This closely watched educational experiment offers lessons both sobering and encouraging to a nation struggling to revive failing schools. The experiment is encountering the perils of local politics, the promise of new ideas, the importance of money and a continuing debate about the merits of top-down versus bottom-up management.
 
Money Still Lacking
While Boston University managers have hired a widely praised bilingual Superintendent and started some promising test programs, they have so fair failed to raise enough money to tackle the most ambitious and innovative part of their program: transforming schools into health- and family-education centers to reach preschoolers and parents.
Boston University set as its goal nothing less than the transformation of Chelsea schools, now among the worst in the state. Plagued by high dropout and pregnancy rates and rock-bottom standardized test scores, Chelsea schools were also starved of money by a town with one of the lowest average incomes in Massachusetts. 
The university and its president, John Silber, outlined sweeping plans for Chelsea. The goal is to place day care centers, preschool programs, health clinics and adult education programs in each school; develop individual learning plans for each student; pair each child in a single-parent family with an adult mentor; offer more training opportunities for teachers; begin moral education courses to combat teen-age pregnancy, and replace school buildings dating before 1908.
 
A 10-Year Agreement
The School Committee of Chelsea, just across the Mystic River from Boston, signed a 10-year contract with the university, retaining the power to override most major decisions by a two-thirds majority and to dismiss the university by a simple majority vote.
In this first year, university managers have offered teachers their first opportunities for further training and installed computers in offices and classrooms. In the fall, all-day kindergarten will begin and a health clinic will open in a high school reorganized to combat low attendance and high dropout rates with individual attention.
But Mr. Silber, whose criticism of Chelsea schools and prescriptions for cures drew national attention and Chelsea indignation, is now focused on his gubernatorial race. And Boston University is paying dearly for what several Chelsea groups see as an arrogant and authoritarian stance, with protracted political battles, two lawsuits and a teachers' contract signed on the second-to-last day of school, after eight months of negotiations.
 
'Another Layer of Bureaucracy'
Both admirers and detractors say it is too early to judge whether Chelsea schools, and the 3,650 children they serve, have actually improved. But they offer widely differing forecasts.
''We felt most strongly that since the Chelsea school system is 52 percent Latino students, if some change is going to take place, involving parents would be something new,'' said Juan R. Vega, a plaintiff in a lawsuit charging that Boston University's agreement with Chelsea's School Committee is unconstitutional. ''But we just ended up with another layer of bureaucracy.''
By contrast, Maria Ayala, who joined a Boston University program that teaches Spanish-speaking parents to read English books to their children, said: ''Things are better for my kids and for me too. Sometimes my daughter tells me something in English, I don't understand. So now I do.''
The other day, Mrs. Ayala sat in a classroom reading Robert McCloskey's classic children's books, slowly repeating the English words and, in Spanish, discussing their meaning. The theme for that week was ducks, in honor of ''Make Way for Ducklings,'' Mr. McCloskey's best-loved story. Downstairs, her children listened as a teacher read a book about ducks and played alphabet games that would help prepare them to read.
 
Literacy Program a Success
This intergenerational literacy program is one of the university's clear success stories in a tumultuous year that underscores just how difficult it is to change a school system.
Diana Lam, Chelsea's new Superintendent, arrived in September to find schools in what she called ''a time warp.'' There were no office computers, no central list of parents. Teachers were not allowed time off from their classrooms to learn other teaching methods. The newest school building dated from 1908. More than half of Chelsea's parents, many of whom are immigrants from Latin America or Southeast Asia, do not speak English at home and do not have a high school diploma.
She and the Boston University management team also had to face teachers demoralized by the university's widely publicized condemnation of Chelsea schools. In addition, they had to contend with Hispanic organizations; long shut out of local politics, they also felt excluded from the Boston University agreement. Meanwhile, School Committee members were shocked to discover that the agreement they had signed stripped them of long-held powers, and parents did not understand what the changes meant for their children.
Money remains an obstacle. Under the terms of its agreement with Chelsea, Boston University pledged to raise money from foundations and other donors for special programs, while Chelsea would pay teachers' salaries and other regular school costs.
 
Failures in Raising Money
But Boston University has raised only $2.1 million of the $3 million budgeted for this past year, partly because a Massachusetts recession has curbed donors' generosity. Only about $1 million of the money raised was actually available this past school year, and most was spent on computers and pilot programs like after-school classes.
In addition, from an expected school budget of $14 million, officials had to cut $686,000 because Chelsea's aldermen refused to ask voters for more taxes.
Peter R. Greer, Boston University's dean of education and the overseer of the Chelsea project, said the budget cuts would probably mean laying off some teachers, enlarging class sizes and delaying a planned alternative school for older high school students.
 
'That Hurts Me the Most'
More troubling is the lag in fund raising, which has stalled what Mr. Greer calls the centerpiece of the university's program: establishing clinics and day care centers so that preschoolers are physically and intellectually ready to start school at age 5, and drawing up individual lesson plans for each school student. ''That hurts me the most,'' he said.
Within these constraints, the new managers tried to put their mark on Chelsea. To raise teachers' morale, Ms. Lam offered small grants for teachers to try new projects, convened a teachers' advisory board, compiled a calendar and booklet honoring teachers, and tried teaching a third-grade class.
The new contract raises teachers' pay, which had been among the lowest in the state, to $21,640 at the start by September 1991, from $18,000. Many teachers said the raises were not enough.
To reach out to parents, Ms. Lam held drop-in coffees, played host to a Spanish and English cable television program, asked parents to evaluate the schools in writing and sent newsletters written in the languages of the parents: Spanish, Khmer, Vietnamese and English.
 
Seminars on Theories
Boston University education school professors offered several seminars on educational theories and techniques that are standard training in many school systems, but were firsts in Chelsea: how to teach children from different cultures, how to ''mainstream'' Spanish-speaking pupils in English-speaking classrooms, how to help children learn from each other, what's new in early childhood education. Elementary school teachers could also take week-long sabbaticals to observe teachers in well-regarded programs nearby.
''I've been here 17 years, and this is the first year we've had this,'' said Brenda Berkeley, a first-grade bilingual teacher who found the workshops invaluable. ''It's exciting working with B.U., and I look forward to the next year with them.''
Ms. Lam also took aim at the high school after she encountered a teacher with his arms full of pink slips showing how many eighth graders cut class that morning alone. She asked that starting in the second semester, teachers form a team to teach eighth graders only, so that these students would get more attention. When she learned that almost half the high school students had failed two or more courses in the first quarter, she called on volunteers to act as coaches and organized after-school alternative courses for credit.
Saying that they had been ineffective, she replaced the popular high school principal, as well as four teachers, at the end of the year. This fall, the high school will be divided into a traditional school and a ''Renaissance school,'' in which students can enroll to work more closely with teachers on interdisciplinary subjects.
 
'The Patient Was Bleeding'
Mr. Vega and teachers' union representatives accuse her of acting too hastily and arbitrarily. But she said: ''We couldn't afford to wait because we would lose these kids. The patient was bleeding.''
The debate about these decisions reflects broader, unresolved questions that continue to hobble the Chelsea experiment. Is strong management from the top, the model Boston University negotiated, the most effective way to change a system, or must consensus be laboriously built up from the bottom, as in the school-based management programs now in vogue among educators?
Mr. Greer said that he regretted failing to consult and placate many interest groups initially, but that he and Ms. Lam had since reached out only to find many groups whose priority is political power, not educational progress.
''Our management contract is set up to allow us to really lead, not to be arrogant dictators, but to avoid what Boston goes through, dealing with every group, every faction, and then nothing gets done,'' he said. ''We seek their ideas, but this is not a 50-50 partnership. We're putting our reputation and money on the line and the kids can't wait.''
 
'Colonial Relationship'
Michael Heichman, a teachers' union official who has taught in Chelsea for 20 years, said he supported many of the changes, but resented Boston University's attitude. ''This is a colonial kind of relationship,'' he said. ''If they had come in a cooperative way, involved teachers and the community more, I think they would be further ahead. My hope is they will see the light and start repairing the damage.''
Ms. Lam said sometimes the calls for involvement were arbitrary. She said she once tried, for example, to call each school committee member to tell them about a personnel appointment she wanted to make. Some did not return her calls, she said, yet were angry that she had not told them about the decision in advance.
Mr. Greer said he hoped that suspicions would fade next year as more programs got under way and more children felt the effect of Boston University's changes. Despite the grumbling, all sides say they want change.
''People are waiting to see,'' said Carmen Hernandez, whose two children attend Chelsea schools. ''I'm not too worried about the fact that the schools committee lost power. The committee has always been in charge and we did need help. Parents expected change to be fast, and it didn't happen real quick. But I feel optimistic.''

Who Should Set Margin Levels?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
With the financial futures industry fearing for its future, and some parts of the securities industry warning of a financial crisis unless there is reform, pressure is building for Congress to control just how much risk speculators can take when they use the futures market to bet on whether stock prices will rise or fall.
A major issue in the debate over the Administration's proposal for changes in regulation of financial markets, on which the Senate Banking Committee will resume hearings today, is whether the Government should set limits on margins - the amount of money an investor must put up to take a position in the market.
 
Redesigning the Ship
''Any financial regulatory system has to be designed so that the ship is strong enough to remain afloat in a storm, not just on a bright sunny day,'' said Richard C. Breeden, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''The current margin system for futures doesn't pass that test with the level of certainty and assurance that we would like.''
Those opposed to changes in margin requirements assert that they may destroy the financial futures markets by robbing them of the liquidity needed to operate and may drive business to overseas markets. 
''Put a tax on us by raising margins, and see how long it takes to lose another industry to foreign countries,'' said William J. Brodsky, the president and chief executive of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The debate in some ways recalls the debates that followed the crash of 1929, which led to Federal regulation of stock market margins. Beginning in 1934, they were set by the Federal Reserve and now stand at 50 percent, although professional traders can effectively cut that in half. Investors in stock index futures, however, although they effectively own stocks, put up far less, as little as 3 percent of the value of the underlying stocks.
The bill backed by the Treasury Department would transfer authority over the stock index futures market to the S.E.C. The proposal is bitterly opposed by the futures markets and by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which now regulates the markets but can rule on margins only in emergencies.
As the hearings begin, some in the securities industry who favor the bill see an uphill struggle. ''The President needs to really push this bill if it is going to pass,'' said one executive, who asked not to be identified.
Exchanges now set margins in the futures markets, and they have varied sharply. In 1987 and 1989, the margins required for some buyers of stock index contracts at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell to as low as 2.2 percent, while margins at the New York Financial Exchange dipped below 2 percent.
Stock index futures contracts are based on the value of the stocks in an underlying index, with the Standard & Poor's 500, traded at the Chicago Merc, being the most popular. The contract can trade for more or less than the value of the stocks until a certain date, when it expires and is guaranteed to be worth the same as the underlying index. In general, a buyer of such a contract will profit if stock prices rise while he holds it. The seller will profit if prices fall.
Although both stock and futures markets use the term margin, the concepts are different. When an investor buys stock, the entire amount is paid to the seller, although the buyer may borrow up to half the amount from a brokerage firm as a margin loan. In a futures contract, the margin is simply a guarantee that the investor will be able to make good on any losses that may occur. Both buyer and seller in the futures market put up margins, but those margins need not be in cash. Often, Treasury bills are used.
The futures exchanges say they have adjusted margins in line with volatility, a move that Mr. Breeden, among others, said threatened to bring down financial markets in 1987 and 1989. Although margins were low before the falls, they were raised sharply directly afterward, forcing traders to come up with an additional $500 million almost immediately in 1989.
''In the midst of a crisis, the futures markets were raising margins, draining credit from a market that was already under enormous stress,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''So you can have a small fall in the market turned into a gigantic crisis because of the excessive leverage that people were allowed to incur,'' he said.
Mr. Breeden said it would make more sense to have higher margins in calm times - perhaps 12 percent to 15 percent - with the ability to lower them if needed in a crisis. It is clearly not necessary to raise them as high as stocks, he said.
There are actually two margin levels for stock index futures traders. The higher one is for self-described speculators, and the lower is for professional traders on the exchange floors and for traders hedging positions in other markets. For example, an institution that owned stocks and wanted to reduce its market risk by selling an index future would be considered a hedger.
In practice, critics say, many traders who qualify for the lower margins are speculators. ''Have you ever looked at who gets a hedging margin?'' Mr. Breeden asked. ''It's who asks for it. Effectively, you self-certify your eligibility.''
Just how much speculation takes place via stock index futures is a subject of much discussion. The futures industry generally plays down the amount, and some critics suggest it may be substantial. For an investor who wants to bet on rising, or falling, stock prices, futures clearly offer the chance for much quicker profits than stocks, albeit at a higher risk.
Were margins for professionals to be raised sharply, futures officials say, there would be less trading because some traders would be priced out of the market. That, they say, would reduce liquidity and increase volatility. Some stock traders argue the reverse, contending that futures traders' ability to trade on low margins now increases current volatility.
''The main point is that people with very little cash are having a disproportionate affect on the equity market,'' said Richard Cantor, president of Neuberger & Berman, a New York money management firm that has campaigned for higher futures margins. ''We think it is established, as a matter of national policy, that people without cash ought not to be able to speculate in the equity markets. That is what has gone amiss.''
Futures industry officials contend there is no need to change the system. ''The margin policies that the futures exchanges have pursued have really worked,'' said Steven Manaster, the chief economist of the C.F.T.C. ''There have not been any defaults.'' Many strategies who use stock index futures can also use stock index options, which are similar in many ways. Options margins are regulated by the S.E.C., and some in the futures industry have seized on that fact to argue that the S.E.C.'s failure to raise them shows that it knows no increase is needed, and is using the issue to gain authority over stock index futures.
Mr. Breeden said he believed option margins should be raised, but that it would be pointless without a similar rise in the futures markets. ''It wouldn't reduce leverage in the markets; it would just transfer that leverage to the futures markets,'' he said.
A possible problem in the system now is that each futures exchange sets its own margins, and they have sometimes seemed to compete by lowering margins to attract business. More Government oversight could end that competition.
At the moment, futures margins are relatively high. To buy or sell a single S.&P. 500 futures contract, representing about $178,000 in stock values, a speculator must put up $21,000, an amount that was raised by $1,000 late last month. Last summer, the figure was as low as $5,400. The requirements for hedgers and professional traders have risen over that period to $7,500, from $4,000.
Just why the margins have risen so far is a matter of dispute. Mr. Breeden has noted that they also rose in 1988, when the Reagan Administration was considering whether to take action, and began falling after it decided not to do so. He questioned whether a new fall would soon begin, if the current bill is defeated.
Todd Petzel, the chief economist of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said much of this year's increase was brought on by concern over volatility in Japan, where share prices fell sharply early this year, and not by politics.

Deregulation: The Good News

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHEN most people think about deregulation these days they are apt to focus on the dubious pleasures of selecting a long-distance phone company or pleading for service from the local cable television monopolist - or worse, on the sheer gall of the savings and loan bandits who made off with the keys to the United States Mint.
But when Clifford Winston ponders deregulation, he is more likely to savor the unambiguous victories of market over bureaucrat in the transportation industry.
In earlier research, Mr. Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution, measured savings from the deregulation of the airline industry. A combination of more efficient ''hub and spoke'' route structures and more flexible pricing, he argued, saved the public some $8 billion annually. Now, in collaboration with Thomas Corsi, Carol Evans and Curtis Grimm, he has estimated the even greater gain from unleashing the long-haul trucking and rail industries in 1980. 
''The Economic Effects of Surface Freight Deregulation,'' published by Brookings, may not make the best-seller list. But the economists' conclusion, that a freer market in transportation is saving the nation a remarkable $18 billion a year, should tame nostalgia for the good old days when Washington tried to fine-tune the needs of regulated businesses and their customers.
Trains and trucks, sometime rivals in the freight business, suffered from very different regulatory maladies. Railroads were ponderous enterprises, hauling too little freight over too many miles of track because the Interstate Commerce Commission refused to let them abandon service to declining mill towns in the Rust Belt. Worse, from the railroads' perspective, the commission denied carriers the right to pass along the costs of inefficient operations to their customers.
The regulators kept a tight lid on rates for coal, chemicals and grain, where railroads had little effective competition and might have made money by playing hardball with shippers. That left the railroads in the hopeless position of trying to cover their overhead on low-bulk commodities - machinery, processed foods and the like - where trucks could offer swift door-to-door service over the heavily subsidized interstate highway system. By the late 1970's, decades of anemic profits had brought the industry to the edge of collapse.
Truckers, by contrast, were mostly fat and happy - but only at the expense of captive customers, who paid rates high enough to cover both the industry's hefty profits and the waste generated by Soviet-style regulation. Under the archaic system invented in the 1930's Washington granted licenses for every route and every commodity, blocking the entry of competitors whenever the established carriers objected.
Partial deregulation of the railroads in 1980 permitted the carriers to abandon one-fifth of their track mileage and to negotiate long-term contracts on any terms shippers would accept. Posted rates to the general shipping public can no longer be challenged unless they are at least 80 percent above operating costs, giving the railroads substantial room to cover their overhead on shipments of bulk commodities.
But the extra revenue has not been wasted. Improvements in the speed and reliability of rail service have generated a net benefit for customers of around $6 billion a year.
Separate legislation that same year broke the back of the truck cartel, eliminating monopoly power and forcing trucking companies to trim the fat from their route systems. Wide-open entry eliminated the most egregious source of waste in trucking - the empty backhaul, in which trucks returned home without cargo because they lacked licenses to carry available freight.
Not surprisingly, some of the shippers' benefit has come at the expense of trucking company stockholders and teamsters' union drivers. What may be surprising, though, is that this $5 billion redistribution of income represents just one-third of the shippers' total savings. The other two-thirds is pure efficiency gain - a potent implication of the price Americans have paid for Government meddling with transportation markets.
Could a good thing be made better? Mr. Winston and his co-authors have a wish list: deregulation of intrastate trucking, a tougher merger policy for railroads, the elimination of Government rules that make it more profitable for railroads to lease out boxcars than use them on their own tracks. But the economists are not about to lose sight of the proverbial forest. America's grandest experiment with economic deregulation has also been its most successful.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Notes and Bonds Down

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds fell again and interest rates rose further yesterday despite a highly successful auction of $5 billion worth of new 30-year bonds offered by the Resolution Funding Corporation, the Federal agency charged with financing the savings and loan bailout.
Traders said bidders were inticed by the price declines over the last three sessions - a drop that has pushed up long-term bond yields by about 20 basis points, or hundredths of a point, from late Thursday.
Indeed, bids at the auction produced an average yield of 8.93 percent, 38.5 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds at the time of the auction.
''With a spread of about 38 basis points over the long bond, there was very, very good demand'' for the new securities, one government bond trader said. ''And the reason demand was so good is that it is priced so well.'' 
The issue traded well after the auction results were announced.
By late in the day, the bonds were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.91 percent.
 
Sale Was Mixed Blessing
For Refcorp, which struggled through the two 40-year bond auctions earlier in the year, yesterday's sale was a mixed blessing.
On the positive side, demand for the securities was unusually large.
Nearly $15.5 billion worth of bids were received for the $5 billion of securities that were sold, a ratio that is much wider than normal for 30-year Government bonds.
''Over the last four years the bid-to-cover ratio for 30-year Treasury bond auctions was about 2.36 to 1,'' said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J. firm that provides research and commentary on activity in the foreign exchange and credit markets. ''The ratio here was greater than 3 to 1, a much deeper bid than what you have normally had for a 30-year security.''
However, given the protracted problems confronting Refcorp and its parent, the Resolution Trust Corporation, it took higher yields to attract demand this time than nearly nine months ago, the last time Refcorp sold 30-year bonds.
In October 1989, the 30-year Refcorp securities were priced at a spread, or difference, of 27 basis points over the prevailing yield on 30-year Treasury bonds.
''The market for our securities has changed significantly from when we issued our first bonds,'' said Diane Casey, a Refcorp spokeswoman. ''But we are comfortable with the fact that the bonds were well received.''
 
Treasury Prices Rally
Treasury prices, which dipped before the Refcorp sale, rallied after the results of the auction were announced, only to fade again as the session wound down.
Still, analysts and traders said they were hopeful that conditions would improve once today's sale of seven-year Treasury notes is completed.
''Compared to last week, when everybody was afraid not to own securities, right now everyone is afraid to own anything,'' the bond trader said. ''Hopefully, the Refcorp auction, and the seven-year, which should go well, will take that fear out of the market.''
Late yesterday the seven-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.58 percent, up from 8.56 percent late Monday.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 101 31/32, down 9/32, to yield 8.56 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered late yesterday at 102, down 1/8 point, to yield 8.56 percent. And the 8 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 31/ 32, down 1/32, to yield 8.39 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.78 percent, down one basis point, or hundredth of a point. Six-month bill rates fell by a like amount, to an offered rate of 7.72 percent. But one-year bill rates rose by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.61 percent.
Activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was highlighted by the sale of $869.7 million worth of revenue and special obligation bonds by the New York State Dormitory Authority.
More than $530 million worth of revenue bonds were sold.
Coupons on the serial bonds that were included in this part of the issue are from 6.5 percent on bonds maturing in 1992, to 7 percent on bonds maturing in 1995, and 7.50 percent on securities maturing in 2004.
The maximum yield on term bonds that were sold was 7.552 percent on securities that mature in 2017.
The remainer of the issue - some $339 million worth of securities -consisted of special obligation bonds.
Serial bonds with maturities from 1991 to 2000 made up this part of the offering. Coupons on these bonds range from 5.80 percent in 1991 to 6.70 percent in 2000.
Paine Webber acted as lead manager for the negotiated underwriting. The revenue bond portion of the sale is rated A by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The special obligation bonds are rated AAA by both agencies.
Activity in the secondary markets for municipal and investment-grade securities was very light, dealers said.
Prices of actively traded issues in both markets were basically unchanged on the day.

World Bank Is Beginning To Tap Smaller Markets

 BODY:
The World Bank began borrowing money in the smaller financial markets of the world yesterday when it became the first nonresident borrower in New Zealand.
The international agency offered $250 million (New Zealand), or about $200 million in United States currency, worth of seven-year notes in the New Zealand domestic market. 
The 12.50 percent notes, payable semiannually, were priced at $100.90 (New Zealand), or $80.92 in United States currency, to yield 12.30 percent.
''For us this deal is something of a prototype for use in other, smaller financial markets as they liberalize,'' financial regulations, said Kenneth G. Lay, senior managing financial officer at the World Bank.
Mr. Lay said that while two-thirds of the issue had been purchased by domestic investors, the balance had been bought by investors in the United States and Japan.
''We didn't call this a global bond,'' he said. ''But we have tried to facilitate global participation.''
Proceeds of the issue will be swapped for marks, which will be used in the general operations of the World Bank.
Fay Richwhite & Company, a leading New Zealand underwriter, acted as lead manager for the transaction. Ratings of AAA are expected from both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Pound; Forecast on Rates Lifts Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The pound took center stage in foreign exchange trading yesterday, sending the dollar to an 18-month low against the British currency. The dollar also fell sharply against the Japanese yen.
''The British pound is the whole story,'' said Robert Ryan, chief foreign exchange dealer with the Bank of New York, summing up the day. 
Sterling's rise came amid continuing speculation that Britain will soon join Western Europe's currency-steadying exchange rate mechanism.
Built into the European Monetary System, the exchange rate mechanism limits the fluctuations of nine of the 12 European Community countries. Britain, Greece and Portugal are the three countries still outside the system.
 
Buying Extremely Heavy
In London, the pound rose by a cent from Monday, to $1.8155, its highest rate against the dollar since Jan. 3, 1989, when it reached $1.8270. At its peak yesterday, the pound reached $1.8270 and buying was extremely heavy, dealers said. In New York trading, sterling also advanced sharply, rising to $1.8220, from $1.8080 late Monday.
The yen rose after Smick Medley International, a Washington-based advisory firm, predicted that the Bank of Japan would raise interest rates during the next few months.
In New York the dollar plunged to 148.23 yen, from 151.15 on Monday. In Tokyo, the dollar dropped to 149.60 yen, from 150.70 yen late Monday, and it was quoted lower in London at 148.85 yen.
The dollar slumped to 1.15695 Canadian dollars, from 1.15855 late Monday. In Europe earlier, it fell to 1.1570 Canadian dollars from 1.1590.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late prices, included: 1.64185 West German marks, down from 1.6528; 1.3930 Swiss francs, down from 1.3965; 5.51225 French francs, down from 5.5460, and 1,203.00 Italian lire, down from 1.21125.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, were: 1.6465 West German marks, down from 1.6495; 1.3945 Swiss francs, down from 1.3950; 5.5270 French francs, down from 5.5353; 1.8555 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8573, and 1,207 Italian lire, down from 1,208.50.

HEADLINE: Textron Settles U.S. Charges

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
Textron Inc. has agreed to pay a record $17.9 million to settle a whistle-blower's charges that one of its subsidiaries supplied the Coast Guard with faulty helicopter engines, the Justice Department said today.
Robert Ballew, the 42-year-old whistle-blower who first brought the suit, was awarded $2.7 million under the settlement. 
The subsidiary, Textron Lycoming, neither admitted nor denied the charges. It also agreed to repair and maintain for six years the 96 helicopter engines it supplied, saving the Coast Guard about $60 million, the Justice Department said.
Engines made by Lycoming, under a 1984 contract worth a total of $310 million, required significant repairs after less than 600 hours of flying time, not the 2,400 hours promised, the Coast Guard said.
Mr. Ballew was a purchasing manager for the Aerospatiale Helicopter Corporation, a Grand Prairie, Tex., unit of the French-owned Aerospatiale Aircraft Company. Aerospatiale subcontracted the manufacture of engines to Lycoming.
Mr. Ballew said he filed his suit on behalf of the United States Government after his supervisors failed to address the problem. The Justice Department said there was no evidence of misconduct by Aerospatiale. But Mr. Ballew, of Fort Worth, is suing his former employer for dismissing him after he brought the suit. He said he was unemployed for a year.
The Coast Guard uses the HH-65A Dauphin helicopters to intercept drug smugglers' airplanes and ships and for air-and-sea rescue.

HEADLINE: A True Test of Diplomacy: Feeding the Summit Leaders

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 10

 BODY:
The economic world focused on the business of the seven leading industrial powers here, but Houston's food community has been obsessed since April with the politics of culinary summitry. The chefs and caterers wanted to do their part to make Houston look good after so many years at the bottom of the oil barrel. They wanted everything to be perfect. So why was a chef from Dallas, Houston's archrival, chosen to be the chief cook for the two major summit dinners?
How did it happen that that chef, Dean Fearing of the Mansion on Turtle Creek, chose two Houston chefs - Robert Del Grande, the chef and owner of the city's most acclaimed restaurant, Cafe Annie, and Robert McGrath, the executive chef of the highly regarded DeVille restaurant in the Four Seasons Hotel - to help him, but not the city's foremost society caterer?
And why did Washington bureaucrats tell Houston that though they wanted food and services donated, or at cost, any premature release of details would result in cancellation of contracts?'' What's the good of the honor if no one knows about it? 
''They are putting the squeeze on everyone,'' said Joe Bacon, a publicist for some of the events. ''They want it dirt cheap and then they swear everyone to secrecy.''
And why would President Bush insist on starting the festivities with a rodeo and country music from Tennessee when Houston was eager to show off its own full-time opera, ballet and symphony orchestra?
Houstonians had hoped the heads of state would remember something about the city besides bucking bulls, bronco riding and a chain restaurant's rendition of barbecued brisket, potato salad and baked beans. That meal was provided free to 5,000 guests at the rodeo by Luther's Bar-B-Q, a 19-restaurant chain based in Houston.
''I get the distinct feeling,'' said Hal Foster, president of the Houston public relations firm Callas & Foster, who has clients working on summit events, that the President ''is actually showcasing the Houston that existed when he lived here a while back. Since those years, Houston has gained a certain level of sophistication.''
The summit festivities were coordinated by a committee in Houston headed by Kenneth L. Lay, chief executive of Enron Energy of Houston, and George W. Strake Jr., president of the Strake Trading Group here, and by a committee in Washington, as well as by Barbara Bush's staff at the White House.
The people of the White House social office had their own ideas about what was appropriate for the formal functions.
Mr. Fearing was chosen by Washington because of mutual acquaintances to prepare the intimate dinner for heads of state Monday night at Bayou Bend, the magnificent former home of Ima Hogg, the daughter of a former Texas Governor. Mr. Fearing also prepared the summit dinner tonight for 110 people at the Museum of Fine Arts. The meal was served in the grand hall of the museum's Upper Brown Pavilion, a gallery where John Trumbull's portrait of Alexander Hamilton was hung especially for the dinner; it was brought from the Treasury Department in Washington.
An aide had left Mr. Bush's notes for his toast back at his hotel, so Mr. Bush simply welcomed the guests, saying: ''There is no work here tonight, no communiques, no amendments, no language to be corrected. We simply want you to have a very good time at this museum we are very proudful of. Make yourselves at home.''
The White House planners had wanted a regional touch to the dinner, but not what Mr. Fearing described as ''cutting-edge Southwest cuisine that just came off our line last week.'' The chefs do not always do as they are told, and these chefs do not do the continental-style food associated with White House dinners.
One of Mr. Fearing's offerings, Texas wild greens, became Texas greens because the word from Washington was, no dandelions. Tomatillos, those little Mexican green tomatoes, were out because someone in Washington could not pronounce the word (toe-mah-TEE-oh). ''The White House used the word 'traditional' a lot,'' Mr. Del Grande said.
In the end, the White House got menus that seemed innocuous enough, but the chefs cooked the food their way. Behind the basil lime sauce for the red snapper lurked mildly hot poblano chilies. Even the innocent-sounding morel sauce for the veal loin had been spiked, oh so gently, with chilies. The plain yellow tomato soup listed on the menu came with smoked poblano, a streak of cilantro cream and avocado relish.
''We had to keep our personal integrity,'' Mr. Fearing said. ''What are they going to do, fire us?'' The White House did not wish to discuss details of the preparations, but after his guests left Bayou Bend Monday evening, the President called the chefs into the living room. He told Mr. Fearing that he had made sure everyone cleaned their plates ''just like at Mom's.'' He said he particularly enjoyed the tortilla soup. When Mr. Fearing asked him if the food was too spicy, the President replied, ''Not spicy enough.''
Because the chefs donated their services and everything else was at cost, the Bayou Bend dinner cost $150 a person, half the retail price. The summit dinner tonight cost $120 a person, $60 less than retail. The State Department picks up the tab.
While the heads of state and their policy makers were dining Monday night at Bayou Bend, a 28-room mansion given to the city by its owner, the visiting spouses were dining at the gracious Georgian-style home of J. Hugh and Betty Liedtke, old friends of the Bushes. Mr. Liedtke, Mr. Bush and two other partners founded Zapata Petroleum in 1953.
Two of the Bushes' and Liedtkes' oldest friends, Baine and Mildred Kerr, were among the guests. Mrs. Kerr, for whom the Bushes' dog, Millie, is named, said she was amazed at how relaxed the evening was. ''It did not seem stuffyor strained,'' she said. ''Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Liedtke are so good at putting everyone at ease.''
Mrs. Bush had phoned Mrs. Liedtke about two months ago. After they chatted awhile, Mrs. Liedtke recalled, ''I said to her, 'What are you getting ready to ask me to do?' '' The answer surprised her.
''When I picked myself up off the floor, I said I'd be delighted,'' said Mrs. Liedtke, whose husband is chairman of Pennzoil. She said she rented the silver plate and plain white china for the dinner ''because I don't have 40 of anything.''
Jackson Hicks, Houston's society caterer, was recommended to Mrs. Liedtke. ''I had not used Jackson before,'' she said. ''I know his name and his reputation very well.''
Mr. Hicks is more famous for his extravaganzas than for his food. He catered the Media Fest for 5,000 people on Saturday night and the working lunches for the heads of state today, but some Houstonians were shocked that he was not tapped to feed the heads of state. ''The lunches are where the real action is at the summit,'' he said earlier in the week.
Others who chafed at the dealings with the Washington summit committee were not so circumspect.
Sharon Seline, a vice president of Tiffany's, which supplied the place settings of silver, china and stemware for the summit dinner at the museum, did not feel too kindly toward a representative from Washington who worked on the two heads-of-state dinners. Ms. Seline said the representative picked out one china pattern, Blair House by Tiffany, for the dinner.
After Ms. Seline had corraled 150 place settings from around the country, the White House social office said the china pattern was not suitable. Manhattan Blue by Tiffany was substituted. ''When you are donating $500,000 worth of time and services, you want good communications,'' Ms. Seline said. She said relations had improved in recent weeks.
Some caterers were bent out of shape over the Bushes' party for 7,000 to 10,000 people, ranging from volunteers who picked up trash to middle managers of companies that donated services, to be held Wednesday afternoon, when the weather in Houston is at its most sweltering. ''Who in their right minds would go outdoors at 3:30?'' said Mr. Foster, the publicist.
When Marthann Masterson of Masterson Catering was invited to bid for the event, she said, she was told the committee was looking for donations. She recalled: ''At that point, I said: 'I can't donate this. This is a thank-you-to-Houston party. It's not much of a thank-you.' ''
It was agreed that Ms. Masterson would be paid $8,000 to cater one of the thank-you pavilions. She also prepared a dinner Monday night for the Secretary of the Treasury, Nicholas F. Brady, and others; they were among the better-fed guests, dining on crawfish quesadillas, crab cakes with cayenne mayonnaise and grilled quail.
Renee Ferrell of Bennie Ferrell Catering said she had been told the planning committee wanted her company to cater a private Presidential reception Wednesday afternoon, but ''something greater'' than the committee ''made the decision.'' (She will cater two pavilions at the thank-you party.) ''Something greater'' was James Huang's connection with Mr. Bush. Mr. Huang owns the Hunan restaurant in Houston. He and his daughter, Gigi, were overnight guests at the White House after a recent state dinner at which Mr. Huang sat at the President's table. Mr. Huang donated the food for the reception and created several new recipes for its banquet.
The Cadillac Bar, with its graffiti-covered walls, its grime-covered floors, loud music, loud customers and good Tex-Mex food, was the setting for a party given by the Secretary of Commerce, Robert A. Mosbacher, and his wife, Georgette, on Saturday night for his foreign counterparts and a few friends. Mr. Mosbacher was not part of the official delegation but Houston is his home. Guests, including Kabun Moto, the Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry, dined on barbecued goat, nachos, fajitas, frogs' legs, mesquite-grilled shrimp and quail.
While officials dined on quail and sipped vintage wines, the police supped on sandwiches, chips and fruit. Reporters were able to eat round the clock at the George Brown Convention Center, the press's headquarters for the summit session. The host committee spent $1 million, mainly to impress foreign journalists, on fare that included lumps of white crabmeat and jumbo shrimp.
''We expect a lot of waste,'' said Dennis Cullinane, general manager of Service America, the catering contractor staffing the convention center. ''But it will be donated daily to the Star of Hope Mission,''

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT DEFENDS HIS SON'S INTEGRITY IN SAVINGS INQUIRY

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
President Bush today gave a ringing emotional defense of his son Neil, who has been accused of violating conflict of interest rules in a Denver savings and loan case, but he promised to stay out of the proceedings and ''let the system work.''
Federal regulators say Neil Bush did not disclose adequately his past business relationship with major borrowers of the defunct Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association. He and other directors and officials of Silverado may well face a $200 million Federal negligence suit over the failure of the institution. Bailing out Silverado is expected to cost taxpayers $1 billion.
''I have confidence in the honor and integrity of my son,'' President Bush said, adding that ''if the system finds he's done something wrong, he will be the first to step up and do what's right.'' 
''This is not easy for me, as a father,'' he said. ''It's easy for me as the President, because the system is going to work, and I will not intervene. I've not discussed this with any officials and suggested any outcome.''
The remarks, in response to a question at a news conference in Houston at the end of the economic summit meeting of leading industrialized nations, came as the Senate approved measures to toughen penalties for those found guilty of savings and loan fraud.
The bill includes provisions for life prison sentences for offenders who conspired to steal more than $5 million. It would also increase the maximum prison term for lending fraud to 30 years, from 20 years at present.
The Administration's handling of the savings crisis has in the last few weeks become an explosive political issue, and lawmakers from both parties are worried about a rising voter sentiment that the Government has mishandled the bailout process.
The Senate package, approved 99 to 1 as an amendment to the Omnibus Crime Bill, would provide $162.5 million a year for the next three years for the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service to prosecute savings and loan fraud. That is more than triple the present amount.
Senator William L. Armstrong, Republican of Colorado, cast the no vote, contending that the bill was an attempt to create ''a smoke screen to shift the culpability for the S.& L. mess from the Congress and onto a few unscrupulous businessmen.''
The measure would permit the Government to bring civil racketeering cases and to confiscate property purchased with illegal profits and would require regulators to open enforcement hearings to the public. Last week, the Office of Thrift Supervision said it would hold open hearings. The Senate's provision would have the force of law and would apply to all banking, savings and credit union regulatory actions.
''There is no question that fraud and other crimes played a significant role in the S.&L. crisis,'' said Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat from Colorado.
 
Criticism of Cartoons
At the Houston news conference, the President was the most expansive he has been in public in discussing his son's case, saying the publicity surrounding Neil Bush's role had caused him considerable pain as a father.
''I've got three other sons, and they all want to go to the barricades when they see some cartoon they don't like, particularly those that are factually incorrect in total, demeaning the honor of their brother,'' he said. ''And I say: 'You calm down now, we're in a different role now; you can't react like you would if your brother was picked on in a street fight.'
''But we have great emotions that I share with Barbara, I share with my sons and my daughter that I won't share with you except to say: One, as President I am determined to stay out of this and let it work and let it work fairly. And secondly, I have confidence in the honor and integrity of my son.''
The Senate's overwhelming vote for the enforcement measure was a barometer of the extent to which Republicans and Democrats are now vying with each other to appear tough on savings and loan crime.
Both parties have problems to overcome. Four of the five senators who intervened with regulators on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr., the Phoenix developer who controlled the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan, were Democrats, as was former House Speaker Jim Wright, who intervened on behalf of failing Texas savings institutions. The Republican image has been tarnished by the Administration's admission that it underestimated the cost of the crisis and by the Neil Bush matter.
The Democrats seem to smell blood. Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat from Colorado, has called for an independent prosecutor to investigate the Neil Bush case.
At this point, White House officials say their approach is simply to say nothing about the case unless asked, and then to respond essentially as the President responded today. But Republican strategists have been casting about for ways to counter Democratic attempts to blame the Administration for the crisis.
On Thursday, Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, is scheduled to give a speech at a meeting of the Republican National Committee in Chicago. He will say that specific Democratic lawmakers had a role in the savings and loan debacle and will assert that President Bush was the first chief executive to step forward and deal with the issue.
 
Qualifications Are an Issue
Documents released by the Office of Thrift Supervision on the conflict of interest charges against Neil Bush show that regulators viewed him as ''unqualified and untrained'' to be a director of a financial institution.
''Certainly he had no experience in managing a large corporation, especially a financial institution with almost $2 billion in assets,'' the documents said.
One troublesomee issue for President Bush is his handling of L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created to manage the bailout. Mr. Seidman must ultimately decide whether to proceed with the $200 million negligence suit in the Silverado case.
The President said today that he supported Mr. Seidman in his current position, although Mr. Seidman has been under pressure from other White House officials to step aside.
''He wouldn't be there if I didn't have confidence in him,'' the President said. ''I have confidence in his integrity and his honor.''
Mr. Seidman would not discuss the possible negligence suit. ''We do not discuss these matters until they are officially filed, if they are officially filed,'' he said.
He added that his agency had not singled out Silverado, saying the F.D.I.C. investigated every failed savings and loan to determine whether misconduct had occurred. ''There is no difference because he's the President's son,'' he said.
 
More Legislation Considered
Mr. Seidman's comments were made as he emerged from a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing held to discuss legislative proposals to accelerate prosecutions of wrongdoing in the savings industry.
The House subcommittee is considering a wide variety of measures, including proposals that are part of the bill the Senate passed today, as well as the possibility of appointing a special prosecutor and giving new authority for the Secret Service to investigate savings and loan fraud. Lawmakers said they hoped to present a bill to the President by mid-August.
In the Senate, the Ethics Committee is deciding how to proceed with the so-called Keating Five, and whether to handle them as one case or five individual cases.
The four Democratic Senators under inquiry are Alan Cranston of California, Dennis Deconcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan; the Republican is John McCain of Arizona.

HEADLINE: Amid Discord, Talks on Boat People Are Put Off

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 11

 BODY:
A 28-nation conference on Vietnamese boat people was postponed today when it became apparent that differences between the United States and Vietnam on one side and the Southeast Asian nations and Hong Kong on the other have not been bridged.
At the headquarters here of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, under whose auspices the meeting was to be held, the indefinite postponement was considered a setback to the principle of first asylum.
Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia have reluctantly allowed the Vietnamese to land on their shores since the refugees began leaving in 1975. There they are maintained, in camps that are Spartan or worse, at international expense until they can find permanent refuge. The United States is the principal final refuge; others include France, Canada and Australia. 
 
No Longer Willing Hosts
Increasingly, however, as the flow of refugees shows no signs of ceasing and the readiness of final-refuge countries to accept the refugees has slowed, the countries that bear the initial brunt of the exodus have balked at continuing to play that role.
The Vietnamese refugees, who at the outset were automatically and widely accepted as political refugees, are now divided into those to whom this status is conceded and a majority, who are classified as economic migrants, suspected of leaving simply to achieve richer material lives and therefore subject to forcible repatriation.
Britain, the colonial power in Hong Kong, followed by the Southeast Asian countries, established cutoff dates, saying that all Vietnamese arriving afterward would be screened to determine which category they fall into. The economic migrants would be subject to deportation back to Vietnam.
The United States, however, opposes any involuntary return of Vietnamese who are classified as illegal economic migrants. Paradoxically, the American position coincides with that of Vietnam, which has so far refused to accept the return of those who fled unless they volunteer to do so.
 
Deterrent Wanted
Hong Kong and the Southeast Asian nations have been pushing for a policy that will clear out their camps and dissuade more Vietnamese from coming.
Today, Malaysia and Vietnam asked the High Commissioner to postpone the meeting, which was scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. No reasons were announced, but senior officials assumed that the two countries, which are on opposite sides of the dispute, were motivated by a desire to prevent a meeting that appeared to have no chance of achieving consensus and might formalize a split that all seek to avoid.
A recent visit to Washington by the High Commissioner, Thorvald Stoltenberg, which included a meeting with President Bush, has apparently failed to bring about a significant softening of the American position, believed to originate in the White House rather than at the State Department.
Officials and refugee relief workers of many nations, including the United States, are skeptical about the rationale for the American stand as to who is entitled to refugee status. They point out that the United States does not hesitate to intercept those fleeing Haiti by boat and return them to their country or deport them if they reach American shores.
 
Still Fighting Vietnam
These specialists attribute the American stand to a continuing harsh attitude toward Vietnam, more than 15 years after the Communist victory in the Indochina war. The United States regards Vietnam as an oppressive country to which no one should be forced to go against his will.
Whatever the motivation, American opposition to forcible return has led Britain and the Southeast Asian nations, all traditionally friendly to the United States, to threaten to end their commitments to allow the boat people to land. In effect, Malaysia stopped doing so last year and since March 1989, has pushed off 8,700 boat people. Most have reached Indonesia with the help of supplies and equipment provided by the Malaysian Navy.
But Indonesia has told the United Nations refugee commissioner's office that it will not indefinitely continue to allow them to land. Even the Philippines, which has been the the most tolerant of the Southeast Asian nations, has begun to adopt a more severe stand, particularly toward freighters that seek to put ashore refugees whom they have rescued at sea.
The United States has rejected a compromise proposal, which would permit sending the ''screened-out'' Vietnamese to a holding center on a Pacific island, such as the American territory of Guam, while a solution less severe than forcible repatriation is sought.
 
Those Who Remain
About 125,000 boat people remain in camps in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. About 25,000 arrived before the dates on which their unwilling host countries instituted screening and are assured of permanent resettlement before the end of this year. Of those remaining, only 25,000 are considered likely to be granted refugee status.
Refugee officials now fear that the Southeast Asian countries may formalize their refusal to continue granting first asylum when their Foreign Ministers meet later this month in Jakarta in the annual conference of the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
According to the High Commissioner, as of April 30, there are 107,802 Vietnamese boat people in camps in Asia. More than half, or 54,718, are in Hong Kong, with 18,404 in Malaysia, 12,370 in Thailand, 12,205 in Indonesia and 8,459 in the Philippines.

HEADLINE: THE HOUSTON SUMMIT;
Three Key Economic Issues Undecided as Meeting Ends

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 11

 BODY:
The leaders of the seven most powerful industrial democracies wrapped up their three-day meeting here today by proclaiming their united goal of fostering worldwide prosperity, but they hardly resolved the three main economic issues that had divided them at the outset.
On trade policy, the leaders at the 16th annual economic summit meeting endorsed an ambiguous statement about agriculture subsidies that was finally drafted at 2:30 this morning. It promised to put trade talks back on track, but it allowed all competing sides to assert victory.
On aid to the Soviet Union, they took the time-honored step of politicians unable to reach consensus: they formed a committee to study the situation.
 
Little Movement on Environment
And on the environment, they agreed that climate change was ''of key importance,'' but they acceded to President Bush and announced no timetable for limiting the emission of gases that might cause global warming. 
In many instances, the final communique presented by President Bush, the host of the meeting, was a masterpiece of euphemism and understatement, as such documents often are. But its language about the changes in Eastern Europe since last year's economic summit meeting was exultant.
''When people are free to choose,'' it declared in the first paragraph, ''they choose freedom.''
In his news conference afterward, Mr. Bush said, ''We are united in a common goal to extend to those who seek political and economic freedom a helping hand with our resources, talents and experience.''
 
Similar Points Made
The other leaders made similar points about the group's harmony. Summit meetings, said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, are looked to by people of the world for leadership on the great issues of the times. ''Once again,'' she continued, ''we have provided that leadership.''
But the comity on the overriding issues of war and peace, democracy and communism, was overshadowed this week by the tensions over the more mundane economic topics that are likely to dominate the alliance in the years ahead.
The most contentious issue, by far, was the question of farm subsidies, and the final communique gave something to everyone.
For the United States, it pledged that export subsidies and import protection would be reduced. And it specifically mentioned a proposal by Aart De Zeuuw, the Dutch chairman of the agriculture committee at the international trade talks, that the United States sees as a favorable basis for negotiations.
Under Mr. De Zeuuw's proposal, separate limits would be negotiated for each specific form of farm subsidy, including export supports.
 
Influential Political Force
For the European countries, where farmers are an especially influential political force, it recognized that ''social and economic conditions'' must be reflected in farm policy and that Government subsidies could be considered as a whole, rather than individually, when the level of protection is measured. The Europeans have been unwilling to make a commitment to reduce their export supports.
For Japan, the document said farm policy should take into account ''concerns about food security,'' a reference to Japan's prohibition on rice imports.
Whatever the ambiguity, Mr. Bush succeeded in putting the issue at the top of the international economic agenda, and that could give a political impetus to the current round of international trade talks that are scheduled to end in December.
The priority Mr. Bush gave to limiting farm supports seemed to surprise most of his counterparts, who tend to view agriculture policy as a matter to be handled by underlings.
 
Stifling of Growth Seen
The President maintained that unless the industrial countries began to limit their support for farmers, which distorts the world market for foods and feed grain, the current round of trade talks would break down. If that happened, Mr. Bush argued, worldwide economic growth would be stifled.
All seven of the countries here - the United States, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Japan - subsidize farmers in one way or another. The subsidies in Europe and Japan are much more extensive than they are in North America. The United States and Canada find the Europeans' export subsidies the most onerous form of protection because they believe they distort the market the most.
The Americans maintained that the summit agreement could get deadlocked trade talks restarted when negotiators meet next in Geneva on July 23. Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said she was encouraged by the summit agreement, but she would not go so far as to call it a breakthrough.
''We gave a tremendous political impetus to the final negotiations of the round,'' Mrs. Hills told reporters. ''We did not come here to negotiate specific words. But we will get on with that on the 23d and put some meat on the bones.''
 
Delight Voiced by Europeans
The Europeans also expressed delight with the outcome. ''It's much better than I had hoped for,'' said Henning Christophersen, the European Community's vice president for economic and financial affairs.
On aid to the Soviet Union, Mr. Bush got a statement encouraging the steps toward a free market economy being taken by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Mr. Bush maintains that the United States can provide technical assistance to the Soviets but no money so long as the Soviets continue to spend vast sums on their military and on support of Cuba.
The Allies accepted his proposal for a study of Soviet economic needs under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and other international economic organization.
 
To Reassure Gorbachev
At his news conference, Mr. Bush said the formation of the study committee was ''not an effort to delay anything,'' and he said he would ''make clear to President Gorbachev that he ought to view this outcome of this summit very positively.''
Later, the President added, ''I think Mr. Gorbachev understands that at this juncture, sending money from the United States is not in the cards.''
The summit meeting left other countries free to give aid to the Soviets. That pleased Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who has promised more than $3 billion in credits to the Soviet Union and who favors an international commitment of $15 billion. Mr. Kohl is going to Moscow this weekend to meet with Mr. Gorbachev.
 
Joint Program Predicted
''The necessary steps are being initiated in the Soviet Union now,'' Mr. Kohl said at a news conference. ''If this continues by the end of the year, we should be able to achieve a joint Western economic assistance program.''
Did Mr. Bush agree with that assessment? ''It doesn't work that you have to march in lockstep on all these questions,'' he said.
Mr. Bush seemed to have won a victory on environmental policy. The leaders rejected a West German proposal, which Mr. Bush opposed but the other leaders supported, that would have set a timetable for limiting the emission of gases that could contribute to global warming. They did approve, with Mr. Bush's support, development of a pilot program to help Brazil preserve its tropical rain forest.
The leaders also dealt with such areas as third world debt, aid to underdeveloped countries, narcotics control and international money laundering. These were central topics at previous summit meetings, and little new ground was broken this year.
Bettino Craxi, the former Prime Minister of Italy who heads a United Nations study on underdeveloped countries, was influential in the preparation of the section of the communique dealing with that area.
It asserted that the industrial countries' commitment to helping Eastern Europe would diminish their support for developing countries elsewhere in the world.

HEADLINE: THE HOUSTON SUMMIT;
Excerpts From Economic Declaration by Chiefs of Seven Industrial Nations

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HOUSTON, July 11

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Economic Declaration issued today by the leaders of the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada at the conclusion of their summit meeting:
1. We, the heads of state and government of the seven major industrial democracies and the president of the commission of the European Communities, meeting in Houston for our annual economic summit, celebrate the renaissance of democracy throughout much of the world. We welcome unreservedly the spread of multiparty democracy, the practice of free elections, the freedom of expression and assembly, the increased respect for human rights, the rule of law, and the increasing recognition of the principles of the open and competitive economy. These events proclaim loudly man's inalienable rights: When people are free to choose, they choose freedom.
2. The profound changes taking place in Europe, and progress toward democracy elsewhere, give us great hope for a world in which individuals have increasing opportunities to achieve their economic and political aspirations, free of tyranny and oppression.
3. We are mindful that freedom and economic prosperity are closely linked and mutually reinforcing. Sustainable economic prosperity depends upon the stimulus of competition and the encouragement of enterprise - on incentives for individual initiative and innovation, on a skilled and motivated labor force whose fundamental rights are protected, on sound monetary systems, on an open system of international trade and payments, and on an environment safeguarded for future generations. 
5. In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in promoting a stronger world economy through sound macroeconomic policies and greater economic efficiency. The economic expansion in our countries, now in its eighth year, has supported notable income growth and job creation in the context of rapid growth of international trade. However, unemployment remains high in a number of countries. Inflation, although considerably lower than in the early 1980's, is a matter of serious concern in some countries and requires continued vigilance. External imbalances have been reduced in the United States and Japan, whereas in other cases they have increased. Continuing adjustment remains a priority in order to counter protectionist pressures, alleviate uncertainties in financial and exchange markets, and contribute to avoiding pressures on interest rates. Sound domestic macroeconomic policies, which may differ according to conditions in each country, will make a major contribution to further external adjustment.
 
International Monetary Developments and Policy Coordination
9. Countries with sizable current account deficits should contribute to the adjustment process by the reduction of fiscal deficits, and undertake structural reforms to encourage private savings and increase competitiveness.
10. Countries with large external surpluses should contribute to the adjustment process by sustained non-inflationary growth of domestic demand with structural reform in order to improve the underlying conditions for growth and adjustment and to promote increased investment relative to saving.
14. We welcome the prospect of a unified, democratic Germany which enjoys full sovereignty without discriminatory constraints. German economic, monetary, and social union will contribute to improved non-inflationary global growth and to a reduction of external imbalances. This process will promote positive economic developments in Central and Eastern Europe.
 
International Trading System
18. The open world trading system is vital to economic prosperity. A strengthened General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is essential to provide a stable framework for the expansion of trade and the fuller integration of Central and Eastern Europe and developing countries into the global economy. We reject protectionism in all its forms.
19. The successful outcome of the Uruguay Round has the highest priority on the international economic agenda. Consequently, we stress our determination to take the difficult political decisions necessary to achieve far-reaching, substantial results in all areas of the Uruguay Round by the end of this year. We instruct our negotiators to make progress and in particular to agree on the complete profile of the final package by the July meeting of the trade negotiations committee.
21. As regards agriculture, achieving the long-term objective of the reform of agricultural policies is critical to permit the greater liberalization of trade in agricultural products. Experience has shown the high cost of agricultural policies which tend to create surpluses. The outcome of the GATT negotiations on agriculture should lead to a better balance between supply and demand and ensure that agricultural policies do not impede the effective functioning of international markets. We therefore reaffirm our commitment to the long-term objective of the reform, i.e., to allow market signals to influence agriculture production and to establish a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system.
22. The achievement of this objective requires each of us to make substantial, progressive reductions in support and protection of agriculture - covering internal regimes, market access and export subsidies - and develop rules governing sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Variations among countries in the mechanisms of agricultural support reflect differences in the social and economic conditions of farming. The negotiations on agriculture should therefore be conducted in a framework that includes a common instrument of measurement, provides for commitments to be made in an equitable way among all countries, and takes into account concerns about food security. The framework should contain specific assurances that, by appropriate use of the common measure as well as other ways, participants would reduce not only internal support but also export subsidies and import protection in a related way.
23. Agreement on such a framework by the time of the July meeting of the trade negotiations committee is critical to the successful completion of the Uruguay Round as a whole. Accordingly, we commend to our negotiators the text submitted by the chairman of the agricultural negotiating group as a means to intensify the negotiations. We intend to maintain a high level of personal involvement and to exercise the political leadership necessary to ensure the successful outcome of these negotiations.
24. Negotiations on market access should achieve agreement on a substantial and balanced package of measures. As regards textiles, the objective is to liberalize the textile and clothing sector through progressive dismantling of trade barriers and its integration, under a precise timetable, into GATT on the basis of strengthened GATT rules and disciplines.
28. For their part, developing countries should substantially reduce their tariffs and increase the percentage of tariffs that are bound; subscribe to balanced and effective restraints on all forms of exceptions, including measures imposed for balance-of-payments difficulties; and participate meaningfully in agreements covering the new areas. The end result should be a single set of multilateral rules applicable to all GATT contracting parties, although some developing countries, especially the last developed, may need longer transition periods or other transitional arrangements on a case-by-case basis.
29. The wide range of substantive results which we seek in all these areas will call for a commitment to strengthen further the institutional framework of the multilateral trading system. In that context, the concept of an international trade organization should be addressed at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. We also need to improve the dispute settlement process in order to implement the results of the negotiations effectively. This should lead to a commitment to operate only under the multilateral rules.
 
Direct Investment
30. Free flows of investment increase global prosperity by complementing the open international trading system. In particular, foreign direct investment can help restructure the economies of developing and Central and Eastern European countries, create new jobs, and raise living standards.
 
Reform in Central and Eastern Europe
34. We and other countries should assist Central and Eastern European nations that are firmly committed to economic and political reform. Those providing help should favor countries that implement such reforms.
35. Foreign private investment will be vital in the development of Central and Eastern Europe. Capital will flow to countries with open markets and hospitable investment climates. Improved access for their exports will also be important for those Central and Eastern European countries that are opening up their economies. Western governments can support this process by various means, including trade and investment agreements.
37. We recognize that these countries face major problems in cleaning their environment. It will be important to assist the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to develop the necessary policies and infrastructure to confront those environmental problems.
 
Soviet Union
42. We discussed the situation in the Soviet Union, and exchanged views regarding the message that Soviet President Gorbachev sent us several days ago on his economic plans. We welcome the efforts under way in the Soviet Union to liberalize and to create a more open, democratic and pluralistic Soviet society, and to move toward a market-oriented economy. These measures deserve our support. The success of perestroika depends upon the determined pursuit and development of these reform efforts. In particular, we welcome President Gorbachev's suggestion for a sustained economic dialogue.
43. We have all begun, individually and collectively, to assist these reform efforts. We all believe that technical assistance should be provided now to help the Soviet Union move to a market-oriented economy and to mobilize its own resources. Some countries are already in a position to extend large-scale financial credits.
44. We also agreed that further Soviet decisions to introduce more radical steps toward a market-oriented economy, to shift resources substantially away from the military sector and to cut support to nations promoting regional conflict will all improve the prospect for meaningful and sustained economic assistance.
45. We have taken note of the decision of the European Council in Dublin on June 26. We have agreed to ask the I.M.F., the World Bank, the O.E.C.D... to undertake, in close consultation with the commission of the European Communities, a detailed study of the Soviet economy, to make recommendations for its reform and to establish the criteria under which Western economic assistance could effectively support these reforms. This work should be completed by year's end and be convened by the I.M.F.
46. We took note of the importance to the Government of Japan of the peaceful resolution of its dispute with the Soviet Union over the northern territories.
 
Developing Nations
48. We reiterate that our commitment to the developing world will not be weakened by the support for reforming countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The poorest of the developing nations must remain the focus of special attention.
51. Important contributions to a hospitable investment climate can be made by the protection of intellectual property, and by liberalization of investment regimes, including transparent and equitable investment rules and equality of treatment for foreign and domestic investors.
 
Third World Debt
55. Significant progress has been made during the past year under the strengthened debt strategy, which has renewed the resolve in a number of debtor countries to continue economic reforms essential to future growth. In particular, the recent commercial bank agreements with Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Morocco, the Philippines and Venezuela involve significant debt and debt-service reduction. Important financial support for debt and debt-service reduction is being provided by the I.M.F. and the World Bank, as well as by Japan.
58. For countries implementing courageous reforms, commercial banks should take realistic and constructive approaches in their negotiations to conclude promptly agreements on financial packages including debt reduction, debt-service reduction and new money.
60. Creditor governments have also provided special support for the poorest countries through the implementation of Toronto terms in Paris Club reschedulings. All of us have canceled official development assistance (ODA) debt for the poorest countries. We encourage the Paris Club to review the implementation of the existing options that apply to the poorest countries.
 
Environment
62. One of our most important responsibilities is to pass on to future generations an environment whose health, beauty, and economic potential are not threatened. Environmental challenges such as climate change, ozone depletion, deforestation, marine pollution, and loss of biological diversity require closer and more effective international cooperation and concrete action. We, as industrialized countries, have an obligation to be leaders in meeting these challenges. We agree that, in the face of threats of irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are justified in their own right. We recognize that strong, growing, market-oriented economies provide the best means for successful environmental protection.
63. Climate change is of key importance. We are committed to undertake common efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. We strongly support the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and look forward to the release of its full report in August. The Second World Climate Conference provides the opportunity for all countries to consider the adoption of strategies and measures for limiting or stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions, and to discuss an effective international response. We reiterate our support for the negotiation of a framework convention on climate change, under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The convention should be completed by 1992. Work on appropriate implementing protocols should be undertaken as expeditiously as possible and should consider all sources.
 
Narcotics
75. We urge all nations to accede to and complete ratification of the U.N. Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (the Vienna Convention), and to apply provisionally terms of the convention.
77. We support the declaration adopted at the ministerial meeting on drugs convened by the United Kingdom that drug demand reduction should be accorded the same importance in policy and action as the reduction of illicit supply. Developed countries should adopt stronger prevention efforts and assist demand reduction initiatives in other countries.

New Zeal Takes Aim at Official Vice

BYLINE: By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 10

 BODY:
If a surge of investigations and indictments of public officials and financiers is any guide, Miami and its sister municipalities have been enjoying their vices even more than usual lately.
According to the United States Attorney's office, more than 30 investigations of corruption by local, state and Federal officials in South Florida are under way so far this year.
''We've indicted more public officials in the last 18 months than were indicted in the last 10 years,'' said Dexter Lehtinen, the acting United States Attorney in Miami.
In the small Dade County town of Sweetwater, for example, the Mayor and members of the City Council have been convicted of wrongdoing in office. In neighboring Hialeah, the Mayor and a member of the City Council have been indicted, and in Miami Beach the Mayor is under investigation. 
The burst of charges against community leaders has prompted soul-searching even in a city like Miami that is accustomed to easy money, fast deals and close relationships between developers and local politicians who control land use and building permits.
City officials whose probity has not been called into question, like Mayor Xavier Suarez of Miami, say the current spate of investigations is far from the norm.
But other observers say that corruption among officials is inevitable in this state of seemingly endless real-estate booms and that the crimes being alleged are in fact ''business as usual'' here. What is unusual these days, many believe, is a new prosecutorial zeal.
Mr. Lehtinen has appeared to give some support for that view by repeatedly declaring in recent months that he is making a special effort to increase investigations and prosecutions of public corruption.
He said in an interview that he had assigned some of his best prosecutors to a public corruption unit and has been pressing the issue hard for the last year because ''corruption is a serious problem here in South Florida.''
Allegations of misdeeds have touched leading figures in the private as well as the public sector.
David L. Paul, the former chairman of Centrust Savings Bank of Miami who was once Miami's leading business magnate, is under Federal investigation after the $2 billion collapse of Centrust. The Federal Government seized the company in February and sold it off two weeks ago.
Mayor Alex Daoud of Miami Beach came under the scrutiny of Federal investigators earlier this year when, they found out while investigating Centrust that he had received a total of $35,000 in 1988 and 1989 in supposed legal fees from an insurance subsidiary of Centrust. During that time the Mayor had voted in favor of a zoning waiver to let Mr. Paul extend a disputed teak dock at his island home to better accommodate his new 95-foot $7 million yacht.
Mr. Daoud refused to comment on his vote and the payments. But his lawyer, Alan E. Weinstein, said the Mayor had not broken any laws and had not allowed his vote to be influenced.
''You can be on retainer to a corporate client and vote on an issue involving a member of the firm,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''That is not illegal.''
He also said the Council vote had been 6 to 1 in favor of the zoning waiver so Mr. Daoud had not cast the deciding vote.
Mr. Paul has consistently refused to comment on the issue, and his lawyer, Sandy Bowrer, said he would not comment either beyond saying Mr. Paul had not broken any laws.
Other business arrangements by local officials have also come under scrutiny. Judge John Gale, a veteran of Dade County Circuit Court, for example, was provided with new Jaguars for 18 years at well below cost by a local dealer.
Judge Gale has denied wrongdoing, but last month the state's Judicial Qualifications Commission formally charged him with ''receiving gifts and favors'' while on the bench. The judge continues to serve and will be allowed to defend his actions before the commission.
In Hialeah earlier this year, Mayor Raul Martinez and Councilman Andres Mejides were removed from office by the Governor under Florida law after being indicted for extortion and racketeering in real estate deals.
In its indictment the United States Attorney's office contended Mayor Martinez received at least $275,000 from alleged racketeering. The indictment charged the Mayor and Councilman Mejides with ''explicitly and implicitly threatening to use their official powers and authority to the economic detriment of the real estate developers, builders and investors.''
Mr. Martinez, who continued to work as a developer while Mayor, has denied all charges of wrongdoing, as has Mr. Mejides.
In Sweetwater, six of the City Council's eight members, including the Mayor, were named in a corruption indictment in January and then removed from office by the Governor. Last week, former Mayor Irain Gonzalez and former Councilmen Antonio Duran and Carmen Menendez were found guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion.
As for the three other Council members removed from office, Hugo Alvarez and Lucio Cobian have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit extortion and Manuel Avila was an unindicted co-conspirator.
''It's certainly not business as usual,'' said Mayor Suarez of Miami. ''This definitely is embarrassing.''

HEADLINE: Two Worlds of Washington: Turmoil and Growth

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Every day, Ruth Ernst goes downtown from her northwest Washington neighborhood, from a subway stop that did not exist six years ago, to a law firm that had not been formed seven years ago, in a booming commercial center where four years ago metal grates covered decrepit storefronts and fear emptied the streets at dusk.
If what Ms. Ernst calls a ''livable city'' seems part of a civic booster's rosy dream, it coexists with the Chamber of Commerce's worst nightmare: the bloody drug-bred turmoil on the city's streets, the roster of city officials indicted and convicted, the shambles of public housing and the tawdry testimony in the drug and perjury trial of Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. Caught between the dream and the nightmare is a city reinventing itself, politically, demographically and economically. For most of Mr. Barry's 12 years as Mayor, Washington has been the beneficiary of an economic boom that has transformed the metropolitan area into an archipelago of shining high-rises and mini-urban centers stretching from Tyson's Corner, Va., to Rockville, Md.
 
Facing the Grimmer Side
But while Ms. Ernst and others like her thrive in Washington's boom, people like Robert Taylor, a retired police sergeant, are too often faced with the city's grimmer side: the epidemics of crack, AIDS, teen-age pregnancy, single motherhood and homelessness. 
How much of this change was influenced by the city's Mayor and how much by Congress, which keeps the city on an ever-tightening leash, are a matter of sharp dispute. But there is little dispute that during Mr. Barry's tenure the city became a better place to work and visit and, in many blue-collar and poor neighborhoods, a worse place to live. It has also continued to be a hard place to understand.
''Washington has always been a place the rest of the country looks down on and distrusts,'' said Atlee Schidler, president of the Greater Washington Research Center, a private group. ''In most minds across the country, Washington is divided between Federal bureaucrats and poor blacks. But this is a predominantly middle-class town.''
Robert S. Strauss, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, put it this way: ''The American people see it as an ungovernable or ungoverned city where you can't go into the streets. I'm constantly amazed at people who come in and say, 'This is really a lovely city.' They are surprised it's not Sodom and Gomorrah.''
After all, the afflictions of Washington - the crimes, the drugs, the homelessness - are those of any large city. When the capital's statistics for crimes like rape, assault and robbery are compared with cities like Boston and Baltimore, they are about the same.
When Mr. Barry leaves office in January 1991 - or perhaps earlier, depending on the jury's verdict - he will leave a Washington decked out in the angular stone and glass motifs of high-rent downtown offices: 17 million square feet of new office space since 1985, bringing the city's total to 69 million square feet.
He will also leave a city grimly trying to keep its black middle class, who fled the city in such numbers in the 1970's that the Washington area is now the only major metropolitan region with more blacks in its suburbs (52 percent) than in the city (48 percent). After seven years of population stability in the range of 630,000 people, a sharp downturn in the past three years has left the population at about 604,000, according to the Census Bureau.
But young people continue to move in. Ms. Ernst, 27 years old and three years out of law school, is one of the newest wave of young professional migrants. The perennial crops of young Congressional aides and Government lawyers have been joined by more and more professionals in private business and public-interest groups.
Ms. Ernst's law firm, Ross, Dixon & Masback, which specializes in corporate insurance law, boasts ''competitive'' salaries, meaning $55,000 to $75,000 a year for someone like Ms. Ernst. Nationally, Washington ranks first in the percentage of residents 18 to 34 years old who earn more than $50,000.
''I just like this city,'' said Ms. Ernst, a native of Iowa. ''I like the theater; I like the free things like the Smithsonian museums. Living in the East as a transplanted Midwesterner, I'd choose it over Boston or New York. I like the pace.''
Even so, she said, she still roots for the Cubs and the Bears. ''I don't feel this is my town yet. I don't feel the sense of community here.''
She is not alone in her sense of rootlessness. For years the city of Washington has been a place that people in their early 20's flock to and people in their early 30's flee, said Eunice S. Grier, a demographic researcher.
By the time Ms. Ernst has been here long enough to feel the city's sense of community, she may be gone. ''I miss not having a congressman or senator,'' said Ms. Ernst, who rents a home at the city's northwestern edge. ''If you move a few blocks to the north you get congressmen and senators.''
In Washington, there are plenty of congressmen and senators. But except for Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy, who represents the city but has no vote in Congress, they represent other people. With Mr. Barry's worsening troubles, among them the conviction of top city officials on corruption charges and growing rumors about drug use by the Mayor, these representatives exercised ever tighter control over the city's affairs.
In the late 1970's and early 1980's, the Barry administration devised a workable rent-control program and attempted a face lift on some blighted areas by building municipal centers in outlying neighborhoods. Some of the most pressing issues, including subways and sewage disposal, were regional, and they were solved by collaboration among the potentially fractious mix of Federal, local and state officials.
 
Scandals and Problems Mounted
In the mid-1980's, scandals in the Barry administration multiplied. Simultaneously, the management of the city's prisons faltered and the delivery of health and housing services to the poor repeatedly failed. People were kept waiting for years for a place in often-crumbling public housing and the city's infant mortality rate rose to become the highest in the nation.
For Robert Taylor, the woes are no longer endurable. By the year's end, the 50-year-old retired police sergeant will leave his blue-collar, predominantly black neighborhood east of Union Station and move to a new home outside the city line.
''My youngest son moved to Maryland,'' said Mr. Taylor, a Washington native. ''My oldest son is following me to Maryland. I'm getting there just as soon as my house is built. I'm sick of this city.''
Crime is what makes Mr. Taylor particularly mad. For the last two years the city has had the highest murder rate in the nation.
Crime is not a big worry for Dr. Celia J. Maxwell, although her work as a Howard University Hospital physician and co-director of the university's AIDS clinic takes her up and down the crime corridor on Georgia Avenue. ''When I lived in Manhattan, I was in Upper Harlem,'' said the 39-year-old Panamanian native. ''I'm not cavalier about violence. But compared to Harlem, this was Mickey Mouse.''
Dr. Maxwell moved to Washington in 1980 after graduating from Columbia Medical School because the city was a mecca for black professionals. ''I wanted to be with people who looked like me,'' she said. ''At Howard I could evaluate my performance based entirely on my performance. It has nothing to do with my color.'' Although she feels comfortably rooted, ''taxes are too damn high,'' she said.
The city's per capita local tax burden, at $3,339 in 1988, including property taxes, compares with a national average of $1,772 per capita for combined state and local taxes; only Alaska residents pay more. City officials argue that they have few options. About 42 percent of city land, most of it belonging to the Federal Government, is off the tax rolls. And because two-thirds of the city's workers commute into the city, their taxes go elsewhere.
The most binding element of the complicated relationship between the Federal and District governments is the lump-sum payment the United States makes to the city each year. For the past three years, Congress has frozen the payment at $430 million, less than 14 percent of the district's $3.1 billion budget for the 1990 fiscal year. In the early 1980's the payment was about 20 percent of the budget.
 
Spending Efficiency Questioned
Watchdog groups increasingly question how efficiently the city government is spending that money. Compared with other city, county and state governments, the district's financial efficiency is low. ''The District spends 86 percent above the national average in meeting nearly average needs,'' according to a new study by the federally sponsored Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.
The city has one of the nation's highest ratios of public employees to residents, about one worker for every 12 residents. Of the 47,300 city jobs, 10,000 have been added since Mr. Barry took office. In the same time the population fell by more than 30,000 people.
But the city's basic problems, said Harry Hatry, an analyst with the National League of Cities. all come down to the equation that has plagued urban centers for decades: a shrinking middle-class tax base and an intractable core of poverty.
And while the young professionals come and go, the people below the poverty line, about 150,000 of them, remain locked in the city by high housing prices elsewhere. Moreover, 45 percent of the families with children are headed by a single parent.
''Those demographics are what the next mayor is really going to have to fight,'' Mr. Hatry said.

HEADLINE: Ecuador's Debt Is Used To Create Scholarships

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 11

 BODY:
Harvard University and an educational foundation in Ecuador have agreed to begin a program of converting Ecuador's foreign debt into Harvard scholarships for Ecuadorean students, university officials announced Tuesday.
While other debt-conversion plans have been used to finance conservation and health projects in Latin America, Africa and Asia, Harvard's ''debt-for-scholarship'' trade is believed to be the first agreement to exchange foreign debt for educational purposes.
Under terms of the Harvard plan, the university will buy $5 million in Ecuadorean debt - now selling for 15 percent of its face value - for $750,000 from United States banks eager to get the devalued loans off their books. Harvard will then donate the debt to Ecuador's Fundacion Capacitar, an educational foundation that can exchange the debt for Ecuadorean Government bonds worth 50 percent of the debt's face value, or $2.5 million. 
The Ecuadorean Government bonds, issued in local currency, will be sold in Ecuador by the foundation. Income from those sales will be used to buy dollar-denominated securities to support the scholarship fund.
 
Enthusiasm at Harvard
Financial analysts agree that the bonds are unlikely to sell well on the international market. But Teresa Petras, vice president in charge of Ecuadorean debt trading at J. P. Morgan in New York, noted, ''There is a limited secondary market for the local-currency bonds within Ecuador.''
Harvard's president, Derek C. Bok, who was approached by the Ecuadorean foundation about the deal last November, has pressed the university to increase foreign student enrollment and courses in foreign studies.
The fund, expected to produce $100,000 to $200,000 a year for scholarships, will support more than 70 full and partial scholarships over the next 10 years, roughly doubling the number of Ecuadorean scholarship students at Harvard. Money from the fund will also be used to support research grants and internships for Harvard students and professors in Ecuador.
Harvard now spends $70 million a year on student financial aid, said Robert Scott, Harvard's vice president for finance. ''This is going to increase substantially the financial aid we have for these students,'' he said. ''It is a win for everyone.'' He added that the university was interested in pursuing similar agreements with other countries.
 
Other Schools Interested
Several other American universities, including the University of California at Los Angeles, are also pursuing debt-for-scholarship agreements with Ecuador, and the University of Pittsburgh is waiting for approval of a debt-for-education trade that would finance research in Brazil, said Jack Ross, executive director of Debt for Development Coalition Inc., an international development group based in Washington.
For Ecuador, which has an external debt of more than $11 billion, the program will help reduce the debt burden while allowing Ecuadorean students to study at Harvard.
Other developing countries have pursued similar agreements to finance development projects in exchange for debt reduction. As of May, more than $132 million debt-for-development trades had been completed by American banks, according to the Debt for Development Coalition.
In 1987, Bolivia and several environmental groups completed a debt-for-nature trade that promoted land conservation. Another program, in which environmental groups purchased $5.6 million in Costa Rican debt for $700,000 from an American bank, was converted to local currency bonds, and the interest on them financed conservation projects in that country.

HEADLINE: Summit Promise - and Shame;
A Chance, at Least, for Fair Farm Policy

 BODY:
The Houston summit meeting resolved no important dispute. The leaders of the seven major industrialized nations did more agreeing to disagree than agreeing. But to judge their annual economic conference a failure is hasty. The leaders differed about how to aid the Soviet Union. Dismayingly, they condoned help for China. But on the primary issue of agriculture policies, the leaders agreed to phase down protectionist subsidies. 
Their language on farm subsidies is promising; perhaps they are willing finally to use the prestige of their united stance to help face up to domestic political resistance. But the words, however promising, are vague. The world won't know till December if they have bite.
With or without a cold war, economic issues divide the Western alliance. The European Community protects millions of inefficient family farmers by blocking low-cost food imports from big, efficient farms in the U.S. and farms in the third world. The system costs European taxpayers and consumers as much as $100 billion a year, but the European leaders have little stomach for threatening the jobs of politically potent farmers.
The U.S. is in a peculiar position. On the one hand, it too protects domestic agriculture, blocking imports of sugar, peanuts and dairy products. Yet the overwhelming economic interest of the U.S. lies in opening European markets to American grain and other products. And there's even more at stake: the Uruguay Round of multinational trade talks, scheduled to end in December.
Food-exporting countries, especially in the third world, are demanding that the industrialized countries open up their markets to more food imports. In exchange, they will consider new trade rules proposed by the industrialized countries governing services, intellectual property and foreign investment.
If the U.S. and Europe cannot agree to lower protectionist farm subsidies, the third world will likely pull out of the trade talks. That would be a grievous blow to world trade and growth. The impasse can be lifted only by national leaders, and the Houston meeting offered an ideal forum.
Did the Houston summiteers get that job done? The answer is unclear. Their words seem evasive. Yet for the first time, the Europeans specifically agreed to lower export subsidies, internal price supports and tariffs. And each of the European leaders is now armed with an international commitment that can be used against politically entrenched farmers at home.
Still, no European leader faced up to the fact that real reform would cost millions of European farmers their jobs. By December, they will have to offer the food-exporting countries tangible evidence that their products will be allowed in. The Houston summit agreement may fortify the European leaders and enable them to face down their farmers. Or maybe the summit agreements merely allow the leaders to evade brutal politics.
Fortify or evade? The world won't know until the trade negotiators get back to work and hammer out a document for the world's trading partners to consider in December. In the meantime, there's at least the promise of good news.

Toe in the Water: Cuomo Scouts '92 Convention

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Welcoming Democratic National Convention delegates to his home state, the Governor eloquently quotes St. Francis. Five days later he accepts the Presidential nomination, allowing as how he had not aspired to the office and that he would have preferred a better candidate, but noting that ''from such dread responsibility one does not shrink in fear, in self-interest or in false humility.''
The governor was Adlai E. Stevenson. In 1952 he was the last major-party Presidential candidate nominated at a convention in his home state. 
That 40 years later the convention will be held in New York, home state of another eloquent governor who, in his keynote address to the 1984 convention, also cited St. Francis, seems unlikely to influence the choice of a nominee. Nowadays, party conventions largely ratify results of primaries. Stevenson was the last nominee not selected on the first ballot.
Arguably, a candidate nominated in New York can leave lugging the baggage of fear, racial tension, poverty and permissiveness that many out-of-towners reflexively associate with the city. Worse yet if the candidate is a New Yorker. Even in 1924, the Presidential ambitions of Gov. Alfred E. Smith of New York were probably not enhanced by the delegates' prolonged exposure to the city over 14 days as they struggled through 103 ballots before nominating John W. Davis.
To the degree that the city puts on its best face for the convention, as it is likely to do again in 1992 in conjunction with the Columbus quinquecentennial, that may redound to its nominee. To the extent that New York's woes are perceived as emblematic of misplaced national Republican priorities, as they were in 1976 when the Ford Administration's urban policy was capsulized in The Daily News's ''Drop Dead'' headline, a candidate could transform adversity into campaign capital. It is the kind of political alchemy that Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo of New York is very good at.
''He's making that case already,'' said John Sasso, who was vice chairman of Michael S. Dukakis's 1988 Presidential campaign.
Last time, Mr. Cuomo flatly declared that he would not be a candidate for President. He said it would be politically impractical to campaign outside the state because, unlike Mr. Dukakis, he was at the mercy of a politically divided Legislature. He was haunted by his defeat in the 1977 New York City mayoral race by a better-prepared rival.
Speculation about a Presidential candidacy enhances Mr. Cuomo's stature in a gubernatorial election year, when he may be spared the scrutiny any incumbent deserves after two terms. He decries the ''semantic carousel'' set spinning by his every disclaimer.
Yet Mr. Cuomo has refrained from stating flatly, as he did before winning a second term in 1986, that running again for governor would preclude a Presidential campaign. His vaguer disclaimers seem less convincing.
''I believe he's going to run,'' Mr. Sasso said yesterday.
For every season there is a candidate. In 1976, Jimmy Carter's integrity was promoted; in 1988, Mr. Dukakis's competence was. ''What they are looking for in '92, I suspect,'' said Robert A. Farmer, treasurer of the Democratic National Committee and Mr. Dukakis's top fund raiser, ''is charisma and vision. That seems to be tailor-made for Governor Cuomo.''
Defying conventional wisdom, the Governor suggested yesterday that hailing from New York might be less of a liability because so many of the city's negative qualities were no longer unique to New York, if they ever were. ''I saw homeless sleeping across the street from the White House,'' he said.
He again dismissed speculation about 1992, suggesting to reporters at a City Hall celebration of New York's snaring of the convention that it was something they save for rainy days. It was raining when Mr. Cuomo was asked why, if he wanted to close the door on a Presidential candidacy, he did not simply rule that out and do the same about a draft, as he did in 1988, 14 months after declaring that he would not be a candidate.
His statement would not be believed, Mr. Cuomo replied. Also, he said, some people would consider it an affirmation that he had something to hide. There is an unstated third reason: Why should he?
It would be shortsighted to rule out a race that because of President Bush's perceived invincibility and the potential importunings of fellow Democrats, Mr. Cuomo might indeed be persuaded to make and to justify in the loftiest terms.
''There has always been that possibility,'' he said. ''I have never foreclosed it.''
How long will he leave the door ajar? ''Until someobdy comes along who's better,'' Mr. Cuomo said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Vows Glorious Show For Democrats

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins accepted the Democratic Party's gift of its 1992 National Convention to New York City yesterday, pledging to make it a ''glorious pageant of progress'' that would ''renew America's progressive values.''
Surrounded by political, business, labor and civic leaders in a packed City Council chamber, Mr. Dinkins signed the city's contract with the national Democratic chairman, Ronald H. Brown. They used a desk that belonged to George Washington when New York was the nation's capital, to make official what was supposed to be secret but had been known for days.
The Mayor promised to spend $20 million in city money to rent and prepare Madison Square Garden and other sites for the 20,000 delegates, alternates and guests and the 15,000 news people expected to arrive in the city two years from this week. He said the crowds would generate $100 million for the local economy. 
 
Private Contributions
The $100 million figure is based on estimates that the delegates and reporters attending the convention, some for four days and some for seven, will each spend an average of $353 a day, or a total of $51 million. The Democratic National Committee itself is expected to spend another $8 million.
All that direct spending would mean new income to local residents and businesses, who would presumably re-use some of it, generating even more activity that - according to the city's economic models -would multiply the direct spending by a factor of 1.7, for a total impact of about $100 million.
Besides the $20 million the city plans to spend - including $6.6 million for police overtime - a host committee of business and labor officials led by Robert E. Rubin, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, has pledged to raise $2.7 million in private contributions of cash and services to entertain and support the conventioneers and their staff.
In addition to Madison Square Garden, the city plans to use the Penta Hotel, the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center for press offices and party caucuses, while the Sheraton Centre on Seventh Avenue is to be the official headquarters hotel.
An army of cars, buses and golf carts will shuttle delegates, dignitaries and security guards from place to place.
Mr. Brown, who announced his decision in Washington and then flew to New York to announce it again, called the city ''the center of an international communications universe that will allow our candidate and our party to send a message of hope, empowerment, change and responsibility to millions across America and around the world.''
But even before the celebration had ended, and before they could answer questions about what the convention would mean for New York's myriad problems, from homelessness to crime, Mr. Brown and the others got a taste of what they may be in for.
As Gov. Mario M. Cuomo rose to speak, he was drowned out by an anti-abortion heckler who stood up amid the invited crowd and shouted that the Governor should be excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church.
''This convention has been highjacked by Mario Cuomo's New York City Democrats using the blood of aborted babies!'' the protester yelled.
After the man had left the chamber, Mr. Cuomo paused for a moment, chuckled at the heckling and said, referring to the city's reputation for brashness: ''Let's be honest. It never would have happened in New Orleans,'' the city Mr. Brown turned down in favor of New York. The audience roared.
 
Personal Ties to New York
Mr. Brown said the Louisiana legislature's recent adoption of the strictest anti-abortion law in the country had played a part in New Orleans's loss, but he praised that city's efforts.
In the end, several Democrats said yesterday, Mr. Brown's personal ties to New York had as much to do with his decision as anything else Mr. Brown grew up here, is a longtime friend of Mr. Dinkins and former law student of Mr. Cuomo.
As they celebrated the choice of the convention site and its possible effects, local and state politicians hovered at City Hall yesterday. Mr. Cuomo, who has been regarded as a serious Presidential contender, repeated that he had no plans to run for the Presidency.
Reporters not content with the old game of jousting with Mr. Cuomo forced even Mr. Dinkins, whose assiduous pursuit of the convention has raised some lighthearted speculation about his own national ambitions, to say several times that he wanted only to be a good Mayor.
 
'Dinkins for President'
But the Mayor gave a coy answer in a letter he sent yesterday to the actor Michael Moriarty, who recently sent him a $1,000 check payable to ''Dinkins for President.''
''After we cure all the problems we face in New York, I will have plenty of energy left to lend a hand in Washington,'' Mr. Dinkins wrote. ''But I have to concentrate on New York first, so I'm happy you did not specify the Presidential campaign year for which your check would be valid. Will it hold till the turn of the century?''
In any case, yesterday's announcement was a big victory and a belated birthday present for Mr. Dinkins, who turned 63 on Tuesday. With the brand of majesterial populism that he has mastered, the former Marine marched into the flag-decked chamber as a brass band in the balcony played the Marine Hymn.
Later, Mr. Cuomo gave Mr. Dinkins a birthday present of a tile mosaic panel picturing a red apple, in token of Mr. Dinkins's repeated references to New York as a ''gorgeous mosaic'' of diversity, an image Mr. Cuomo first used years ago. Praising Mr. Dinkins lavishly, the Governor seemed eager to dispel the suggestion of some mayoral aides that he should have left the spotlight yesterday to the Mayor alone.

HEADLINE: Dirty Schools: Will a New Contract Help Clean Them?

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
A little more than two years ago, before the signing of a contract hailed as the start of a new era in school maintenance, New York City school custodians cleaned classrooms every other day, cafeterias once a week and mopped floors three times a year. Head custodians were paid almost $20,000 more than the average teacher and about $7,000 less than the average principal.
Now, as school officials negotiate with the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 891 for a new contract to replace the one that expired June 30, school custodians clean classrooms every other day, cafeterias once a week and mop floors three times a year. A backlog of repairs, from clogged toilets to broken windows, has not abated, nor have complaints from community groups about how difficult it is to reserve the use of school buildings in the evenings. 
Despite assurances that the 1988 contract would improve school maintenance and give principals more control of the buildings they supervise, 60 percent of principals surveyed by the City Comptroller's office last year said custodial service had not improved, while 58 percent said that their custodian does little or no ''hands on'' work.
According to reports both anecdotal and documented, in some schools teachers mop their own classrooms and hallways are swept by students instead of one of the system's 956 custodians or their thousands of staff members.
Principals are still not even sure what duties the custodians are required to perform - and a report by City Council President Andrew J. Stein found that only about half of all principals have copies of the custodians' contract.
Disappointed parents groups and education advocates have renewed their calls for changes in the way the system works. In particular, they want the new contract to spell out the responsibilities of the custodians and of the board.
The president of Local 891, John W. Holahan, agreed yesterday that the cleaning schedule was inadequate, but he said the problem lies beyond the control of his union.
 
'The Board Designed the Schedule'
''I think it's horrendous you're cleaning classrooms every other day and that windows are washed once a year,'' Mr. Holahan said. ''Prior to the 1970's financial crisis we cleaned the building every day. The board designed the schedule; they made the cuts and never restored them.''
Mr. Holahan said the 1988 contract called for a substantial expansion in the types of repairs done by custodians. But he said the board failed to provide materials to make those repairs, resulting in a backlog of 55,000 work orders.
Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez has said that while there are schools where custodial care is not as it should be, many custodians and their staffs work against the odds to create a clean environment. The limited resources to do the job right make the job difficult, he said.
The contract negotiations, which are not expected to be resolved before the end of the month, represent another test of Mr. Fernandez's political muscle. Among the Chancellor's crusades since taking over in January have been efforts to encourage schools to open their doors to public use, to improve the appearance of school buildings and to restore the balance of power between the board and the custodians union.
''This is a very important negotiation for us,'' said James Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Fernandez. ''It's one that has a large impact on the way we run our schools.''
 
Increasing Accountability
At informal meetings over the last three months, Mr. Fernandez and Mr. Holahan agreed that the key areas of discussion will include increased custodial responsibility for maintenance and repair; the use of the schools after 3 P.M. and fees for those activities; removal of asbestos from school buildings, and the relationship between principals and custodians.
Making the custodians more accountable to principals is high on Mr. Fernandez's agenda. While custodians report to the principals, they have complete discretion under existing contracts on how they perform routine cleaning and repairs as long as they meet minimum obligations.
The custodians function both as city employees and independent contractors. Each administers his own staff and an annual allowance for supplies, equipment and salaries. The 1988 contract clarified vague language that in the past led to custodians' refusing to perform routine tasks like repairing a broken window.
But many say the changes did not go far enough. ''My perspective is nothing has changed since 1988,'' said John Fager, vice-president of the citywide Parent Coalition and a former education adviser to Mr. Stein. The father of two children in city schools, he is Director of Education for the city's Department of Consumer Affairs.
 
'The Same Old System'
''Here's an example of a system that has a tremendously adverse impact on the schools and we were supposed to have reform, but we're back to the same old system,'' Mr. Fager said. ''Can you imagine cafeterias that are mopped only once a week? If any of these schools were treated like restaurants they'd be shut down by the Health Department.''
And despite what in 1988 was described as a breakthrough in reducing large fees paid to custodians for after-hours use of school buildings, a report scheduled for release today by a coalition of family service groups said that confusion and perhaps even more red tape remain as barriers to public use of school buildings.
Mr. Holahan said yesterday that principals are responsible for after-school activities and that the rates are set by the Board of Education. But there appears to be widespread confusion among both principals and custodians about who does what.
 
'A Whole Anarchy'
''The contract and the system are so terrible,'' said Barbara Miller, staff director of the Neighborhood Family Services Coalition. ''The custodians do only what they are required to do.''
Ms. Miller said as part of their research, the coalition sent questionnaires to all elementary and intermediate school principals. They also called 11 school district offices seeking information on how a community group could rent school space.
They received six different answers on how space could be rented, only four of which were correct, Ms. Miller said. Eight different fees were quoted, of which three were correct. One district quoted a price that amounted to a 20.5 percent overcharge.
''It's difficult because among the principals and custodians, no one can decide what the fee is or who pays the fee,'' she said. ''It's just a whole anarchy of no one knows what's going on.''

HEADLINE: Hoboken Warns Of Tax Increase After Plan Dies

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A vote on Tuesday in which residents rejected a $30 million plan to redevelop Hoboken's waterfront is expected to result in tax increases and layoffs, officials said yesterday.
''We anticipate sizable layoffs,'' said Peg Thomas, director of planning and community development for Hoboken. ''Everyone in the community will have to bear the burden.'' 
The $30 million waterfront development deal with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was defeated by 12 votes - 4,418 to 4,406 - in a special election. The project would have been the first major development on the Hudson River waterfront since cargo ships began taking their business to the ports of Newark and Elizabeth 30 years ago.
As part of the deal, the Port Authority would have also financed $41 million in municipal improvements.
 
Far-Reaching Implications
City officials argued that the plan would bring in much needed revenue and be an attractive replacement for the crumbling warehouses and docks along the waterfront.
But a coalition of environmental, anti-development and community advocates successfully lobbied against the plan, saying it would tarnish the city's image and overwhelm the one-square-mile community.
Hoboken's 42,000 residents will now face increased taxes and cuts in city services as a result of that success, city officials said. They said it was too early to give any exact figures.
''The city will have to reassess its fiscal situation and will have to reorganize,'' said Ms. Thomas, adding that any worker layoffs would be felt across the board. ''There'll be a lot of far-reaching implications and ramifications.''
 
Work Suspended
The city must also repay $7 million it received from the Port Authority, which was already incorporated into the city budget. It will also lose an additional $8 million that was expected from the agency this year.
Under the agreement with the Port Authority, Hoboken would have leased about 32 acres of waterfront to the agency, which would have built 3.2 million square feet of commercial and residential space, including offices and retail stores.
The Port Authority would have also paid the city $30 million during the next five years.
Until an alternate plan is agreed on, the city and the Port Authority have suspended all work on the project.

HEADLINE: H.U.D. Project On Ninth Street Halted by Judge

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
A judge ruled yesterday that the Department of Housing and Urban Development had violated its rules in approving funds for a low-income housing project on the Lower East Side. The judge issued a preliminary order blocking H.U.D. from proceeding on the project.
The project, 80 units of housing for the elderly with low incomes, is planned for Ninth Street and Avenue C, a high-crime area where many houses are boarded up. 
A neighborhood group, La Plaza Defense League, sued to block the project, arguing that in accordance with Federal guidelines the housing should not be approved because of the area's ''undue concentration'' of poor people.
In his decision, Judge William C. Conner of Federal District Court said the housing agency had violated its regulation against allowing projects to add to poor neighborhoods. The reasons for approving the project, the judge added, were subjective and not well considered, saying, ''H.U.D. has paid only lip service to the requirements of its regulation and the purpose of the statute.''
 
Park for the Neighborhood
La Plaza sued after The New York Times reported in October that the regional economist in the housing agency, David Burns, had said that he had originally opposed the project because he felt it violated policy. But Mr. Burns added that his superiors pressured him to approve the housing.
La Plaza says it is seeking to stop the project because it would force the closing of La Plaza park, which is at the site of the proposed housing. The park, built and maintained by neighborhood residents, would be razed. Judge Conner's decision means that the suit can go to trial. In issuing the restraining order, the judge found that La Plaza would most likely win the case at trial.
The lawyer for the league, Harry Kresky, called the ruling ''a very signficant victory for the community.''
The ruling does not mean that the park will remain. Anticipating the project, the city started eviction proceedings against La Plaza. A suit by the group to block the eviction is pending, and Mr. Kresky said the Federal decision would bolster the group's case in Civil Court.
Officials in the regional office of the housing agency said they had not seen the ruling. ''The best we can say is that we will certainly study it closely and consult with the U.S. Attorney's office and the Department of Justice on whether or not we would appeal it,'' said the deputy regional administrator, Burton Bloomburg.

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
If you are one of the 50 million adult Americans who still smoke cigarettes, now is the best time to quit. The incentives to end your affair with nicotine have never been greater.
Nationally, less than three adults in 10 smoke. In many social circles, less than 10 percent of people still smoke, and even fewer dare to smoke in public. And the places where smokers are permitted to light up are growing ever smaller and farther between.
Restrictive legislation and public pressures are increasingly turning smokers into social pariahs who must sneak off by themselves or ask others for permission to smoke. The time is ripe to expedite the goal of the former Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop: to create a smoke-free society by the year 2000. 
The economy can no longer afford the 1,000 deaths a day and the even greater number of serious illnesses directly attributable to cigarette smoking. The majority of Americans who are nonsmokers are no longer willing to have their own health jeopardized by the noxious habit of the minority. The evidence that passive smoking is harmful is so convincing that the Environmental Protection Agency now lists it as a serious environmental hazard.
But how can so many people be weaned from cigarettes? Almost every smoker questioned in surveys believes the habit is personally harmful, and more than four smokers in five expresses a desire to quit. Most have tried one or more times to break their addiction to nicotine; alas, they relapse, usually within a few days or weeks, but sometimes years later. Typically it takes four to 10 attempts before a potential quitter finally makes it stick.
It is certainly not easy - many heavily addicted smokers say quitting was the hardest thing they have ever done, but all who really want to quit can find a way to become former smokers forever. As one exasperated would-be quitter put it: ''There are as many ways to quit smoking as there are people who have quit, and I've tried them all! Now, I've got to find the one that was tailor-made for me.''
 
Tales That Inspire
In a fascinating and inspiring book, ''The Last Puff'' (W. W. Norton, $18.95), Dr. John W. Farquhar and Dr. Gene A. Spiller give 30 former smokers a chance to share the secrets of their success. The stories can be a source of inspiration, hope and helpful hints for smokers who have, like the storytellers, made repeated failed attempts to quit.
Each found a particular trigger that prompted yet another effort, this time for keeps.
One man, a three-pack-a-day smoker for 30 years, finally quit after his wife agreed to the purchase of a fancy new car if he agreed never to smoke in it. Then, as soon as the car arrived, the couple left on a three-week, crosscountry trip in it.
One woman, a college teacher and writer for whom words and cigarettes were intricately entwined, finally decided to quit for good after seeing a smoker who appeared much older than her years and was beginning to ''look like an ashtray'' with wrinkled, gray skin, yellow teeth and fingers, and thin, limp hair.
A man who wrote advertising copy for a tobacco company said he quit ''because it began to nauseate me that I was a slave to tobacco,'' adding, ''My whole life revolved around being able to smoke.'' He had to leave concerts, the theater, movies, every 20 to 25 minutes to smoke and even resented sleeping because it meant he couldn't smoke.
What nearly all had in common was a long ''incubation period'' - usually years of thinking they wanted to get the tobacco monkey off their backs, plus innumerable failed attempts. They also all learned from their earlier failures. They learned what didn't work and, on the final attempt, many tried a new tack.
For Elton W., a public relations specialist, it was a new attitude that spelled success. ''In all the previous attempts,'' he said, ''I acted out of a spirit of self-sacrifice. I was giving up something that I liked and quitting was unpleasant. I felt like a martyr.''
On his final attempt 20 years ago, he changed his perspective. He practiced a new identity: that of a nonsmoker. He imagined himself in all kinds of situations in which someone might offer a cigarette and then said out loud, ''No, thanks, I don't smoke.'' Not ''I'm trying to quit'' but ''No, I don't smoke.'' And he imagined himself to be a super-wholesome person, a squeaky clean Goody Two-Shoes, the kind of person no one would dare to offer a cigarette to.
Several successful quitters found it easiest to do on vacation. Being away from familiar surroundings and the usual triggers and stresses that prompt them to reach for a cigarette helped them break the habit. By the time they returned home, they were over the worst of the addiction, had evolved some alternative actions and were well on the road to being permanent former smokers.
As for the means to this coveted end, more than 90 percent of the 43 million Americans who have stopped smoking did so on their own. Most of the successful quitters quit cold turkey, some after cutting down or switching to a less potent brand of cigarette but most just by throwing away all their cigarettes and their smoking accouterments.
 
Challenge for Women
Women have an especially hard time giving up cigarettes. If current trends continue, in five years there will be more American women than men who are smokers. And smoking-related diseases, like lung cancer, are rising among women at astronomical rates. Yet, most research on quitting techniques has focused on men.
To deal with the special problems of women who smoke, like a fear of weight gain if they quit and a strong dependence on cigarettes to cope with stress, Sue Delaney, herself a former smoker who puffed away two packs a day for 40 years, has written a small but very valuable guide, ''Women Smokers Can Quit: A Different Approach'' (Women's Healthcare Press, $6.95). The book can be purchased directly by calling 800-543-3854 or by writing to Women's Healthcare Press, 500 Davis Street, Suite 700, Evanston, Ill. 60201.
A surprising number of Americans who have stopped smoking say their physician's advice to quit was the most important motivating factor. Yet only 46 percent of all smokers surveyed last year by the United States Public Health Service said they had been advised by a physician to quit smoking. Even fewer people have been actively counseled as to how to go about quitting.
Doctors can now prescribe a nicotine-containing gum to ease withdrawal. For some smokers, this temporary aid enables them to make a concerted effort to stop smoking and wean themselves from a behavioral dependence on cigarettes without suffering through the extreme irritability of nicotine withdrawal that can prompt family, friends and co-workers to beg them to resume smoking. Smokers who depend heavily on the relaxant and stimulant effects of nicotine can become hooked on the gum, but the gum is easier to give up than cigarettes.
Other aids that help some people include hypnosis (especially when the smoker learns self-hypnosis); acupuncture, which can reduce the craving for addictive drugs, and a variety of relaxation techniques, which can calm the raw nerves of a would-be quitter and provide them with an alternative way to relax.
But this does not mean that organized stop-smoking programs are of little or no use. While it is true that less than 10 percent of former smokers quit through such programs, those who do best in a group setting are nearly always smokers who have repeatedly tried to quit on their own and failed. Success is fostered by group support, the feeling that they are not the only ones going through this, the helpful hints offered by the counselor and other participants and in many cases the fact that they paid for the program.
And even when a relapse occurs after completing an organized program, the learning experience can often abet success of a future effort to quit on one's own.
The bottom line of stop-smoking efforts, then, is the old Boy Scout motto: If at first you don't succeed, try, try again, because each failure can be a steppingstone to future success. And by the year 2000 the air both outside and inside the lungs of Americans can be a lot cleaner.

HEADLINE: Summer, Children And 'War of the Exes'

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
FOR legions of divorced fathers, a ritual is under way. A time of love and reunion, it can also be an agony of dashed hopes and recrimination. It is the extended summer visit with the children, an arrangement included in most divorce settlements, which in 9 of 10 cases give custody to the mother.
During most of the year, these ''noncustodial'' parents are weekend fathers. They can be spotted with their children on Saturday-morning shopping trips to suburban malls, when fathers from intact families might be mowing a lawn or playing golf. They order two scoops of ice cream for the youngsters instead of one, and extra chocolate sprinkles.
For many of these men, the summer visit, with its heightened expectations, is also the yearly culmination of a struggle to maintain a parental role, despite what they perceive as formidable obstacles put in their path by the courts and their former spouses. 
From the mother's point of view, giving up a child for part of the summer can also be highly stressful, especially in the first years after a divorce, when emotions can still be raw and animosity between the former spouses at a peak. One mother feeling those worries this week was Dina McClellan, a freelance editor in Manhattan, who was awaiting the return of her two young children from a two-week visit with their father in Jersey City.
''They were all excited, packing their bags, and my daughter didn't even look back at me when she went prancing off with her father,'' she said. ''I was actually shaking and depressed. They see him as a good-time father, where with me, we just kind of hang around together. I feared they liked being with him more.''
The forces that helped break up a marriage, like a struggle for control or an inability to communicate, can quickly resurface during a summer visit. The children can become players, willing or not, in their parents' continuing battle.
A New York business executive was at La Guardia Airport recently to pick up two pre-adolescent sons who live with his former wife in the Midwest. He had mailed them first-class tickets, and they emerge from the plane wearing torn jeans and dirty sneakers. ''I give your mother all this support money, and this is how she dresses you?'' were the first words out of his mouth. The boys looked at each other and smirked. The battle lines were drawn.
''I asked this man if he would start one of his business meetings like that,'' said Jeannette Lofas, a Manhattan therapist who works with divorced fathers, including the one whose airport encounter she described. Ms. Lofas, who heads the Stepfamily Foundation, said summer visits with children can be one of the toughest tests of fatherhood.
''I call it the war of the exes,'' she said. ''If there continues to be bad blood between the ex-spouses, the summer visit can be as painful as the divorce itself. The kids may arrive filled with anger at their father. At home, they've been given too much permission to bad-mouth him. Some arrive as Mom's little spies, to sneak a look at his bank balance or check out his new girlfriend.''
The situation is even thornier if the man has remarried and has other children. There are an estimated 11 million married couples in the United States in which at least one partner has been divorced.
Joe Nasar, a Manhattan accountant, is one remarried father who sought counseling. ''One kid pulls you one way, and the other pulls you another, and your ex-wife and your current wife each want something else,'' Mr. Nasar said. ''A visit can drive you nuts unless you plan it down to the letter.''
Summer visits take two basic forms, said James C. Melamed, the executive director of the Academy of Family Mediators in Eugene, Ore., a national group representing divorce mediators. ''There is the one-to-three-week visit, and the visit covering more than half the summer,'' he said.
The length of the visit usually depends on more than a father's personal commitment. It often hinges on how far the child has to travel, how much vacation the father has, and whether or not a new wife, friends or grandparents can help look after the youngsters, Mr. Melamed said.
Logistics can be an issue. Michael Krouch, a 42-year-old social worker in Westchester County, has a rough road to keep a commitment to his children, one that winds through three states week after week.
One Saturday morning saw Mr. Krouch, who is now single, behind the wheel of his Ford Escort by 8 o'clock. He was headed for the Connecticut home of one of his two former wives to pick up their 6-year-old daughter.
It was the first stop in a complicated weekend routine for Mr. Krouch, who takes graduate courses at Columbia University and tends bar some nights to help make support payments. With his daughter scrunched happily in the front seat beside him, he pointed the Escort westward; 75 minutes later they arrived at a park in Teaneck, N.J., where Mr. Krouch's son from his first marriage, Canaan, 13, was playing in a Little League baseball game.
''Two children from two broken marriages who live in two different states doesn't leave much free time for myself,'' Mr. Krouch said with soft-spoken acceptance, his former wife Debby seated next to him at the game. ''You're always on the go.''
Debby Krouch, a United Airlines supervisor, considered transferring to Denver last summer. But, she said, ''Canaan needs both his parents, and Mike is a good father.''
When children live with their mother in a different city from their father and see him only infrequently, the summer reunion can cause extraordinary stress on all sides, family experts said. For men deprecated by their former wives in front of their children, the visit can turn into a crusade for vindication.
''I had a client who was a businessman who lost his job and had to drive a cab for a while,'' said Ellen Weber, a New York psychotherapist. ''His esteem hit bottom. If he couldn't see his son, that meant his wife had triumphed over him once again, so his attitude with his son was, 'You're going to come see me even if it kills you!' ''
Feelings of powerlessness and humiliation can become so painful during visits that some men cut back on time with their children or drop out of the relationship completely.
Studies of divorced fathers show alarming numbers retreating from emotional and financial commitments after a divorce. By some estimates, nearly half of all children in the custody of their mothers have little or no contact with their fathers.
The numbers have fostered theories that the bonds between men and their children are weaker than those between mothers and children, or that men are more irresponsible. Those assumptions, while they may apply in some cases, hurt those men who agonize over the legal, financial and psychological impediments to close, loving contact with a child.
''A lot of people say fathers don't care about their children and are deserting them,'' said Dr. Marion Lindblad-Goldberg, the director of the family-therapy training center of the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic. ''I don't share that view. Many fathers care so much, they try to protect themselves by pulling away. Sometimes their ex-wives make visitation so difficult that just coming by to pick up the kids can be emotionally traumatic.''
Stephen Erickson, a Minneapolis divorce mediator, said that ''even the label of 'noncustodial visiting parent' put on fathers by the divorce courts tells you something.''
''The only other place 'custody' is used is in prisons,'' he said. ''The only other place 'visitation' is used is in funeral parlors.'' Fathers' rights groups say that some embittered former wives will go to great lengths to deny men their legal claim to visit their children. Across the country such groups have sought legislation to establish joint legal custody in uncontested divorces, to give men equal authority in major decisions about their children.
New York does not provide for shared legal custody, and is unlikely to in the foreseeable future, said James Taylor, a fathers' rights campaigner in Clinton, N.Y.
''It's a dead issue for the time being,'' Mr. Taylor said in a telephone interview. He called the state ''a bastion of powerful women's organizations'' that urge women to gain sole custody as a means of control and as a way to insure that fathers keep up with support payments. ''They feel women end up economically on the shorter end of the stick because of a man's greater earning power,'' he said.
Lawrence Morgan, an accountant who is the president of the Fathers' Rights Association of Metro New York-Long Island, said, ''Our family court systems look at fathers only to the extent that they supply money, never that fathers have a right to be involved in a child's educational life, medical life or other components that go into his well-being.''
But not all family experts are convinced that joint custody guarantees that the father will be an involved father. ''I'm still in favor of joint custody because it sends the right signal to fathers, but I don't have any illusions about it,'' said Andrew Cherlin, a Johns Hopkins sociologist who cited studies showing that large numbers of fathers stopped seeing their children, even with joint custody.
''There's a relatively small group of well-educated and sensitive fathers who are prevented by custody arrangements from acting as responsible parents,'' he said. ''But their numbers are dwarfed by those who don't give a darn.''

HEADLINE: Congress Unit Assails U.S. Information Policy

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
The Federal Government is ignoring scientific and technical information that could potentially be one of its most valuable weapons in the battle for high-technology international competitiveness, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment reports.
While the Bush Administration has been concerned about the consequences of an industrial policy that favors one industry over another, the report says the White House has overlooked the role that the Federal Government could play by improving access to computerized technical and scientific data bases.
The report, scheduled for release Thursday, sees access to a wide range of information as an essential part of the innovation process. It also describes such information as a central product of the $65 billion that the United States Government spends on research and development. 
 
Controversial Issue
Improving access to Government information by modernizing storage and retrieval systems has become a controversial issue in recent years as information companies and public-interest groups have clashed over how new computerized data bases should be made available to the public. But these groups now appear to be close to a compromise.
The report criticizes the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy for failing to show leadership on the issue.
''During several years of debates on Government-wide information policy, there is no evidence that Office of Science and Technology Policy has been a player in that debate,'' said Fred B. Wood, project director for the Office of Technology Assessment study. ''There has been no one on the executive branch side looking out for the agencies or trying to reflect the broader national interest.''
The Reagan Administration hampered Federal scientific and technical information programs, the report said, because it favored getting the Federal Government out of the business of distributing information and did not pursue policies to modernize distribution systems.
 
Price for Information
In 1985, the Office of Management and Budget issued a document that emphasized the role of private companies in disseminating Federal information and supported the idea of charging people to get it.
Legislation now before Congress would alter the Government's policy to emphasize that Federal agencies have the primary responsibility for providing information.
The report by the Office of Technology Assessment sees computerized data bases as the only way to manage Federal data libraries. It notes that for a Federal initiative to succeed, it must take several steps:
* Create standards for data bases so that information can be freely moved between agencies and users.
* Index data bases and documents so that information is easy to find.
* Increase financing for basic scientific and technical information in Government research and development budgets.
While creating a single centralized Federal information data base is still not technically feasible, the report argues, ''low-cost, user-friendly electronic scientific and technical information'' would stimulate computer-based science, mathematics and engineering education.
Copies of the report, titled ''Helping America Compete: The Role of Scientific and Technical Information,'' can be ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, at the United States Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402, for $3.75.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money-Fund Yields Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down for the week that ended yesterday.
''The fixed-income market was jolted last Friday by an unexpected upward revision in the May employment figures, and unemployment has still not responded to Fed pressures,'' said Walter S. Frank, the chief economist at Donoghue's. ''So the market, which has been anticipating lower rates for the near future, retreated and rates went up.'' 
This week, interest rates have moderated somewhat.
''Still, the important factor behind any interest-rate adjustment will come from Government budget negotiations and from the weak economy,'' Mr. Frank added. ''Right now, it's an eager market pitted against slow-moving events, accounting for the seesaw effect in rates.''
Tax-exempt money managers increased the number of days securities are held in their portfolios to 49, from 48.
The assets increased by $3 billion, to total $78.9 billion, with the average seven-day tax-exempt compounded yield down by 16 basis points, to 5.30 percent, and the 30-day average yield down by 2 basis points, to 5.40 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
For investors in a 28 percent tax bracket the equivalent taxable seven-day compounded yield would be 7.36 percent, and it would be 7.91 percent for those in a 33 percent bracket.
 
Calvert Ranks High
Among tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million survyed by IBC/Donoghue's, Calvert Tax Free Reserves, distributed by the Calvert Group in Washington, outperformed the other funds this week by yielding 6.01 percent.
The assets of taxable funds increased by $4.7 billion, to a total of $379.2 billion. Those of institutional funds increased by $800 billion, to $79.6 billion, while the assets of consumer funds rose by $3.9 billion, to a total of $299.6 billion. The gains were attributed to a a narrowing of yield spreads between certificates of deposit and money market funds.
The average days to maturity of taxable securities held in managers' portfolios fell to 43 from 45.
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund fell by a basis point, to 7.95 percent, while the 30-day average yield was unchanged at 7.97 percent.
Of the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million, the Alger Money Market Portfolio, distributed by Fred Alger & Company in Jersey City, showed the best return for the second straight week, with a yield of 8.82 percent.

Stocks advanced sharply yesterday in heavy trading, with oil, high-technology and drug stocks leading the way.
By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 41.83, to 2,932.67 - just a few points away from the all-time high of 2,935.89 set on June 4. Computerized program trading accounted for more than half the run-up.
Birinyi Associates said it had tracked five buying programs that lifted the Dow 24 points and one selling program that cut the Dow 2 points, for a net gain of 22. A 10-minute buying spree near the end of the day alone accounted for 12 points of the gain, it said. 
Continuing to pick up significantly, trading volume spurted to 162.22 million shares, from 147.63 million the day before. And in a sign that traders must have welcomed, 971 stocks rose, only 506 declined and 74 reached new highs.
Among other stock indexes, the broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose 4.74, to 361.23; the Nasdaq composite, buoyed by technology stocks, rose 2.93, to 463.90, and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.68, to 359.41.
 
'Big Position' in Technology
Peter DaPuzzo, co-head of worldwide equities trading in the Lehman Brothers division of Shearson Lehman Hutton, said, ''Technology stocks led the rally Tuesday and again Wednesday despite Oracle's disappointing profits; that shows there's real strength in the tech stocks.''
Mentioning I.B.M., Digital Equipment and Compaq, among others, he said that several big financial institutions were ''taking really big positions'' in such stocks.
''History shows that leadership in the tech stocks creates follow-through in the overall market,'' he said.
One trader said the market was also responding to Alan Greenspan's ''moral suasion.''
Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a House Judiciary subcommittee yesterday that ''short of a constitutional restraint on expenditures, it's very difficult to see what one can do'' about the Federal budget deficit.
''The market likes that kind of talk,'' the trader said.
On a cautionary note, Robert H. Stovall, the president of Stovall/ Twenty-First Advisers, said ''the stock market's heading into a near-term correction - a drop in prices.''
The reason, he said, is that ''the Japanese have made it clear they wish to see the yen go higher versus the dollar; that means higher Japanese interest rates to pull money into the yen.
''Historically, a weak U.S. dollar does not bode well for U.S. stocks or bonds because they become unattractive for non-U.S. investors,'' Mr. Stovall said.
 
Wal-Mart Leads Volume
A minute-by-minute chart of the Dow industrials showed that except for a brief rise after the opening bell and a short decline in the wake of Tuesday's strong selloff, the blue-chip index moved steadily into higher ground for most of the day.
Although Wal-Mart led the New York Stock Exchange's list of 10 most active stocks, rising 3/8, to 33 3/4, on expectations that sales figures out today will be strong, the Dow industrials were prominent on the list.
Recovering from a negative report on tobacco in Barron's, Philip Morris, No. 2 on the list, rose 1 1/8, to 49 1/4, on 2.4 million shares. No. 3, A.T.& T., the most widely held stock, fell 1/8, to 37 3/8, on 2.3 million shares, hitting a new low of 37. It said last month that second-quarter profits would decline.
Fighting off an unwanted takeover bid, DeSoto, a paint and detergents producer, surged 5 1/2, to 45, in heavy trading after saying it would pay stockholders special dividends totaling as much as $28.
In a strong oil group, reacting partly to predictions of sharply higher oil prices coming in a few years, ARCO rose 2 1/8, to 117 5/8; Oryx 1 3/4, to 43; Chevron 1 5/8, to 71; Unocal 1 1/2, to 27 3/4; Royal Dutch 1 1/2, to 76 1/2; Texaco 1 3/8, to 58; Mobil 1 3/8, to 61 5/8, and Amoco 1 1/4, to 51 3/4.
And in a strong drug group, Eli Lilly rose 2 1/8, to 86 7/8; Rorer 2, to 75 3/4; Abbott 1, to 43 3/4; American Home Products 1, to 53; American Cyanamid 1, to 60 7/8; Johnson & Johnson 1 5/8, to 69 5/8, and Merck 1 7/8, to 88 1/4 - all in heavy trading. Health-care stocks are regarded as ''defensive'' in uncertain times.
Among the technology stocks, Oracle Systems fell 2 1/2, to 19 7/8, with 9.36 million shares changing hands - No. 1 on the Nasdaq active list. Despite a 58 percent rise in quarterly profits, analysts said Oracle's earnings were less than expected. But I.B.M. rose 1 3/8, to 119 1/8; Honeywell 1 3/8, to 104 1/2; Digital Equipment 1 1/8, to 86 5/8, and Compaq 7/8, to 64 1/2. On Nasdaq, Conner rose 1, to 27 3/4, and Intel 1 3/4, to 48.Royal Dutch/Shell

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rebounds Modestly; Gold Prices Off in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rebounded modestly yesterday, but foreign-exchange dealers predicted that the United States currency would resume its downward course shortly.
Gold prices were mixed, moving higher overseas but falling in later New York trading.
The dollar picked up more than 2 cents against the British pound and more than a pfennig against the West German mark in New York trading. Dealers attributed yesterday's gains to profit taking as traders sold other currencies that had soared in recent weeks against the dollar. 
Dealers cautioned that despite the dollar's better showing it was still fundamentally weak against the yen, while high interest rates were still shoring up European currencies, including the pound.
 
Yen Prices Mixed
In New York the dollar rose to 148.40 yen from late Tuesday's 148.225. The United States currency reached a four-and-a-half-month low against the Japanese yen in Tokyo, slipping to 148.10 from late Tuesday's 149.60 and was quoted at 148.64 yen in late London trading.
Dealers said the pound should remain firm because of the Government-imposed 15 percent base interest rate on bank lending to curb inflation. The high interest rate continues to attract investor money to London.
The pound slipped to $1.7995 in New York yesterday from late Tuesday's $1.8220. Earlier in London, the pound closed at $1.7980, down 1.75 cents, from $1.8155 late Tuesday.
The dollar rose to 1.6540 marks in New York, compared with 1.64185 late Tuesday. In earlier European trading, it closed at 1.6507 marks, up from 1.6465.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.4020 Swiss francs, up from 1.3930; 5.5515 French francs, up from 5.51225; 1,211.25 Italian lire, up from 1,203.00, and 1.15885 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15695.
Other late rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.4030 Swiss francs, up from 1.3945; 5.5285 French francs, up from 5.5270; 1.8582 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8555; 1,207.04 Italian lire, up from 1,207.00, and 1.1586 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1570.
 
Gold Prices Up Overseas
Gold bullion prices rose overseas after falling $4 an ounce Tuesday on reports that between 10 and 15 tons of the metal had been unloaded by Middle East sellers. But gold was lower in domestic trading.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Jack Kemp's Favorite Public Housing Tenant

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Her voice does not invite dissent. Kimi Gray spots a child littering the lawn and responds with a machine gun locution that fuses her words into one unambiguous command: ''Come here, baby -Getthistrashouttamyyard.''
As it happens, the yard in question is not yet Ms. Gray's, although she would very much like it to be. So would Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the two have joined in an unusual Washington collaboration. It has made Ms. Gray, who runs an experiment in tenant management that is aimed at tenant ownership, a symbol of the self-help politics the Secretary promotes as ''bleeding heart conservatism.''
Is she a Republican tool? She curses and says the people with the luxury to think so are not forced to live in public housing. ''If I'm being used, then I like it,'' she said. ''I'm using them too. We're using each other.'' The Best Connections Variously sophisticated, blunt, bellicose, shrewd, articulate and sometimes coarse, Ms. Gray has become perhaps the nation's best known resident of public housing, personifying inner-city hope in frequent network television appearances. She is almost certainly the one with the best Republican connections. 
''Kimi Gray is my hero,'' said Mr. Kemp. He envisions inner cities full of Ms. Grays, people who run their own projects, increasing revenues and services while decreasing vacancies, vandalism and welfare, people who start their own businesses and move to buy their own homes. He is promoting Government policies that he says will help make this happen.
Ms. Gray sat with Mr. Kemp's family during his Senate confirmation hearings, where he called her ''a model for the rest of the country.'' But he is far from her only contact among conservatives. President Reagan was her host at the White House several times. William J. Bennett, the director of drug policy, has sought her advice.
Ms. Gray's place in Republican iconography has upset some who support the concept of tenant management - an idea that arose on the political left. They worry it is being used as a ploy to justify ending Government support for new low-income housing. ''A fraud, a snare, a delusion'' is what Florence Roisman, a staff attorney with the National Housing Law Project, calls Mr. Kemp's plans.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is an admirer of Ms. Gray, cautions that conservatives within the Reagan and Bush Administrations have used ''the exemplary model like Kimi to give the impression they're committed to housing for the poor.'' He added, ''The P.R. may be projecting the person, but the policy's the opposite of the projection.'' Can She Be Copied? Beyond the question of intentions, there are questions about whether Ms. Gray is, in fact, a replicable model. Willful as a freight train, she may be capable of making any neighborhood work. But what will happen under tenant management in places without a Kimi Gray?
And although Ms. Gray is often touted for her self-sufficiency, critics raise the delicate issue of government subsidies. Her apartment complex, Kenilworth-Parkside in Northeast Washington, has benefited from a full deck of government-backed programs to provide health care, day care, substance-abuse counseling, recreation and transportation, as well as government subsidies to operate the apartments themselves. Ms. Gray portrays herself as simply a good grant applicant, not the beneficiary of political favoritism. Either way, a snapshot of Kenilworth would fit as easily into Lyndon Johnson's scrapbook as it does into Mr. Kemp's. She sees the criticisms coming and swats them as though they were flies.
 
'No Such Puppet'
Is she unique? ''There's a Kimi Gray in every housing public housing development in America,'' said Ms. Gray. ''Let's just hope she's not as obese as I am.''
Is she a beneficiary of special treatment? ''People assume that I was a favorite child,'' she said. ''No such puppet.''
Where do her political loyalties reside? She has a stock way of explaining that she is loyal to whoever will further her cause.
''I'm a dollar bill,'' Ms. Gray said. ''And on each bill there's a different President. My family was poor when we had Roosevelt for the White House. We had Kennedy, Nixon, Ford and Carter and we're not richer now.''
The ideological mix surrounding Ms. Gray's public work is reflected in her personal politics. For all the company she keeps on the right, Ms. Gray is a registered Democrat who has twice voted for Mr. Jackson for President and views him as a important role model for black children.
But when speaking of Mr. Kemp, her sharp tongue floats rhapsodic sounds. ''Anybody that loving, understanding and committed to a mission of this type has to be led by God,'' she said. ''It's not just a job for him at H.U.D. It's a mission.''
 
Path to Prominence
Ms. Gray's improbable path to prominence began with a number of backward steps. She had her first child at the age of 14, and had borne five by the time she was 19. When her marriage fell apart, Ms. Gray and her children turned to welfare. In 1966, at the age of 21, she secured an apartment at Kenilworth, the low-rise complex of 37 buildings that became her life's work.
Her reputation as a neighborhood force began to swell in the mid-70's, when some Kenilworth students told her they wanted to attend college. After calling schools, raising money and stoking spirits, she delivered 17 students to campus doorsteps in the first year of a program that continues today. ''Knock on everybody's door,'' she said. ''Get 'em all.''
She took her own advice, finishing a degree at Federal City College, now the University of the District of Columbia, in 1979. Ms. Gray now works as a counseler for the city Recreation Department for $22,000 a year.
 
Rent Collections Rise
She brought the same insistence to her work as a resident manager. The Kenilworth-Parkside Resident Management Corporation began running the complex in 1982, with her as its unpaid chairwoman. Three years later, Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, found that rent collections had increased by 77 percent while vacancy rates dropped to 5 percent from 18 percent. The accountants estimated the city saved $785,000 over four years.
Among the hats Ms. Gray came to wear was that of a one-woman employment agency. The resident corporation hired Kenilworth residents as office and maintenance workers. And it offered prodding - and loans - to residents for an array of small business efforts: a laundromat, a screen-door repair shop, a beauty salon and a catering company. The accountants' study found that 132 Kenilworth residents left welfare during the first three years of resident management.
The secret to her success, Ms. Gray said, is ''residents' being in control of their own destiny.''
But others note that the Kenilworth destiny still involves a good deal of government support.
Laventhol & Horwath, an accounting firm, recently estimated that government subsidies provide about $1.6 million of the $2.3 million the apartment spends each year on utilities and operating expenses. Add to that a $23 million renovation program to modernize the 31-year-old apartments - about $50,000 a piece. And add to that Kenilworth's array of city and federally financed social services.
 
'A Great Deal More Money'
''It does take a great deal more money than what's available in other housing projects,'' said Robert E. McKay, executive director of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities.
Still, Ms. Gray's talk of owning her destiny very much appealed to Mr. Kemp and his political allies, who have been preaching a theology of inner-city enterprise for more than a decade. While a handful of other tenant leaders had done similar work elsewhere, Ms. Gray's work was happening just across the river (the Anacostia, that is) from Congress and the think tanks, and it gathered the most attention.
Robert Woodson, a conservative who founded the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, introduced her to Mr. Kemp. Stuart Butler, the director of domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, praised her work in a book on anti-poverty strategies. She, in turn, was the host of a party for him at Kenilworth. ''Ask people from the Brookings Institution how many times they've had book receptions in a housing project,'' he said.
The characteristically complicated politics that surround her were on display several years ago, on the day Kenilworth residents signed an agreement to buy their apartments. The 1987 legislation permitting the sale had been co-sponsored by Mr. Kemp, then a Republican Representative, and Walter Fauntroy, a Democrat who is the District of Columbia's Delegate to the House.
 
'Rained on Our Parade'
But when the White House scheduled a ceremony marking the event just before the 1988 Presidential election, Mr. Fauntroy joined Jesse Jackson at a counterdemonstration to denounce the Reagan Administration's housing policies. Ms. Gray said the two of them ''rained on our parade'' and that Mr. Fauntroy ''staged a protest against his own legislation - that's what it ended up with, no?''
Ms. Gray is now making plans to turn her purchase agreement into a final sale. While the details are still being worked out, H.U.D. guidelines provide for five years of continued Government subsidies to build a reserve fund that residents would then use until tenant contributions meet actual expenses.
And why does Ms. Gray want to own her own home? The question catches her in a rare moment of surprise, as though the answer should be self-evident, and she said:
''I want help on my taxes. I want to leave something to my children. I want to own some brick. That's the American dream, isn't it?''

HEADLINE: FED CONSIDERS CUT IN INTEREST RATES TO BOOST ECONOMY

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Expressing concern that banks have become overly cautious in lending money, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said today that the central bank might need to cut interest rates to keep the economy moving ahead.
Shifting from a long-held position that tight credit conditions were confined to real estate, Mr. Greenspan pointed to slow growth of the money supply and rising rates for commercial loans as evidence of a restriction of credit that poses a threat to continued economic expansion.
''We don't think tightening at this stage would be desirable, and as a consequence may have to act to offset it,'' Mr. Greenspan said in an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee.
 
Change Would Be 'Modest'
He said a policy shift would involve ''a very modest change'' in the interest rate on overnight loans among financial institutions, a benchmark rate over which the central bank exercises considerable control by varying the amount of money it provides to the banking system. 
That rate, the Federal funds rate, has stood at 8 1/4 percent since December, and analysts said after Mr. Greenspan's remarks that they expected it to fall in coming weeks to 8 percent.
Such a decline would put downward pressure on interest rates in general, although consumer borrowers might not immediately derive much benefit. A quarter-point reduction in the Federal funds rate might not be immediately reflected in the banks' prime lending rate, which has tended to move in half-point increments lately.
 
Financial Markets Rally
The market for bonds and shorter-term fixed-income securities rallied on the news, as did the stock market, which rose to a record close of 2,969.80 in the Dow Jones industrial average. [Pages D1 and D6.] But the dollar plummeted, as the prospect of lower rates reduced the attractiveness of holding dollars. [Page D13.] Mr. Greenspan and his Federal Reserve colleagues, remaining vigilant against inflation, have been restraining the economy by means of relatively high interest rates. But growth has slowed to an annual rate of less than 2 percent, and the Bush Administration has repeatedly urged in recent weeks that the central bank relax its grip.
Until today, the central bank had given no indication that faltering growth or a pullback in lending had pushed it to the brink of a policy shift.
Mr. Greenspan's statement before the committee today, made in response to a question, said:
''We have been closely watching various interest rate spreads and other indicators to determine if the pulling back of commercial banks to less lax lending standards is moving over the line and, in effect, creating a tightening in credit markets, independent of actions by the Federal Reserve. The cumulating evidence indicates commercial bank loan rates and collateral requirements are firming in the context of an unchanged Federal funds rate. This suggests a market tightening of modest dimensions may be occurring.
''If so, that could have undesirable effects on the economy that the Federal Reserve would have to consider offsetting with an ease in monetary policy.''
Private analysts said this seemed to confirm the widespread belief that Fed strategists decided at a policy-making session last week to tilt to lower rates pending a moment that now appears to be arriving.
''It is very unlikely that Greenspan would have voluntarily raised the possibility of ease without a serious intention of following through,'' declared Robert T. McGee, a senior vice president of Tokai Bank Ltd. in New York. He said the Federal Reserve would look for some excuse to lower interest rates within the next month.
Mr. Greenspan, whose appearance today was formally on the subjects of deposit insurance and wider powers for banks, is to return to the committee next Wednesday to make his required semiannual presentation on the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.
As recently as three weeks ago, Mr. Greenspan said there was little evidence of any broad-based lack of credit, and a Fed survey published at that time stated that ''lenders are reported to have tightened standards especially for real estate loans, but there is still little information that suggests credit restraint is spreading into other markets.''
On Tuesday, Mr. Greenspan met privately over lunch with Senate Republicans and heard various members express fears that reduced lending and high rates could tip an already fragile economy into recession.
Mr. Greenspan, according to some of those present, gave no indication of any intention to move to lower interest rates. Although he apparently was not asked specifically about cutting rates, he did suggest that it would not take much to induce such a move.
One participant, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, told a group of reporters this morning that Mr. Greenspan's thinking is dominated by a fear of recession.
 
Talk of an Obsession
''He's been accused of being obsessed with inflation,'' Mr. Lugar said. ''What he's obsessed with is that growth must continue; we must not have a recession. The growth may be only 1 1/2 percent, as it is now, but it's got to stay positive. Everything we are doing, whether we're talking about the budget, resolution of the savings and loans and so forth, is dependent upon this stream of growth. Absent that, we really do have a lot of problems.''
Mr. Lugar, apparently still reflecting the chairman's comments, pointed out that recession would not only widen the budget deficit because of revenue shortfalls and additional spending but would also prevent a needed rise in the market value of real estate and other savings and loan assets that the Government has taken over and wants to sell.
''Greenspan would say, sure, he's interested in inflation, because he perceives that if we have a binge of inflation we will for sure have a recession,'' Senator Lugar said. ''And that will end the growth, for a while, and we cannot afford to have that.''

HEADLINE: Sudan Forces Refugees Back to Barren Lands

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AKON, the Sudan, July 6

 BODY:
In a new tactic in the seven-year Sudanese civil war, the Khartoum Government is forcing tens of thousands of refugees who fled to Khartoum from the south to return home, further straining food supplies in the famine-struck region, relief workers and village chiefs here say.
After two years of preventing more than a million southerners from going back, the Government is now organizing their return from Khartoum to northern Bahr el Ghazal Province around Akon. At the center of the disastrous 1988 famine, Akon can scarcely support its diminished population.
Until now the Government feared that the refugees would provide new recruits for the rebel army in the civil war, which pits the Arab and Islamic north against the African and mostly animist south, if they returned to their homes in rebel-held territory. 
In all, about 60,000 people, mostly of the Dinka ethnic group, have returned to northern Bahr el Ghazal since the beginning of the year, according to a report last month by the United Nations Children's Fund. Because of poor communications and the expulsion of many relief workers from the area by the Khartoum Government, the extent of the influx only became known to the United Nations in late May. The Unicef report called the influx alarming.
 
Food Grown in '89 Running Low
After virtually no harvest in 1988, last year's yield was better but uneven, according to Unicef. And now, the food that was grown in 1989 is running out and the harvest to be reaped about October looks unpromising.
The combination of the returning refugees and the low food reserves means about 125,000 people are in need of food relief in northern Bahr el Ghazal, according to the Unicef report. That part of the Sudan has been a focus of the $130 million international relief effort underway in Government and rebel-held areas of the Sudan for the last 18 months. About half of that amount has been paid for by the United States Agency for International Development, according to American officials.
These days the relief effort, mostly operating under the auspices of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, is concentrating on attempting to make the southern Sudan self-sufficient. Where possible, seeds, tools and fishing nets are delivered rather than handout foodstuffs.
But as the lack of expected food for the returning refugees around Akon shows, obstacles to the donors' best intentions abound. Red Cross workers, for example, were stationed in Akon to vaccinate the Dinkas' cattle. In November, the Khartoum Government withdrew permission for the Red Cross to work in Akon, which is under the control of the rebel Sudan Peoples Liberation Army. A Sudanese veterinarian hired by the Red Cross now remains idle in Akon because of a lack of vaccines. Under Red Cross rules intended to reduce corruption, only a full-time Red Cross delegate can receive relief items.
 
Return of Extended Family
And relief food from the United Nations has not materialized because a train that was loaded with 1,500 tons of grain in September in the northern town of Muglad for delivery to the south has been blocked by the Government, according to relief officials of the United Nations and the United States. The Government of Lieut. Gen. Omar Hassan al-Bashir is apparently fearful that the train, destined for the garrison at Aweil, will deliver disproportionate amounts of food along the way to areas under rebel control.
Some relief workers said they believed that by sending the refugees back, the military Government is trying to disrupt the area around Akon, a region mostly populated by members of the Dinka ethnic group, who make up the backbone of the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army. The expulsion of the refugees from Khartoum also relieves the Government of an unpopular presence in the crumbling city, the relief workers said.
For the last five months, relatives of Chief Deng Goc Tong have been streaming back to their villages in this bleached, flat terrain that forms a bridge between Equatorial Africa and the continent's northern deserts, relying on promises that the war and famine they fled is over and a better life awaits them.
For Chief Deng, the return of his extended family is a melancholy experience. He likes to see his people back, yet loathes to see them suffer again.
''But the people prefer to come and die in their homeland,'' said the Chief, who decided to remain at home when many of his relatives struggled north to Khartoum two years ago. ''People are collected by the police in the camps in Khartoum and searched. If you have money, you pay for the train. If you don't they put you in the car free.''
According to the United Nations, the refugees are taken by train to Muglad or Babanusa and then by truck to Abyei, about a four-day walk from Akon.
 
'We Don't Have Enough Seeds'
''When they leave Abyei to begin the walk southward to their homes, they are prevented from carrying food and trade items by army and the local militia,'' the Unicef document says.
A scrawny man with deep creases in his face, Chief Deng has been doing what he can to share the cattle of his clan with the those who are returning. Many, he said, were reduced to eating boiled leaves, wild fruits and the bitter kernels of desert dates.
The crop prospects look poor. ''We don't have enough seeds to plant, not enough food to give energy for those who are lucky to have seeds to cultivate, and now no rain,'' he said. Since February, 43 children and 7 adults who came home to his village have died of malaria, Chief Deng said.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Impasse Ends on U.S. Bill to Aid Europe

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
The Bush Administration and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have reached agreement on the structure of an economic aid package for Eastern Europe that would allow the President to provide technical help to Moscow for the first time, Administration and Congressional officials said today.
The officials said that tentative agreement on the bill for fiscal 1991 was reached Wednesday night after four months of wrangling. The understanding suggests an emerging consensus between Congress and the Administration on the politically sensitive question of aid to the Soviet Union.
After much initial resistance, the Adminstration appears to have accepted the view of many in Congress that technical aid programs intended to promote free-market economic reforms should also apply to the Soviet Union. The President would be able to offer those programs to Moscow at his own discretion in fiscal 1991. 
Administration officials said they had no idea to what degree Mr. Bush would use such authority. But his acceptance of the language reflects, at least symbolically, a steady shift by the Administration toward a more active role in helping President Mikhail S. Gorbachev succeed.
 
Agreeing on the Conditions
Congress, for its part, seems to be endorsing the President's position that until Moscow undertakes more serious, irreversible steps toward a free-market economy and reduces its military spending, Washington should confine any assistance to technical advisory programs, not cash grants or loans. Mr. Bush affirmed that stance at the economic summit meeting of seven industrial nations this week.
The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, said the President had reiterated in a briefing after the Houston meeting ''that additional economic reforms are necessary.''
''I can only say that I don't dispute the President's statement at this time,'' Mr. Foley said.
Since the meeting of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev in Malta last December, the Administration has been providing limited technical aid to the Soviet Union out of various departmental budgets. Most of the programs have involved exchange visits, like a trip to Moscow by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, or an effort by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to teach Soviet officials how gather accurate economic figures.
 
Money for Ventures and Farms
The cost of most of these programs amounted only to the air fare and daily expenses of the officials involved. What the new legislation would give the President is the power to unlock money and exercise a variety of other options for much broader technical aid to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
The Senate's draft bill, for example, suggests giving the President the authority to extend to East European countries and the Soviet Union programs for developing small private businesses, creating extension services to support family farms, building Western-style legal systems, banks and credit unions, and providing English-language instruction.
The draft would also enable the Administration to establish American business centers in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union. Charging a user's fee, the centers would provide office space, translation services, secretarial help and legal assistance to American businesses seeking to start up enterprises in the formerly Communist countries.
The bill also includes financial aid packages along the lines of those approved for Poland and Hungary last year. But it restricts the use of such direct aid to specified Eastern European countries and prohibits it from going to the Soviet Union.
The Administration and Congress are still at odds over how much money should be allocated for the bill and which technical assistance programs should be included. The Administration is seeking as much freedom as possible in choosing programs, and the Senate bill is designed to provide such leeway in exchange for assurances that certain programs will be put into force.
The Senate bill calls for $536 million for fiscal 1991, including $70 million for the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Administration only wants to spend $300 million, including outlays on the European development bank. A House version calls for $489 million.
 
Insisting on Clause for Soviets
Agreement on the basic structure of the bill was reached in talks between Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who is coordinating Eastern European aid for the Administration, and Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Europe. Mr. Biden is drafting the Senate version of the aid package with Sen. Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Since the negotiations began in February, Mr. Biden has insisted that the bill for fiscal 1991 include some language that would authorize the President to use the programs not only for former Communist countries in Eastern Europe but for technical aid to promote changes in the Soviet Union.
The Administration initially resisted the inclusion of even technical assistance to Moscow in the bill, saying that the question of aid to the Soviet Union should be dealt with separately. Administration officials argued that writing such authority into the legislation might reduce incentives for the Soviets to enact difficult free-market reforms.
They contended that the language could increase pressure on the Administration to follow the example of West Germany and other European countries that are eager to give financial aid to Moscow before the changes there are in place. The White House was also worried that it would be criticized by the right wing of the Republican Party.
 
Signal From Eagleburger
But on Wednesday night, Mr. Eagleburger signaled to Senator Biden that the Administration was prepared to accept his broad language on the issue. The phrasing would allow the President to use any program authority in the bill when he determines ''that the use of such authority would assist the emergence or transition of that country from Communist rule through the development or strengthening of Democratic institutions and the practices of a free market economy.''
''The challenge and opportunity in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union today demands that the President assume more active leadership,'' Mr. Biden said, ''not by giving money to President Gorbachev, but by supporting the reform process in the Soviet Union. This bill will enable him to do that.''
A senior Administration official said: ''It is hard to argue against it now. There has been a change in attitude at the level of the President, albeit slight. It has moved from an attitude in which it was unimaginable that public or private funds be used to help the Soviets do their restructuring, to at least entertaining the possibility. We are not there yet, though.''

HEADLINE: Republicans on the Attack In Savings and Loan Crisis

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES; Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 12

 BODY:
Unnerved by the rising public outrage over the nation's savings and loan scandal, the Republican Party opened an orchestrated effort today to blame the Democrats before the Democrats succeed in their effort to blame the Republicans.
''We're fighting back, plain and simple,'' said Charles Black, a leading Republican strategist. ''They've got more guys involved in this than we do.''
In speeches and hallway remarks at the Republican National Committee's summer meeting, which is being attended as well by other prominent Republicans, there were efforts to cite the soaring interest rates during the Carter Administration and savings and loan operators' big campaign contributions to Democrats to explain why the scandal was not the fault of President Bush and his party. 
''For a few million dollars in campaign contributions, the Democrats sold out the taxpayers,'' Edward J. Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a speech here this afternoon.
 
A Central Political Issue
The attention being devoted to the matter here effectively demonstrated that the Democrats, with considerable help from news organizations' focus this week on the troubles of the President's son Neil, a former director of the now-defunct Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, had succeeded in making the issue a central one in the politics of 1990.
Several Republicans here expressed concern that the issue posed great perils for them, and there was also a general feeling that the party's national chairman, Lee Atwater, was being sorely missed in their efforts to combat it. Mr. Atwater, who for months has been suffering from a brain tumor, was readmitted to a Washington hospital Wednesday night for treatment and observation.
Mayor Susan Myrick of Charlotte, N.C., warned her Republican colleagues that voters were furious that many billions of dollars would have to be spent to clean up the savings and loan industry. ''Because there is a Republican in the White House, you know who gets the blame,'' she said. ''We do.''
That is just what Democrats have been hoping, and the attention on Neil Bush, who has been accused of conflict of interest, has only increased their glee. ''What's scaring the Republicans is Neil Bush - that's too close to home,'' Richard Bates, executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a telephone interview today.
 
Brown's Opening Salvo
Neil Bush's problems mushroomed just as the Democrats decided to go on the offensive. The Democratic national chairman, Ronald H. Brown, announced at his party's summer meeting in Portland, Ore., two weeks ago that they would make the savings and loan scandal a central theme in their attacks on Republicans this year.
Mr. Brown, in a speech and an interview at the time, made it clear that he was willing to pay the price of hurting some office holders of his own party if by sharpening the focus on the issue he could portray Republicans as protectors of the wealthy.
In responding today to Mr. Brown's remarks in Portland, Mr. Rollins said in his own speech: ''Brown says we Republicans will only raise taxes to bail out wealthy savings and loan speculators. He says the Reagan-Bush Administration created this crisis. I say Ron Brown is proof that America's education system needs reform. If Ron Brown thinks the Republican Party wants to bail out the Democratic campaign contributors, who caused the savings and loan mess, he must be dreaming and prayimg.''
Mr. Rollins ran through a list of former and present Democratic members of Congress - including Speaker Thomas S. Foley; former Speaker Jim Wright; Tony Coelho, former House Democratic whip, and Ferdinand St. Germain, former chairman of the House Banking Committee - and said they had all received substantial campaign contributions from the savings and loan industry.
He said that this was the reason why the industry was given greater Federal insurance and less supervision during the 1980's and that, contrary to the Democrats' assertion, the reason had nothing to do with the Reagan Administration's drive toward deregulation.
 
A Late Deletion
The text of Mr. Rollins's speech included a line that said House Republican leaders had not received any money from savings and loan institutions. But he did not read that when he delivered his speech.
In the telephone interview, Mr. Bates, the Democratic strategist, noted that most House Republican leaders -including Robert H. Michel, the minority leader, and Newt Gingrich, the minority whip - had received contributions from savings and loan operators, as had the Republican National Commitee and Mr. Rollins's own National Republican Congressional Commitee.
Mr. Bates called Mr. Rollins's speech ''the rantings and ravings of a desperate man with selective amnesia.''

HEADLINE: Pauperized Workers Are Price of 'Free' Trade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The foreign-trade deal the Bush Administration has negotiated with Japan (front page, June 29) follows the thinking of the Reagan Administration and will continue the giveaway of essential interests of the United States. Because it assumes that unregulated foreign trade - always called ''free trade'' - automatically benefits both nations involved, this viewpoint makes light of the one-sidedness of United States trade. The net takeover of our markets by excess imports, and the shrinkage of our industries and jobs, is attributed to some outside factor, and token policies are devised to deal with these imaginary causes.
Thus, the real causes of the self-destructive pattern of United States foreign trade were not touched by the Reagan Administration's initiating unfair trade practices investigations or getting commitments from other countries to increase their ''economic growth.'' Neither will they be touched by the Bush Administration's getting Japan to increase its public-works spending, to speed up the issuing of patents, to reduce protection of small shops and to increase prosecution of bid rigging. These actions may be desirable, but their effect on the huge United States trade deficit with Japan will be long delayed and trivial. Saving the economic future of the United States requires the regulation of United States imports to bring about balanced, two-way-benefit trade with countries that differ from us in economic policies and institutions, market sizes and qualities, wage levels and other ways. 
The widening spread in American incomes and the worsening plight of our ordinary workers is shown by data and has been viewed with concern by many commentators. Americans were once proud of being the only country where the factory parking lot was filled with the workers' cars - cars of one-income families. Two incomes may not permit workers to raise a family in today's United States, and the situation is continuing to worsen.
History provides an illuminating parallel. The ancient Roman Republic became politically unworkable largely because the jobs of ordinary Roman workers and small farmers were taken over by cheaper outside labor, in this case by burgeoning use of imported slave labor. Slave labor was cheaper than the labor of free Romans. Thus, ''the free market'' said, ''Use the slave labor.'' Doing so enriched Roman landowners and the affluent. But the shift to slave labor took away the jobs of ordinary Romans, who had been the backbone of Rome's armies and state. They became an unemployed proletariat in the city of Rome, degraded by politicians' free bread and circuses - and Rome as a republic stopped working.
The United States turned the jobs of its ordinary workers over to outside labor - because it was cheaper than American labor - by accepting imports vastly in excess of our exports, imports that are cheaper than American-made goods because of foreign wage levels a tenth or less as high (as was initially true of Japan, which now relies on other advantages over United States production). One-sided immigration of low-wage labor has the same effect. The Americans whose jobs are given away to outside labor, like the pauperized Roman workers and farmers, will not go away. They have no place to go. They are finding that the available temporary jobs, the part-time jobs, the minimum-wage jobs without job security, medical insurance and retirement benefits do not permit them to live and raise a family like other Americans - not even when both spouses work. What is to become of these people? What will become of a United States in which groups not subject to such foreign competition live extravagantly, while the ordinary workers thrown by one-sided foreign trade into wage competition with the poorest of the world's burgeoning millions of poor become outcasts in their own country?
The economic theory on which United States policy is based evades this problem by assuming an imaginary world in which unemployment is cured by lowering wage levels, where foreign trade and job shifts automatically balance out and where cheaper implies more efficient. Laissez-faire economics and the Bush foreign trade policy perhaps would work in this imaginary world - just as Communist economics perhaps would work in its imaginary world.
But in the world of reality, the United States is self-destructing in permitting one-sided ''free trade'' to throw ordinary American workers into competition with hundreds of millions of foreign workers who can live on much less than they. This kind of ''free trade'' may be a time bomb of laissez-faire ideology more deadly even than ''free'' savings and loan association pillaging, ''free'' airline mergers, ''free'' liquidate-American-industry takeover deals, the ''free'' selling of America to foreigners and ''free'' government spending without taxes.

HEADLINE: Space Program Builds America's Future

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Big Science, Little Gain'' (editorial, June 24), you make a cogent parallel between the United States space program and the Pharaonic penchant for pyramid building in ancient Egypt. Nevertheless, I must disagree with your conclusions.
The ancient Egyptian public-works project was sold to the public in those days, under the umbrella of religion, as the supreme national undertaking: to build the portals through which the deceased Pharaohs could span the crossing from the world of mortals to that of the gods. Be that as it may, pyramid building did provide employment to countless artisans and other surplus labor, and indeed produced momentous gains for civilization in mathematics and measurement, architecture, medicine and other spinoffs. Some of this later passed on to the Greeks, although much of it was lost with the destruction of the great library of Alexandria. I cannot discern any convincing evidence that the erection of the pyramids had much, if anything, to do with hastening the decline of Egyptian civilization many centuries later. 
The United States space program has begun building the infrastructure of our grandchildren's economy and is enabling scientists and engineers laid off (permanently, we hope) from military industries to channel their energies into a direction private industry will not enter for lack of short-term profit. While huge government programs are wasteful and inefficient, and that the space program may never bridge the light-years gap between our planet and distant galaxies, the future of our wounded biosphere demands that we shift many pollution-ridden process industries into space in the next century and begin robot-mining the mineral wealth of asteroids and nearby planets to save our suffocating Mother Earth. Nothing short of a total commitment can accomplish this task.
The Japanese and others may reap interim advantages by selling us more of their microchip-based gadgets for a while and buying some of our real estate in exchange, but we'll get it all back when camera-toting Japanese tourists and others line up to board commercial space-bound American-built shuttles of the future.
As for ''small science,'' perhaps that should be left mainly for small countries to do.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
After The Cold War (2)

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

 BODY:
Through most of its history this has been an unmilitarized country. The Framers of the Constitution wanted it that way. To prevent a large standing army becoming a habit, they provided that Congress could not appropriate money for the military ''for a longer term than two years.''
In the time of the cold war the unmilitarized tradition has been abandoned. For four decades the United States has had millions of men under arms. Much of our resources and our scientific intellect has gone to build expensive new weapons. The country has been transformed into a national security state. 
Right now we have the greatest opportunity in two generations to shed the burdens of militarism and return to the older American tradition. The crumbling of the Warsaw Pact and the changes in the Soviet Union dramatically lessen the threat that was the premise of our militarization. But will we seize the day? Last week in London the leaders of the Western alliance declared the cold war over. That declaration surely indicates that the time has come to rethink American national security policy, to focus on how to reduce the military burden. But in the last week newspapers have told us of these developments:
* The armed forces are pressing ahead with plans to buy 4.5 million more acres of land in this country, to add to the 25 million they already have for bombing ranges, bases and the like.
* An all-out enthusiast for the Strategic Defense Initiative, Henry Cooper, was named to head the star wars program, whose planners want between $55 billion and $69 billion to put a first phase in space in the next 10 years.
* The Pentagon is insisting on buying a $4 billion radar-jamming device, the Airborne Self-Protection Jammer, that has failed its flight tests.
All of those, and much else, tell us that it is business as usual in the national security state. NATO may announce the end of the cold war, political pressures may force cutbacks here and there, but the minds of Washington are not thinking about fundamental change in the direction of policy. The aim is to preserve as much of the status quo as possible.
To go on that way, unthinkingly, would be profound folly. For the militarization of the cold war years has done terrible damage to the real sources of American security, our constitutional system of government and our economic strength.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan spelled it out, movingly, in a piece last month in The New York Review of Books. He wrote about the costs to this country of becoming ''a national security state, geared for war at all times.''
''As everything became secret,'' Senator Moynihan said, ''it became ever more difficult to correct mistakes. Why? Because most of the people who might spot the mistakes were kept from knowing about them because the mistakes were classified. . . .
''The national security state began to threaten the Constitution itself. From the time of the Vietnam War . . . the executive branch has been more and more tempted to use secrecy to avoid responsibility, even legality. The Iran-contra affair was only the latest such episode. . . .
''The national security state consumes the Presidency. It grows more and more insulated from the people. . . .''
That the United States has paid a heavy economic price for cold war militarization is hardly necessary to argue - not when we see the boom in the two countries that avoided most of that burden, Japan and Germany. We have a military-industrial-scientific complex that limits our ability to compete in the civilian goods the world wants.
The interests that fed on the cold war will fight change. That is only natural. No one gives up money and power easily. The question is whether the national interest can prevail over the parochial, and that is a question of political leadership.
It is not a conservative-liberal issue, or should not be. Conservatives do not like big government and concentrated power, which have been by-products of militarization. It is not suggested that we rush into massive demobilization; there are still uncertainties. But we have to change direction, and there should be no pain in thinking about that. Senator Moynihan put it:
''How do we now demobilize? How do we move from a national security state to a government that merely asks what are our interests abroad and our needs at home, and calmly and openly pursues them? What a wonderful challenge!''

HEADLINE: The Talk of Sullivan County;
Victory Leaves a Prosecutor With an Orphaned Court

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTICELLO, N.Y.

 BODY:
More than two years after the Sullivan County District Attorney's office asked, in an anonymous complaint, that a state judicial commission investigate the county court judge here, prosecutors have emerged triumphant in theory, if a little traumatized in practice.
Last fall the panel, the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct, censured the judge, 68-year-old Eugene M. Hanofee, for improprieties ranging from banishing a Legal Aid lawyer from his courtroom to seeking favored treatment from another judge.
In April a second panel, the Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, recommended, as the District Attorney had earlier requested, that the judge remove himself from any case involving the District Attorney's office, the Legal Aid Society or any other lawyer who had testified for or against him before the commission.
That has left prosecutors without a judge of their own, like students perpetually assigned subsitute teachers: Judge Hanofee, the only County Court judge, had handled all of the criminal cases in semirural Sullivan County, where crack houses co-exist with Catskill resorts. 
For the next two years, until Judge Hanofee reaches the mandatory retirement age of 70, he will be reassigned to other counties; judges from other counties, meanwhile, will rotate through here every four weeks.
 
Judge of the Month
''We're thinking of handing out judge-of-the-month T-shirts,'' the District Attorney, Stephen F. Lungen said. ''We may be upstate, but we're close enough to New York City that we have a significant criminal caseload, and having to deal with a new judge every month has inherent problems.'' John Ferrara, a staff lawyer for the Legal Aid Society of Sullivan County, said, ''It has the potential of being a disaster.
''The cases in the pretrial stage are stagnating, and we're going to have a bottleneck soon,'' he said.
But the bureaucratic morass aside, Mr. Lungen said Mr. Hanofee's reassignement was ''the right thing.''
''You can't have a legal system that operates on distrust,'' he said. The District Attorney's office and Judge Hanofee had shared a well-known strained relationship for some time.
It was Mr. Ferrara who was barred from Mr. Hanofee's courtroom for 88 days in early 1988 after he raised objections to remarks made by the judge. During sentencing of a Cuban-born defendant charged with selling drugs, Judge Hanofee said that if the defendant, a United States resident of 18 years but not a citizen, is ''unhappy with our justice system'' then ''perhaps he should go back where he came from.''
One of the charges against the judge was that he made ethnically derogatory comments to five Hispanic defendants. While that charge sparked the most anger in the county, where hotel jobs draw many Hispanic workers, it was ultimately dismissed by the Commission on Judicial Conduct.
 
A Taxing Night's Rest
 Not too many decades ago, Sullivan County was home to hundreds of hotels, there for New Yorkers who needed a breather from New York City. Then came easy air travel, Club Med and Atlantic City, and today, only a handful of resort hotels remain. ''We're an endangered species,'' said Milton Kutsher, president of Kutsher's Hotel and Country Club, one of the survivors here.
Sensitive to their precarious future, hotel owners rose up last year in a failed effort to defeat a proposed county tax of 2 percent on hotel room charges. Still reeling from that loss, the hotels were hit just last month with a new state hotel tax of 5 percent on rooms over $100 a night.
The resort hotels received a ''food credit'' of 50 percent toward the new county and state taxes since three meals are included in room rates. But guests are starting to grumble. Between the state and county sales tax of 7 percent, the county hotel tax and the new state hotel tax, a couple staying in a choice double room for one week at Kutsher's now pays $157.50 in taxes, on top of the $1,500 room charge.
''Of course, I object,'' said Harvey Klein, a 70-year-old Bronx resident, stopping in the lobby recently. ''They're getting enough already.'' Others are taking the taxes in stride. ''I'm taxed to the hilt anyway, so what's the difference?'' said Roberta Scotti, a 51-year-old Manhattan resident staying at the Concord Resort Hotel here. ''I have wonderful memories of coming to Sullivan County as a girl. I know it's a depressed area, and I'm willing to pay my share.''
What made last year's debate over the relatively small county hotel tax so emotional was that a historically symbiotic relationship had soured. Afraid that the new tax would hurt business, hotel owners accused the county, which for years benefited from tourists, of kicking the industry while it was down. County officials countered that they had simply run out of options in their search for new sources of revenue.
 
Bye-Bye, Bungalows
 Clusters of summer cottages, known as bungalow colonies, were enormously popular in Sullivan County in the 1940's and 50's. Tourist interest has since withered, however, and scores of empty, crumbling bungalows blight the countryside.
Now, a movement is afoot to tear them down. ''I'd rather see trees and grass than dilapidated buildings,'' said Darryl J. Kaplan, the Town Supervisor in Fallsburg, whose idea to order the demolition of unsound bungalows has caught on in other towns. ''When people see buildings falling apart, they feel down and out.''
In the last few years, 220 structures, mostly bungalows, were razed in Fallsburg after property owners were found in violation of safety ordinances that were on the books but unenforced. In all but two cases, the owners hired wrecking crews themselves. ''There's a realization that we need to clean up our act,'' said the county's Director of Economic Development, Paula Osenni.
 
No Bashful Billboards
 A profusion of roadside signs advertising motels and meals greets motorists all along Route 17, the main drag through the Catskills, as well as on quieter roads. In a great billboard debate raging in the county, some residents say the signs are alluring and attract tourists, while others say they are lurid and turn people off.
Two years ago, the Sullivan County Visual Quality Task Force, a 10-member panel appointed by the county, drafted a model ordinance for towns to adopt that greatly restricts the size, color, lighting, typography and placement of new signs. It mandated that available billboards be painted dark green instead of bright yellow.
But to date, only one of the 15 towns in Sullivan, Highland, is seriously considering its enactment.
''The business owners say the county can't develop without signs,'' said Nicholas A. Michaels, an architect and task force chairman. ''But I say look at Vermont, Nantucket and other classy resort areas. They have the strictest sign ordinances in the nation, and they're booming.''

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Goals Similar, but Florio and Cuomo Split on Strategy

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
Not long into their respective tenures as Governors of New York and New Jersey, Mario M. Cuomo and Jim Florio each audaciously expressed political philosophies of unapologetic liberalism.
For Mr. Cuomo, that expression came most boldly in his riveting keynote address to the 1984 Democratic National Convention.
For Mr. Florio, a gubernatorial rookie, it came last month when he sponsored a stunning series of against-the-conservative-grain tax increases and measures aimed at redistributing income and school aid. Those initiatives - which strive toward a traditional, but these days rarely realized, liberal goal of narrowing the gap between the wealthy and the less so - he willfully pushed through a dazed and at times fearful Legislature.
 
Challenge to Assumptions
Whether that turns out to be good politics, much less good government, remains to be seen. But what is clear is that Mr. Florio is challenging many assumptions about what is possible or politically wise for a governor to do. 
And in the process, Jim Florio, son of an Italian-American dockworker in Brooklyn, and Mario Cuomo, son of an Italian immigrant grocer in Queens, have offered a striking example of how two similarly strong-willed men of similar political persuasion can wind up with vastly different governing strategies and images, shaped by political, governmental and economic circumstance, political strategy and, more murkily, character.
''They share a critical vision of what government should be now in terms of income redistribution and public aid to schools,'' said Richard Wade, a professor of history at the City University of New York and a longtime Cuomo adviser. ''But what Mario has done incrementally, this guy has done in one fell swoop. Mario was the liberal in the age of conservatism. He had to go against the tide all the time. That's what made him so distinctive. But the tide is changing, and Florio is a little ahead of it. He's on the whitecap.
''It's also a difference in personality. Mario is a liberal, there's no doubt about it. But politically he's by nature more prudent, more cautious. Mario doesn't get many people mad, while this fellow doesn't care.''
Indeed, said George Sternlieb, a professor emeritus at Rutgers University and founder of its Center for Urban Policy Research, ''I think Florio is taking one of the great political gambles of the century.''
If it works, Professor Sternlieb said, Mr. Florio ''is going to be the hero of the 90's, as the guy who first caught sight of the fact that class warfare is back and you can run against the rich and tax them.'' If that strategy does not work, Professor Sternlieb added, ''he'll go from rooster to capon overnight.''
The differences in style have as much to do with differences in states as in men, many observers pointed out. Mr. Florio won his first term in a landslide in November, garnering 62 percent of the vote and sweeping Democratic majorities into both houses of the Legislature.
When Mr. Cuomo, now in the midst of a re-election campaign, won his first term in 1982, he squeaked to victory and has had to live with a contentious Republican majority in the State Senate ever since, to say nothing of a contentious Democratic majority in the Assembly.
In New Jersey, the Governor's supremacy runs further. Aside from United States Senators, of whom Bill Bradley, a fellow Democrat who looms almost as large as Mr. Cuomo as a Presidential prospect, Mr. Florio is the only official elected statewide. There are three others in New York. Different Terrain, Distinct Approach Mr. Florio has broad patronage powers. And with few television stations in the state, it is particularly difficult for opposition figures to emerge as prominently.
The governmental terrain is also far different. When Mr. Cuomo took office in 1983, New York was home to what by many measures was the heaviest tax structure in the nation and one of the most progressive. Competitiveness was the issue, Mr. Cuomo says, as much as redistribution is for Mr. Florio now.
Even after Mr. Florio had prodded the Legislature to double the income-tax rate for the wealthiest citizens, households with incomes of less than $250,000 will still pay less than their counterparts in New York.
Finally, by most measures, the different levels of government are far more dependent on local property taxes in New Jersey than in virtually any other state. That has led to a wide disparity in school spending between rich and poor areas that the State Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional even as Mr. Florio was pushing his school-financing plan through the Legislature.
In New York, although the disparities are great, they usually do not approach those in New Jersey. The State Court of Appeals has several times declined to throw out New York's school-aid formula.
But even in light of all the differences, their approaches are in many ways remarkably distinct.
Mr. Florio's multibillion-dollar school and tax plan had clearly identifiable goals, not only to pay the bills, but also to do so by shifting wealth from the rich to poor and struggling middle-class families. To balance a budget that was hundreds of millions of dollars in the hole, a situation that he attributed to his Republican predecessor, Thomas H. Kean, he and the Legislature raised the sales tax, from 6 to 7 percent, and extended its reach - generating an estimated $1.3 billion.
Incidental taxes and fees were raised as well, to the tune of $200 million a year. In addition, by doubling the highest income-tax rate, to 7 percent, Mr. Florio and the Legislature expect to raise an additional $1.25 billion next year for school aid to less-affluent districts, property-tax rebates for the poor and middle class and a state takeover of many welfare and social-service payments from the counties.
His administration maintains that 83 percent of the state's taxpayers would not pay more in income tax as a result of the measure, which applies only to income beyond $150,000 for couples and $75,000 for individuals.
 
How They React Under Pressure
 If Mr. Florio faces critics who contend that his program is reckless, needlessly divisive and perhaps suicidal, Mr. Cuomo has frequently had to deal with criticism of another sort, that he is too tentative and ''Hamlet-like'' in the face of contentious issues.
In his first year in office he gave a ringing inaugural address, presided over the successful resolution of a prison uprising, negotiated the early balancing of a budget in a year of large deficits and personally championed the passage of the state's first large bond issue in years.
Yet Warren M. Anderson, at the time the Senate majority leader, noted that the State of the State Message included 33 study commissions and other panels, devices that he contended were allowing Mr. Cuomo to avoid making hard decisions. Mr. Cuomo strongly dissented from that conclusion.
Mr. Cuomo, in a telephone interview last week, expressed frustration that what he considers the accomplishments of his administration had not been properly recognized. He cited three fundamental reasons.
First, he said, he has expressly refrained from concentrating his emphasis on a few major themes and areas, instead moving on many fronts at once.
Second, because of Senate opposition some initiatives have been thwarted or taken years to pass. Third, as someone who has won high marks for oratory, Mr. Cuomo said, he has been a victim of the ''dumb blond theory,'' which in this version holds that because he speaks well he must not be able to do anything else, like govern.
''We swamp people with lists of the accomplishments,'' he said. ''We have a very long list of accomplishments that I think have not been properly noted, at least until recently, because I have never focused on just one issue.
''I have never focused on just education. If I had, with nearly a 100 percent increase in school aid, with money for 170,000 computers in the schools, with our Liberty Scholarship program, I could very easily say we are the education state.
''If you wanted to take infrastructure, nobody is even close over the last eight years. We did three bond issues, every one of which people said could not get done. We have the first acid-rain law, the first seat-belt law.
''You see what happened is because I never stood up and said this is our claim to fame. Because we didn't make it simple and focused, it never got the attention that it deserved.''
 
'Playing Catch-Up With New York'
 Indeed, Mr, Cuomo's chief of staff, Gerald Crotty, can add amply to the list.
One million jobs have been added to the state economy, and the administration points to its efforts to cut taxes as a reason.
Norman Adler, an adviser who helped Mr. Cuomo win election and then had a falling out with him, concluded, ''A lot of the stuff in New Jersey that people look at as visionary is really playing catch-up with New York. It's hard to compare a veteran of seven and a half years with a divided Legislature with a guy just coming in with total control over the Legislature.''
Maybe so, but there are those who see comparisons. ''The Governor won by an incredible landslide four years ago, and you didn't get this radical approach,'' Assembly Speaker Mel Miller said. ''I've always viewed the Governor as a moderate'' whose changes ''have been incremental.''
Mr. Cuomo's liberal reputation, Mr. Miller said, owes more to his opposition to the death penalty, which Mr. Florio favors, than to anything else.
The issue of school aid, and how it has played out in the two states, shows how difficult it is to separate out factors like personality, tactics and the realities of the political landscape.
In 1988, Mr. Cuomo appointed a commission to study school aid that recommended a drastic increase in New York City's share. The Governor used the recommendations as the basis of his school-aid proposal this year. But many legislators said they never took the proposal as do-or-die, and it went by the board amid other budget problems.
 
Cordial Praise For Each Other
 Mr. Miller said that although the Governor had the proposal in his budget he ''never fought for it with the Legislature.'' But even if he did, Mr. Miller said, because of the Republican-controlled Senate, ''it's probably a dream that you can't do.''
''Even if he dug in, I don't think you can win the fight,'' Mr. Miller said.
In regard to each other, the Governors extend cordial, if not effusive, praise.
''A very impressive, articulate person with a great future on the national level,'' Mr. Florio said of Mr. Cuomo.
''Superb,'' Mr. Cuomo said of Mr. Florio's handling of his fiscal situation, which he said required bold action. Still, Mr. Cuomo said, raising taxes does not define a liberal agenda.
It falls to their proponents to sing more abundant praise. Ann F. Lewis, former executive director of Americans for Democratic Action, a major liberal lobbying group, said: ''There are a handful of Democratic leaders who have spoken to the best the party has to offer, who have had the courage to say, 'We are better than this.' I think Mario Cuomo has been one.''
Ms. Lewis described Mr. Florio's recent legislative session as breathtaking. His actions, she said, ''represent the future of American politics.''
Not surprisingly, Roger Stone, a Republican consultant who has run campaigns for candidates who opposed Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Florio, said:
''They do share the same grand vision of redistribution of wealth. Florio is more open in his public-be-damned attitude. Cuomo knows how to obfuscate. I think he's a liberal, but somewhat less ideological. Only time will tell us which one of them is a better politician.''

HEADLINE: Florio Signs and Explains Tax Rise

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 12

 BODY:
The battle over how to explain the largest tax increase in New Jersey history was joined by Gov. Jim Florio today, as he signed the bill to raise $1.25 billion in new income taxes. He described the action as property-tax relief for the middle class.
The law, which will raise the top tax bracket, to 7 percent from 3.5, for top wage earners, will provide money for increased school aid to less-affluent districts and for property-tax rebates to families that earn less than $100,000 a year.
''What we are doing today is for the people in the middle who've just been squeezed and squeezed and squeezed,'' Mr. Florio said as he stood in front of a chart that showed 17 percent of taxpayers will pay higher income taxes. ''Look at the numbers on this chart that clearly show who is going to pay higher taxes and who is not. The vast majority of people are not. It's that simple and it's that fair.'' 
In recent weeks thousands of New Jerseyans have expressed rage at the Democratic Governor, describing him as an autocrat who is raising taxes at a time when average residents can ill-afford to pay them. To the chagrin of Democrats, many of the 6,000 people attending an anti-tax rally here on July 1 were just the middle- and lower-income voters whom Mr. Florio says he is trying to help.
 
Moves by County Boards
An ad hoc group of anti-tax protesters, Hands Across New Jersey, is gathering signatures around the state protesting the tax increases and asking for the right to recall Mr. Florio, a provision that does not exist under state law.
In addition, the Boards of County Freeholders in Bergen, Morris and Hunterdon voted this week to place non-binding referendums on the ballot in the fall to urge the repeal of the tax increases. The income-tax rise is scheduled to start on Jan. 1; the sales tax was raised, to 7 percent from 6, on July 1.
Although Mr. Florio has said a majority of taxpayers would benefit under the complex set of bills that the Legislature passed last month, he acknowledged that many New Jerseyans did not understand what was in it for them. His next goal, he said shortly after the bills had been approved, was to do a better job of explaining how his fiscal policies will work.
At the signing of the income-tax bill in his office in the State House, Mr. Florio stood beside Rich Mauro, a warehouse worker from Carteret, who, Mr. Florio said, was struggling with wife and three children against the rising cost of property taxes for middle-income families. The income-tax package, Mr. Florio said, is intended to help families like the Mauros.
 
Describing Who Will Pay
In a handout the administration described the people who will pay higher income taxes as 17 percent of the taxpayers. Single people will begin to pay higher taxes on taxable incomes of more than $35,000. Families and single heads of households will begin to pay added taxes on taxable incomes of more than $70,000.
The administration said 89 percent of the new taxes would be paid by people making more than $100,000 a year. The top rate, doubling from 3.5 to 7 percent, will be levied on incomes of more than $75,000 for single people and incomes of more than $150,000 for families or heads of households.
Without detailed statewide polling, it is hard to determine exactly how most New Jerseyans perceive the increases. Most politicians agreed that it was easier for voters to understand that sales and income taxes were going up than new and complex formulas.
Republicans have been generally delighted with what they say are a public repugnance with Mr. Florio's policies.
''It has been horrible for Florio and the Democrats, at least the reaction among my constituents,'' said Garabed Haytaian, Republican of Hackettstown and the Assembly minority leader. ''People are truly upset.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Presents Anti-Drug Curriculum for Schools

BYLINE: By LESLIE MAITLAND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
The Department of Education today issued a detailed program for drug prevention lessons that it will send to more than 120,000 school administrators across the country, in an effort to teach children skills for resisting drug use.
This is the first time the department has offered a curriculum model to all the nation's schools.
In a press conference, Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos emphasized that his department was not trying to mandate what schools must teach, but was proposing a curriculum they might voluntarily add to their current drug prevention efforts.
The curriculum, which covers kindergarten through 12th grade, is based on research into child development and is intended to teach children self-esteem, decision-making skills and a sense of personal and civic responsibility. 
''This emphasis on civic responsibility helps students understand that drug use is not just a personal choice with only personal consequences,'' Mr. Cavazos said. ''Students learn that drug use is part of a culture of pain and potential violence that harms both individuals and society as a whole. And they learn that they can help change this culture through their own behaviors.''
 
Guidance for Parents
The curriculum, ''Learning to Live Drug Free,'' is intended to give children with the psychological tools and the information on the social, economic and health effects of drug use to help them resist peer pressure and make healthy choices for their lives, Mr. Cavazos said.
The program offers guidance for parents, teachers and communities and offers methods for infusing drug prevention into a range of subject areas: health, physical education, language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, art and music.
But to underscore that it is not dictating a comprehensive lesson plan, the department is issuing the curriculum in a looseleaf binder, so that schools may take from it what they want or add their own materials.
''We want it to be a living document,'' said one of the principal authors, Charles H. Flatter, a professor of human development at the University of Maryland who has been on the board of advisers to the children's television program ''Sesame Street.''
 
'Prevention Messages'
In an introduction, the plan's authors explain that while the curriculum model includes information on drugs and drug use, ''it focuses primarily on positive prevention messages: being drug free is something to be proud of; building children's academic and life skills is an important drug prevention strategy; and providing appropriate adult guidance is necessary so that youths will choose to participate in wholesome, healthy activities.''
The time when children make ''big decisions about who they're going to be in life'' is moving down to age 10 or 12, Dr. Flatter said, adding, ''Good decision-making and peer refusal skills have to start before that age.''
At the earliest level, kindergarten through third grade, the curriculum suggests encouraging children in activities like drawing ''Good Person Shields'' depicting things they like about themselves. It advises teaching children how to solve problems by having them play roles in dramas about stressful social situations. Seventh and eighth graders, for example, are presented with situations such as the following:
''You share a locker with a very popular student at school. Before school one morning, you open the locker and discover a small plastic bag with something in it that you think looks like marijuana. You must decide how to speak to your locker partner about your discovery. You do not want to jump to conclusions about the contents of the bag and why the bag is in your locker, but this locker also belongs to you, and you are responsible for its contents.''
 
Concern on Implementation
Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, today commended Mr. Cavazos on the curriculum, but questioned whether it would be broadly implemented.
''I hope the Secretary plans to follow up the distribution of this document with incentives for these schools to make this a reality,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''Otherwise, this is just another pile of Washington white paper.''
Lee Dogoloff, executive director of the American Council on Drug Education, and Elizabeth Karnes of the National Commission on Drug-Free Schools, said the curriculum model is likely to be welcomed enthusiastically by administrators. They were among a group of experts who were consulted on the model before its publication.
Mr. Dogoloff, a member of the President's Drug Advisory Council and a drug adviser to former President Carter, said the model represented a ''terrific contribution.''
''Most drug prevention curricula are quite expensive, running into the thousands of dollars and also require special training, which is expensive,'' Mr. Dogoloff said. ''This is free and it is good. Now, there's no reason why every school in this country shouldn't have an adequate drug curriculum.''
Dr. Karnes, who is a curriculum expert and a school board member in Omaha, said: ''There has been a demand for this from teachers, administrators and parents all over the country.'' She noted that many curriculums fail because they simply impart information about drugs, which may actually spark students' curiosity.
'' 'Just say no' is not enough,'' she said, echoing the theme that Nancy Reagan had made the motto of her drug war. ''Children need alternatives.''
In his comments today, Mr. Cavazos said ''the format of the model is designed for easy and continual expansion, revision and adaptation,'' and he urged teachers nationwide to provide the department with examples of how they introduce the prevention theme into their school lesson plans. The department expects to send out the curriculum within the next two weeks. It put the total cost of the project at $1 million.

 BODY:
Whatever else the participants at the economic summit meeting accomplished, President FRANCOIS MITTERRAND of France came away with a new title: distinguished professor of architecture at the University of Houston. The title and an honorary doctorate of humanities was awarded in a hastily arranged presentation yesterday at the university's College of Architecture, the four-year-old building created by Philip Johnson after a design by the 19th century French architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux. 
Of possibly greater interest to Mr. Mitterrand was the college's current exhibition, Architecture Capitales a Paris. The exhibition features the 11 buildings and design projects known as his Grands Travaux, works that involved Mr. Mitterrand. His participation in the projects, which included the glass pyramidal addition to the Louvre and the Musee D'Orsay, won him praise and condemnation.

 BODY:
Dr. ARNOLD RELMAN , editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine, is to retire next June after 14 years at the helm of the prestigious chronicle of medical research. Dr. Relman, who is 67 years old, said he plans to write, teach and lecture. The weekly magazine is owned and published by the Massachusetts Medical Society, which is to form a committee to select a successor to Dr. Relman. 
During his tenure, the journal became a forum for examining social and economic issues in medicine as well as reporting research findings. Dr. Relman was frequently criticized for using the journal to question, among other things, the growing role of business in medical care.
Many colleagues agree that Dr. Relman's chief accomplishment has been taking the journal into the contentious area of medical finance and ethics. The journal has reported on and commented editorially upon such matters as the growth of profit-making medicine and conflicts of interests that affect physicians.
''I want to spend the next few years as a more active participant in what I think will be a growing national discussion of health care,'' Dr. Relman said. ''I think the medical profession can make a major contribution toward solving the health care problems of this country if it will rouse itself.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Increased Slightly Last Month

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Lower prices and special promotions increased business at stores last month but sluggish economic conditions continued to restrain overall sales growth, the nation's largest retailers said yesterday.
Despite the small rebounds, analysts say retailing has been facing a difficult period because consumers have been losing confidence in their financial security and have grown more cautious about spending.
''People no longer whip out their plastic cards for anything that catches their fancy,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retailing consultant and publisher of an industry newsletter in New York. 
Jeffrey Edelman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Inc. said, ''I think we are witnessing a gradual slowing in the consumer sector.''
 
Reluctant Shoppers
 Weaknesses in employment and income growth, combined with heavy debt loads, have made shoppers reluctant to spend freely, especially when considering purchases of expensive, long-lasting merchandise.
In an indication that the Federal Reserve Board is worried about the economy's prospects, Alan Greenspan, the chairman, suggested yesterday the central bank might nudge interest rates lower.
Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee in Washington that slow growth in the nation's money supply and increasing commercial interest rates indicated that credit conditions might be tightening without central bank action.
 
3.5% Gain at Sears
 Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's largest retailer, posted a June gain of 3.5 percent, after a nine-tenths of 1 percent increase in same-store sales in May. The June figure was still unimpressive, the analysts said.
Gains at same stores, those open at least a year, give a more accurate reading of a retailer's performance. New stores typically attract extra shoppers who do not return regularly.
The promotional activity and markdowns, which reduce the amount of money that retailers receive for goods, are expected to impede the industry's profitability.
''Second-quarter profits are going to be under pressure,'' Mr. Edelman said.
 
Low Summer Inventories
 Most retailers have not had to cut prices drastically or resort to unplanned clearances because they were carrying lean inventories of summer goods. But the markdowns have been more prevalent than the industry had anticipated when the season began, the analysts said.
Several discounters did much better than the industry average.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a nationwide chain in Bentonville, Ark., that is the country's third-largest retailer, said its June sales soared by 28 percent. Its sales at stores open a year or longer grew by 14 percent.
Target, the discount-store division of the Dayton Hudson Corporation in Minneapolis, posted a 14 percent gain in total sales and an 8 percent gain in its same-store sales. But Dayton Hudson's department stores had a same-store sales increase of only 1 percent.
Following is a list of the sales of the other largest retailers:
 
Sears said its sales in the five weeks ended on July 7 rose 3.7 percent. Its same-store sales increased 3.5 percent.
K Mart Corporation, based in Troy, Mich., said its sales in the five weeks ended on July 4 rose 13.7 percent, while same-store sales grew 4.3 percent.
J. C. Penney Company, based in Dallas, said its June sales rose 5.3 percent. On a comparable-store basis, sales grew 4.1 percent.
May Department Stores Company, based in St. Louis, reported a total June sales gain of 8 percent. Its comparable-store sales rose 3.2 percent.
The Limited Inc., based in Columbus, Ohio, posted a 15 percent increase in total June sales. Its same-store sales rose 5 percent.
The Gap Inc., based in San Francisco, said its total June sales surged 31 percent, while its same-store sales increased 24 percent.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 37.13 to Set a Record

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
The prospect of lower interest rates and higher corporate profits pushed stock prices to record levels yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average surged by 37.13, to a new high for the blue-chip average of 2,969.80.
Volume was heavy and program trading again accounted for almost half the gain. The day was choppy, marked by three computerized selling programs before 11 A.M. and five buying ones starting at noon. 
Referring to Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Peter G. Grennan, the senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., remarked, ''Greenspan finally mentioned the word 'ease.' ''
 
Fed May Lower Rates
 Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday, Mr. Greenspan cautiously raised the possibility that if, as it appears, bankers were tightening credit, the Fed ''would have to consider offsetting with an ease in monetary policy.''
The previous record for the Dow had been 2,935.89, set on June 15. The gauge also broke the previous intraday record of 2,956.93, set on June 13.
But the record set in June for the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks still stands at 367.40, although the index rose by 4.21 yesterday, to 365.44.
Although traders still remained cautious before today's figures on the Producer Price Index are released, volume rose sharply to 211.5 million shares, the highest level since the middle of May, when it stood at 225.4 million. On Wednesday, volume amounted to 162.2 million shares.
And in yet another good sign for investors, 987 issues advanced while only 545 were down.
 
Factors in Gain
 Two big factors in yesterday's strong gain, Mr. Grennan said, were ''the conclusion from what Mr. Greenspan said that he will protect the economy from going into a recession'' and, after a flood of weak earnings in recent weeks, several ''positive earnings'' reports. Mr. Grennan mentioned Motorola, Safeway, Walgreen and Fannie Mae.
After reporting poor earnings, Computer Associates, a software producer, tumbled by 6 1/4, to 10 1/4, with 7.9 million shares changing hands. It led the New York Stock Exchange's list of the 10 most active stocks. And although it reported a rise in its profits, the stock also reached a new low of 10 1/8 after the analysts said they were disappointed with the gain.
Timothy McCollum of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. eliminated his recommendation, while John Maxwell of Dillon, Read & Company cut his earnings estimate.
 
Contel Soars $7.125
 The Contel Corporation, the telecommunications giant based in Atlanta, soared by 7 1/8, to 35 1/8, on 4.8 million shares after GTE, the telephone company, offered to buy it for about $6 billion in stock. GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., offered 1.27 shares of its stock, or $37.78 1/4 a share at yesterday's price, for each Contel share. GTE fell by 1 1/4, to 29 3/4, with 6.6 million shares trading.
Although telecommunications issues have been lagging lately, the Contel move put new life in the telephone sector - except for the regional Bell telephone companies.
Contel Cellular, which is 90 percent owned by Contel, jumped by 3 3/8, to 21, in over-the-counter trading, while Lincoln Telecommunications increased by 3 1/4, to 28. On the Big Board, Rochester Telephone rose 3, to 34 3/4; Southern New England Telecommunications rose by 2 1/2, to 35 5/8, and Century Telephone gained 2 3/4, to 30. ; On the American Stock Exchange, Telephone and Data Systems rose 1 7/8, to 38 1/4.
But Nynex fell yesterday after The Wall Street Journal disclosed on its front page that it had uncovered evidence of what it called ''a series of bawdy gatherings at Florida resorts.''
Nynex, which traded as low as 77, fell by 1 1/8, to 78 5/8, in heavy volume. Although the traders expected some fallout from the Nynex problem, all of the Bell regionals bounced back from their lows of the day, but Ameritech fell by 3/8, to 59 1/4.
 
Oil Issues Continue Rise
 With oil prices strengthening, petroleum stocks continued to rise sharply. ARCO increased by 4 1/4, to 121 7/8; British Petroleum by 2 1/4, to 71 5/8; Texaco by 2 1/8, to 60 1/8; Chevron by 2 7/8, to 73 7/8; Mobil by 1 7/8, to 63 1/2; Pennzoil by 2 3/8, to 78 3/4, and Amerada Hess by 2, to 47 1/2.
Motel 6, the Dallas economy chain, rose by 2 5/8, to 19 1/4, after is agreed to be acquired by Accor S.A., a French company, for about $1.3 billion.
Among other gauges, the Nasdaq composite index rose by 3.27, to 467.26, while the Amex's market-value index gained 2.82, to 362.23.

HEADLINE: Brady Gives Views on Bill

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady acknowledged today that the Bush Administration would probably fail to persuade the Senate to pass all of its proposals to revise the regulation of the financial markets.
But Mr. Brady refused to say whether he would accept a compromise to insure the passage of some of the changes. 
''I understand that we won't get everything in the legislation,'' Mr. Brady said in response to a question from Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. ''But I would not want to comment at this time on what a second-best solution was.''
The possibility of a compromise was first raised on Wednesday when the Senate Banking Committee began its hearings on the Treasury Department's proposal to shift jurisdiction over stock index futures to the Securities and Exchange Commission from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It would also transfer the authority to set margins from the Chicago exchanges to the S.E.C.
The Senate is divided over the proposal, which is opposed by the commodity futures board and agriculture interests on Capitol Hill. A vote is not expected until the end of the hearings, which is scheduled for July 24.

HEADLINE: Japan's Trade Surplus Rises

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 12

 BODY:
A surge in exports widened Japan's trade surplus by 27.5 percent in June, causing some analysts to believe that an 18-month shrinking of the trade imbalance may be over.
Japan's unadjusted customs-cleared trade surplus expanded to $6.72 billion in June, compared with $5.27 billion a year ago, the Finance Ministry said today. 
Behind the larger surplus was the first year-to-year rise in exports in nine months, Government officials and analysts said.
The surplus grew from levels a year ago for the first time since March and registered its largest year-to-year increase since February 1989, when it rose 38 percent from the previous year.
Economists said the yen's recent weakness accounted for much of the surplus's growth. A cheaper yen makes Japan's exports more competitively priced abroad.
June exports climbed 4.7 percent from the previous year, to $23.76 billion, bolstered by an 8 percent increase in exports by Japanese auto makers, with much of that going to Europe.
Imports fell 2.2 percent in June, to $17.04 billion. Although import growth was not expected to be strong, the decline surprised some economists who had expected surging domestic demand to offset expansion in exports.
The June trade data disclosed a narrower trade surplus with the United States.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Tumbles in Selloff After Greenspan's Remarks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled yesterday in a selloff set off by comments by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who suggested that the central bank might consider lowering interest rates.
The Fed chief's comments in Congressional testimony caught many foreign exchange dealers holding portfolios weighted heavily toward the dollar.
Renewed technical buying in later afternoon New York trading carried the dollar above its session lows against other key currencies but it still ended below Wednesday's closing levels. 
In overseas and early United States trading, the dollar was driven higher amid buying inspired by the lack of any currency-related announcements when the seven major industrialized nations concluded the Houston summit conference on Wednesday.
It had been expected that the leaders would indicate support for a stronger Japanese yen. But the dollar abruptly reversed course around midday in New York after reports of Mr. Greenspan's comments to the Senate Banking Committee reached the market.
Hugh Walsh, a currency dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank's office in New York, said as the session progressed traders began to view Mr. Greenspan's comments more skeptically, which may have aided the recovery in the dollar. He said Mr. Greenspan only stated the possibility that the Fed might ease monetary policy and did not declare that it would do so, or when.
In New York the dollar closed at 147.40 yen, down from 148.40 yen late Wednesday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 148.90 Japanese yen from 148.10. In London late Thursday the dollar was quoted lower at 148.45 yen.
A pound was quoted at $1.8130 late in New York, stronger than Wednesday's late level of $1.7995. In European trading, it closed at $1.7995, more expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $1.7980.
Late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's late quotes, included: 1.6355 German marks, down from 1.6540; 1.3895 Swiss francs, down from 1.4020; 5.4910 French francs, down from 5.5515; 1,198.75 Italian lire, down from 1,211.25, and 1.15675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15885.
Selected late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday's levels, were: 1.6525 German marks, up from 1.6507; 1.4020 Swiss francs, down from 1.4030; 5.5460 French francs, up from 5.5285; 1.8625 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8582; 1,211.00 Italian lire, up from 1,207.04, and 1.1580 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1586.

HEADLINE: Days of Fruit Tramp's Painful Harvest Fade

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST COLUMBIA, S.C.

 BODY:
Luther Henry Tindal, who is 45 years old and looks 60, and his wife, Linda, 34, rest on a dust-caked couch outside their $125-a-month cinderblock shack here, smoking discount cigarettes and drinking discount beer.
Their four children, ages 2 to 15, play in the sandy soil under a walnut tree with Buck, the pet goat, and Tramp Two, the pet mongrel. (An alligator in Florida ate Tramp One.) ''L. H.,'' as people know Mr. Tindal, had all his teeth pulled years ago, and Mrs. Tindal has lost most of hers. He is 5 feet 6 inches tall and once weighed 125 pounds. He says he is now down to about 95; he speculates that this is because of - a bout with tuberculosis four years ago and working among pesticides in fruit orchards.
 
Poverty and Hard Work
Mr. Tindal's poverty, his hard living and the toll of both on his health are emblems of a disappearing strain of migrant farm workers. He is a one of a huge clan, current and former migrant workers all, that includes his four other children from a previous marriage, his 10 brothers and sisters, Mrs. Tindal's 15 brothers and sisters, along with scores of cousins, other relatives and unrelated hangers-on. 
These are ''Grapes of Wrath'' people, native-born Americans, who follow the fruit and vegetable harvests in jalopies from Florida through Georgia and the Carolinas to Michigan and upstate New York. Unlike most migrant workers who are bound to a crew chief, these are independent operators who take pride in their skills, covet their freedom and exist in the shadows of public scrutiny. They call themselves ''fruit tramps'' to distinguish themselves from other migrant workers. Some others call them ''freewheelers.''
Fruit tramps are hard to spot because they try to live outside the law and contemporary conventions. Few have gone beyond junior high school. Mr. Tindal said he stopped at the 5th grade and his wife in the 10th. They say they have never voted, had a bank account, saved any money or owned a home and had a telephone only once, for a few months. Like some of the other men in his family, Mr. Tindal has never had a driver's license, although until recently he did drive.
They put up with Social Security tax deductions when they work for big farmers, who have too much to lose in evading the law. But they seek payment in cash, without deductions, from small farmers and people who give them part-time jobs. On rare occasions and when produce prices were higher, a family could earn $500 to $600 a week, but often with the help of their children in violation of the child labor laws. Now they say it would be hard to earn $400.
 
A Dying Breed
Clans like the Tindals and his wife's family, the Moteses, did most of the nation's migrant labor until 30 or 40 years ago, when teams made up only of men began moving in. More recently Hispanic, Haitian and Jamaican workers began taking the jobs once claimed by American families. Like Mr. Tindal's health, the American migrant clans are fading, victims of the way they live and the brutal economics of farm work.
Officials at the Census Bureau and the Department of Agriculture say they have stopped trying to count migrant workers because they are too elusive. Unofficial estimates range from hundreds of thousands to several million, but families hardly show up. Certainly there are a few hundred fruit tramps, possibly a few thousand; most of them are white. That fruit tramps persist is in part the discovery of a photojournalist, Herman Emmet, who came upon the Tindals in the late 1970's. He lived and worked with the Tindals off and on for more than a decade and wrote about them in a book of photographs called ''Fruit Tramps,'' published last year by the University of New Mexico Press.
Mrs. Tindal's 58-year-old mother, Betty Motes, who like her husband, Leroy, and her parents was an itinerant fruit picker, said a dozen families around her neighborhood in Fort Pierce, Fla., are fruit pickers. Everette W. Noel, one of the many peach growers 50 miles from here in Johnston, S.C., which calls itself ''The Peach Capital of the World,'' has employed the families for years. He turned them away this season, however, because storms and a March freeze mutilated his crop.
Mr. Noel prefers to hire migrant families because, he said, they are relatively stable and seem not to use hard drugs. ''They're not bad,'' Mr. Noel said. ''Just kind of defeated. Their problem is alcohol.''
 
Picture of Southern Poverty
Mr. Tindal's arms and emaciated torso are covered with primitive tattoos. He said he got most of them while on a prison chain gang when he was 18. On his left shoulder is a tattoo that says ''Live hard'' and on the right one that says ''Die young.'' He got his latest tattoos some weeks ago, little crosses on his neck to align a radiation machine for treating his throat cancer.
The Tindals have lived here for almost a year, longer than any place else, so that Mr. Tindal can be treated 20 minutes away in Columbia. At Lot 100C, beyond the Silver Lake trailer park, the house presents a stereotypical picture of Southern rural poverty, with light bulbs hanging from wires, a decrepit washing machine resting in a puddle outside the kitchen door, the hulk of an abandoned car on one side of the house and the hulk of another beyond the clothesline in front.
The Tindals bought their current car, a 1982 compact Pontiac station wagon, some three months ago for about $1,500, and they still owe $1,300 on it. It has a license plate on the front that says ''Jesus,'' and a bumper sticker in back that says, ''Good girls go to Heaven, bad girls go everywhere.'' The children leave the doors open, and the goat gets in and eats the seats.
The Tindal home is a scene of coping and pulling together. Most days, relatives and friends come to check on Mr. Tindal and to chat, smoke, drink beer and help out.
The Tindals say their sole income is Mr. Tindal's $371 monthly Social Security disability check. They were cut off from food stamps in March because Mrs. Tindal earned too much last year, at $35 a day at a produce stand. She says she cannot work now because she is caring for Mr. Tindal. She reapplied for the stamps but says she has heard nothing.
L. H.'s brother Lewis Tindal, 49, found the house for them and stops by frequently. He is the trailer park's full-time maintenance man, having stopped picking fruit three or four years ago, and he seems the most prosperous of the lot. The father of eight children, he owns his own home, a four-bedroom trailer about 20 minutes away, that he bought for $15,000 in cash.
The Tindals' most essential prop, however, is a lifelong friend: David Langston, a gangling, gregarious, heavy-drinking 43-year-old Vietnam War veteran who sleeps on the couch in the living room. Mr. Langston spends much of the $40 that he earns each day at an open air market on beer and cigarettes for himself and the Tindals, and he brings them the market's excess produce. Mrs. Tindal drives him to work and does his laundry and cooking. He stopped picking fruit regularly a year ago, he said, to care for the Tindals. Is It Freedom or a Trap? Most migrant workers sign up with sometimes unscrupulous crew leaders, and are herded by vans and old buses from farm to farm. The crew leaders provide meals and keep track of each person's production, and the farmers provide barracks-like housing. Fruit tramps, by contrast, drive straight to the farm and make their own arrangements. When conflicts arise with a farmer or a crew leader, they head for another farm.
The Tindals say their way of life is liberating, but they don't often calculate its cost. ''They have their gypsy life,'' said Mr. Emmet, the photographer. ''But that's all they have. Is it freedom, or is it a trap? It's a trap.'' Fruit tramps are constantly alert to the presence of the law. Mr. Noel said that when the police appear at his farm, whatever the reason, the workers scatter.
L. H. Tindal said he went to jail for ''not minding my own business,'' but declined to elaborate. Lewis Tindal said he had gone to jail ''a hundred times'' but never for more than 30 days. Mrs. Tindal's 38-year-old brother, Leon Motes, said he had served 12 years: 5 for trying to kill a policeman, 7 for auto theft.
Another brother, 29-year-old Terry Motes, cited a time when he went in for nine months. ''Illegal tags, no license, eluding a police officer,'' he said. He said he did not have a license because he couldn't read well enough to take an examination. ''I knew I was going to jail anyway, so I tried to get away,'' he said.
 
Prisoner of the Elements
Evading conventional payment arrangements can also cause problems. Mr. Langston recalled a Miss Hurd in upstate New York, who invited the Tindals, Mr. Langston and three other men to work for a day picking raspberries. ''She gave us $5.50 for the whole day - a dollar for the men and 50 cents for Linda,'' he said. They had no recourse.
But if these people are in a trap, it is not entirely their own design. Consumers benefit from abundant, cheap fruit and vegetables. Peach pickers typically get 35 cents for each sack they pick; orange pickers about 55 cents. They are assured the minimum wage of $3.85 an hour if they pick too little to earn more. But the minimum wage no longer provides a standard of living above the poverty level, and migrant workers earn less than other minimum-wage workers because they can't work in the rain or when there's nothing to pick.
Other economic forces work against them. St. Clair Guess, publisher of The Citizen-News in Edgefield, S.C., near Johnston, said that in the low-interest-rate era of the 1970's, fruit growers, like many other farmers, planted more land and overexpanded, leading to today's often abundant harvests. Large supplies of fruit help keep prices down, he said, leaving growers little room to pay their workers more and still earn enough to pay off their loans.
The influx of foreign workers makes matters worse, Mr. Guess said. Mexicans will pick the fruit at rock-bottom wages, holding down the pay the fruit tramps might otherwise get. ''Without inexpensive labor,'' Mr. Guess said, ''the farmers can't survive.''
 
'It's in the Past'
The children of fruit tramps, unlike their parents when they were children, have set their sights on other careers. James Tindal, a cousin of L. H.'s, is 52 and said he had had three heart attacks in five years after a life of picking fruit. ''I raised four children and got all mine out of it,'' he said.
Tina Tindal, at 15 the oldest of Mr. and Mrs. Tindal's children, told Mr. Emmet that half of her wanted to carry on as a fruit tramp. But she has ruled that out. She says she wants to be a model or a teacher. ''See, Daddy's sick,'' she said. ''I liked it at first, but it's in the past. I don't see no life in fruit picking no more.''
Shannon, 9, the next oldest, said: ''It gives me the chills. All them bugs that got on me. No way I'll pick fruit.'' Mr. Tindal said, ''I'm glad of it.'' ''Fruit picking is a freedom job: Nobody's hollering at you, cussing at you, telling you what to do.'' But he added:
''You got to be a damn nut to pick fruit now. You got have a weak mind, a strong back and alcohol to put up with it.''
As long as the children are under her roof, Mrs. Tindal added, ''they're staying in school.''

HEADLINE: Starrett City Keeps Apartments Vacant Despite Waiting List

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
In the 20 months since the United States Supreme Court outlawed racial quotas that favored white applicants to the huge Starrett City housing complex in Brooklyn, the black and Hispanic families who had sought apartments for years have remained stuck on a long waiting list.
Instead of offering apartments to those on the list - who the Federal courts determined were the victims of a quota system that Starrett's owner said had been created not to enforce segregation but to preserve integration - the owner has left as many as 400 apartments vacant.
Most of the apartments that have been rented since the High Court decision have gone to more affluent families paying higher rents, Federal and state housing officials say. Without seeking the permission of the Government regulators who oversee the complex, Starrett has for the first time advertised for families not on its waiting list who are willing to pay market-rate rents and it has offered as an inducement four months rent free.
It is not clear why Starrett decided to limit the use of its waiting list or whether that violated a consent decree Starrett had signed with the Justice Department. Starrett officials said they were forced to seek market-rate tenants because government subsidies no longer covered all their operating costs. 
Starrett, overlooking the Shore Parkway at Pennsylvania Avenue in the East New York section, has traditionally been home almost exclusively to subsidized moderate- and middle-income tenants.
Some open-housing advocates questioned whether Starrett was trying to circumvent the Supreme Court decision by denying apartments to people on the waiting list.
Other housing officials said they thought that the management was motivated more by economic than racial concerns, to increase rental income and to prepare for a possible conversion from rental housing to a private cooperative.
Some officials said that whatever the motivation, a result was that the less-affluent families on the waiting list, most of whom are black and Hispanic, continued to be denied subsidized housing.
Officials at the complex, which has been renamed Starrett at Spring Creek, contend that they have acted properly. They said they were allowed under a Federal contract to rent at market rates up to 10 percent of the nearly 6,000 apartments in the 42-building complex. Three-bedroom apartments have been offered for as much as $1,200 a month, and two-bedroom units for $1,000.
Starrett officials said they were not trying to get around the Supreme Court ruling; most of the 100 families who have recently rented apartments at market rates are black, they said.
State and Federal officials, who have a different interpretation of the contract and Federal rules, said Starrett was not permitted to charge market rates and had to rent vacant apartments to people on the waiting list who qualify for subsidies.
 
Reviews Planned by the State
The state housing agency that oversees the complex has ordered Starrett to stop renting apartments at market rates. Saying Starrett had resisted requests for its records, the state has demanded copies of the waiting list and many other documents and has said it would begin reviewing every applicant selected by Starrett to rent an apartment. Families eligible for subsidies generally pay 30 percent of their incomes for rent, with the Federal Government paying the rest. Subsidized apartments also rent for $300 to $400 a month less than market rates.
The bias suit, filed by the Reagan Administration, received national attention because the owner, the Starrett Housing Corporation, had taken an unusual line of defense. The company asserted that racial quotas were needed to keep the complex integrated.
 
Fear of 'Segregated Wasteland'
About 55 percent of the 20,000 residents are white, and 45 percent are black, Asian or Hispanic. Management argued that preference had to be shown to white applicants to maintain the racial balance. Otherwise, they said, whites would flee and Starrett would become, in the words of a lawyer representing the complex, ''a segregated wasteland.''
Two Federal courts decided that the quotas violated the Fair Housing Act because they discriminated against minority families on the waiting list. In November 1988 the Supreme Court turned down an appeal by Starrett.
A spokeswoman for Starrett, Devora Fong, said it had deliberately kept apartments vacant between the Supreme Court decision and the signing of the consent decree with the Justice Department six months later. Starrett was awaiting instructions on how it should go about renting apartments, Ms. Fong said.
In the last year, Ms. Fong said, vacant apartments have been rented to market-rate tenants and to less-affluent families on the waiting list. But residents and state officials, who are awaiting proof that waiting-list applicants had received apartments, said they believed that hundreds of apartments remained empty.
 
Dispute on Subsidy Numbers
State and Federal housing officials said Starrett had to use all of the Federal rent subsidies at its disposal. Only then, they said, would they consider allowing it to rent at market rates.
Under one Federal program, the officials said, Starrett is required to rent 2,500 subsidized apartments to moderate-income households. Federal and state officials said Starrett had failed to rent 200 apartments under the program to meet the requirement.
Ms. Fong said 120 families on the waiting list for the program were ''being processed right now.'' Starrett was built with state and city subsidies, and it has contracts for three different Federal subsidies.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, Amy Casner, would not comment on whether Starrett's actions violated the consent decree. Ms. Casner said the department was aware of the Federal and state concerns.
 
Order From State Official
In a stern letter, the state agency that oversees Starrett, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, ordered the management in April to stop renting at market rates and to rent empty apartments to those on the waiting list.
''Since the signing of the Justice Department consent order, Starrett City has been holding hundreds of apartments off the market, limiting rentals to applicants on the existing list who are in need of subsidy, while concentrating their marketing efforts on market-rate tenants,'' wrote Myron Holtz, a deputy housing commissioner.
The state had met with ''marked resistance to our requests for access to office records,'' Mr. Holtz wrote. He ordered Starrett to send the waiting list, all applications for apartments and all credit reports on applicants to the state ''for review and approval prior to move in.''
The rental practices and the state's response were disclosed in an article in City Limits, a monthly publication on New York housing.
 
Pleased With Amenities
State housing officials said in interviews that Starrett had long been one of the best-managed and maintained middle-income housing complexes in New York. Many residents said that their apartments were spacious and inexpensive and that they enjoyed amenities like an indoor swimming pool, a recreation center and excellent public schools. State officials said they were puzzled and disturbed by management's recent actions.
Starrett had not previously tried to market apartments to more affluent people, state officials said. Although a small number of tenants have paid market-rate rents over the years, nearly all of them had received rent subsidies when they entered the complex. As their incomes grew over the years, some families no longer qualified for the Federal subsidies, and their rents were increased.
Phyllis Spiro, assistant director of the Open Housing Center, a fair-housing group, said she had received complaints from people on the waiting list who said Starrett had told them that apartments were not being rented to those on the list.
 
Skepticism on Motivations
Ms. Spiro speculated that more white families would be likely to afford higher rents than minority families. She also said Starrett might be preparing to convert to a cooperative, which it is entitled to do after 1994. Management has indicated an interest in doing so. Affluent tenants might be more likely to buy their apartments, Ms. Spiro said.
The director of fair housing at the City Human Rights Commission, Harvey Fisher, said he was skeptical about management's motivations.
''For them to be able to market co-op apartments, I think they are going to have to take into account white anxiety about a very integrated development,'' Mr. Fisher said, adding that he thought that Starrett might have been recruiting more affluent tenants, whether white or minority middle-class families, who would be less threatening to potential white buyers.
Starrett officials insisted that they were doing basically what they had always done, renting apartments both to market-rate tenants and to less-affluent subsidized families. State and Federal officials said, however, that virtually all tenants had been subsidized for the last 10 years.
''We have had meetings with them,'' Ms. Fong said of the government officials, ''and we are all working on this together. I don't think we are in an adversarial position.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 19, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about vacant apartments in the Starrett City housing complex in Brooklyn misidentified the owner. The development, recently renamed Starrett at Spring Creek, is owned by Starrett City Associates, not the Starrett Housing Corporation.

The People Threat

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Lucien Paye, head of the O.E.C.D., which groups 24 industrialized countries, was asked what worried him most on the horizon. U.S. budget and trade deficits? Protectionism? Recession?
''It depends if you talk short-term or long-term,'' he answered. The serious concern, out about a decade, ''is demography.'' Third-world countries are building up population at a rate no imaginable economic development effort could accommodate. 
As things are going, pressures will become explosive, launching invasion tides of desperate people trying to throw themselves on labor markets. They won't be armed, but will set forth in overwhelming multitudes.
Mr. Paye is a Frenchman, and he was thinking mainly of burgeoning African populations. Already immigration from the south is the most abrasive political issue in France, strengthening the nationalist ultra-right. The issue is sharpening in Italy, a country with no tradition of absorbing the poor from abroad.
For the U.S., the push will mount primarily from Latin America. But the stakes are global because development, environment, peace will be put at risk if the number of people and capacity to sustain them is thrown into such imbalance.
That is why deliberate restraint of science in providing reproductive choice is beyond comprehension. The U.S. is hobbling a humane approach by its obsession with abortion. In the name of ''right to life,'' American militants are disregarding conditions of life for children around the world: nutrition, health care, education at home, famine, disease, war abroad.
During the Reagan Administration, funds for United Nations population control programs were cut because they might be used for abortions. In the last couple of years, threats from American groups have blocked distribution of a pill that prevents development of a fertilized egg.
It is RU486, called the ''French pill'' because it was developed by a French biochemist, Etienne-Emile Baulieu, who won a 1989 Lasker Award for his discovery. The citation said it provided a ''safe, effective'' means for preventing pregnancy and avoiding surgical abortion. Made by the French company Roussel Uclaf, RU486 has been widely tested in France and other European countries. In April, reports on 40,000 cases of use listed only two ''incidents,'' without damaging consequences.
The anti-abortion lobby in the U.S. succeeded in preventing legal importation of the drug under Federal law. Worse, by threatening a general boycott of pharmaceuticals from the German company Hoechst, which controls Roussel Uclaf, the lobby persuaded Hoechst to shut down production. The order was reversed in France by the Government, which had a minority share, so the pill is available here under medical supervision, but not much elsewhere.
Now, a group of San Francisco doctors has decided to test a California law that permits import of banned drugs for experimental purposes, passed to enable investigation of as-yet uncertified treatments for AIDS. The French newspaper Liberation quotes Dr. Bernard Gore as saying, ''Like your Minister of Health, we think this revolutionary discovery is the moral property of women.''
He pointed out that some 300,000 women die yearly of botched abortions, mostly in the third world, and that law or no law, some 300,000 women in California undergo abortions every year.
The difference between a contraceptive pill and RU486 is that it can be taken after insemination. It works in the early stage of pregnancy by countering the hormone progesterone, which serves to attach the fertilized egg to the uterus.
The World Development Forum called RU486 a ''breakthrough for developing countries.'' Dr. Baulieu said, ''It is a far safer method of abortion than any operation in countries where medical facilities are limited.''
But, the Forum said, Hoechst has refused to license production in China, and the World Health Organization is ducking the issue. ''We have no position,'' a spokesman said. A Hoechst spokesman said his company had yet to make a final decision, which would be based on medical reports, chemical trials ''and other issues, such as opinions in society. We will take note of their wishes.''
That is a way of saying that the threat from American militants of commercial loss on its other products has intimidated Hoechst to the point of depriving the world of an urgently needed safeguard. The San Francisco doctors have a chance to prove the pill should be legalized in the U.S., and open the possibility of worldwide distribution. They deserve support.

HEADLINE: Nunn Panel Cuts Pentagon $18 Billion

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
In the first Congressional action on the 1991 military budget, a Senate committee today approved a plan to cut $18 billion from the Bush Administration's proposal, and called for sharp troop reductions in Europe and cuts in the ''Star Wars'' anti-missile program.
The action, by the Senate Armed Services Committee, made it plain that Congress was seeking far deeper reductions in military spending than those sought by the Administration.
The Senate panel is the first of four Congressional committees that will address the military budget this year, and it is the most supportive of the Pentagon's budget plans. Its chairman is Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who exerts considerable leverage in military issues. In a number of speeches earlier this year, he emphasized the need to restructure the United States military in the face of a diminishing threat. His outline essentially became a blueprint for the committee. 
 
Others Might Cut Deeper
The other committees, which are not likely to act before September, are the House counterpart of Mr. Nunn's panel, and the two chambers' military subcommittees on appropriations, where the actual money for the military will be provided. They are expected to make even deeper cuts in the Administration's $307 billion budget request, which is 2.5 percent below current military spending when adjusted for inflation.
In a news conference at the Capitol today, Senator Nunn called the committee's proposal a ''responsible'' and ''manageable'' plan toward ''a major restructuring of our military establishment and the way it does business.''
Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the committee, said that while the proposal ''may be just Round 1,'' it also represents a ''foundation and a guidepost for how those cuts could be made and the very severe consequences of further reductions.''
The committee's plan includes these major elements:
* Reduction of United States troop strength worldwide by 100,000 from 2.1 million, including a reduction of 50,000 troops in Europe. The Administration proposed cutting worldwide troop strength by 38,000.
* Cancellation of the $1.3 billion proposed rail system for shuttling MX missiles around the country, leaving only $548 million for continued research. The committee approved $202 million in research on the single-warhead Midgetman.
* Cuts of nearly $1 billion, to $3.7 billion, in the Administration's budget on the ''Star Wars'' program.
* Approval of the Administration's request to build two of the Stealth, or B-2, radar-evading bombers.
* Creation of a Strategic Environmental Research Program to address environmental threats by enlisting the research talent available to the military, as well as its computers, planes, ships, satellites and other resources. The plan, sought by Mr. Nunn, proposes $200 million to finance the program.
* Elimination of an Energy Department request for a $65 million new plutonium plant at Rocky Flats, Colo., shifting the money to clean-up efforts.
Major battles are expected on the Senate floor and with the House over the anti-missile program, the Stealth bomber and perhaps troop levels. Senate leaders clashed this week over whether cuts should be taken more heavily in personnel or weapons systems.
The reductions in the panel's $289 billion spending plan reflect its philosophy that adjustments should be made to reflect the reduction in the Soviet threat overseas and economic demands at home. This philosophy embraces nuclear deterrence, but at lower force levels, delaying production of more advanced weapons systems until they pass performance tests and improving existing weapons before committing to expensive new systems.
The plan would, for example, slow production of major weapons, including the A-12 aircraft carrier plane, C-17 transport and Seawolf attack submarine, by rejecting all or nearly all of the Administration's production request for them for next year.
The Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, cautioned that the proposed cuts, if forced on the services too quickly, could jeopardize the military. ''If I have to take big cuts the first year, and it's in fast-spend accounts, then it has to come out of personnel, and that does begin to do serious damage to the quality of the force,'' he said in an interview with the Cable News Network.
In addition to the cuts in troop strength in fiscal 1991 the panel also approved a fiscal 1995 level of 1.6 million military personnel, a reduction of nearly 475,000 from the current level.

HEADLINE: QUAYLE DEFENDS BUSH'S TAX STAND

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 13

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle sought to reassure a nervous group of Republican leaders today that President Bush did not simply kick away one of their best campaign issues when he acknowledged last month that tax increases would be needed to reduce the Federal budget deficit.
Mr. Quayle, raising the issue that clearly most worries those gathered here for the summer meeting of the Republican National Committee, said clear differences on taxes remained between Democrats and Republicans even after Mr. Bush's reversal.
''The reaction of some Democrats to the President's June 26 announcement was a useful reminder of this fundamental difference between our two parties,'' Mr. Quayle said in a luncheon speech on the second day of the committee's three-day meeting. ''The President reluctantly announced that he would consider tax revenue increases to get the negotiations going -as one of six elements of a budget deal. But many Democrats made it clear that their first and only priority was to raise taxes.'' 
 
A Defensive Position
Mr. Quayle's speech here was part of an effort by the White House and the Republican National Committee to dig out of the uncomfortable, and somewhat unaccustomed, defensive position the party finds itself in as the fall campaigns draw near.
''This meeting is about one thing: offense,'' Ed Rogers, a top White House political operative, said of the Republican gathering.
The Republicans have felt on the defensive on issues as diverse as the savings and loan scandal and abortion. But perhaps most threatening of all is the issue of taxes, their stated resistance to which has been a central element of their success in the last three Presidential races.
 
Assailing the President
Even as the committee was meeting here today, a number of conservatives were holding a news conference in Washington to attack Mr. Bush on several fronts, including his softened stand against taxes.
The critics, led by L. Brent Bozell 3d of the Conservative Victory Committee, released a letter they had sent to Lee Atwater, the Republican national chairman, in which they said, ''If the Republican Party compromises the basic tenets of the 1988 platform, it will spell disaster for its candidates in the upcoming Congressional elections.''
In Chicago, Peggy Noonan, the former Reagan speechwriter who coined Mr. Bush's ''read my lips'' 1988 campaign promise to resist new taxes, seemed to sum up the delegates' feelings when she told them, ''I truly believe we must not lose the tax issue.''
Finding a way to hang on to that issue, while the White House continues negotiating with Congressional Democrats to reduce the deficit, was uppermost on everybody's mind here.
 
Strong Economy Emphasized
Several different, and perhaps contradictory, approaches were in evidence. One was to emphasize the importance of a strong economy, as Jeannie Austin, party co-chairwoman, did this morning, and to praise Mr. Bush for his ''leadership and his courage'' in making hard decisions to assure that economic strength.
But another approach, which drew considerably more applause whenever it was brought up, was to suggest that the deficit talks might fail and that Mr. Bush could walk away, blaming the Democrats for the collapse and not raising taxes after all.
Many Democrats on Capitol Hill believe that public concern about the deficit has risen to such a level, and that the economy has slowed to such a point, that Mr. Bush cannot afford to let the budget talks collapse.
But both Mr. Quayle and Ms. Noonan, who is a good friend of the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, rejected that.
''A good deal, or no deal at all,'' Mr. Quayle said.
Ms. Noonan said, ''I hope this party will, if it must, take the tax-and-spend issue to the people.''
Seeking to shift the political focus from taxes to spending, Mr. Quayle demanded that the Democrats respond to Mr. Bush's willingness to discuss tax increases by detailing spending cuts they would be willing to accept in a budget deal.
''Their silence on this issue, as usual, has been deafening,'' the Vice President said.

HEADLINE: Drunken Flying Persists Despite Treatment Effort

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
Bruce K. is a pilot who flies Boeing 727 jetliners for a major airline. He is also a recovering alcoholic.
Until about three years ago, he routinely showed up to work only three or four hours after a night of heavy drinking. (Federal rules prohibit a pilot from drinking within eight hours of flying.) ''As long as I got some sleep and ate some mints, I figured I was O.K.,'' he said. To hide the fact that he was too drunk to fly, he devised other ways to hide it, like assigning his co-pilot to fly the first flight of the day.
Finally, with his family life in tatters and his job in jeopardy, he reached what he called his ''personal bottom.'' At the urging of his wife, he entered an in-patient treatment program at a hospital in the Middle West. Seven months later he was back at work, earning the same pay and retaining his seniority. Today he is a counselor in a support group for alcoholic pilots. And his group is one of many. #1,200 Pilots Rehabilitated About 1,200 airline pilots have been treated for alcoholism and have returned to the cockpit since the Government began a rehabilitation program for such pilots 15 years ago, said Dr. Burton Pakull, chief psychiatrist at the Federal Aviation Administration. 
The rehabilitation programs are the most visible sign of an industry still wrestling with the problem of alcoholism. Statistics on pilots with drinking problems are virtually impossible to come by, but industry and government officials said they believed that treatment programs are not reaching all pilots who drink too much. And although most pilots in treatment programs say they never mixed drinking and flying, Bruce K. is not alone among pilots who said that they have flown while drunk.
''There are probably a number of early-stage alcoholics flying,'' said Gary Kohn, corporate medical director for United Airlines. ''We don't pretend we screen out all substance abusers, but we do screen out some.''
 
'Great Potential for Tragedy'
The arrest of three Northwest pilots in May, charged with flying while under the influence of alcohol, has brought new attention to the issue. The pilots, who have since been dismissed by Northwest, have denied the charges. Their trial is scheduled to start July 25 in Federal District Court in Minneapolis. If convicted, they could face up to 15 years in prison.
''The Northwest incident establishes very clearly that there is a great potential for tragedy,'' said Stephen Hilton, spokesman for Senator John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican who is sponsoring a bill that would require random alcohol testing of pilots. Only testing for drugs like marijuana or cocaine is now required.
But some experts fear that alcohol testing will simply force pilots who drink to seek treatment without the airline's knowledge, as was the case before the rehabilitation program began in 1975. Since the arrest of the three Northwest pilots, counselors have reported an increase in the number of pilots seeking help for alcoholism.
''All of us in the industry are glad that the incident was publicized,'' said Chuck G., a retired pilot from Seattle who was one of the first to be treated in the rehabilitation program. ''It was a good warning to people.'' #16 Accidents Since 1983 Since 1983 there have been only 16 airline accidents in which drug or alcohol use by pilots was found to be a factor, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
The 16 accidents involved commuter airlines and charter flights. But about 6 percent of all accidents in private aviation are traced to drug or alcohol use.
Since 1984, 61 professional pilots have had their licenses suspended or revoked for flying while drunk.
''For every pilot I treat, there are five more who just sneak into early retirement,'' said Dr. Joseph A. Pursch, director of the Addiction Institute in Costa Mesa, Calif. Dr. Pursch, a psychiatrist, helped start the rehabilitation program.
Today, every major airline has a confidential rehabilitation program. A pilot who passed psychiatric tests after the rehabilitation can return to work with no loss of benefits or seniority. The pilot is monitored monthly for at least two years by an airline doctor, a fellow pilot, a counselor and an airline executive.
 
Unusual Cooperation Seen
These rehabilitation programs represent unusual cooperation among a Government agency, a major industry and a union. Indeed, with a success rate of more than 90 percent, they are regarded by counselors as models for other recovery programs.
Experts attribute the high success rate to close monitoring and a strong motivation to fly again. ''It put the job on the line in the most clear and unequivocable way,'' Dr. Pursch said.
Nobby Hall, a union representative at Trans World Airlines who helps detect pilots with drinking problems, said, ''You get them where they live: pride, ego and a $100,000-a-year salary.''
Northwest Airlines had long been an industry holdout; it began its program less than a year ago. ''They were adamant about not having a program,'' said Dr. Pakull, the F.A.A. psychiatrist. ''They were a conspicuous exception.'' Company Policy Recalled Robert Gibbons, a spokesman for Northwest, said the airline decided last year to bring its policy in line with the rest of the industry. Previously, its pilots were not permitted to drink 24 hours before flying; those who violated the policy did not receive rehabilitation but were grounded for two years. ''As we became more enlightened,'' Mr. Gibbons added, ''we understood that we were not encouraging pilots to come forward.''
The rehabilitation costs about $17,000 a person, with the airlines paying for the treatment. In this the airlines are motivated by economic as well as humanitarian reasons.
''An airline has spent millions of dollars training these people to take the pilot's seat,'' said Richard Bickerton, a spokesman for the Employee Assistance Professionals Association, a trade group that represents counselors. ''These people are human assets.'' About 85 percent of the pilots who have problems with alcohol are flagged by fellow pilots who have been trained to look for signs of the disease. And evidence of a drinking problem must be verified by at least two colleagues.
 
'A Conspiracy of Silence'
Still, there is reluctance to turn in a fellow pilot. ''There is a conspiracy of silence among macho men: 'Don't rat on your buddy,' '' said Don F., a recently retired pilot who is a recovering alcoholic and now counsels pilots in northern New Jersey.
''The attitude is, 'I'll cover for you because next time you might have to cover for me,' '' said Bruce K., the 727 pilot. Both spoke on the condition that they not be identified.
Denial, always a formidable obstacle when treating alcoholism, is especially daunting among pilots, who are trained to keep their emotions in check.
''Every pilot I treat, it's clear that he should have been treated 10 or 15 years ago,'' said Dr. Pursch. ''They say he's not that bad, he has only three years to go before he retires. They look the other way.''
 
No Match for the Disease
Bruce K.'s drinking bouts slowly caused his family life to unravel. The discipline instilled in him early in his career proved no match for the disease. ''I had been trained for over 20 years to be in control,'' he said. ''Finding something I wasn't in control of was a hard pill to swallow.''
Today he counsels other pilots at a group called Birds of a Feather. The group, which is affiliated with Alcoholics Anonymous, has 25 chapters worldwide. Meetings are part confession, part therapy and part aviation patter.
''My hero was an airline pilot: the steely-eyed, womanizing drinker,'' one member said.
Bruce K. is no longer monitored by the airline and, as far as his employer is concerned, he is no different from the airline's thousands of other pilots. When he is asked by his colleagues why he will not join them for a beer, he has a few stock replies: ''I had to give it up,'' or ''I don't drink casually.'' Usually, he said, the subject is dropped.

HEADLINE: Rights Bill for Disabled Is Sent to Bush

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
The Senate today completed Congressional action on a far-reaching bill to bar discrimination against people with physical and mental disabilities.
After a brief but highly emotional discussion in which several senators described relatives with handicaps, the lawmakers voted 91 to 6 to accept the House-Senate conference report on the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The measure now goes to the White House. President Bush said today he was ''delighted'' that the bill had been approved and would sign it when it reached his desk. 
The bill, the most sweeping anti-discrimination measure to be approved since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, will bar bias in employment, transportation, public accommodations and telecommunications against what it estimates as 43 million Americans with a physical or mental disability.
More than 100 supporters of the measure, some in wheelchairs, gathered in a reception room off the Senate chamber and cheered wildly when a security guard announced the final vote.
''No longer will people with disabilities be second-class citizens,'' said Pat Wright, executive director of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, a lobbying and advocacy group.
 
Emotional Tributes
Earlier on the Senate floor, one of the bill's prime sponsors, Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, said he was addressing his comments to his deaf brother, Frank. ''Today, Congress opens the doors to all Americans with disabilities,'' Mr. Harkin said, using sign language as well as words. ''Today we say no to ignorance, no to fear, no to prejudice.''
Some lawmakers expressed concern about the effects on business, among them Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who supported the bill and in fact dedicated it to his brother-in-law, Raymond Hansen, who died in May 1970 after a long bout with polio.
''If our bureaucrats in Washington, our regulators - maybe that's a better word - write the regulations too stringently and too tough, there are aspects of this bill that could make it very difficult for the free enterprise system,'' Mr. Hatch said. The six Senators who voted against the bill were Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, Jake Garn of Utah, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Gordon J. Humphrey of New Hampshire, Steve Symms of Idaho and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, all Republicans. Their objections ranged from a concern over increased suits against business to the extension of protection against bias to people with AIDS. Some also felt that the law would place an economic burden on businesses.
 
Fear on Expenditures
''Rather than merely prohibiting discrimination against the disabled, the bill compels employers to make significant expenditures and extensive physical alterations to their facilities to accommodate an unlimited variety of job applicants,'' Mr. Humphrey said.
How much the bill will cost will depend on two factors: the regulations that will codify how the legislation will be carried out, and the legal penalties that businesses will face for violations. The regulations are to be drafted within 18 months.
The scale of legal costs will depend greatly on the fate of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, which the Senate is now considering. The disabilities bill links the monetary damages that victims of discrimination may receive from the courts to those embodied in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - currently back pay for those who have been dismissed or denied a promotion. The new civil rights bill seeks to amend the 1964 legislation to allow those who prove willful bias to receive an unlimited amount of compensatory and punitive damages.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that local governments would spend $20 million to $30 million a year to buy lift-equipped buses for people in wheelchairs, and $15 million more to maintain these vehicles. The C.B.O. makes no estimate on the additional costs for subway, railroad and trolley cars. But the agency projects it would cost $1 billion to alter ''key'' railroad, subway and trolley stations to make them accessible to people with disabilities, as will be required by the law.
There are no reliable estimates on the economic burden on private busineses, but Cecelia Fepp, a research analyst for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said it would be ''millions of dollars annually.''
A 1987 study by the Job Accommodation Network, a consulting concern that helps business deal with disabled workers, concluded that in less than 1 percent of cases did a business have to spend more than $5,000 to make a reasonable accommodation for a disabled worker.
''This thing is not going to be as costly as you think it is,'' said Ray Robertson, the organization's executive director.
 
Definitions and Coverage
The legislation approved today defines a disability as a condition that ''substantially limits'' a ''major life activity,'' like walking or seeing. It covers recovering drug abusers and alcoholics, but not a host of other emotional disorders like kleptomania, compulsive gambling or pyromania.
For the first time people who have acquired immune deficiency syndrome or are infected with the AIDS virus will be granted Federal protection against discrimination in housing or employment.
''It's wonderful,'' said Dr. June Osborn, dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health and chairman of the President's Commission on AIDS. ''It's a necessary first step to allow people to satisfy their own personal concerns and seek to know where they stand without fear of discrimination.''
The disabilities bill would require that within two years, businesses would be forbidden to refuse to hire a disabled applicant. And companies would have to make a ''reasonable accommodation'' to permit the worker to do the job. Employers would be exempted from this requirement if they can show that meeting it would place an ''undue hardship'' on the business.
Thirty days after enactment of the law, operators of railroads, intercity and intracity bus lines, mass transit or light rail system and public school bus companies would have to insure that all new vehicles they buy are accessible to people with physical disabilities, including those in wheelchairs. Within five years of enactment, all trains and subways would have to have at least one car that is accessible.
Public mass transit systems would have to provide alternative transportion for people unable to board buses or subways. In addition, within three years ''key'' subway and light rail stations must be made accessible to the disabled. In New York City, that will affect 54 of the 469 subway stations.
The legislation also says people with disabilities cannot be denied service at commercial establishments like office buildings, hotels, theaters, supermarkets, dry cleaners, doctors' offices, zoos, amusement parks and bowling alleys. Existing businesses would have to be made accessible, unless that would create ''an undue burden.'' All new public and commercial buildings would have to be accessible.

HEADLINE: Chinese Dissident to Study in U.S. (and to Speak Out)

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, England, July 13

 BODY:
Fang Lizhi, China's most prominent dissident, said today that he planned to study in the United States for at least six months beginning in January. He also said that while he was there he would meet with exiled Chinese dissidents and speak out against his country's Government.
In an interview, Mr. Fang, an astrophysicist, said he might make the United States his permanent place of exile. He was allowed to leave China last month with his wife, Li Shuxian, more than a year after taking refuge in the United States Embassy in Beijing during the violent crackdown on dissent.
Mr. Fang's intentions seem likely to cause concern among the hard-liners in Beijing and could prove an irritant in relations between Beijing and Washington, but they do not appear directly to break any known elements of the agreement between the countries that allowed him and Miss Li to go free. 
 
Face-Saving Measure
Although they were initially released to Britain, apparently as a face-saving response to Chinese concerns that Mr. Fang not go to the United States, there is no known agreement that prevents them from moving later on.
And while Beijing might regard Mr. Fang's speaking out against the Government as a breach of his pledge not to conduct ''anti-China'' activities while in exile, Mr. Fang was careful not to rule out criticism of the Chinese Government, as opposed to criticism of the nation itself.
In the wide-ranging interview, Mr. Fang, whose full name is pronounced fahng lee-jur (rhyming with burr), gave details of negotiations involving the United States Embassy in Beijing and the Chinese authorities that led to exile for him and his wife, who is also a physicist and a prominent dissident.
He said the authorities had asked him to agree not to participate in activities against the Government and to admit that he was a criminal. He said he had refused on both counts but agreed to other terms, including a demand that he say he was going abroad for medical treatment. Mr. Fang, who spoke in English throughout the interview, called that professed reason ''diplomat's language'' and said nothing was wrong with his health.
 
Urges Sanctions Against Beijing
Appearing relaxed and cheerful at his office at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy, Mr. Fang also touched on the state of the democracy movement in China, the need he saw for continued economic sanctions against the country and the role the Bush Administration could play in bringing about change.
Mr. Fang, who is here doing research into the structure of the universe, said that the Chinese authorities had allowed one of his sons, who had remained behind when the couple left, to travel to Britain a week ago and that the family, including a second son, had now been reunited.
Mr. Fang, 54 years old, said he had accepted an invitation from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. - an independent institute that grants fellowships for research in various fields - and would conduct research there for at least six months.
Mr. Fang was asked whether he would meet Chinese dissident leaders while in the United States, where he would have a broader platform for his views. He said, ''I think so.'' Asked whether he would speak out, he replied, ''Yes, I think so.'' But he said that whether he would be willing to serve as the leader of exiled dissidents would ''depend on the situation.''
Mr. Fang said he might make his home in exile in the United States because it ''is very large and very easy to spend a longer time'' there than in Britain. He said he would visit various parts of the United States and had already received invitations from universities and institutes in California, Chicago, Colorado and New York.
 
Chose to Go to Britain
He said the Chinese authorities, for reasons that were unclear to him, had not wanted the United States to be his first stop after leaving Beijing. He said he had told the authorities he was willing to go to any developed country, and ultimately chose Britain, where he conducted research in 1979.
Mr. Fang and Miss Li flew to exile in Britain on June 25 after having been in the United States Embassy in Beijing since June 5, 1989. They took refuge in the embassy the day after the Communist leaders sent troops into Tianamen Square and after pro-Government demonstrators burned Mr. Fang in effigy.
Mr. Fang said he believed that the Government had allowed him to leave largely because it was feeling the pressure of economic sanctions. But the authorities also wanted to improve their image, he said, because ''intellectuals don't believe them and students don't like them.''
He said Western governments should relax sanctions against China only when it freed imprisoned dissidents and returned human rights to its citizens. He called on President Bush, whom he said he hoped to meet in the United States, to demand that pro-democracy demonstrators be released, adding that only about two student leaders had been freed.
He said Mr. Bush could not have acted to prevent the killings near Tiananmen Square because by that time, ''the Chinese Government had already become illogical.'' But he said a stronger response from the Bush Administration in the aftermath could have lessened the number of people who were detained or killed. He said at least 1,000 people were still in jail and gave 700 as the ''lower limit'' of the number of people who died when the Government sent troops and tanks into the square to crush the student-led demonstrations.
 
Long-Term Optimism
Mr. Fang said that world trends made him optimistic that democracy would be achieved in China but that ''we'll be waiting until the old generation'' of leadership is gone. He said it was difficult to determine which of the country's current leaders would become ''China's Gorbachev,'' because the autocratic system made it difficult for them to reveal ''what is really in their minds.''
For the first couple of weeks of their stay in the embassy, Mr. Fang said, he and his wife feared that the authorities would come and take them away, ''because there were still shots'' being fired.
''After the first two weeks were gone,'' he said, ''I know we are safe. They can't get in there. Even in that time, many sons and daughters of Chinese leaders applied for visas for the States. I know if they apply for visas for the States, I'm very safe.''
 
Life in the Embassy
Mr. Fang said he had spent most of his time in the embassy doing research and writing five scientific papers. Life was ''very confined'' for him and Miss Li, he said, because for security reasons, only Ambassador James R. Lilley and a few staff members were allowed to approach them. He said his wife taught two nurses how to cook Chinese food.
Mr. Fang said he would go back to China if the Government guaranteed ''all my rights as a citizen.''
He said he still kept his Chinese passport and would never apply for political asylum. ''In our Constitution, citizens have many rights, including freedom of speech,'' he said. ''If they will guarantee that, I will go back.''
 
WOULD BE WELCOME IN U.S.
WASHINGTON, July 13 - A senior State Department official said today that Mr. Fang would be welcome in the United States. Any plans he might have for a prolonged stay, the official said, would not contradict the terms of the agreement reached with Beijing.

HEADLINE: Viola Is Erratic and Reds Prove Exploitive

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, July 13

 BODY:
From the season's start, Frank Viola has insisted that he doesn't focus on his statistics, being, among other things, suspicious that he might get dizzy from any high opinion of himself that might result. Tonight, his numbers weren't anything to get dizzy about.
''The wheels kind of fell off,'' Bud Harrelson, the Mets' manager, said of his ace left-hander after the Mets lost here to the Cincinnati Reds, 4-2. The defeat put the Mets two games out of first in the National League East behind the Pittsburgh Pirates, who beat the San Diego Padres. 
Viola left the clubhouse without comment. His teammates were left to digest and decipher the numbers: five innings pitched, nine hits, three walks and a wildly expensive wild pitch.
 
A Slump of Sorts
''He was a little different out there tonight,'' Howard Johnson said of Viola. ''He let things bother him more than usual.''
One result was the Mets' first real discomfort in more than a month. The team, which had won 18 of its last 20 games by late Thursday, has lost two in a row for the first time since June 3.
''In that, we've done something I thought we wouldn't do the rest of the year,'' Harrelson said. ''I'd call it a mini-slump.''
If it is a mini-slump, it is one born of maximum frustration at the left hands of Tom Browning and Randy Myers. Browning, his efficient effort blemished only by Darryl Strawberry's home run in the seventh, Strawberry's 23d homer of the season, and Dave Magadan's run-scoring single in the eighth, had a perfect game through four innings, working fast and fearlessly.
 
Teufel Blames Anxiety
''We were all just too anxious, too aggressive,'' said Tim Teufel, who spoiled one threat by being thrown out trying to stretch a single into a double in the sixth. ''Especially against a guy who keeps things in rapid motion.''
Myers, who entered in the eighth, gained his 19th save, setting down five of the six Mets he faced with intimidating economy.
''They know what's coming,'' Myers said of his former teammates. ''I just try and keep them honest.''
Viola, en route to his briefest night's work since May 24, had thrown only half a dozen pitches before it was clear that he had left most of his magic in the dugout. He did manage a couple of tricks to escape self-created trouble in the opening innings, but was given the hook after the fifth.
Through three innings, Viola permitted six base runners, five of whom reached scoring position. But matters became unsightly in the fifth. Glenn Braggs singled to start the inning. One out later, Todd Benzinger singled, then Mariano Duncan doubled off the wall in right to score one run. Joe Oliver's groundout scored another, then Viola's ground-ball wild pitch to home plate scored a third.
 
DARLING'S UNHAPPINESS CONTINUES
 Ron Darling, upset over what he considered his premature exit in the nightcap of Thursday night's doubleheader here, expressed yet again his unhappiness and confusion over his current situation. Darling, the current Mets starter-in-residence in the bullpen, said he no longer had faith in what he was told by the club about his status.
''I don't put a whole lot of merit in what I hear,'' said Darling, who was taken out for a pinch-hitter after four innings in a game the Mets lost, 3-2. ''The Mets are a conservative outfit. They'll do with me what they want, when they want. But I don't think they know yet what they want to do with me. It's pretty obvious there are guys on this team they'd like to trade, and they can't pull the trigger. How are they going to pull the trigger on me?''

HEADLINE: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
Still Excluded After All These Years

BYLINE: By Malcolm Moran

DATELINE: TEANECK, N.J.

 BODY:
Twenty summers after his book ''Ball Four'' was supposed to have destroyed the game of baseball as we know it, the leading pitcher of the Little Ferry Giants of the New Jersey Metropolitan League sat in his office and thought about his distinction in the history of the New York Yankees.
The Yankees are having another Old-Timers Day today, and Jim Bouton is not invited. This is neither a bulletin nor a surprise. It is his tradition. Bouton, the Bulldog back in the early 1960's when his cap kept flying off, when flattop crew cuts were in and the concept of a dynasty still applied in the Bronx, may well be the most accomplished pitcher in Yankee history to become a nonperson on a day that glorifies what little sense of majesty the organization has left. 
Which makes him smile. ''I think it's terrific,'' Bouton said. ''It almost confirms 'Ball Four.' Talk about small thinking. This is it, folks. It tells more about baseball than anything. Twenty years? What kind of crime did I commit?'' What he did was violate the order that appeared on some clubhouse walls, but was imposed throughout the major leagues: ''What you say here, what you see here, what you do here and what you hear here, let it stay here.''
When Bouton took note of the laughs inside the game, plus the joys, the hypocrisy, the back-of-the-bus silliness, the pettiness and togetherness, the alternating feelings of achievement and worthlessness, and the unfairness near the end of baseball's economic dark ages, the paying customers were finally able to learn the truth.
But as the years have passed, we have discovered that Bouton accomplished more than that. Nearly five years ago, on that emotional early September night when the Mets met the Cardinals at the beginning of a stretch run, Keith Hernandez stood just outside a batter's box and listened to 30 noisy seconds of emotional support. He had just testified at the drug trials in Pittsburgh, placing the torture of his cocaine use on the public record.
And as Hernandez spoke that night in Flushing, the extent of the book's influence became clear.
''If this had happened 15 years ago, it would have been different,'' he said of the crowd's response to his situation. ''Now people know that athletes make mistakes, athletes are human, too.
If that book accomplished anything, it broke down the facade of athletes as idols.''
It was not merely the words Hernandez chose late that night, but the matter-of-fact tone, the acceptance of an intelligent veteran, that suggested that ''Ball Four'' had become part of the fabric of the game.
Decades of mythology, too often perpetuated by the press, had at last been replaced by some understanding of the people that millions pay to see.
Years after Bouton was criticized for wondering how good Mickey Mantle might have been if he didn't drink so much and so often, Mantle often publicly wondered the same thing.
Seventeen years after the book, co-written with Leonard Shecter, addressed the racial inequities in the business of baseball, the ''Nightline'' blunder of Al Campanis on live network television finally forced the sport to acknowledge a problem. In the era of the million-dollar utility infielder, the 20th anniversary edition of the book reminds us of the days, not that long ago, when management would do its best to strongarm some kid out of an extra $500.
And if ''Ball Four'' has been confirmed in terms of management's tactics, it has also shown the consistency in one slim 51-year-old right-hander's outlook toward the game.
Bouton was away for nearly five years, dealing with the fallout from a divorce, when he was driving by a field with his wife, Paula Kurman, five years ago. ''I said, 'Would you mind if I just stop here and watch a couple of pitches?''' he remembered. ''I wanted to see this kid's motion. So we both sat in the car watching a couple of pitches.
''And she said, 'Do you miss it?' I said, 'I don't know.' She said, 'Why don't you ask if you could work out with them?' ''
Five years later, when not delivering motivational speeches or heading a company that invents and markets sports-related items, he has a record of 5-2 for a team that has won 10 of 18 games in a league of former major and minor leaguers plus undrafted college players. He was approached last year by a team in the Senior Professional League in Florida, but quickly rejected that idea as far too serious.
But Bouton has confirmed the thought he recorded 20 years ago, after the end of his 1969 season with the Seattle Pilots, the minor league Vancouver Mounties, and the Houston Astros: ''You see, you spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.''
He smiles and says he would rather have the distinction of being uninvited to Old-Timers Day than be announced as the reason Mickey Mantle decided to stay away. But now that flattops are back, in the summer that Nelson Mandela made it to Yankee Stadium, it would be nice to see the Bulldog lose his cap just one more time.

HEADLINE: Strong Increase of 0.5% Shown in Retail Sales

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Helped by strong department store sales, overall retail sales rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month, the Government reported today. It was the first increase since January.
Retail sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $147.82 billion in June, up $784 million from the May level, the Commerce Department said. 
''It's a welcome sign for a beleaguered sector of the economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. ''It offers a good deal of hope that the economy will keep on expanding.''
 
Three Months of Declines
But analysts also cautioned against reading too much into the sales turnaround. They noted that the June increase followed three months of declines - the first such period of sustained weakness since 1981. ''The question is whether it's a one-time reversal of a string of weakness or the start of something new,'' Mr. Sinai said.
Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity, prolonged weakness in retail sales raises fears that the economy could be headed for a downturn.
Analysts said the upturn in June retail sales was probably due, in part, to consumers who had delayed making purchases in April and May. They noted that cool May temperatures probably resulted in a delay of purchases of summer clothing, air-conditioners and other seasonal items. Those purchases were likely made in June, when the weather warmed up, the analysts said.
David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill called the June increase ''just a rebound from the softness we saw in May.''
''We're up only 2.4 percent from a year ago,'' he said. ''That's not even keeping up with inflation.''
Americans continue to show signs that they are cautious about their spending, said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
''The consumer did not turn tail in the spring, but nonetheless is behaving in a rather restrained way,'' Mr. Dederick said.
The June increase of five-tenths of 1 percent was the first rise in retail sales since January, when sales rose 2.8 percent. Retail sales showed no change in February, fell four-tenths of 1 percent in March, 1 percent in April and six-tenths in May.
The overall gain stemmed partly from spending at department stores, which rose 2.8 percent, reflecting a rebound after a drop of 2.2 percent in May. Department store sales had fallen for three months, and analysts said the June increase resulted from price cuts intended to encourage purchases of summer clothes.
Auto sales edged up a tiny one-tenth of 1 percent in June after being down two-tenths in May. Weak auto sales have contributed to the overall sluggishness of consumer spending this year.
Sales at building material and hardware stores rose 1.3 percent after falling two-tenths of 1 percent in April.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises in U.S. Trading After Declining in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose in the United States yesterday in volatile, heavy trading after falling in Europe.
The American currency - after declining on Thursday on comments by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that the Fed might ease interest rates - changed direction yesterday. It rose in domestic trading in a seesaw session. 
The dollar tumbled after Mr. Greenspan's remarks because lower rates reduce the returns on dollar-denominated investments, thus sending investors to other currencies.
Traders said the dollar rose yesterday after the Government reported that wholesale prices climbed by two-tenths of a percent in June, indicating low inflation.
But the currency then slipped after the Fed added money to the banking system. That has the effect of lowering interest rates, and some of the traders interpreted it as a follow-up to the Fed chairman's comments.
The Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans, moved lower, which has a negative influence on the dollar.
But the dollar soon climbed again, partly because European traders were buying dollars to shore up their positions as the markets there closed, said Francoise Soares-Kemp, a vice president in the foreign exchange department of Credit Suisse in New York.
The currency was also strengthened by the traders, who believed the dollar had reached its bottom and were buying them to cover short trading positions, the traders said.
Against the Japanese currency, one dollar bought 148.15 yen in New York trading, up from 147.40 yen late on Thursday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar fell to its lowest level since Feb. 22, closing at 147.42 yen, down 1.48 yen from Thursday. Later in London, the dollar firmed to 147.50 yen.
The dollar jumped against the West German currency, to 1.6510 marks, up from 1.6355.
In London, the British pound traded at $1.8020, up from $1.7995 late on Thursday. But in New York, a pound cost $1.8005, cheaper than $1.8130 late on Thursday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Climb Sharply; Grain and Soybeans Also Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of gold futures rallied strongly yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York, but some analysts wondered whether the market would sustain the gains, which were prompted in part by a decline in interest rates.
On other commodity markets, silver also rose; petroleum futures were mixed; grains and soybeans advanced, and livestock and meat futures rose.
Gold futures settled $6.20 to $6.70 higher in New York. The contract for delivery in August was at $365.70 an ounce, its highest settlement price since May 31. The expiring July contract was up $6.30, to $364.40. 
Silver futures ended 1.7 cents to 1.8 cents higher, with the July contract at $4.908 an ounce.
The rally in gold extended the $3.90 gain posted on Thursday after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, indicated that the Fed was ready to ease credit, if necessary. Interest rates fell sharply on the news, and gold, which is considered a hedge against inflation, rose.
Analysts agreed that lower interest rates could create a friendlier atmosphere for gold. Craig Sloane, a metals analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said the upward swing of gold on Thursday could be seen as a sign that the market had ended its recent decline.
But Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said other conditions did not appear right for gold to sustain the rally. Gains in the stock market, like those of Thursday and Friday, are typically bearish signals for gold, he said.
 
Bargain Hunting Seen
Mr. Savaiko said the two-day run-up in gold prices might simply have represented the squaring of books before the expiration of the August gold options contract on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and bottom-picking by investors when gold fell to near $350 an ounce on Thursday.
Crude oil futures ended mixed in a volatile session dominated by bullish news of unity by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on measures to restrict production and raise prices.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents lower to 17 cents higher, with August at $18.36 a barrel; heating oil was 0.78 cent to 1.85 cents higher, with August at 54.21 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.43 cent to 1.38 cents higher, with August at 61.95 cents a pound.
Prices of crop futures ended higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after the Agriculture Department reported that the agency had lowered its projections for winter wheat production and corn and soybean stockpiles.
But gains were limited by expectations that beneficial weather would continue as the corn crop enters its critical pollination phase.
Cattle futures rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in line with stronger cash markets.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Rose 2.5% in Early July

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 13

 BODY:
Helped by strong demand for light trucks from General Motors and Ford, sales of American-built vehicles rose 2.5 percent in early July, the industry's second consecutive 10-day period of healthy sales gains.
Over all, sales of domestically produced cars rose six-tenths of a percent in early July. G.M., Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi and Toyota all reported higher sales, while Chrysler and Nissan showed sharp declines, and Ford's sales were marginally lower.
Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.3 million, lagging behind the 7.4 million rate for the comparable period a year earlier. The number of selling days was the same in both years. The selling rate for the last 30 days was 7.3 million; for the last 60 days, cars sold at a rate of 6.9 million. 
 
Trucks and Vans Up
Sales of pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles, which account for roughly a third of all vehicles sold, rose 5.6 percent in early July, compared with a year ago.
''This was a surprise,'' said Scott Merlis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, ''because rebates have been coming down, prices just went up, and sales were higher than we had anticipated in June: three reasons for lower sales in early July.''
Mr. Merlis noted that inventories of unsold cars and trucks had fallen to the lowest level in five years.
''People could be waiting in line to buy a car this summer,'' he said, ''which would be ironic compared to the fire sales that were held a year ago to move unsold vehicles near the end of the model year.''
Sales by the ''transplant'' auto makers - the Japanese companies that build cars in the United States -increased 35.2 percent. The Big Three domestic makers reported a collective decline of 2.3 percent, most of it from Chrysler.
 
Problem Area for Chrysler
Indeed, the gains posted by G.M. and Ford in light-truck sales appeared to be at the expense of Chrysler, which reported a 13.9 percent drop in sales of light trucks. That category includes Chrysler's mini-vans, which have new rivals in G.M.'s plastic-bodied mini-vans. Those appear to have caught on with buyers after slow initial sales in the spring.
In addition, Ford's new four-door Explorer sport-utility vehicle is challenging Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee, which has dominated the market for the hybrid between pickup trucks and station wagons, but must now contend with new four-door rivals from several auto makers.
''Chrysler faces substantially increased competition from here on, in both mini-vans and Jeeps,'' said Philip Fricke, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.
G.M.'s car sales rose eight-tenths of a percent, led by gains for the Geo line of compact cars, which are manufactured by Isuzu and the G.M.-Toyota joint venture in Fremont, Calif.
 
Aided by a Movie
Sales of the Chevrolet Lumina also surged. The car is featured in the movie ''Days of Thunder,'' and many Chevrolet dealers have held special promotions to take advantage of the film's release.
''There's no question that the movie is helping sales,'' a Chevrolet spokesman said.
Other G.M. models that sold well in early July included the redesigned Chevrolet Caprice, Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile 98, and Cadillac Seville. Sales of the Seville rose more than fourfold.
G.M.'s light-truck sales increased 18.2 percent, led by two mini-vans, the Chevrolet Lumina APV and the Oldsmobile Silhouette APV.
Ford's 6.1 percent gain in light-truck sales came almost entirely from the new Explorer and the Bronco II sport-utility vehicle.
Sales of cars made by Ford fell four-tenths of a percent. Sales of the Escort remained sluggish, lagging behind last year's by 28 percent, despite an extensive marketing campaign for the redesigned small car. Sales of Escorts and Ford's subcompact, the Festiva, are essential in helping the company meet Federal fuel economy standards for its total product line.
Chrysler's car sales fell 18.8 percent, as customers failed to respond to an aggressive advertising campaign featuring Lee A. Iacocca, the company chairman. Sales of Chrysler's light trucks and mini-vans were also down, by 13.9 percent. Some analysts suggested that buyers might be waiting for Chrysler's new mini-vans, due out this fall.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Up Modest 0.2%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
In a mixed reading on inflation, the Labor Department reported today that prices at the producer level rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in June but would have climbed much more without continued declines for energy and food.
Excluding those two volatile components, the Producer Price Index jumped six-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest increase since June 1989, with passenger cars and tobacco products showing substantial increases.
Although the rise in the so-called core figure was higher than most analysts had expected, the widespread view was it was unlikely to be sustained and that inflation remained essentially under control.
 
Expectations Fulfilled
But they also said that the inflation data today seemed to underscore the concern expressed to Congress on Thursday by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, that overcaution by bankers in making loans was putting the economic expansion at risk. Today, the Fed took steps that pushed down a key money-market interest rate, thereby quickly fulfilling expectations that Mr. Greenspan had raised. 
Since the Fed's chairman is believed to have known the June producer price figures before going to Capitol Hill on Thursday - and acted as he did to signal lower interest rates in spite of the six-tenths of 1 percent jump in the core rate - this supported the view that the Fed's policy had been readjusted.
''The Fed has definitely shifted direction and priorities,'' said John O. Wilson, chief economist for the Bank of America, adding that he thought Mr. Greenspan was interested in doing more than just offsetting the tightened credit terms being imposed by bankers. ''I think he's really worried about the economy,'' Mr. Wilson said.
But analysts at Salomon Brothers, who were less worried about the pace of the economy, expressed some anxiety at the Fed's decision to shift from its ''standing priority of paring inflation'' to address the different risk of shoring up the financial system and avoiding a credit squeeze. Easing policy ''may be benign in a sluggish economy but it does little to lower inflation expectations,'' these analysts wrote in their weekly ''Comments on Credit'' publication, which was published today.
 
Comment by White House
At the White House, the Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, called the modest rise in the overall price index ''excellent news,'' saying that ''declining inflation should continue to relieve pressure on interest rates.''
In a separate report, the Commerce Department disclosed that retail sales rose five-tenths of 1 percent in June following three straight declines. This rise provided some reassurance about the prospects for continued economic growth.
The rise of two-tenths of 1 percent in prices received by domestic producers for goods ready for sale to the final business or individual user followed an increase of three-tenths in May and declines of three-tenths in March and April.
Food prices declined moderately for the third time in four months, the Labor Department said, while energy prices dropped for the fifth straight month after soaring by nearly 14 percent in January.
Among items reversing direction were fish, pork, processed chickens and pasta, which fell in price, and eggs and fresh fruits and vegetables, which rose. Home heating oil fell 10.5 percent, even faster than May's 6.2 percent, but gasoline prices turned slightly higher. 3.1 Percent Rise in Year Over the last year, the index for finished goods has now climbed 3.1 percent, with the increase without food and energy a slightly higher 3.4 percent.
For the first half of 1990, the finished goods index rose at a 3.7 percent rate, down from 7.4 percent in the first half of 1989 but higher than the 2.6 percent inflation rate posted during the second half of 1989.
Two companion indexes, for prices of goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production, both posted declines last month, today's report showed.
 
Intermediate Goods Down
Intermediate goods, which are one step further removed from the ultimate user, such as a bag of flour or a bolt of cloth, edged down two-tenths of 1 percent with most categories showing little change. Excluding food and energy, the decline was one-tenth of 1 percent in June.
Over the last year, the inflation in intermediate goods was a negligible two-tenths of 1 percent. ''A lot of us in goods-producing industries find it hard to believe there's any inflation at all,'' said John D. Walter Jr., an economist at the Dow Corning Corporation, which makes silicones and related chemicals.
Prices of crude goods, such as wheat or raw cotton, fell 2.4 percent last month after virtually no change in May and declines averaging more than 2 percent in March and April. Disregarding food and energy, crude goods fell six-tenths of 1 percent last month.

HEADLINE: Sears Expects Steep Drop In Second-Quarter Profits

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 13

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company said today that it expects a sharp decline in second-quarter earnings because its Allstate Insurance group's catastrophe-related losses exceeded expectations and sales by the merchandise group were disappointing.
In a brief statement, Sears said second-quarter earnings from continuing operations were expected to be about 65 cents a share, down from 95 cents a share in the comparable period last year. Discontinued operations added 16 cents a share to earnings in the period last year, bringing actual net income for the quarter to $1.11 a share. 
Analysts had expected Sears to earn about 80 cents a share in this year's second quarter. They have for some time been revising their estimates downward, based on Sears's weak retail sales in recent months.
''We knew they would be lower, but the magnitude of decline was much greater than I had anticipated,'' said Richard Nelson, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. Mr. Nelson reduced his full year's estimate of earnings per share to $4.25, from $4.40. Last year Sears earned $4.30 a share.
Edward A. Weller, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, dropped his 1990 estimate to $3.90 from $4.05.
The price of a Sears share fell 37.5 cents today, to $34.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Sears said its retail operations had a 3.7 percent gain in sales for the five weeks ended July 7. Sales at stores open more than a year were up 3.5 percent.
A Sears spokesman declined to elaborate on today's announcement on the earnings outlook. Sears expects to announce its second-quarter results early in the week of July 23.
The recent fires in California account for Allstate's unexpectedly high losses. Ira H. Malis, an insurance analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore, said Allstate was particularly susceptible to losses from fires and other disasters because a high percentage of its business is insuring houses and cars. Mr. Malis said that most analysts had not lowered their estimates for the insurance industry over all because of the recent fires, floods and other natural disasters.
Analysts said that today's announcement was further evidence of how daunting a task Sears faced in its highly publicized effort to revive its retail business by cutting prices and emphasizing national appliance and electronic brands.
''The job they have is immensely complicated,'' Mr. Weller said. ''I don't think people worry about Allstate's ability to thrive in the same way that many of us worry about the merchandise group.''
Still, management has said for some time that profits from Sears stores will improve in the second half of the year, and the company stood by that claim today. ''We continue to expect a solid performance for the second half of the year based on our outlook for continued moderate growth in the economy,'' the chairman and chief executive, Edward A. Brennan, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Costly Proposals to Curb Asbestos Ignite New York City Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
Proposals aimed at reducing the threat of airborne asbestos in buildings have set off a furious debate in New York City, which already has some of the toughest asbestos regulations in the country.
Prominent in the debate are religious groups, along with many other property owners and businesses, all of them alarmed over the prospect of a law that would require them to pay millions of dollars for inspections, maintenance and possible removal of asbestos in their buildings.
The proposals, one of them submitted by Mayor David N. Dinkins, have also reignited a controversy over the medical dangers of chrysotile, the type of asbestos most commonly used in insulation and fireproofing.
On Thursday, a senior aide to John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, sparred with New York City Council members over the proposed legislation, saying it would impose ''a staggering economic burden'' that would force religious and nonprofit groups to slash social spending. 
But the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner, Albert F. Appleton, and a spokesman for the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, told the Council that the dangers of so-called in-place asbestos are real and that the proposed law was a prudent response to a public health problem of immense proportions.
Asbestos, a naturally occurring mineral, can cause cancer and scarring of the lungs if its microscopic fibers are inhaled, although the symptoms of asbestos-related diseases usually take a decade or more to appear. Scientists believe that the risk is tied to quantity of asbestos inhaled and the length of exposure.
The City Council exchanges this week came during a daylong hearing on two asbestos bills, the second of which was submitted by Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, a Queens Democrat.
The measures, whose mainly technical differences are being ironed out by the Council's Environmental Protection Committee, would require inspections of asbestos insulation and fireproofing in all public and private buildings in the city and the repair or removal of any that is damaged and apt to become airborne.
In a sense, the New York City proposals would extend the kind of inspections and abatement policies that the Federal Government already requires for public schools nationwide to all 800,000 of the city's public and private buildings.
The procedures, which would be performed by city-certified contractors, would be at owners' expense. Owners would also be responsible for regular maintenance and periodic reinspections. Specific guidelines for building inspections would be established by the Environmental Protection Commissioner. These could address such questions as whether air sampling would be used to augment visual inspections or whether an owner would be required to tear down a wall to examine asbestos.
But the Commissioner, Mr. Appleton, stressed in his testimony that the legislation ''does not mandate, and in fact actively discourages, the unnecessary removal of asbestos.''
Besides the Roman Catholic Church, which owns 2,000 buildings in New York City, the most vociferous critics of the legislation include many other property owners, including other religious and nonprofit groups, many large businesses, people with co-operative apartments, hospitals and former manufacturers of asbestos products.
A gradual ban on all new asbestos products was announced last year by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. But except in schools, there has been no Federal action on asbestos already in place. But beginning in 1985, New York City adopted strict procedures for minimizing exposure to asbestos at construction sites.
Under its new proposals, property holders like churches, owners of walkup apartments, stores and service stations would have 12 1/2 years to comply fully, while owners of apartment buildings with elevators, tall office buildings, hospitals and hotels would have 6 1/2 years.
Mr. Appleton estimated that 544,000 of the 800,000 public and private buildings in the city contain significant amounts of asbestos and that 87 percent of the asbestos is damaged.
The hearing this week at City Hall included a slide presentation by an asbestos-abatement consultant, Laurence B. Malloy of the Malloy Corporation, showing how the flaking of asbestos from insulation or fireproofing can spread the cancer-causing fibers into the air, even into food.
The proposed law ''is meant to help prevent a new cycle of illness and death,'' said Councilman Enoch H. Williams, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee, which heard from 15 witnesses on Thursday. They ranged from critics like Janet Fox, a spokeswoman for the Consolidated Edison Company, to supporters like Carol Steinsapir, an official of a worker advocacy group, the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health.
 
Shifting of Funds
Cardinal O'Connor's aide, Msgr. Henry Mansell, estimated that compliance would cost the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn $60 million to $120 million, plus $7 million annually for inspection and maintenance.
''If we have to put this kind of money into asbestos procedures, we will have to take it away from things like schools,'' AIDS programs and other forms of vital social assistance, Monsignor Mansell said.
Mr. Williams replied, ''Some of the problems that come about as a result of asbestos are just as bad as many of those problems, too, so we're going to have to achieve some balance here.''
The Monsignor, who is Chancellor of the Archdiocese, added that no insurance is available to property owners for asbestos abatement.

Not Just Mortar Holds Together Church's Stones

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Eddie Pizzaro grew up poor in Spanish Harlem. His father abused drugs, went to jail every so often and beat his precious mother in front of him. Out on the ragged streets, friend after friend seemed to fall inexorably into similar dismal traps.
Amazingly, Eddie did not. ''While everybody was in trouble, I was trying to build things,'' he explained. 
Build things. The other morning, Mr. Pizzaro, now 29 years old, strolled through the world's second-largest church, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, at 112th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, and pointed out things he had built. The round-cheeked high-school dropout paused at Poets' Corner to gaze at black slate stones he had cut in honor of Henry James and Emily Dickinson. (Each took two days' work.) He then indicated a time capsule in which he had scampishly ensconced his own name. In the adjacent stone yard, which he manages, Mr. Pizzaro pointed to a continuing project, a bust of Nelson Mandela.
This direct-speaking Puerto Rican with the giant smile regards all those as lesser works. His most important creations are human -the neighborhood needy to whom he teaches the ancient stonecutting skills that can add up to a ticket to a better life. His is an exquisite lesson: ''We're not all perfect, but we can do something perfect.''
Nothing is more transcendent than a cathedral, those awesome holy books writ of stone and glass sprinkled magically about this sorry planet like answered prayers. Generations are born and generations die before many cathedrals are finished.
People look so small in cathedrals.
 
The Cathedral of
St. John the Divine began to rise more than a century ago.
But construction ground to a halt for World War II because the armed forces needed iron and steel.
 
Then the Episcopal
Church was reluctant to resume work on a grand structure in such a poor neighborhood for fear they might appear insensitive to the needy.
The church found a novel way out of the conundrum by deciding to hire unemployed young residents of Morningside Heights, Harlem and Newark and teach them the dying trade of stonework. Master artisans were summoned from England. The venture has become so successful that it employs more than 60 people and has recently begun taking on outside work - some as far afield as a restoration of the Iowa State Capitol - and plowing profits back into the cathedral.
Not surprisingly, many recruits to the demanding craft fell by the wayside. But others are doing work that has won praise even from European experts. ''We're trying to build people as well as revive the craft,'' said Alan Bird, a third-generation carver from England. ''The stone is the binding.''
Mr. Pizzaro is a huge success story. He worked four years as an apprentice before winning the title of journeyman. A few years later he became a supervisor and was recently appointed stone-yard manager. In this role, how important is Mr. Pizzaro to the cathedral's construction?
''Eddie is this whole enterprise,'' Mr. Bird said.
Eddie Pizzaro grew up building things. Often working in abandoned buildings, he built scooters, go-carts and, he figures, as many as 30 bicycles from scratch. What intrigued him were numbers and dimensions. He said he was called ''master of the ruler'' by schoolmates.
Despite excelling at mathematics, Mr. Pizzaro dropped out of school in the 11th grade. He says it was the only way his sister and two brothers could remain in school. His mother was already stretched to the limit, working in a hat factory downtown and cooking nights in an uptown restaurant.
Mr. Pizzaro found a job restoring abandoned buildings. About that time, he went to the cathedral for his brother's graduation from junior high school. The gargoyles captivated him, and he could not help scratching one to see whether it was made of plaster. (Hardly.) He began applying for a job, ultimately being hired to operate a 52-inch saw.
Mr. Pizzaro threw himself into the 10-hour days he still works. And he learned things. For example, when you look at a massive hunk of Indiana sandstone you must visualize the completed form before making the smallest cut. And the artisan's attitude is everything. ''If you feel bad, your stone looks bad,'' he said.
The difficulty of the task is increased by problems some employees arrive with, like drugs. And the job can seem downright eternal. After a decade, one tower comprises 4,000 stones of a planned 11,000. The other has not begun.
In the background, a chiseler chipped methodically. Mr. Pizzaro acknowledged that he would never see the finished cathedral. ''My goal is to see the towers,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Clemson to Establish M.B.A. Program in Moscow

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CLEMSON, S.C., July 14

 BODY:
Students in the Soviet Union will be able to earn a degree that epitomizes capitalism, a master's in business administration, under a program that Clemson University is setting up in Moscow, the university announced today.
Officials from the university and the Soviet Education Ministry plan to sign an agreement on Sunday calling for the school to develop the M.B.A. program.
''With the rapid changes both in the Soviet Union and Europe, they feel they need M.B.A.'s who understand U.S.-style management,'' said Ryan Amacher, dean of Clemson's College of Commerce and Industry. 
''We're excited to be the initial degree-making institution,'' he said. ''In 10 years we'd like to have 500 Clemson M.B.A.'s in the Soviet Union.''
 
Classes in English
The program could begin as early as next year, Mr. Amacher said. The degree requirements would be the same as those of the M.B.A. program at Clemson, and all classes would be taught in English.
The agreement calls for a new group, the Consortium of Universities for International Business Studies, to develop, finance and operate the Institute for International Business Studies-Soviet Union. Clemson heads the group.
The consortium would provide faculty members for an M.B.A. program in Moscow and also offer non-degree managerial training through the institute in the Soviet Union.
In addition, it would encourage United States-Soviet trade and ease cultural and academic exchanges between the two countries.
 
International Financing
''This is just the opening of a door which could eventually lead to a number of educational and research partnerships with the Soviets,'' Mr. Amacher said.
An international business group based in Paris, Investment Services, will finance the program with money derived from business ventures in the Soviet Union.
The group wants U.S.-trained Soviet business leaders who can help with the expansion of trade between the Soviet Union and other countries, Mr. Amacher said.
Plans call for the M.B.A. program to begin no later than 1992, with some prerequisite courses offered in the fall of 1991. Faculty members would be selected by the consortium and would spend at least one semester in Moscow.
Most students would be able to complete the degree requirements in two years, Mr. Amacher said.
 
Rationale for Program
Clemson would benefit by having some of its professors and students travel to Moscow for classes, he said, but American students would make up no more than 20 percent of the program's enrollment.
Clemson organized the consortium after it became apparent that the university did not have enough faculty members to run the Moscow program alone without hurting the school at home, Mr. Amacher said.
The others in the consortium are Florida State University, the University of Georgia and Mississippi State University. They would also have a chance to send students and faculty members to Moscow and could also eventually offer degree programs, he said.

HEADLINE: With Time and Influence Evaporating, Aquino Finds Rivals All Around Her

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA

 BODY:
As her shaky six-year term winds down and her rivals maneuver for 1992 presidential elections, President Corazon C. Aquino is trying almost desperately to preserve some political leverage.
After the long, dictatorial rule of Ferdinand E. Marcos, Mrs. Aquino's humility and her pledge to serve only a single term were welcomed. But she has always presented herself as a reluctant leader, proud of her lack of political know-how, and this has set the stage for six coup attempts, a faltering economy and rampant corruption.
Increasingly, Filipinos express a desire for strong and decisive leadership of a kind that they clearly do not feel they have, and which they remember from the best years of the Marcos era. The main beneficiary of that desire has been Mrs. Aquino's estranged cousin, Eduardo Cojuangco Jr., a close ally of the late Mr. Marcos. 
As Mrs. Aquino and her advisers continue to try to pump some life into the last two years of her term, their chosen instrument is a new political organization called Kabisig, roughly translated as ''arm in arm.'' It is intended to be a citizens' lobby to press for legislation and change as well as an effort to reignite the waning popular support she once enjoyed. It is also intended to raise the possibility, still denied by Mrs. Aquino, that she may yet decide to run again.
 
A Land of Ambitious Politicians
The targets of Kabisig are the stagnant bureaucracy and the ambitious politicians, mostly in Congress, who are looking ahead to 1992. But these politicians say they are not terribly happy about being made scapegoats for Mrs. Aquino's own failures of leadership.
Both she and they feel betrayed, and yet for the sake of an even modestly functioning Philippines, they need one another.
Mrs. Aquino's main problem, some of her top aides admit, stems from her own limited sense of her job. Having installed democratic institutions, she does not seem to want to use them.
After the authoritarianism of Mr. Marcos, her style of democracy, in particular her respect for the separation of powers, is so rigid as to be unworkable even in the United States, they say, let alone in the feudalistic, crony-style politics of the Philippines. She is not a glad-hander; she does not flatter politicians' egos or make calls. Convinced of her own righteousness, aides, congressmen and diplomats say, she neglects the need to take advice or explain her decisions. She seems contemptuous of political horse-trading.
Ordinary Filipinos, who regard the maneuvering in Manila as childish or arcane, do notice the stagnation, however. They speak of corruption continuing on a broader, ''more democratic'' scale, of power outages and uncollected garbage, of bureaucratic and military abuses, of poverty undiminished and decisions unmade.
 
Everything Seems Worse
''I think Cory is O.K.,'' said Wilson Fernandez, a 35-year-old fisherman in the little village of Padre Burgos, on the remote Bondoc peninsula on Luzon island. ''But since Marcos, nothing has changed except for the worse.''
Mr. Fernandez notes that Filipinos like to complain, and reputable polls show they are increasingly disaffected with Mrs. Aquino. Since August, her approval rating has dropped 11 percentage points, to 48 percent.
More and more Filipinos seem to think they may find strong leadership in Mr. Cojuangco. He is known universally as Danding, and by his allies as ''Boss'' or the ''Americano,'' for his reputation for decisiveness, rapid action and loyalty.
Mr. Cojuangco profited considerably from the business opportunities Mr. Marcos provided him, for which he now faces numerous criminal and civil charges. Mrs. Aquino has accused Mr. Cojuangco of having had a role in the most recent coup attempt, in December, just after he re-entered the country clandestinely after four years of exile in the United States. Mr. Cojuangco has not been formally charged.
He is considered a more natural heir of the Marcos political legacy than the former President's widow, Imelda, still banned from the country and blamed by many for her husband's failings, or Vice President Salvador H. Laurel, whom Filipinos regard, however affectionately, as inept, or Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, considered cynical and devious.
In various newspaper straw polls, Defense Minister Fidel V. Ramos and former Immigration Commissioner Miriam Defensor Santiago are popular. Mr. Ramos has no party and is not an inspiring speaker, but may yet get Mrs. Aquino's backing. Ms. Santiago is a brash and noisy former judge who has created the image of a graft-buster, but is thought to have offended too many people to be a credible candidate.
 
Call for Action
Mr. Cojuangco has not publicly announced that he will run for President in 1992, but his friends are setting up a political party for him. The celebration of his 55th birthday on June 10, two days before Mrs. Aquino announced the formation of Kabisig, drew 10,000 followers, paid and unpaid, from all over the country.
''Let us bury the past and move on to a new beginning,'' Mr. Cojuangco said in a strongly political birthday address. ''With you by my side, how can we fail? Together, there is no goal we cannot reach.''
A senior Western diplomat said he took Mr. Cojuangco very seriously. ''He has a lot of money and a lot of contacts in the traditional 'patron' style, and he seems to symbolize the vigorous, decisive management Filipinos want,'' he said.
''It seems almost unbelievable that Danding should be gaining this way,'' he continued. ''But it's a mark of the frustration people feel that they would consider making someone President who played such a part in a discredited administration only a few years ago.''
This potential clash of cousins continues a long rivalry within the Cojuangco family. Mrs. Aquino and Mr. Cojuangco share the same great-grandfather, who emigrated from Fujian Province in China in the 1890's, became a Roman Catholic, hispanicized his name from Ko Hwan-ko to Cojuangco and called himself Jose. He rode the train from Manila to the end of the line in Tarlac Province, about 100 miles north of the capital, where he set about getting rich, first from trade and then land, and married into the elite.
 
Family Grudge
His oldest grandson and namesake was the father of Mrs. Aquino; another grandson fathered Mr. Cojuangco. Mrs. Aquino's father prospered; Mr. Cojuangco's father, it is said, resented that success and felt ill treated.
While Mrs. Aquino's late husband, Benigno, was governor of Tarlac in the 1960's, Mrs. Aquino's younger brother, Jose (Peping) Cojuangco Jr., ran for Congress against Danding, a member of Mr. Marcos's Nationalist Party. Peping won. When Mr. Marcos fled to the United States, Danding went with him, settling in Los Angeles.
Diplomats point out, however, that the Philippine political universe -which includes the military, the newly wealthy and populist politicians - has become too large to describe it merely as ''Cojuangco vs. Cojuangco.''
Even if Mrs. Aquino does not run again for the presidency, it is considered unlikely that her brother will. Peping Cojuangco is an influential congressman, but he is considered a backroom operator, unable to articulate a national agenda.
After December's failed coup, Mrs. Aquino asked Congress for emergency powers. But she used them so ''pedestrianly,'' and on issues of so little sweep or moment, that they made little difference, a Western diplomat said.
 
Politics Is Too Degrading
He said she proposes legislation and appointments to Congress but does not lobby for them, considering it degrading. Similarly, the effectiveness of Kabisig has been undercut by the fact that Mrs. Aquino announced the organization without first consulting the politicians who support her. This infuriated them.
''I don't think she understands the process very well,'' a Cabinet member said. ''People tell her that successful American Presidents, like Ronald Reagan, worked and flattered Congress, while the aloof ones, like Jimmy Carter, failed. But she finds it hard.''
Her administration is divided when she cannot afford it, he continued, when she still has an active threat from both the left and the right. She remains sandwiched between an active insurgency and a frustrated military, which is both her protector and her most immediate threat.
While the recent withdrawal of American Peace Corps volunteers and the kidnapping of one of them has brought new attention to the Communist insurgency, the rebels have in fact grown weaker, not stronger, diplomats say.
As for the military, the coup plotters continue to plot, with more attention paid to a group called the Young Officers Union.
Still, there is one major advantage to the more heated politics as the elections come closer: the prospect of political change is widely believed to make a coup attempt less likely. A Cabinet member, after making a similar comment, laughed and said, ''Actually, the only time we know we're not going to have a coup is when everyone expects one.''

HEADLINE: The French Seek Their Own 'Peace Dividend'

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 12

 BODY:
Having long pursued an independent military policy, the French Government is for the first time facing domestic pressure to reduce its arms spending in response to the changes sweeping the Warsaw Pact and NATO.
The immediate focus is on proposals to cut the 1991 military budget. But the debate is already touching on broader political issues, including France's status as one of Western Europe's strongest military powers and its complex relationship with Germany.
Reacting to the first signs of public interest in a possible ''peace dividend'' that would trim the Government deficit, the Economy Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, has proposed a cut of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion in the military budget for next year. The budget is about $40 billion. 
After the NATO summit meeting in London early this month sought to reassure Moscow of the alliance's friendly intentions, President Francois Mitterrand sent a message to Bonn noting that ''logic will require'' the withdrawal of 51,000 French troops stationed on German soil.
 
Resistance to Defense Cuts
Yet it is already apparent that even if only minor spending cuts are involved at this stage, any change in military strategy will be strongly resisted by much of France's political and military establishment, including sectors of Mr. Mitterrand's Socialist Party.
Unhappy that the military budget through 1993 was trimmed earlier this year, the Defense Minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, now wants a 4 percent increase in military spending next year. And any French troop withdrawal from Germany, he says, will not come before 1994 or 1995.
In defending a strong military, he has the support of the armed forces, the arms industry and the two main conservative parties. ''If France is a nation that counts in Europe and the world, it is due largely to its defense,'' said Pierre-Andre Wiltzer of the center-right Union for French Democracy.
Today, the very existence of a debate on the military is a novelty for France. Until now, successive governments enjoyed solid political and public backing for the independent policy established by de Gaulle when he withdrew French troops from NATO's integrated military command in 1966.
 
A Counterweight to Bonn
Over the last quarter-century, France has formally remained a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But no American or other foreign troops are on its soil and it controls its land, air and naval nuclear striking force.
With Britain, Western Europe's other nuclear power, France has also refused to join the United States and the Soviet Union in nuclear disarmament negotiations. More than Britain, though, it has viewed its military strength as an important political counterweight to West Germany's economic might.
But now, with the Warsaw Pact in ruins and NATO rethinking its strategic options, an independent military policy that for many years proved politically beneficial to France is suddenly threatening to isolate the country and even irritate relations with its neighbors.
At the 16-nation NATO summit meeting last week, Mr. Mitterrand was alone is opposing the alliance's new definition of nuclear arms as weapons of ''last resort,'' arguing that they should essentially be seen as deterrents to be used to prevent rather than to win wars.
 
Crumbling Domestic Consensus
And as part of the modernization of its nuclear forces, France is still formally committed to developing its new short-range nuclear missile, which cannot reach the Soviet Union, as well as a new generation of a air-launched nuclear missiles.
Nonetheless, as NATO commits itself to change, France is under increasing Western pressure to move closer to the alliance. There are also clear signs, even in recent public-opinion polls, that the traditional domestic consensus on military issues is beginning to break up.
''The Socialist Party is urging the Government to spend more on social welfare,'' a Western diplomat said. ''So the obvious place to take from is defense. France can't afford an independent defense policy for much longer. One way of saving money is to cooperate more with others.''

3 Sets of Proposals To Reduce Costs Win Cash Awards

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
Southern Methodist University has begun giving money to students and faculty and staff members whose proposals can help the school save money.
This year the winners of the 1990 Cary Maguire Productivity Award are Gregg Mader, the university's manager of copy centers, first place, for suggesting that several satellite photocopy centers around the campus be consolidated, saving the university an estimated $152,000; Dennis C. Kendall, a staff member in the physical plant, second place, for proposing the consolidation of air-conditioning and temperature-control shops, for a projected savings of $35,000, and, Robert Skinner, the central university librarian, and Dennis Bowers, a staff member in the dean's office of the Meadows School of the Arts, third place, for a plan to use microcomputers, instead of people, to conduct library instruction tours. Projected savings would come through eliminating one or two positions. 
 
Project Is Under Way
The university president, A. Kenneth Pye, said the administration would do everything it could to use the winning proposals.
The university has already begun the copy center consolidation, which is to be completed by July 1.
''With all the satellite centers, we had some people who were real busy, and some twiddling their thumbs,'' said Mr. Mader, explaining the inspiration for his copy center plan.
The productivity award, established in January by a trustee, Cary M. Maguire, provides $3,000, $2,000 and $1,000 for the best ideas for helping the university reduce costs. The three winners are picked by a seven-member committee composed of faculty and staff members.
Mr. Maguire said the judges look in particular at the cost-effectiveness of the proposal and the ease with which it can be put into practice. Thirty-one proposals were submitted to the awards contest this year.
 
Making Management Think
Mr. Maguire, president and chief executive officer of Maguire Oil Company in Dallas, said he created the award, which is similar to one he instituted at Maguire Oil several years ago, because S.M.U. cannot keep raising its tuition at a rate exceeding that of inflation. The university's fee for tuition, room and board for the 1990-91 academic year will be $13,752, up 9.5 percent from the year just ended, a typical increase over the last few years.
The university does not release information about its budget, though administrators acknowledge that there has been a deficit for several years.
Although Mr. Maguire donates the money to be used for the award, he has no say in which proposals win. But he noted that experience has shown that even rejected ideas can be instructive. ''It makes management think,'' he said. ''You have to give a reason why you would turn an idea down.''

New Graduates Prepare To Teach in Rural Areas

DATELINE: OXFORD, Miss.

 BODY:
Armed with honors, degrees and noble ambitions, 25 of the nation's brightest scholars are going to battle for better education in some of the neediest schools in this state's rural areas.
The first Mississippi Teacher Corps, comprising top students from 19 United States colleges and universities, will finish nine weeks of intensive teacher training at the University of Mississippi next month and go to work in the state's impoverished public schools. The program is for graduates in subjects other than education and is intended to relieve the critical shortage of teachers in Mississippi. Corps recruits study classroom management, advanced psychology, teaching techniques and curriculum planning and get hands-on training twice weekly in three northern Mississippi summer schools. 
This fall, in exchange for the summer of free courses and room and board, worth about $3,000, most of the recruits will move to rural Mississippi to work in junior and senior high schools desperate for teachers in subjects like science, mathematics and foreign languages. Others will fill vacancies in urban schools.
They will receive full certification as Mississippi teachers and will be obligated to teach for one year, each earning about $18,000.
 
'Help Other People'
''We don't have a lot of experience. But I think we'll make up for it in enthusiasm,'' said Karen Cajka, 24 years old, of Somers Point, N.J. Ms. Cajka, a 1988 graduate in English from the University of Pennsylvania, left her home near Atlantic City to live amid the cotton fields and poverty of Yazoo City, a town of 12,400 near the Mississippi Delta.
''I decided I wanted to see a different part of the country and help other people. Teaching was something I had always considered, but I wanted to teach kids where it was truly needed,'' Ms. Cajka said. Her goal in teaching is ''to break through the social, economic and political stratification'' she sees in Mississippi.
''It probably sounds like I'm this idealistic kid from the North who wants to solve all of Mississippi's problems. I know I can't do that. But even if one child is happy he had my class and it makes him want to learn more and get ahead, I'll feel like I've been successful,'' Ms. Cajka said.
The poorest state in the nation, Mississippi ranked lowest nationally in per-pupil expenditures for 1988-89. The state's average teacher pay, $22,579 in 1989-90, was about $7,000 less than the national average. In April, the Mississippi Legislature passed a $182 million comprehensive education bill but has yet to provide funds for it.
 
'Like the Peace Corps'
''We tell the recruits that Mississippi has the highest number of poor kids to educate in the nation and a history of poor performance,'' said Andrew Mullins, director of corps placement and special assistant to the state education superintendent. ''They see that as a challenge,'' he said. ''To the ones from outside the state, it's kind of like the Peace Corps,'' he said.
Michael Cox, 23, of La Conner, Wash., and a 1989 social studies graduate of Harvard, believes racial segregation of Mississippi schools -sanctioned until the mid-1960's - is partly to blame for the state's current education crisis. ''For the South to progress, its racial tensions have to ease. I hope I can be a part of that,'' Mr. Cox said. ''I came because of the blues, because of red beans and rice and Southern culture,'' said Jeffrey Seinfield, 22, a 1990 classics and anthropology graduate of Stanford University from Tacoma, Wash.
The Teacher Corps program evolved from an alternative certification policy that Mississippi adopted in 1982 to qualify more people to teach in its public schools.
 
Avenue of Public Service
The State Board of Education, institutions of higher learning and community and junior colleges are sponsoring the program using $78,400 in grants from four private foundations. Recruiting on college campuses by representatives of the trustees of the institutions for higher learning in Mississippi began his spring. More than 125 honor graduates, who had to write essays on why they wanted the positions, applied.
''We expect to see a lot of success stories - a lot of junior and high school students turned around because of this program,'' Mr. Mullins said.
For Celia Savitz, 23, of Boston, the Teacher Corps is an avenue of public service. Her 1990 degree, ''magna cum laude'' from Harvard, could have led her into international business. But instead she is pursuing ''a chance to make a difference in Mississippi,'' she said.
''I try not to be idealistic,'' said Ms. Savitz, a social studies major. ''The reality is I'll be working with kids with discipline problems, kids on different learning levels, kids who don't want to learn. I'll be a first-year teacher. They're going to know it. I'll be an outsider in every way possible.
''But I'm ready for the challenge,'' she added, breaking into a laugh. ''I hope. I'm scared.''

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Is Tonality Pie in the Sky Or Pie in the Face?

BYLINE: By DONAL HENAHAN

 BODY:
Nothing is harder to kill than a good myth. Beat on it with hard facts, and it will hardly notice. Chop off its head, and it will grow another one by nightfall. Nothing, it seems, can put an end to a myth but its replacement by another myth.
One of the accepted ideas of the 20th century has been that traditional tonality was dealt a mortal blow around World War I, probably in 1913 at the premiere of Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps.'' Subsequently, Schoenberg laid the poor bones to rest by developing the 12-tone method, which made all the notes of the chromatic scale democratically equal and therefore, as it turned out, inherently static. Several generations of avant-gardists have kept busy throwing dirt on tonality's coffin to make sure the ghost did not walk, but they neglected to drive a stake through the corpse's diatonic heart. 
In the dying years of our century, the revival of tonality, with its apparatus of cadences, modulations and tonal centers, has become, if not the dominant new myth, at least a remarkably vivid illusion. Even at concerts of new music, you are as likely to hear works that are recognizably tonal, if not necessarily consonant, as pieces constructed according to yesterday's atonal esthetics.
It is a commonplace of music criticism nowadays that the mathematical formalism and severity of post-Webern Serialism finally led younger composers to react violently in favor of more accessible music. Repetition, formerly anathema, is elevated to a place of honor. The angst of the New Viennese School is replaced by a creed of quietism derived from Oriental philosophies. The rigor and dissonance long associated with contemporary academic music is replaced by calculated blandness and nonlinear logic.
About two decades ago, upon first encountering what came to be called Minimalism in the works of composers like Philip Glass and Steve Reich, I developed a ''cream-pie theory'' to explain it. For many years, that is, listeners tired of the nouvelle-cuisine leanness favored by the most highly regarded academic composers had yearned for an occasional taste of dessert to balance the diet. The early Minimalists responded by hitting us in the face with the whole pie: unrelenting repetition of a few consonant chords at interminable lengths. The reaction produced the strange hybrids that merge childishly simple tonal formulas with monotonous pop rhythms and, in extreme form, the cotton candy known as New Age music.
So we have a new ruling myth, which encourages us to believe that the function of music is either to serve as a background for meditation or as an incitement at mass puberty rites. I have heard it argued, in effect, that this musical leveling-down adds up to a cultural earthquake whose impact on world culture will make the American, French and Russian revolutions seem mere twitches on the Richter scale. At very least, we are in the presence of a ''new Wagnerism,'' whatever that means.
All this remains to be demonstrated, but no one who has read much cultural history would rule out the possibility that the next turn or two of the wheel could bring a renascence comparable in impact to the Nuove Musiche reforms around 1600 that resulted in the accessible style of monody and the birth of opera. It is always necessary to believe that such a renewal is possible. What else would encourage anyone to sit through one more meandering post-Minimalist work but the hope of discovering how this myth of innocence and rebirth may be more artistically fruitful than the sterner one it replaced.
Speaking of musical myths, I was interested to see several old ones laid out for autopsy by Kirke Mechem, who participated in a symposium last fall at the national conference of the Central Opera Service. Mr. Mechem, a San Francisco composer whose first opera, ''Tartuffe,'' has been performed 100 times, therefore speaks out of some practical knowledge. In my digested version, here are his candidates for the trash bin and his comments.
 l. ''New music has never been understood in its own day.'' That notion was never true in the past and even in our own century does not stand up to inspection.
 2. ''It's the audience's fault if it doesn't like a new work that has been declared a masterpiece.'' Efforts to ''educate'' audiences about new works and their ''responsibility to the art of their times'' are wasted and counter-productive. It does no good to market new music as bad-tasting medicine that is good for you.
 3. ''Only ugly art can reflect the reality of our times.'' A conceit perpetrated by bad historians. Art can shine a light on the horrors of our times, but it must be more than a mirror. It is a puny art that cannot rise above its environment.
 4. ''Musical theater (in the Broadway sense) is the opera of our time.'' Even the best musicals rely so heavily on musical cliches and production formulas and aim at such a low level of musicality that most opera lovers consider musicals a different category, even when they enjoy them as light entertainment. Some concerned people in opera management want to believe that opera and musical theater are the same thing. Not true. Don't be deceived, you administrators, by the fact that there is a big audience for musicals and that you'd love to get those people into your opera house. There is an even bigger audience for rock music. The solution to the contemporary opera problem is not writing down to any audience; it is writing up to the audience you already have, an audience that is used to great music.
I especially like Mr. Mechem's approach to the music-theater issue and commend this challenge to the attention of our better opera houses: ''If I ever see a Broadway show that gets to me like 'Die Meistersinger,' 'Gotterdammerung,' 'Falstaff,' 'Otello,' 'Figaro,' 'Jenufa' or 'Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk' - that has . . . music of that beauty, power, scope and grace - then we'll talk about opera and musical theater being synonymous terms.''
Mr. Mechem's argument, of course, is defensible only on the grounds of musical discrimination and taste, not theory or economics. It goes against the cultural Zeitgeist, but that is the Zeitgeist's problem.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
How a Real-Life Drama Came to an Unhappy End

BYLINE: By HILARY DE VRIES; Hilary de Vries has written about culture for The Wall Street Journal and other publications.

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 BODY:
When the avant-garde theater director Anne Bogart and the Trinity Repertory Company came to the last act of their drama in May and parted company, it was more than a dispute over budget cuts. The fact that after less than a year the 38-year-old director and one of the nation's leading regional companies did not live happily ever after is an example of the challenge now confronting a number of the nation's not-for-profit theaters: how to secure the next generation of artistic directors while maintaining a faithful subscriber audience (the key to a sound operating budget) and at the same time allow for a new artistic vision.
Even before Ms. Bogart's appointment last fall, Trinity had been a troubled place, beset by controversies and a leadership vacuum that formed during the last two seasons when Adrian Hall, Trinity's founder and longtime artistic head, had also assumed the directorship of the Dallas Theater Center. Among the ranks of a new generation of young regional artistic directors assuming control of the nation's regional theaters, including Des McAnuff at the La Jolla Playhouse in California, Robert Falls at Chicago's Goodman Theater and Garland Wright at Minneapolis's Guthrie Theater, none was regarded as more of a harbinger of the future than the avant-garde Ms. Bogart. ''During the changeover of artistic leadership at a theater there are tough questions to be answered,'' said Robert Brustein, the artistic director of the American Repertory Theater, in Cambridge, Mass., the only other regional theater where Ms. Bogart had directed. ''It is very hard to say who the theater belongs to then - the artistic director, the board, the subscribers, the audience? And when the choice of successor is adventuresome, as in the case of Anne Bogart, the board must hang tough. Such a transition is always accompanied by anger on the part of the audience and a falling off in subscriptions.''
Indeed, the transition period is increasingly important to regional theaters, as several of them, including the Guthrie, the Dallas Theater Center and the Cleveland Playhouse, have experienced subscription declines and even financial difficulties during the changeover of artistic directors. A recent conference of regional theater heads included several panel discussions addressing just such challenges. However, the situation at Trinity Rep is regarded as one of the most extreme because of its financial problems and the abrupt departure of its artistic director after less than a year.
By the end of Ms. Bogart's first season as artistic director, the company faced one of the worst financial crises in its history - an escalating $1.5 million deficit, half of which predated Ms. Bogart's arrival. The theater's board opted for a 25 percent cut in the budget from $4.2 million to $3 million. Insisting that such retrenchment would mean broad cutbacks in personnel and production budgets, Ms. Bogart refused. It was a move the board took as her resignation. Richard Jenkins, a longtime company actor, director and protege of Adrian Hall, was appointed as artistic director for the 1990-91 season.
''Anne's season was artistically acclaimed, but not a box-office bonanza,'' said John Howland, chairman of the Trinity board since October. ''It seemed prudent that we take a fiscally responsible position. We all hoped Anne would work with us on that.''
Ms. Bogart, however, said she had planned the second season of her two-year contract (in which her first year's salary was set at about $75,000) with the original $4.2 million budget figure. ''If they had come to me at the beginning of the year and said, 'Look, this is the way it is,' I would have done things differently,'' she said. ''Instead, they wanted me to be the hatchet woman and I wouldn't. At the time I didn't know I was resigning.''
Ms. Bogart's departure - coming in the wake of a controversial and critically mixed season with marked declines in attendance - raises significant questions about the future of the prestigious but financially troubled 26-year-old company. So unsettled is the current situation that many actors and board members spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
Squeezed by falling revenues and escalating costs in a weakened New England economy, the theater had been forced recently to meet weekly operating expenses by borrowing against its $500,000 endowment fund, its $500,000 capital reserve fund and a $210,000 Mellon grant that had been earmarked for new play development over three years.
The theater has also restricted use of long-distance telephone service and obtained a 60-day extension from creditors. Mr. Jenkins, who two years ago refused the offer of the Trinity artistic directorship, says he accepted the one-year appointment now ''because I didn't want to see the theater where I had spent 20 years of my career go south.''
Mr. Jenkins and the board have already dismissed 31 artistic and administrative staff members, roughly one-quarter of the company - including the acting managing director and the marketing director. He has moved to restructure the theater's administration, replacing many of Ms. Bogart's assistants with former staff members and consultants employed during Mr. Hall's tenure. Mr. Jenkins has also invited Mr. Hall to return as a director, dropped Trinity's $255,000 two-year student training program from the budget, canceled the rest of the theater's summer season and announced a reworked 1990-91 season that will draw from a selection of plays, including such popular fare as ''Mr. Roberts'' and such small-cast dramas as Terrence McNally's ''Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune.''
In contrast, Ms. Bogart had been best known for her work in New York's avant-garde circles. Her inaugural season at Trinity Rep - an ambitious mix of classical and new work including plays by Gorky, Brecht, Shakespeare and Maria Irene Fornes, a contemporary American playwright - reflected European avant-garde influences and was an esthetic stretch for a theater and an audience used to Mr. Hall's socialist-populist theater. ''This is a very people- and actor-oriented theater,'' said Peter Gerety, a longtime Trinity company member. ''Anne is from a dance and movement orientation. There was a philosophic difference right from the beginning.'' (Two of Mr. Hall's acclaimed productions were his adaptation of Robert Penn Warren's political novel of the South, ''All the King's Men,'' and Franz Xaver Kroetz's domestic drama ''Mensch Meier.'') Audiences balked at such Bogart productions as a highly stylized ''Summer Folk'' by Maxim Gorky, a nontraditional ''Christmas Carol'' and a Brecht ''Baal'' that featured simulated homosexual activity. Subscriptions, already down by 30 percent from a peak of 18,000 two years ago, remained flat. Single-ticket sales were nearly 20 percent below the company's audience projections of 82 percent capacity - an ambitious figure for a theater that had not been three-quarters full for many years.
In addition, some of Ms. Bogart's administrative moves proved controversial. She dropped 10 actors from Trinity's 30-member troupe, including several longtime and well-liked company members, causing Mr. Hall to speak out publicly against her decisions. ''That was a wound that didn't heal,'' said one company actor who asked not to be identified.
Ms. Bogart prefers to work with a small handful of close associates and brought on board several administrative and artistic colleagues with little professional experience at regional theaters. When Timothy Langan, Trinity's longtime managing director, resigned this spring, ''there was a period of about four months when the theater was being run by people with literally no experience,'' said the actor William Damkhoeler, a company veteran.
Ms. Bogart, who will return to the American Repertory Theater in the fall to direct George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's ''Once in a Lifetime,'' acknowledged that several of her decisions had been challenging to both the company and the community. ''And when we lost Tim we were all neophytes making it up as we went along. But I don't think that's bad. I believe this institution needs radical restructuring, and I don't think one year is enough time to figure it out.''
Just before her resignation, Ms. Bogart had indicated a willingness to accommodate her critics. She had announced next year's season - a more user-friendly program peppered with such familiar classics as ''Hedda Gabler'' and such popular new plays as ''Driving Miss Daisy'' -with a pledge to ''do anything to put people in those seats.'' Yet when the final production of this season, the musical ''On the Town,'' opened in May to mixed reviews and poor ticket sales, Ms. Bogart's efforts were perceived as too little too late.
Several staff and board members said that the director had inherited a company with an acclaimed artistic tradition but a history of fiscal mismanagement and lack of direction from an inexperienced board. In 1979, the National Endowment for the Arts had to bail out the company with a special grant after the Internal Revenue Service sought $100,000 in back taxes from it. The early 1980's saw a rejuvenated Trinity. But by the mid-80's, when Mr. Hall was dividing his time between Providence and Dallas, the perception was that Trinity was a rudderless ship.
''This theater is a $3 million-a-year business that requires professional management,'' said one board member. ''For too long this company was a seat-of-the-pants operation.'' Today, Trinity remains one of the few regional theaters whose 30-member board has no minimum donation requirement and the average annual gift made by board members is less than $1,800 per person.
But several people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified say that Trinity's problems remain far from resolved. They add that despite Mr. Jenkins's standing within the community and the company, the theater is again being run by a small group of people with little administrative experience.
As for the future, there is widespread agreement among company actors and board members that even with subscription renewals running slightly ahead of last year's - ticket prices have been significantly reduced - next season remains crucial. ''Right now, the theater has no artistic mission except to woo back its audience,'' says another board member. ''And the board has gone back to being just a rubber stamp for another artistic director who has no experience.''
Mr. Jenkins disagrees. ''I didn't know Anne's people and I didn't have time to find out if I could work with them, so I brought back a lot of the people I worked with before,'' he said.
Mr. Howland says he is sanguine about the theater's future. ''During Anne's tenure the board was relatively uninvolved. Now we have our eyes open and we are trying to achieve a working partnership between the board and the artistic director to balance our artistic objective with fiscal stewardship.''

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
Museums Hear a Knock on the Door: Politics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Those who need further evidence that nowadays no manner of alchemy can separate the art world from the world of politics might consider the following incident, which illuminates what is becoming a quagmire for American museums.
On June 6, as organizers for Nelson Mandela's tour of the United States were still ironing out plans, Mayor Art Agnos of San Francisco presented what sounded very much like an ultimatum to the president of the board of trustees of that city's Fine Arts Museums. Mr. Mandela will not visit San Francisco, Mr. Agnos wrote in a letter, unless the museums get a different sponsor for an exhibition of Dutch 17th-century paintings scheduled to open next February.
''I would like to strongly encourage that the Fine Arts Museums find another sponsor or cancel the show,'' the Mayor wrote.
The Mayor had been told by Claude Everhart, a deputy mayor, that the show might cause Mr. Mandela to skip San Francisco. According to the Mayor's office, Mr. Everhart served on the executive committee of the Northern California Mandela Tour Coalition, which had urged the national Mandela tour committee to avoid San Francisco if a new sponsor for the show were not found. 
The decision by the tour organizers was to add Oakland but not San Francisco to the African leader's trip. The show was ''not the determining factor, but it definitely didn't help San Francisco,'' Madoda Hlatshwayo, assistant to the chief representative of the African National Congress in Washington, said last week. On June 14, at a public meeting that included many anti-apartheid protesters, the museum board was persuaded to pass a resolution seeking an alternative sponsor. The board did not say what it would do if no other sponsor were found.
Why would Nelson Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress, be concerned with the financial backing of an exhibition of 17th-century Dutch paintings that would not take place until months after his visit? Because the sponsor was Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, the Dutch parent company of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and Royal Dutch has a subsidiary in South Africa. Shell has been a target of protests by anti-apartheid groups in this country and elsewhere.
Museums may be among the last American public institutions to feel the impact of social changes that years ago swept through the offices of government officials and university presidents. As the Shell incident shows, accountability at museums now extends beyond the quality of exhibitions to encompass issues of divestiture and equal representation. In trying to deal with these new realities, museums come face to face with an even larger question, one they have not had to confront in such a public way: To whom, ultimately, do they feel responsible, not only artistically but also politically and morally? Finally, and perhaps most disturbingly, there looms in the Shell episode once again the matter of free speech and government involvement in cultural affairs.
Last year, employees of the Fine Arts Museums raised the first questions about the show with museum officials, and this spring they were joined by members of the United Mine Workers of America, the Northern California Chapter of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists and other protesters. Word of their concerns eventually reached representatives of the African National Congress in the United States, and in April Tebogo Mafole, a high-ranking A.N.C. official, accompanied members of anti-apartheid groups when they presented the case against Shell before the museum's board.
 
Conceiving Art In Political Terms
 That politics has become the order of the day in the art world, there can be no doubt. The controversy involving the National Endowment for the Arts has, of course, captured the most widespread public attention.
But within the art community an increasing number of politically charged debates have monopolized discussion - debates about the inclusion of women and members of minority groups in exhibitions and museum collections, for example, and debates about the interpretation of art among feminists, post-structuralists and Marxists, on the one hand, and more traditional art historians on the other. Perhaps not since the 1930's have so many American artists conceived of their work in such explicitly political terms, or at least received so much notice for that sort of work.
As for museums, they find themselves confronted with political and economic challenges that appear to demand contradictory solutions. In the 80's, art and money seemed to become inseparable. Astronomical auction prices only fueled the public's impression that art is a domain principally for the rich and powerful, and this image has certainly done no harm to the endowment's critics who argue that the art world is elitist to the point of decadence.
Worse, changes in the tax laws during the mid-80's, which discouraged donations to museums, have led these institutions to go to sometimes questionable lengths in courting private collectors by building elaborate annexes and emphasizing vanity exhibitions of these collectors' holdings. Recent, and sometimes disturbing, sales of valuable works from permanent collections further demonstrate how much pressure there now is on museums to raise money.
It is not simply the exorbitant price of acquiring certain art that has put museums at a disadvantage. Higher prices at auction lead to higher insurance costs for paintings, which in turn make it more expensive to organize the blockbuster exhibitions that have helped some museums avoid budget shortfalls. It may well be to everyone's benefit if the high price of blockbusters encourages museums to spend more energy on focused exhibitions drawn from their permanent collections instead of lavishing so much attention on traveling extravaganzas. But this is at best only a partial solution to an economic crunch that affects all facets of museum activity.
 
Relying on Corporate Help
 Especially because funds from the Federal Government have diminished over the last decade, museums have become even more dependent on the support of such corporations as Royal Dutch Petroleum, which can cover the estimated $500,000 tab for presenting the ''Great Dutch Paintings in America'' exhibition in San Francisco. The show, organized by the Royal Picture Gallery at The Hague, where it will be shown in the fall, includes some 70 works by such artists as Ruisdael, Vermeer, Hals and Rembrandt, and is accompanied by a 500-page catalogue.
It should go without saying that if the right wing succeeds in persuading Congress to cut the budget of the National Endowment, there may be even less government money available for elaborate exhibitions like ''Dutch Paintings,'' among other things, which would make museums even more reliant on corporate help.
In turn, and perhaps not surprisingly, corporations have been demanding greater prominence at museums by requesting, for instance, that their logos be displayed at the entrances to exhibitions and in advertisements for the shows. Shell's participation in the Dutch display was especially noticeable because the event was organized to celebrate that company's centenary.
 
Under Attack From Right and Left
 All of this comes at a time of heightened public scrutiny of corporate activity, and for museums, the resulting dilemma is obvious. Just when they are more than ever beholden to private collectors and what seems to be a diminishing pool of art-minded corporate sponsors, museums may now be facing the prospect of censure from groups like the anti-apartheid organizations in San Francisco. These organizations insist that the museums, as institutions serving the public and receiving public money, should be held as accountable for their actions as are public schools and government officials. In one sense, what these groups are doing is not all that different from what Shell and other corporations are doing: using museums as vehicles to advertise themselves.
The day may be over when museums and corporations can expect that philanthropic gestures will be accepted without question by a grateful public. And if so, it will be even harder for museums to entice private sponsorship at precisely the moment when their dependence on private support is greatest. After all, some of the most generous corporate sponsors of the arts in recent years have been targets of boycotts or protests, among them the cigarette maker Philip Morris.
Can Harry Parker, director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, now assure prospective corporate sponsors of the Dutch exhibition that they will not become targets of boycotts and protests? And should these companies take the risk? Museums, in other words, find themselves under attack from the political right and left, and not necessarily from people who attend art museums but from those who have come to see these institutions as symbols of what they consider undesirable activity. These people protest the sponsorship of an exhibition, but they may not be able to compensate for the financial loss when a museum rejects money from a corporation like Shell.
For Mr. Parker, the most encouraging aspect of the Shell incident is that a ''grass-roots, cross section of individuals,'' including anti-apartheid activists, has been trying to raise money for ''Dutch Paintings.''
''We have a responsibility to assist the museum to put the show on without Shell,'' said Geraldine Johnson, president of the Northern California Chapter of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists and an outspoken opponent of Shell's participation in the Dutch display. ''We're not trying to cancel the show or to deprive art lovers in the Bay Area of the chance to enjoy this exhibit.'' Ms. Johnson has been writing to labor leaders and others, asking for money.
As of a few days ago Local 790 of the Service Employees International Unions - which represents 150 employees of the museums and was a strong opponent of Shell's involvement - had pledged $2,000 toward the exhibition. Its offer has been supplemented by $53,000 pledged from individuals. Still, $55,000 is a long way from the $500,000 goal.
 
Little Choice But to Give In
 In the mid-80's San Franciscans approved a policy to withdraw city pension funds from companies that did business in South Africa. They also passed an ordinance against investing city money in goods or services from businesses active in South Africa. Last year the museum, responding to protests by its employees, asked the city's attorney to determine whether the show violated the ordinance; in November it received written assurance that the ordinance was ''not applicable to this exhibition.''
But last month Mr. Agnos asserted in his letter that ''the sponsorship of this show is, however, in conflict with the spirit'' of the ordinance. Approached last fall by Mr. Parker, the Mayor's office said it supported the idea of the exhibition. During the winter, however, representatives for the Mayor began to express to the museum their concern with the mounting protests about Shell's involvement. By June Mr. Agnos, further distressed at the suggestion that Mr. Mandela might skip San Francisco on his tour, persuaded the city's Board of Supervisors to pass a resolution opposing Shell's involvement. He then made public his own letter to the museum.
Coming at a time when Mr. Mandela was making direct pleas to the American people to maintain economic sanctions against his country, the Mayor's letter effectively left the museum - whose collection and building are city owned, and which is given free rent and public subsidies - with little choice but to accede.
 
Anti-Apartheid Or Anti-Art?
 For Mr. Parker it has been a source of some pain that his institution faces this dilemma at the same time that it has taken a strong public stand in support of the National Endowment. (For example, as a protest against assaults on free expression, the museum wrapped a shroud around the copy of Rodin's ''Thinker'' that stands outside its entrance.) The director points out a connection in terms of free speech, because just as religious fundamentalists and other conservative groups seek to hinder financing for exhibitions they deem morally unacceptable, anti-apartheid groups are effecting something similar with the Dutch show. The result in both instances is to threaten the public's ability to see art.
In any case, there is a narrow line between, on the one hand, Senator Jesse Helms impinging on the activities of museums and the content of artists' work, and, on the other, Mr. Agnos pressuring the San Francisco museum to find an alternative sponsor or cancel the Dutch exhibition. Senator Helms is taking the additional step of trying to enact restrictive legislation. But the involvement of Mr. Agnos and the Board of Supervisors, even if at one point solicited by the museum, raises many of the same troubling questions about government interference in museum practices and programs.
 
Money With Strings Attached
 What, then, are museums to do? Clearly, no simple solutions exist. Their endowments could be invested in companies that don't operate in South Africa, but financially strapped museums, which compete for a limited number of supporters, do not usually have the luxury of deciding among sponsors for exhibitions.
Still, museums may view the Shell incident as a warning that if they do not regulate themselves the government and special-interest groups may, in effect, regulate for them. This means that museums must confront the fact that the money they accept and the art they display both come with strings attached, and that they should be prepared to explain their actions in clear and simple terms that the public - not just the art community - can understand. What has been a largely closed-door process among museums could become part of a more informed public discourse about art and politics. ''We must realize that as institutions we are in politics and public affairs,'' Mr. Parker says. ''To think of ourselves in an ivory tower is a dated attitude.''

Savings and Loan Bailout, Soviet Style

BYLINE: By JAY G. BARIS; Jay G. Baris, a financial services lawyer, is of counsel to Spengler Carlson Gubar Brodsky & Frischling in New York.

 BODY:
Read my lips: No more savings and loan crisis.
With 1992 just around the corner, President Bush must quickly shed this albatross lest history remember him as the ''one-term savings and loan President.''
Fortunately, he need look only as far as the Soviet Union to solve this half-trillion-dollar problem. Beset by 75 years of Communism - with no private ownership of homes and few quality goods to purchase - the Soviet Union stands idly on the dock while Western ships of prosperity sail by. 
All the President has to do is invoke the law of supply and demand, and offer President Gorbachev the ultimate foreign aid package: America's savings and loan institutions.
Instantly, the Soviets would solve their most pressing economic need: they would inherit an infrastructure - including mortgages and credit cards - custom-designed to stimulate a sagging economy.
In return, the Soviets must agree to pay the tab. That is, they must take on the liability for the savings and loan cleanup. This could be accomplished by the creation of an R.T.C. - the Russian Trust Company.
The Soviets would be foolish to pass up this opportunity. Recall that America's savings and loans themselves were born out of necessity just a little more than 50 years ago. Savings and loans offered low-cost mortgages to encourage home ownership. Federally insured deposits guaranteed a steady low-cost source of funds and fostered savings too. And, by giving away toasters and credit cards they encouraged consumer spending.
The system worked superbly for many years, generating decades of economic prosperity. Only when a few greedy executives took advantage of deregulation and poor regulatory supervision, and stopped giving out the toasters, did it sour.
If they learn from America's mistakes, the Soviets need not worry about creating a savings and loan crisis of their own. For example, by discouraging Reaganesque deregulation, they would keep savings and loans from straying into the risky investments in ''junk bonds,'' art collections and ski lodges that brought down the American institutions. And strong police powers - traditionally a Soviet strength - would deter Russian savings and loans from criminal mischief.

Too Many Bosses, Too Few Workers

BYLINE: By RICHARD ROSENCRANCE; Richard Rosecrance, a professor of political science at the University of California at Los Angeles, is author of ''America's Economic Resurgence: A Bold New Strategy.''

 BODY:
Before Americans can celebrate the decline of Communism, we should ponder why a Japanese eighth grader typically knows more mathematics than an American with an M.B.A., and whether our own decline can be far behind the Soviet Union's. I believe we can avoid that fate, but we need to make a number of fundamental changes in business, government and education if we are to continue to prosper.
First, we must recognize that most of our organizations - public and private, military and economic - have too many chiefs and not enough Indians. We have embraced Max Weber's bureaucratic society with a vengeance, with overstaffed corporate headquarters in which specialization has been narrowed to a pinpoint. Committees proliferate, but the job does not get done. It is almost as if leading American businesses were run by a series of ganglia but not by a single brain. 
In all too many of our organizations, management specialties - not production and meeting the needs of the consumer - are the way to the top. More than half of the modern American corporation consists of workers uninvolved in operations or production work, an astounding fact. At the General Motors Corporation, 77.5 percent of the work force is white collar and salaried, while only 22.5 percent are hourly blue-collar workers. At Mobil Oil, 61.5 percent of the staff is white collar; at General Electric, 60 percent; at Dupont, 57.1 percent; at International Business Machines, 91.5 percent. (Because I.B.M. does much of its manufacturing overseas and most of its strategic planning at home, this is not surprising.) At Exxon, the figure is 43 percent; at Ford, 37 percent; at A.T.&T., 42 percent; at Chrysler, 44.4 percent. The ratio in typical corporations in Japan is about one-sixth of the American figure.
This tendency toward bureaucratization in modern American life is not confined to business; it also applies to our military and school districts. At the peak of our Vietnam effort only about 60,000 troops formed the maneuver battalions doing the actual fighting, but nearly 500,000 more military personnel supported this fighting. The number of America's most senior military officers - three-star officers, full generals and admirals - is now considerably greater than at the peak of World War II even though they have roughly one-sixth the number of combat forces to command.
In school districts the number of service and supervisory personnel has increased relative to the number of teachers. In Los Angeles, teachers make up only 50.6 percent of the total school district's employees; in New York, the figure is 46.3 percent; in Philadelphia, 47.6 percent, and in Denver, only 24 percent. In universities the number of administrative personnel has risen relative to the number of professors. In every area, there is a great surplus of captains over sergeants and lieutenants, and the result is a reduction in American productivity. America's manufacturing productivity now limps along at 1 percent per year, far less than historic figures of 2.5 or 3 percent.
Over time, corporate, government and educational bureaucracies must be ruthlessly pruned. The industry of the future needs fewer, but much more broadly trained executives. Workers should take on some management tasks. Many companies are already experimenting with self-managing work teams. Under one approach, 5 to 12 workers rotate jobs and take responsibility for an entire product or service with only limited supervision.
If the United States is to arrest its decline, two developments need to occur in the near future: first, American business will need to increase the ratio of operators to managerial staff, giving management a much wider purview; second, workers will increasingly come to fulfill a management function. In the more distant future, the distinction between white and blue collars may disappear.
But an increase in American white-collar productivity will not itself lead to economic resurgence. Corporate survival must become an objective beyond that of return to shareholders. Chief executive officers must manage for the long term and that means longer than the 6.1 years top officers stay on the job. The United States must invest more in its most important asset: human capital. American workers are undereducated. Schools need an infusion of talent, from universities, businesses and government. We need new tax incentives to encourage consumer saving. But if this country makes the necessary reforms and is willing to face difficult days, and perhaps difficult years, it will see a long-term economic resurgence.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Modem Makers Are Picking Up the Pace

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
Computers are getting faster, more powerful and more reliable, and so too are modems, the devices that allow two or more computers to share information over regular telephone lines. Fairly bristling with advanced circuitry, the new modems achieve their performance by taking over a lot of processing done by computer-based software communications protocols. ''The modem is doing much more processing than the computer,'' said Dennis C. Hayes, president of Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. of Norcross, Ga., which for many years has set the industry's standards.
The change is important for the new computer systems that can perform several tasks at once, with a communications program running in the background while the main processor is working on other applications. For the last few years, the standard office modem has been able to transfer 1,200 or 2,400 bits of information a second, through modulation and demodulation (hence the name modem). Because of improvements that safeguard the accuracy of data, industry analysts are expecting the standard to make a leap to 9,600 bits a second. 
Using such techniques as data compression, which in effect squeezes out the ''white space'' between chunks of information, some makers of 9,600 b.p.s. modems boast that their devices have an actual ''throughput'' faster than 9,600 b.p.s. - several times faster, in some cases. A few brag of speeds that once were thought possible only on a digital phone network, like the Integrated Services Digital Network that is still several years from widespread use.
''Businesses are finally beginning to appreciate higher speed'' in data transmissions, said Greg Szumowski, a data communications analyst for the International Data Corporation, a market research company in Framingham, Mass. He added, ''They are aware that 9,600 is the next step up, and they've leapfrogged over 4,800.'' A 9,600 b.p.s. modem theoretically sends a file in one-fourth the time of a 2,400-b.p.s. modem, and the increased speed makes it economically feasible to exchange larger amounts of data. Because businesses increasingly need access to information stored in computers far away, long-distance telephone charges are a significant expense.
''We find that a lot of companies are changing the way they do business through these technologies,'' Mr. Hayes said. ''For example, a textile company in South Carolina is spearheading an industrial integration system where customers place orders electronically to improve service. Pharmacies and drugstore chains are using dial-in services to do drug-interaction checks, to make sure a prescription from one doctor does not cause ill effects when used with a prescription from another doctor. Companies are realizing that in providing those kinds of services there is a transmission cost involvedin sending data. High-speed modems can significantly reduce phone bills and make them more competitive.''
But telephone lines were designed to handle human voices, not computer data. The quality of the line is not critical for voice transmission, because the human brain has superb built-in error correction and data compression capabilities. Computers, on the other hand, are essentially dumb boxes that have to have everything crystal clear. The slightest pop, hiss, whistle, click or echo on a phone line can knock a computer senseless. A single bit that strays out of place can lead to all sorts of problems. Often, if the modem senses that the line quality is inadequate, it will simply drop the connection and force the caller to redial.
When modems try to pump more and more bits down the same standard telephone line, the importance of error checking and correction technology increases. As a result, the Consultative Committee on International Telephone and Telegraph, or C.C.I.T.T., an organization that sets worldwide standards for such things as modem and facsimile transmissions, developed a standard for 9,600 b.p.s.modulation, which is called V.32. If the V.32 modem makes a connection with another modem, it performs a ''handshake'' in which the two devices exchange information about themselves. If the V.32 modem detects that its partner is not V.32, it typically ''falls back'' to a lower standard. ''V.32 is a funny animal,'' said Casey Cowell, chairman and president of U.S. Robotics Inc. of Skokie, Ill., a leading maker of data communications equipment. ''It was originally conceived as a way to transmit data on leased lines over short distances, and it was not really optimized for long-distance connections. The technical trick was to get it to work well with regular telephone lines.''
U.S. Robotics, Hayes and other modem makers quickly adopted the V.32 standard for high-speed communications. Then, in the quest for further speed enhancements, the C.C.I.T.T. developed a standard called V.42, for error checking and correction, and a second standard, known as V.42bis, for data compression.
V.42 incorporates and surpasses earlier error correction standards called M.N.P., for Microcom Network Protocol. Many businesses already have modems that include MNP levels 2, 3 and 4, and they will be able to communicate with V.42 modems. V.42bis also supplants an earlier standard, called MNP level 5. In general, said Mr. Cowell of U.S. Robotics, V.42bis offers about a 35 percent increase in performance over MNP-5 modems on typical data files.
In short, businesses that need to exchange a large amount of data would do well to shop for V.32 modems with V.42 and V.42bis capability. Such modems typically cost $1,000 to $1,600. Because they cut phone bills so efficiently, they have the potential to pay for themselves in a relatively short time.
Modem makers often add proprietary schemes to the industry standards in their efforts to make modems go faster. U.S. Robotics's Courier modems, for example, employ a technology called HST that boosts the effective speed of the V.32 modem to 14,400 bits a second when it is connected to another HST modem. Otherwise, it falls back to the other modem's top speed. Mr. Cowell said HST also greatly improves the chances of a successful handshake on the first try and reduces the time it takes for modems to perform that handshake, to an average of 6 seconds from the typical V.32's 14 seconds.
''That means the HST modem can send 100,000 bits of information before a regular V.32 can send bit one,'' Mr. Cowell said. ''In many applications where people are calling to remote sites to extract data several times a day, every day, those differences add up.''
And last month, Hayes introduced a modem called the Hayes V-series Ultra Smartmodem 9600, for $1,199. The Ultra 96, as it is called, can reportedly achieve pure data throughput of as many as 38,400 bits a second when connected with another Ultra 96.

Giving Less Time to Good Causes

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Two years ago, internal dissension threatened to destroy the Shanti Project, the San Francisco nonprofit group that is one of the world's largest providers of care for people with AIDS. Its founder had stepped aside and Douglas P. Holloway, a member of Shanti's board, ran the group on a day-to-day basis for eight months while holding down a full-time job as an executive vice president of Wells Fargo & Company.
''I was coming to work at 5:30 A.M. and getting home at 10, 11 o'clock at night,'' Mr. Holloway recalled.
Mr. Holloway continues to put in many hours a week at Shanti, at Irwin Memorial Blood Centers and on similar nonprofit boards because he is ''personally committed'' to an adequate blood supply and to helping AIDS victims. But this kind of commitment has grown rare. 
''Nonprofit agencies are finding it harder to sign on board members,'' said Chrystl Kasler, a specialist in nonprofit organizations in the Washington office of Chicago accounting firm Grant Thornton.
It is a particularly thorny problem for smaller, little known - and underfunded - organizations, said John N. Odom, executive director of the New York State Society of Clinical Social Work Psychotherapists. He noted that, although United Way of New York and several other nonprofit groups run programs to recruit and train directors for smaller boards, their emphasis has been on finding minority members, not corporate executives. ''The small, struggling groups that need the fundraising clout of prestigious board members just can't find them,'' Mr. Odom said.
There are many reasons for the growing managerial aversion to serving on nonprofit boards. Private-sector downsizing has meant that jobs eat up a lot more hours in the day than they once did, leaving less time for philanthropic activities. Scandals, like the one revolving around Covenant House in New York, have made potential directors leery of accepting board memberships of groups they do not intimately know.
And horror stories about directors getting hit with lawsuits and fines abound. One executive in Washington was on a nonprofit board that, he said, was so strapped for cash that its executive director used the withholding taxes it had collected from employees to pay its monthly bills. The Internal Revenue Service tried to make him and other board members personally liable for some $90,000 in back taxes. The executive, who spoke on condition that his name not be used because he did not want to attract the I.R.S.'s notice yet again, says he spent more than $5,000 on legal fees before the I.R.S. backed off.
Since most nonprofit groups indemnify their directors, such stories are rare. Still, Ms. Kasler tells clients to check the last audited financial statement of any nonprofit before they join.
''Financial problems can mean a lot of hand-wringing and unpleasantry, even if the insurance company will pay,'' she said.
Not all nonprofit groups have the same degree of trouble attracting directors, of course. Accountants, doctors and other professionals are generally eager to serve on the boards of their own professional associations because it affords networking opportunities. Membership on the boards of major art museums or philharmonic orchestras are considered prize plums for high-society types. And chief executives can usually attract their peers - and certainly subordinates hoping to rise - to boards they favor.
Yet even these boards are on dangerous ground, in that they are asking their directors for a lot of time and money.
''Too many people think putting their name on the letterhead is enough,'' said Gordon C. Dixon, a fundraising consultant in New York. ''Non-profit boards have to make it clear to their private-sector directors that, with Federal funds drying up, it's become essential that they attend meetings, read the material, and, most important of all, raise funds.''
 
THE INCENTIVES TO SIGN ON
Why do executives join boards?
 Often, their corporations have made it professionally worth their while. Conoco, Colgate-Palmolive, the Aluminum Company of America and a fair number of other companies have made community participation part of the evaluations that decide bonuses and promotions. And many others, through articles in employee publications and generous time-off policies, have made it clear that community service is looked on with favor.
''An emphasis on community participation is part of our corporate culture,'' said George L. Knox 3d, vice president of public affairs at the Philip Morris Companies. ''But where lower-level people become volunteer ambulance drivers, senior vice presidents sit on boards.''
Boards that offer networking opportunities also have a good shot at attracting directors. Thomas M. James, a partner in Gorsuch, Kirgis, Campbell, Walker & Grover, a Denver law firm, spends an average of 25 hours a month on his five nonprofit boards. The majority of that time goes to a local chamber of commerce. ''Sure, I'm committed to volunteer service, but let's be honest - exposure to the business community certainly helps in developing clients,'' he said.
Similarly, when Lyn Corbett Fitzgerald was an advertising project manager for Kraft Inc. responsible for promoting Kraft products to the under-19 set, she joined the board of Future Homemakers of America, a nonprofit group that points teen-agers toward careers in home economics. Being on the board put her in touch with a whole slew of teen-agers, allowing her to see how they would respond to various promotion and product ideas.
Now, Ms. Fitzgerald is doing public relations at Quaker Oats, and is no longer immersed in the youth market. Her three-year stint on the Homemakers board was up this month, and she did not re-enlist. She's finished with nonprofit service, at least for a while. If she joins another board, it will be in the private sector, she said.
''Nonprofits have so many subgroups with their own agendas that it becomes exhausting just finding out where everyone is coming from, where the biases are,'' she said. ''At least on a for-profit board I'm dealing with financial ramifications, shareholder interests, other things I really understand.''

What's going on in Tokyo? Why are some small stocks soaring and the lesser-known stock indexes at record highs? With the closely watched Nikkei 225 Index still floundering around 32,600, how can some forecasters still expect it to hit 40,000 - a new high - by the end of the year? And has Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, given a boost to market hopes with his surprising promise to lower American interest rates if credit for businesses and individuals remains too tight?
The Nikkei 225 index, which charts the market's leading companies, is still struggling to regain a modest amount of the ground it lost with its 28 percent slide to 28,002 earlier this year. But the Second Section in Tokyo, which includes many smaller companies with fewer shares in the market, has already surged 35 percent to a new record after reaching bottom in April. The Second Section was up 48.54 Friday to 4467.25, its fifth new high in the last six trading days. 
One reason for the surge of stocks with smaller capitalization is that high interest rates in Japan have driven many investors from the stock market to the better yields in money-market instruments, leaving them with very high cash positions.
What has been sold is the better name, bigger company stocks. But the smaller capitalizaton stocks offer specal opportunities. One is that some of them had low price/earnings ratios. But more important, with fewer shares outstanding, any large purchase has a large effect on price.
''It is easier to push up these prices,'' said Yuichi Kohashi, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. ''You cannot buy and push up Nippon Steel, but it is easy to push up small-cap shares.'' However, he cautions, even these stocks may peak soon because the rally has now pushed their price/earnings ratios too high.
The reason for a change in the outlook for the market overall is the new talk of higher interest rates, on top of high rates that are already undermining the market.
Yoshiro Katsuya, senior vice president of Nikko Securities in New York, says worries about inflation persist, although price levels now are low. The fears have been intensified partly because of the 430 trillion yen in public-works spending the Government has promised over 10 years, he said. Higher rates may also be needed to boost the anemic yen.
So he expects short-term interest rates, now around 7.5 percent, to rise and the Bank of Japan to raise its official discount rate. The Bank of Japan has already pushed up short-term market rates, by about 25 basis points at the end of June.
While this is a negative for the stock market, shares should get some boost from a stronger yen, which last week commanded a rate of less than 150 to the dollar. Between these trends, the market is caught in the middle, which is not good, especially if the stronger yen is just a result of higher Japanese interest rates. So while the official view of Nikko in Tokyo is still that the Nikkei 225 could reach 40,000 this year, Mr. Katsuya sees a top of 36,000 to 37,000.
But Salomon Brothers, one of the earliest to trumpet a major turnaround in the Tokyo market, is sticking to its year-end forecast of 37,000 to 40,000. Its analysts, lead by Christopher M. Mitchinson, feel that the Japanese economy is at a turning point, which could lead to lower interest rates, and that much of the worry about inflation (consumer prices are up only 2.2 percent in the last year) is overdone.
Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, may have given their prediction a boost, since the major stumbling block to a new Nikkei high is interest rates. After the chairman told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that the Fed might ease off on rates because of tight credit, it apparently did so on Friday, adding reserves and pushing the Federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, down to eight and one-sixteenth percent from eight and one-quarter percent.
This ease, much earlier than expected, could help strengthen the yen against the dollar and reduce some of the pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates.

INTERNATIIONAL
 
The Best Little Summit in Texas
 
A summit conference meant to celebrate the triumph of free-market economics became a demonstration of laissez-faire diplomacy as well. For every country and cause, the final communique had a clause. As the conference in Houston ended, West Germany came away with the right to unilaterally aid the Soviet Union, Japan the right to aid China. The United States avoided taking a strong stance against global warming, while the European nations beat back American demands for a commitment to end agricultural subsidies. Instead of unanimity, the leaders of the West's seven major industrial powers settled for chumminess. President Bush tried to loosen up his guests with rodeo and barbecue, even as some Houstonians fumed that their art museum better reflected their worldly sophistication.
 
Promises, Promises
 
On one summit issue, President Bush got downright vehement. He demanded an end to agricultural subsidies. The United States showers its own farmers with aid and protection, but not nearly as much as Japan or Western Europe do. Administration officials said that subsidies keep food exports from America and the third world out of major markets. The President won no specific timetables or commitments from other leaders, just a general promise to roll back protectionist subsidies. 
 
Helping the East Go On-Line
 
First the computer conferences, then maybe the computer sales. Western sellers are rushing to meet the Eastern bloc's potential buyers at one computer show after another. From last Tuesday through today the International Data Group has held its first PC World Forum/Moscow. Last month, the International Computer Club held its first International Computer Forum in Moscow. Set for early fall are the Softool U.S.S.R. conference in Moscow and the Edventure East-West High-Tech Forum in Budapest. The conference come as the West eases its technology export rules. But computer vendors still face unconvertible currencies, clogged distribution channels, scant office space - and doubts about whether the person who signs a deal today will have authority to live up to it tomorrow. ''I'm trying to first tell everybody how tough it is,'' said Esther Dyson, publisher of the Release 1.0 newsletter and sponsor of the Budapest conference. ''Then, if you still want to do it anyway, more power to you.''
 
COMPANIES
 
Defending the Family Honor
 
It was a trying week for a President attempting to distance himself from the savings and loan debacle. He defended his son, Neil, against accusations that he violated conflict of interest rules as a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in Denver. ''I have confidence in the honor and integrity of my son,'' President Bush said, while pledging to stay out of the case. Federal regulators are considering whether to file a $200 million lawsuit against Neil Bush and other directors to recover some of the Government's losses in Silverado's failure. The regulators released documents last week showing that loans Neil Bush voted to approve for a business partner cost the Government at least $45 million when they went bad. Democrats tried to force the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor, bringing protests from Republicans.
 
*
 
A Senate panel opened hearings into what Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, called ''the worst case we have found'' of abuses in the savings and loan bailout program. An Arizona insurance executive with a history of legal and regulatory problems garnered promises of $1.85 billion in Federal subsidies to buy 15 failed savings and loans. The executive, James M. Fail, consolidated them into Bluebonnet Savings, which, with the Government aid, became the most profitable large savings and loan in the nation last year. Mr. Fail received help in securing the funds from Robert J. Thompson, an aide to George Bush when he was vice president.
 
*
 
The Senate approved a bill to provide $162 million to clean up the savings and loan industry and increase maximum penalties to life imprisonment.
 
Taken for Granite
 
Fly the friendly floors: American Airlines plans to charge its La Guardia Airport passengers an extra dollar a ticket for the privilege of treading imported granite floor tiles. Passengers on flights from Newark, New Orleans, West Palm Beach, Fla., and Fort Myers, Fla., will pay as much as $4 more for each ticket as well, reflecting what American calls ''excessive charges'' at these airports. At La Guardia, American objects to the use of granite tiles in the main terminal areas. American says the tiles are at least four times as expensive as the porcelain tiles the airline installs in its own terminal areas. While some consumer groups griped about the charges, analysts politely applauded. Julius Malduits of Salomon Brothers said airlines should be able to recoup added costs, whether at the airport terminals or at the fuel pumps. ''How's this any different from the fuel surcharges?'' he asked.
 
The Brademas Touch
 
If they had the millions, John Brademas had the lintels, with space for their names. And so, under his nine-year tenure as president of New York University, he lined up donors for the Tisch Hospital, the (Leonard N.) Stern School of Business and the Alexander S. Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies, named after Aristotle's son. His board of trustees, with Laurence A. Tisch of CBS as chairman, was stocked with Alan C. Greenberg of Bear, Stearns; Lewis L. Glucksman of Smith Barney; Thomas S. Murphy of Capital Cities/ABC; Milton J. Petrie of Petrie Stores, Lewis Rudin, the builder; Mr. Stern, of the Hartz Group; Martin Lipton, the lawyer, and Ann G. Getty. After raising $800 million in all, Dr. Brademas said last week that he will step down in December 1991.
 
Chi-Chi Shopping
 
With other tony New York retailers closing down, is there room for a new French arrival to open up? Galeries Lafayette of Paris plans to put its first American store in the Trump Tower space vacated by Bonwit Teller. But New York's appetite for Euro-glitz is slumping along with its economy. And Au Printemps S.A., Galeries Lafayette's Paris rival, closed its only United States department store, in Denver, last year. New York City's morale did improve last week with the Democratic Party's decision to hold its 1992 national convention there. But Galeries Lafayette will need to attract plenty of shoppers long before the conventioneers hit town.
 
Adding Insult to Injury
 
It was bad enough for John A. Mulheren Jr. to be convicted last week on four felony counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. But worse, he was convicted even after the lead witness against him, Ivan F. Boesky, confessed to keeping millions of dollars in ill-gotten profits, bribing fellow prisoners to do his laundry and deducting half his $100 million fine from his taxes. Mr. Mulheren, a former trader, was accused of conspiring with Mr. Boesky to manipulate the price of Gulf and Western Industries stock. A Federal judge declared a mistrial on 26 other charges when the jury deadlocked.
 
In Brief
 
A Federal judge took steps on Monday to consolidate hundreds of thousands of asbestos cases in an attempt to control legal costs. He also froze spending by a trust that the Manville Corporation set up to handle the claims.
 
*
 
Sears, Roebuck and Company said it expected sharply lower second-quarter earnings because of unanticipated losses in in its Allstate Insurance unit and weak sales in its stores. Eastern Airlines said Friday that it had entered merger talks with Northwest Airlines. Eastern also predicted 1990 losses greater than the projected $330 million.
 
*
 
Robert W. Kearns was awarded more than $5 million in his suit against the Ford Motor Company for infringing on his patent for intermittent windshield wipers.
 
*
 
Who says the leveraged-buyout boom is over? Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company agreed last week to the sale of Motel 6 to Accor S.A. of France for $1.3 billion. Kohlberg, Kravis and its investors will earn five times their original $125 million investment.
 
*
 
The GTE Corporation intends to acquire the Contel Corporation in a stock swap worth $6 billion. GTE would become the nation's second-largest mobile telephone operator.
 
*
 
The United Parcel Service plans to convert its 2,700 delivery trucks in Los Angeles to run on cleaner natural gas.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Loosening the Credit Reins
 
It's as if Alan Greenspan got turned down for a loan himself. For months, business people have been complaining about tight bank credit, but the Federal Reserve chairman said he saw a problem in real estate only. Last Thursday, Mr. Greenspan announced that banks had indeed become too unwilling to lend, so the Fed was ready to compensate by easing interest rates. The very next day, market analysts saw signs that the Fed was pushing rates down. The markets rallied, with the Dow climbing above 3,000 for the first time, before closing at 2,980.20, up 75.25 for the week. Mr. Greenspan believes the economy is strong enough to resist a recession, analysts noted. ''The easing we got today seems to have been a special, once-and-for-all response to the banks' tightening,'' said Lawrence Krohn, an economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
 
In Brief Truth in performing: New York and New Jersey are considering laws to require notices on concert tickets and advertising when a performance will be less than live. Many rock stars gyrate and lip-synch their way through programs of canned music that have all the spontaneity of political conventions.
 
*
 
Regulators ordered the nation's largest banks last Wednesday to write off 20 percent of their loans to Brazil and raise their write-offs for Argentina's debt from 40 to 60 percent.
 
Inflation Takes a Hike
 
No sooner does the Fed begin lowering interest rates than the inflation report takes a jump. While the producer price index rose just two-tenths of 1 percent in June, the core rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices, increased six-tenths of 1 percent. The jump in the core rate was twice what many economists expected. And evidence last week that oil producers were arranging to limit output might reverse recent declines in energy prices. Some economists said Friday's price report was nothing to worry about after several months of low inflation; for the first half year, wholesale prices still increased at an annual rate of only 3.7 percent. But other economists questioned whether higher prices will limit the Fed's flexibility. ''We do have an inflation risk,'' said Stephen S. Roach, the senior economist at Morgan Stanley. ''It will not go away, and most definitely not with the Fed adopting an easier policy.''

Surprises From the Fed

 BODY:
Last week, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, took the foreign exchange market by surprise, announcing Thursday that the central bank might ease interest rates because of dwindling credit from commercial banks and then, on Friday, actually pushing rates down slightly. The dollar fell sharply after his remarks but recovered some on Friday, partly because the June increase in producer prices was disappointingly high. This week Mr. Greenspan will give his semiannual explanation of Fed policy to Congress. Analysts will be searching for clues to what happens next. If Mr. Greenspan says there will be no further easing, the dollar's fall may slow. But many analysts expect the Fed to ease rates again later this year.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Warning to Lamenters

BYLINE: By A.M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
I read that a former newspaper colleague of mine is so depressed by the way things are in the United States these days that he says it reminds him of Romania.
Then, a day later, I came across two pieces on the Op-Ed page of The Times singing laments about how the U.S. had wounded itself fighting the cold war.
One said the United States had already become a militarized national security state. But that was positively lighthearted compared with the other piece. 
That one said the ''North American colossus is now widely regarded as a colonial power whose verbal championship of freedom, democracy and social reform cannot be taken any more seriously than that of the Soviet Union.''
You hear that, Colussus? That is what the man said, word for word. Widely regarded. You could look it up, if you don't believe me.
No, this writer, Christopher Lasch, was not trying to be funny, although I don't blame anybody for thinking that.
His final pronouncement was that the choice between the Soviet and American ''empires,'' even the ''abstract choice between socialism and capitalism,'' no longer interests the rest of the world.
I am sending copies of that showstopper to some Czechoslovak politicians, Polish unionists and Hungarian economists I know. Somehow they and Soviet democrats believe the difference between capitalism and socialism is the difference between national survival and national death. They could use a few chuckles nowadays.
But the man is a history professor and must have meant what he wrote. So now comes a cautionary word to readers who believe the country has become a police state or is so lowdown mean and dirty, so weakened in soul and ethic, that you can't tell it from the Soviet Union.
WARNING: What follows is extremely sentimental about the U.S., very God Bless America. So don't read further. It will make you sick.
On Friday I went down to Battery Park in New York to watch a naturalization ceremony.
There were flags, a snappy small band, a police honor guard, the oath of allegiance with hands over heart, ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' belted out. It was held outdoors and, get this, you could see the Statue of Liberty. The new citizens wanted their pictures taken with her in the background.
Wait, it gets worse - some of them cried.
Thirty countries of birth were represented, 66 people in all - 34 from the Caribbean, 10 from Asia, 12 from Central and South America, 3 Africans and 7 Europeans.
Chief Judge Charles L. Brieant Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, whose grandfather was a bone-poor immigrant from England and who has the best handlebar mustache in the entire Federal judiciary, had all 66 swear to renounce foreign potentates and bear arms for this country if needed.
A young man in Army uniform nodded as he held up his hand and so did a Caribbean woman who was 70 if she was a day. The judge and Betsy Gotbaum, the Parks Commissioner -the Battery is part of her domain -made short, sensible speeches.
The judge said nobody had to tell the new Americans the meaning of America - they chose this country and then chose to work to take the ceremony of belonging. The Commissioner said if the new Americans ever needed information about the parks, just call her.
I don't know what was in the minds of the people at the Battery or the other 250,000 people who become Americans every year. I only know what was in my own mind decades ago when I swore that Canada's potentate would have to get along without me.
It was that in the United States you become a member of the national society the moment you take the oath and forever are so considered and name yourself: American.
I could live in almost any other country the rest of my life after taking its citizenship and never be thought of as an Englishman, an Italian, a Frenchman. That difference is important to me.
Before they left Battery Park, 66 men and women carefully put away their naturalization certificates and their small gift flags from the Daughters of the American Revolution to keep forever.
Then strangers from different parts of the world kissed; suddenly they had something dear in common.
I thought of mentioning that piece about the United States being widely regarded as no different than the Soviet Union when it came to championing democracy and asking some of the new Americans what they thought about that.
But I was afraid they would think I was some kind of a klutz.

HEADLINE: Bush's Campaign Pledge of No New Taxes: Misleading or Naive?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Walter F. Mondale urges us to give President Bush credit for realizing the United States needs revenue increases and to applaud his courage in stating the obvious (Op-Ed, July 3). The former Vice President is off the mark. In the game of hardball politics this response is what the Administration sought. That it should come from a former standard bearer of the opposition is a coup for the Administration. More important, it is a disgrace to the Democratic Party and a disservice to the working men and women of this country. 
Who does not realize the seriousness of the budget deficit? One does not applaud as courageous an attempt, finally, to fix the deficit created in a decade of cavalier irresponsibility by Reagan-Bush Administrations. The President claimed in his speech that he now understands the seriousness of the deficit and the savings and loan crisis. That crisis was precipitated by a policy and fundamental philosophy marking the last 10 years of deregulation. It was perpetrated by wealthy members of our society, who have benefited in so many ways from the changes in the 1980's. What occurred should come as no surprise.
What should be surprising is the President's desire to rectify this financial scandal by taxing the middle class precisely to the exclusion of the well off.
Candidate George Bush promised America no new taxes. Was he (1) engaging in misleading the public, or (2) so fundamentally naive about national economic problems as not to see the tough decisions he would be required to make as President?
Whether misleading or ignorant, his mocking intransigence did a disservice to the discourse and issues of the 1988 campaign - rhetoric from which we have yet to recover. For this we should give him credit and applaud his courage? I think not, Mr. Mondale.

HEADLINE: College Students, at Least, Aren't Apathetic

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A June 28 front-page article characterizes young people 18 to 29 years old as ''indifferent toward public affairs'' and current events, and you quote a Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press study that states they are a group that ''knows less, cares less, votes less and is less critical of its leaders and institutions than young people in the past.''
Our research among college students nationwide since March 1988 leads to a different conclusion -there are among 18-to 29-year-olds a crucial core group of students that does care, does vote and is aware and critical of the world around them. College students have strong opinions about the major issues facing the country and are active consumers of major news media, from newspapers and news weeklies to television news. A summary of key findings:
* Three-quarters of undergraduates are registered to vote, and 83 percent of those voted in the 1988 Presidential election. Both rates are far higher than those for their non-college peers or adults as a whole. 
* College students are critical of our national leadership. More students approve of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's performance (81 percent) than President Bush's (63 percent) or Vice President Dan Quayle's (40 percent).
* Students are especially critical of the business community's environmental efforts. Asked to rate the business community on a 10-point scale for protecting the environment, students gave business a grade of less than 4. Only 7 percent of undergraduates gave it a rating of 7 or higher.
* By a 5-to-1 margin, students rank the overall quality of Japanese products over those of the United States; there was even a slight preference for the quality of products from West Germany. By better than 2-to-1 students rank the Japanese economy over the United States as the strongest in the world.
* In our news media studies, Newsweek and Time are consistently the leading publications read by students and news is among the top five television programs they report watching. Eighty percent read their local newspaper at least weekly and more than a quarter read it five or more times a week. More than 90 percent read their campus newspaper.
* Sixty percent indicate that they have become more politically aware since coming to college. A similar number indicated their political views had shifted since coming to college.
* Asked if they were likely to be involved in political organizations or activities after college, about half answered that they would.
* More than 90 percent of students favor a woman's right to choose abortion; 63 percent favor elimination of investments in South Africa; 89 percent favor stronger protection for the environment, even if prices or taxes rise as a result, 80 percent favor Government assistance to provide day care for working families; 80 percent favor prosecution of drug users, and 78 percent indicate that they do not believe that equal opportunity exists for all Americans.
We do not share the view that this is an ''indifferent generation.'' What's more, all people 18 to 29 cannot be lumped into one uniform group. While we cannot speak for the noncollege population, we can point to three years of studies on campuses across the country that this is a vibrant, opinionated, active group. They'll be heard from.

Mr. Bush and America's Greens

 BODY:
President Bush's next summit meeting might well be a cozy little chat in the Oval Office with a handful of environmental leaders. There's much common ground between them. But one would never know that from the poisonous and sometimes silly rhetoric that filled the air during last week's economic summit meeting in Houston.
Environmentalists from seven nations descended on Texas like boll weevils to monitor their governments' actions. The Americans, in particular, had reason to be supremely disappointed at Mr. Bush's reluctance to embrace even a modest strategy for limiting emissions of carbon dioxide that could cause a catastrophic warming of the earth's climate. 
But they had no reason to engage in the hyperbole attributed to Jay Hair, the moderate president of the National Wildlife Federation. ''Bush's efforts at balance, compromise and consensus building,'' he cried, ''are killing the world.'' Not to be outdone in the bombast sweepstakes, the ever-competitive Mr. Bush retorted that he wasn't out to win ''brownie points'' with environmentalists. Nor would he be swayed by ''extremists,'' or seduced by ''radical positions'' that would ''throw a lot of American men and women out of jobs.''
The childishness of all this is self-evident. It's hard to imagine President Bush waking up and saying, ''Barbara, let's go out and mess up the earth today''; equally hard to imagine Mr. Hair gleefully calculating the number of families he could impoverish by saving the spotted owl.
What makes this backbiting dangerous is that it blocks serious discussion of very complex questions. Environmental issues are never easy; their solution is rarely cost-free. They require hard choices between environmental protections the voters obviously want and the economic growth many Americans are loath to abandon. And that requires a maximum of care and a minimum of cant. Mr. Bush has shown himself capable of both. His clean air bill, though greatly improved by the environmentalists, was patiently conceived.
His recent decision to ban coastal drilling, taken after long study, was a sensible bow to the environmentalists who argued that the oil was not worth the risk. It was also a good example of the ''balance, compromise and consensus building'' that Mr. Hair finds so distasteful.
Conversely, given an opportunity to strike a balance between jobs and nature in the spotted owl controversy, Mr. Bush responded with pained indifference, threatening to change the endangered species law that had dumped the problem on his desk in the first place.
His vision on global warming seems even more cramped. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany asked the President to cut harmful emissions by 25 percent over the next 15 years. John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, screamed that any such plan would threaten America's sovereignty and plunge it into depression. This ignored the findings of tough-minded economists like Yale's William D. Nordhaus, who argues in the latest Economist that a 20 percent cut can be achieved at very little cost to annual economic growth.
Even so, with Mr. Bush in the White House, America's greens at least have somebody to work with. That's more than they had before. Between 1980 and 1988 the White House was occupied by a man who wanted to drill everywhere, thought that acid rain was a figment of some crazed Canadian's imagination and blamed ''killer trees'' for global warming.
The time ought to be ripe for sensible debate on the competing demands of the environment and energy. While perpetual dissatisfaction is the natural state of any self-respecting environmentalist, caterwauling doesn't help. Neither does a petulant President who keeps threatening to pick up his bat and ball and go home.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Houston Scorecard

 BODY:
When the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations met last week in Houston, the three main issues of contention were trade policy, aid to the Soviet Union and the environment. Here, by David E. Rosenbaum, a New York Times correspondent who covered the Houston event, is a look at the issues, what the summit meeting produced and the outlook.
 
Trade
 
The issue: International trade liberalization talks are deadlocked over farm subsidies. The summit partners all subsidize their farmers, resulting in severely distorted world prices. Government support in Europe and Japan, however, is much more extensive than it is in the United States. President Bush asserts that unless the supports are reduced, developing nations with little to sell but their farm products will walk out of the trade talks. But the Europeans are especially reluctant to act. 
 
The summit decision: The final communique included ambiguous language that allowed all sides to claim victory. For the United States, it pledged specific attention to reduction of export supports. For the Europeans, it recognized that ''social and economic conditions'' must be reflected in farm policy. For the Japanese, it implicitly recognized that their prohibition of rice imports is considered a matter of national security. But more important than the words, the summit may have provided the political impetus to get the trade negotiators talking again.
 
The next step: When trade negotiators resume, some agreement will probably be reached on lowering farm subsidies. But it is too early to tell whether it will satisfy the developing countries.
 
Soviet Aid
 
The issue: Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany has pledged more than $3 billion in credits to the Soviet Union and with the support of President Francois Mitterrand of France is pushing for a $15 billion aid package from the industrial countries. The United States and others oppose direct aid but are prepared to offer technical assistance. They maintain that the money will be wasted in the absence of a free-market economy. Furthermore, Mr. Bush argues that he cannot provide money to the Soviet Union so long as that country spends vast sums on its military and supports Cuba.
 
The summit decision: The leaders encouraged the steps being taken toward a free-market economy, and agreed that individual countries were free to support the Soviets directly. They agreed to a study of Soviet economic needs by international organizations.
 
The next step: After the meeting Mr. Bush said, ''I think Mr. Gorbachev understands that at this juncture, sending money from the United States is not in the cards.'' But Mr. Kohl, maintaining that the ''necessary steps'' are being taken, said, ''If this continues by the end of the year, we should be able to achieve a joint Western economic assistance program.''
 
The Environment
 
The issue: Chancellor Kohl, with the support of the other leaders except for Mr. Bush, proposed a specific timetable for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that some scientists believe contribute to global warming. Mr. Bush insisted that scientific data on climate change were inconclusive. He held that reduction of greenhouse gases could damage the economy in the United States and other countries and that action should not be taken without further evidence.
 
The summit decision: Mr. Bush prevailed in that no timetable was set. But the communique declared that the countries were ''committed to undertake common efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse gases'' and that ''lack of full scientific certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are justified in their own right.'' The leaders also agreed, with Mr. Bush's support, to develop a pilot program to help Brazil preserve its tropical rain forest.
 
The next step: Mr. Bush is likely to face considerable pressure to relent on the global warming issue not only from his summit partners but also from environmental groups at home. International studies of the matter are under way, and more discussions will be held at a conference in Geneva in November.

IN HAITI, THUGGERY IS EASIER ALL THE TIME

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
With the return from exile last week of two figures associated with political violence and torture, one pessimistic notion seemed to resound clearly through the thick atmosphere of Port-au-Prince. For many, the return of Roger Lafontant, the former head of the Tontons Macoute, and Williams Regala, a top army officer under Jean-Claude Duvalier and successor dictatorships, showed how little ground has been gained in the four years since Mr. Duvalier was routed in a street revolution.
Now, after only four months in office, Haiti's fifth interim Government since 1986 is listing badly, and infighting among civilian politicians is increasing. Again the country is flirting with violence and chaos nurtured by groups - often tied to drug trafficking or other forms of illegality - that are loyal to former barons of the Duvalier system and bent on derailing democratic change. 
Many criminal enterprises got started under Jean-Claude Duvalier, whose tolerance for independent illegal activities was notoriously high, as long as they didn't interfere with his family's own acquisitive habits; since his departure, the hold of these groups has only grown stronger in the absence of a stable central government.
After five years in which each government has seemed less in control than the last, many Haitians realize that popular movements and international sanctions have failed to curb the chilling determination of these groups to preserve their interests at all costs. ''With each crisis the situation has only gotten worse, with all of these groups, not just the Tontons Macoute, but the drug smugglers and the contraband traffickers, even traffickers in people, gaining ever more of a hold on the system,'' said Anthony P. Maingot, a Caribbean affairs expert at Florida International University in Miami. ''These are criminal enterprises that are threatened by change and they are not going to allow real elections.''
Mr. Maingot and others have said meaningful elections in Haiti are possible, but only if the democratic sector could somehow unite long enough to sweep the civil service clean of corrupt Duvalierists and reform or eliminate the armed forces - which now are in near-chaos themselves. But Haiti's opposition forces are anything but unified. They range from veterans of the dictatorship who now profess democracy to excitable nationalists, including members of the Haitian clergy, who call for a revolution. They give the impression of an assortment of often impressive but headstrong individuals, each pulling mightily in his own direction.
 
Disunity and Distrust
 ''What these people don't seem to realize is that if they really unify themselves, they could defeat what is left of the army and the Tontons Macoute and break the back of the kleptomaniac state,'' said Larman C. Wilson, a specialist in Caribbean affairs at American University in Washington. ''They are unwilling to set aside differences before an election and fight it out later. They fight things out beforehand and end up being torn apart.''
Others say Haiti must invite a multinational force to temporarily take over governance and insure security during elections. But few politicians are likely to publicly support such a step. Distrust of Washington, which was involved to varying degrees in all of the frustrated efforts to advance democracy here, is high, and Haitians have a historic suspicion of foreign intervention.
One angry Haitian businessman, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, declared, ''We have the impression the United States is against us; the Government, the press, the C.I.A., all are working together to keep Haiti cordoned off, to make the world as unsympathetic as possible to us, even to prevent any sense of solidarity with black Americans from developing.'' Such feelings are reinforced by memories of American aid to Jean-Claude Duvalier and by Washington's failure to heed signs that the first post-Duvalier dictator, Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy, harbored no democratic intentions. The latest American ambassador here, Alvin P. Adams, quickly earned high marks from many Haitians with his personal diplomacy, his knowledge of Creole, and, shortly after arriving last November, his role in easing Gen. Prosper Avril out of power. On his arrival, Mr. Adams used a Creole proverb - ''a heavily laden donkey must move forward'' - to suggest that the country must proceed to elections. This earned him a complimentary sobriquet, bourik chage, or loaded donkey. Recently, however, with Haiti's political future as clouded as ever, many references to him have been shortened to donkey.
Still, the ambassador's most potent weapon for change remains the assertion that without democracy, Haiti will remain cut off from the rest of the hemisphere and from the economic aid it has been denied since 1987. ''We're a cheap shot, everyone can have a go at us,'' Mr. Adams said during a recent interview. ''But the point that has to be made is that he who interferes with the electoral process will have a price to pay.''

HEADLINE: Giant Steps;
Germany Makes the Most of Its Newfound Power

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: BONN

 BODY:
There is no doubt in anyone's mind in London, Paris or Bonn that the Western leader who dominates the international agenda these days is not Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain or President Bush of the United States, but Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany.
Part of the reason is that German economic and political strength is beginning to overshadow Europe the way Soviet military strength did for 45 years. Now Soviet weakness has reduced the leverage the United States had during the years of Soviet menace. The result is a net flow of political power and self-confidence to Mr. Kohl, an enormous man who is positively bursting with pride these days and flew off confidently to Moscow yesterday for another heart-to-heart talk with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev about German unification. 
An extraordinary series of summit meetings - the European Community, then the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and finally the Group of Seven industrial democracies in Houston last week - has seen his partners, including the United States, content to let Mr. Kohl set the agenda, and to provide the backing he demanded for German reunification on his terms. Now, with the Group of Seven acquiescing in West German plans to offer the Soviet Union hefty sums of real money (marks, not dollars) to ease the loss of Moscow's strategic position in East Germany, Mr. Kohl will be getting to know Mr. Gorbachev better in Moscow and Stavropol today and tomorrow. He is prepared to talk about everything from future German-Soviet trade to limits on the size of Germany's armed forces, in order to make its NATO membership more acceptable to Moscow.
Despite the heartfelt professions of good will and the camaraderie, there are bitter memories and not a little resentment about the new German strength, not only in the Soviet Union but in most of Western Europe.
In Germany as well, there is profound ambivalence about the new German role, and much criticism of Mr. Kohl for having gone too fast and too far. German flags waved after West Germany won the World Cup in soccer last Sunday, but there was no national wave of triumphalism. Instead, by the end of the week, many Germans were anguishing about why a British Government minister who is one of Prime Minister Thatcher's closest and oldest friends, Nicholas Ridley, had compared German domination of Europe today with Hitler's conquests earlier; the only comfort for the Germans lay in the fact that most British politicians felt obliged to apologize rather than agree with Mr. Ridley. Germany may be powerful, but it is still insecure.
 
Taking Charge
 Nevertheless, Mr. Kohl has taken charge of unification and the associated issues with dizzying speed, in just six months. For 45 years, the United States, Britain and France saw questions like the size of a postwar Germany's army, Allied occupation rights, and both their own and Germany's relationship with the Soviet Union as vital national interests, not to be left to the Germans to decide. Now a lot of that is changing.
 
One reason is that the United
States decided, a year ago last May, that if there was to be a special American relationship with any European leader these days, it should be with the one who had the most clout - Mr. Kohl - not the increasingly insular and out of touch Mrs. Thatcher. The issue then was a new system of short-range American nuclear missiles to replace the Lance rockets stationed in West Germany.
Mr. Kohl didn't want them, Mrs. Thatcher wanted him to take them, and Mr. Bush took her breath away by suddenly coming down on the side of the Germans.
She hasn't been the same since, partly because the past year has been one of deep trouble for her Conservative Party in British public opinion polls. Personal pique about Mr. Bush's backing for Mr. Kohl's positions played a part, too; Mrs. Thatcher notoriously cannot abide Mr. Kohl's girth, manner or fondness for such un-Thatcherite terms as ''social partnership'' to describe the relations between labor and management. But when the Chancellor went to London in April and again for the NATO summit this month, she put on her nicest smile and agreed to let him have his way, more or less, on having the European Community draw up a road map to European economic and monetary union, and an economic aid plan for the Soviet Union. At Houston, the United States, Britain and Japan decided to let the Germans go ahead with financial aid for Soviet economic reform, even while declining to provide aid themselves.
Today and tomorrow, Mr. Kohl will try to convince the beleaguered Mr. Gorbachev that a united Germany can help the Soviet Union stave off economic collapse, and that the $2.9 billion in credit guarantees and the $736 million in payments for Soviet occupation costs that Bonn has already agreed to provide this year are only the tip of the iceberg. A united Germany will need vast amounts of Soviet oil and gas - and will pay in marks -to replace East Germany's dependence on Soviet-designed nuclear power plants and sulfurous soft coal for electricity, Mr. Kohl's entourage in Houston suggested.
 
A Green Light
 The Chancellor also got the green light at the NATO summit in London to offer Mr. Gorbachev a ceiling on a united Germany's armed forces - probably considerably lower than 400,000 troops, according to Western diplomats here, less than the current West German level.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d seems to have made a calculation some time before the East-West meeting in Ottawa last February that Mr. Kohl was on the right side of history. ''Between Christmas and Ottawa, it became clear that this thing was going to happen, much faster than anyone had realized, because East Germans were emigrating at the rate of 2,000 a week and demanding unity on the streets in Leipzig,'' a Western diplomat said, ''and there was a Bush-Baker calculation about the importance of Germany in Europe and the importance of Kohl being re-elected as Chancellor.'' Mr. Kohl stands a fair chance of being elected as the first postwar Chancellor of a united Germany in the national election next Dec. 2, though his Social Democratic opponent, Oskar Lafontaine, has made it clear it will be a bitter fight. American policy in previous West German elections has been neutrality, but Mr. Kohl seems to have little doubt about whom George Bush would prefer in this one. In London this month, Mr. Kohl was effusive about American support for his policies and expressed the view that Mr. Bush's incumbency was something like an act of Divine Providence for the Germans in their hour of fulfillment. The French and the British are not so effusive, though President Francois Mitterrand has stood cheek by jowl with Mr. Kohl and kept to himself the reservations he and many of the French are known to have about the rush to unification by the end of 1990.
The true British feeling may be imagined from unusually explosive remarks by Mr. Ridley, which were published in The Spectator in London this week. They were not defused one bit when Mr. Ridley said he regretted and unreservedly withdrew the remarks. ''This is all a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe,'' he said of the push for European economic union. ''This rushed take-over by the Germans on the worst possible basis, with the French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is absolutely intolerable.''
One bemused diplomat noted that if Mrs. Thatcher had managed to keep out of the doghouse after a bad start with Mr. Kohl earlier this year, by finally going along with quick unification in the spring, Mr. Ridley's remarks would probably put her back in. That the British worry at all about what the Germans think of them these days speaks volumes about the change in thinking that the prospect of German unity is bringing all over Europe.

HEADLINE: On the Road, Again

BYLINE: By Noha Applebaum; Noha Applebaum teaches professional writing at Harvard University.<

 BODY:
A recent Midwestern drive presented more than expected sights like the Gateway Arch, Sears Tower and Blue Water Bridge. The roads between scheduled stops revealed a four-decade evolution in American motoring. The Interstate highways enter the 1990's, like many of us who travel them, pushing middle age. Twenty-five years of growth pains have yielded to a steady state, with some key roads already graying. The mature highways are more predictable but less adventurous.
In contrast, my travels began as a child in the 1950's by watching thousands of miles of intimate two-lane U.S. roads whiz past the backseat of Dad's emerald Olds Super Rocket 88. My family crossed the country by four routes that touched 46 states by 1956, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Interstate Highway Act and I was 10.
My 20's overlapped the Johnson and Nixon presidencies, mainly heady years of cheap gas and fast travel over the rapidly expanding interstate network. Until 1974, when oil embargoes made us crawl, 70 miles an hour was the norm, with speeds reaching front-end rattling legal highs of 80 on roads like the Ohio Turnpike. In 1979, with the interstates practically complete, my wife Beth and I defied President Carter's ''fuel allocation'' during a two-month, 10,000-mile jaunt rediscovering surviving older routes. 
Ten years and two children later brought my domestic travels full circle last summer. Now the father, I drove a 3,000-mile circuit from Boston to St. Louis to see how families experience America's highways in the early Bush years.
Some things never change. Seen through the windshield, Illinois remains a blur of corn and soybeans topped by a brawny city the quintessence of America. Flat fields lining I-55 (once fabled Route 66) are measured still by earthy truck stops like the Phillips 66 an hour south of Chicago. Their loudspeakers blasted country radio USA 99 while the cashier produced the first Gold Bond stamps I'd seen in decades.
But digital technology colors travel today. In the 50's, we relied on cash; in the 60's, traveler's checks. Now, it's computers. The card that springs fresh 20's from my neighborhood bank also taps 23,000 A.T.M.'s in 4,800 North American cities. I felt slightly criminal while first typing my code in the Super Duper Market in Batavia, N.Y. Only robbers once boldly entered stores in alien towns to demand cash. But when the machine paid out $300, traveler's checks instantly became as archaic as slide rules.
Other technologies have improved our comfort in the car. Before Air Conditioners (B.A.C.), we cooled by ice and water, even for desert crossings. A few cubes rolled in a wet towel provided a cold, if dripping, pack to wrap around the neck. With the car's windows open wide, 60 m.p.h. winds produced true air conditioning. Ice water was so vital B.A.C. that Stuckey's roadside empire and South Dakota's legendary Wall Drugs sprung up oasis-like around it. Now compressors cool hot heads.
And sealed windows let us hear hi-fi casettes. Well-timed blasts of ''Sesame Street'' faded to the backseat mercifully soothed a restless 3-year-old Teddy. But we sadly neglected the radio's 50,000-watt beacons of Middle America and transient snippets of otherwise covert culture still receivable by twisting the knob far right on the AM tuner or to the left on FM.
Our hermetically-sealed, temperature-controlled, musically programmed car fostered more insidious dangers. I attributed my own ennui near Syracuse to over-familiarity with I-90 until I noticed Rachel had buried her head in a book in the back seat. Although any parent of a 9-year-old welcomes reading, I thought it decidedly uneducational for her to ignore new sights.
Then I suddenly realized the paucity of adventure in a backseat view of the interstate highway. Even a twice-read Nancy Drew held more mystery than this kind of travel. At that epiphany, we exited the interstate, flung open the windows, ejected the tape and sat Rachel up front. After a dose of Route 20, her face lit up. She smelled fields fresh from a shower, saw horses up close, felt the pull of the twisting road and thrilled as rolling hills unwound before the windshield.
Interstates can't compete with these esthetics. Their design, in fact, obscures even natural wonders. As we neared St. Louis, I piqued Rae's interest with a tale of my awesome first Mississippi River crossing. Swollen by floods, its waters seemed a mile wide in May 1956. But strain all she could, my daughter saw not one muddy drop under the broad concrete bridge designated I-70, I-55 and U.S. 40. Like magicians, the engineers had made the mighty Mississippi disappear.
Speed remains the prime virtue of superhighways. During the Reagan Administration, states west of New York and Pennsylvania legally liberated throttles to 65, nearly matching the 1960's pace. Better still, today's drivers rarely need to detour around unfinished stretches.
But as the interstates have reached full growth, some roads show early decay. Question: What was 80 the day it was born, is still less than 20 years old, but seems prematurely middle aged? Answer: I-80 as a route across Pennsylvania. Heeding warnings, we rerouted around it.
Would we had skipped other graying interstates. Reconstruction of I-55 south of Chicago funnelled miles of traffic to one lane of stop-and-go frustration with no way to pass. Such tedium makes some interstates slower than the routes they superceded. The most primitive old highways required waits for honest junctions, crossings by seemingly endless freight trains and, however rarely, even flocks of sheep. But when stuck behind a timid driver or heavy truck, the 1950's motorist could often pass through the lane of oncoming traffic.
Bottlenecks from current reconstruction underscore the practical as well as esthetic wisdom of preserving, not replacing, historic highways as escape routes. Besides, some roads have aged gracefully. The granddaddy of Eastern superhighways, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, not only predates I-80; it could outlive it.
Even old routes show a new style of roadside service. Across America, the hegemony of Howard Johnson's has yielded to a seeming Babel of competition. But the plethora of new logos only masks one standard fast-food menu, ethos and mountain of packaging. Still, any alternative is easily tastier, cheaper and faster than was HoJo's in its dotage. And to save even more time, travelers can now theoretically buy every breakfast, lunch and dinner at a drive-through without once leaving their car to meet an embodied, unamplified human voice.
Motel chains offer a like uniform impersonality in lodging. Without reading their signs, who could tell if we slept in a Regal 8, Motel 6 or Econolodge? Many chains offer swimming pools, and all provide ''free'' color TV. Still, I'd return to the days when we fed motel TV's with silver quarters if those coins would also awaken the bed's ''magic fingers'' massage machine.
Chains for food and rooms often link. I have seen the future, and its name is Breezewood, Pa., also known as the Town of Motels, Turnpike Exit 12, a community of countless gas stations, restaurants and motels assembled in a grotesque commercial parody of an American village.
Authentic local color gets ever harder to find. On the last day of our drive, we resolved to break the chain-food habit. Leaving I-80 for U.S. 46, I spied an old-fashioned New Jersey diner in Little Ferry. Visions of coconut custard pie danced in my head at the sight of this architectural gem complete with 1940's Art-Deco stainless steel and neon. Inside, my eyes panned from the round corner booth, past the long row of red spinning stools. It looked good.
Too good. Above the formica counter where a sign should have announced the blue-plate special, hung instead the joint's own T-shirts. They proclaimed that we had wandered into Rosie's Diner, a location for filming TV ads that was sold earlier this year. Framed autographed stills from paper-towel commercials lined the chrome walls above postcards touting ''the most famous diner in the world.'' Leaving the interstate had brought us no closer to genuine discovery. Madison Avenue had gotten there first.

HEADLINE: Practical Traveler;
Getting Cash Abroad: Bank Cards Make It Easy

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
When my family and I first traveled to England in 1965, we carried an engraved-letterhead note from our bank in New York that would have done credit to Edith Wharton. It introduced us to a bank in the City of London that would cash one of our New York checks, in case we ran through our $10 ''tip pack'' of British currency and our traveler's checks. It all seems so Victorian now; the methods of getting money overseas are modernizing rapidly. In the latest wrinkle, the electronic cash machine, with the help of satellite technology, is following its users overseas.
The entree is a cash card linked to either of two international networks, Cirrus or Plus. These networks are putting their labels and decals onto overseas automatic teller machines (A.T.M.'s) almost as fast as they can stick them down. Both networks are already strong in Canada and Mexico, the two favorite destinations of United States travelers, but the systems have carved out markets elsewhere: Plus is strong in England and has no presence in France; Cirrus is strong in France but in the first week in July had no machines in England. 
How do the systems work? You use the same bank card that you use at home, punching in your numerical identification. The message transmitted by your card and the data you enter are relayed by satellite to the United States and back while you stand at the machine. If there is money for you to withdraw, you get it. You request the amount you want in the currency of the country: so many pesos, francs or pounds. Both Plus and Cirrus say the conversion rate is the one in effect at the time of the transaction, and may be different the next day. This rate is described as a ''wholesale'' rate.
One big catch is that you do not know what the rate is until you get home and see from your bank statement what your money cost in dollars. Both organizations, however, are unequivocal that their network rates are better than the rates that people who walk into banks would get, because they are bank-to-bank rates. A colleague verified this in London on July 3. The rate at Plus machines was 100 for $176.60; at the Midland Bank it was $189 if cash was used, $183 if travelers checks were used. Your bank at home may, however, charge you an A.T.M. transaction fee of 25 cents to $2.50 but you should have found out about this in advance.
The cash card is not a credit card, and it is issued only by a bank where you maintain an account. You are not charged interest for the transaction, which is not the case when you use a credit card for a cash advance. Your bank card may also enable you to get a cash advance on your credit card, or your credit card may allow you to get money from your bank account, but this must be established with the bank before you leave, and you must have a personal identification number to punch in.
The back of the card displays logotypes for the networks through which you can get access to your own money, for instance NYCE, M, MAC, Pulse or Yankee 24, as well as Cirrus and Plus, the two systems now operating overseas.
Plus, which was created in 1982, went overseas in 1986 with 100 machines in Japan. This June it had machines in 11 countries or islands outside the United States. Cirrus, also founded in 1982, began to appear overseas in January. In June it had machines in five foreign countries.
Banks usually provide booklets listing the locations of the A.T.M.'s you can use in the United States and elsewhere. If your experience is like mine, you need to ask the bank for it. According to Cirrus, many member banks are still ordering only a few booklets. But you need them overseas, because finding a machine in a country with only 200 is a lot harder than finding one at a restaurant on I-95. Be sure the book you take is recent, because growth is giddying.
Cirrus publishes its booklet three times a year; the most recent edition is dated May 1990, and another is due in October, according to Kim Ross, a spokeswoman for the organization. The May directory lists 35,000 machines in 6,000 cities, mostly in the United States and Canada, with 800 locations in France, 500 in Mexico, 14 in Japan and 30 in Chile. According to Ms. Ross, Cirrus is expanding by 3,000 to 4,000 machines this summer, mainly in Europe: England, Scotland, Italy, Belgium and Spain.
Plus publishes its book twice a year. The most recent, also dated May, listed 33,000 machines, once again mostly in the United States and Canada. Elsewhere, it lists 1,340 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 200 in Mexico, 200 in Hong Kong, 160 in Puerto Rico, 113 in Japan, 50 in Australia, 25 in Singapore and a few in the Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Guam. Machines in Colombia and Ecuador are being tested, Eric Goldman, a spokesman, said. Growth in Continental Europe is a goal for the mid-90's, Mr. Goldman said. Transaction Fees If you plan to use a cash card overseas, it is worthwhile to ask your bank about its transaction fees. Before he went to England early this year, Spartacus Bernstein of Brooklyn opened a savings account at Chase Manhattan specifically to get a Plus card, which he used frequently. Chase did not charge him a fee or commission on any of his withdrawals, he says. But Ms. Ross of Cirrus reports that overseas use of that card is so new that officials at the network do not have information on whether overseas fees are being levied by banks that do not charge fees for domestic use of the card. ''It's a case where the consumer can bargain,'' Gerri E. Detweiler, the education coordinater of the BankCard Holders of America, a consumer group, said in recommending shopping around. ''If you want to do it, talk to banks and find out what you can get.''
As with credit cards, Ms. Detweiler pointed out, there is no requirement that notice of a transaction fee be posted on the machine, so unless you know before you go, you may be surprised. The Plus and Cirrus networks are financed by payments from participating banks, so the question for the consumer is whether the cost is being passed along or absorbed by the bank. It is more likely to be absorbed by the bank when you maintain a minimum balance - savings account, regular checking, securities or whatever.
Ms. Detweiler gave an urgent warning about keeping cash cards or credit cards safe: Do not write your personal identification number on any document that you carry with the card, even if you disguise it. And if you have picked your own number and have selected an ''easy'' one, like your birthdate or your license plate or phone number, you should probably start over again with a random number and then memorize it.
BankCard Holders of America publishes a leaflet, ''Traveling With Your Credit Card,'' that reviews basics such as credit limits, exchange rates and steps to make sure your bill does not go unpaid while you are gone. It is free to members but is available to nonmembers for $1 from the association, 560 Herndon Parkway, Suite 120, Herndon, Va. 22070. Overseas Restrictions Another limitation on getting cash overseas was encountered by Mignonne B. Bouvier of Portland, Me. While in France this spring Ms. Bouvier was carrying American Express travelers checks and at two branches of the bank Credit Lyonnais she was unable to cash them and was not told why. ''I am bilingual; therefore it was not a question of misinterpretation,'' she wrote. She asked if the bank had a new policy and if so, why no notice was posted to prevent Americans from standing in line a long time to no purpose.
According to Marie Laure Meunier, at the bank's headquarters in Paris, only branches of Credit Lyonnais that have a foreign-exchange window can cash travelers checks in another currency. The two branches she went to, in Lourdes and on Place Victor Hugo in Paris, did not. However, Ms. Meunier said, had Ms. Bouvier been carrying Visa travelers checks in dollars, she could have cashed them because the bank has an agreement with Visa providing for this.
Most bank branches in Paris do exchanges and are able to cash travelers checks, according to three big banks, B.N.P., Societe Generale and Credit du Nord. But look for a sign for foreign exchange before you get in line.

China Introduces Round-Trip Air Ticketing BEIJING
To make independent air travel more predictable, China's national airline has begun to issue round-trip tickets and to accept round-trip reservations. As of July 1, air travelers have been able to reserve and purchase round-trip tickets to 16 large cities, including most major tourist destinations. Round-trip tickets to smaller cities in China apparently will not be available.
The policy change helps resolve one of the greatest frustrations for independent travelers in China: the risk of flying somewhere and not being able to come back, because it was possible to reserve or purchase only one-way tickets. The first order of business upon landing somewhere was often to dash for the airline office and make a reservation for the return trip. Sometimes, it turned out there was no seat out for a week or two. Planning with any certainty was impossible. 
Tour groups have been immune from this problem, and they will continue to be able to have confirmed round-trip tickets to all destinations.
The Chinese cities for which round-trip tickets are now offered are Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Dalian, Canton, Xiamen, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guilin, Xian, Chengdu, Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Haikou and Shantou.
It is not clear how smoothly the new policy will be implemented, nor whether round-trip tickets will be offered only on the national carrier, Air China, or also on the regional airlines that have been established in recent years.
Buyers may need to be persuasive. A reporter who tried to book a seat from Beijing to Shanghai and back again - with the outward journey on Air China and the return on China Eastern Airlines - was initially told that round-trip tickets were possible only when the entire journey was on Air China. But after a bout of pleading, the clerk produced the round-trip ticket as requested, with the return on the regional airline. Air China employees in New York and San Francisco said they would sell tickets for domestic flights in China only if flights between the United States and China were made on Air China.
Even though foreigners pay higher prices than local Chinese, air fares are still very inexpensive. On the one-hour 45-minute trip between Beijing and Shanghai, for example, the fare for foreigners each way is just $80 economy and $104 first class. Round-trip tickets are simply double the one-way fare. NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
 
Icebreaker To North Pole
Breaking the ice will not be metaphor but reality this summer when passengers from the West will be allowed to board the Soviet atomic icebreaker Rossia for a summer trip to the North Pole. The voyage, for $24,500 a person, is scheduled for July 30 to Aug. 15, departing from the northwestern Soviet city of Murmansk. The Rossia, about 500 feet long, can travel through ice up to eight-feet thick, though in the summer, most ice should already be broken up, according to Mountain Travel of El Cerrito, Calif., which is selling spaces on the ship.
The Rossia will have two helicopters on board that will allow visits to such remote spots as Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land, archipelagos in the Arctic Ocean. A featured speaker of the voyage will be Peter Wilkniss, director of polar programs for the National Science Foundation in Washington. The ship has a pool, sports center, theater and a Swiss-Italian chef.

Corporate Car Coverage Cut
American Express has dropped collision-damage coverage it provided on cars rented with some of its corporate green cards. The coverage is still offered on rentals with the personal green card and all the company's premium cards. The coverage was withdrawn March 31 for companies that had more than 10 corporate cards, an American Express spokeswoman said, because larger companies already insure their employees who rent cars.
American Express began offering collision damage coverage with its gold and platinum cards in November 1987 and with green cards in January 1989. The company said it had no plans to drop the coverage that it provides on rentals with its personal cards when the rental company's collision damage waiver is refused by the renter.

HEADLINE: Homeless In America

 BODY:
The Better Homes Foundation, a nonprofit organization serving homeless families, has been in contact with more than 1,000 programs that deal with issues regarding the homeless. Many of these programs find ''substance abuse'' a growing problem. However, this does not mean that substance abuse causes family homelessness.
The root cause of homelessness is poverty and the lack of decent, affordable housing. The danger in isolating a single, psychosocial factor such as substance abuse is that policy makers could use it to ignore the housing crisis.
We have been down this road before, with the mentally ill who are homeless. If people can be thought of as crazy, then economic and housing issues for them can be more easily ignored. If we label families substance abusers, and blame them for their difficulties, we, as aJU society, can more easily abdicate our responsibility for housing them. Rather, we should acknowledge the complexity of the problem and work toward developing an integrated solution.

HEADLINE: On Language;
Empowerment And Denouncement

BYLINE: BY William Safire

 BODY:
The Energizing word among ''bleeding-heart conservatives'' (an oxymoron that Jack F. Kemp, the Housing and Urban Development Secretary, uses to describe himself and his followers) is empowerment.
The voguish political noun, coined in 1849 to mean ''the gaining of power,'' has particular resonance among blacks. In 1978, the conservative Heritage Foundation attributed popularization of the word to the Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960's, which, said a Heritage release, ''condemned the 'Establishment' and sought 'empowerment' for 'helpless minorities outside the system.' '' The assumption is that the word grew out of the S.D.S. slogan ''power to the people.'' 
As political empowerment was largely achieved, the word was applied to the need for economic clout. In 1976, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., then head of the National Urban League, said, ''That goes to economic security, income maintenance, economic empowerment - the real basic issues of equal opportunity.''
Everybody got into the empowerment act. Voter-registration groups pushed electoral empowerment; pediatricians espoused parent empowerment; after the Reagan re-election in 1984, the political pollster Pat Caddell, who had been a Gary Hart adviser in the Democratic primaries, opined sadly: ''The issue was the empowerment of a generation. . . .''
Feminists have also made it their own: in a piece about the campaign to maintain Mills College in California as a women's undergraduate school, Amy Pyle of The Los Angeles Times wrote, ''Empowerment -buzzword of the recent protests - actually has been the theme at Mills for some time.''
The word was used by some black conservatives eager to move beyond integration to equal opportunities. Many liberals saw this as a denial of their achievement, or as self-help rhetoric unhelpful to entitlements and were slow to pick it up. ''The issue was black empowerment, not integration,'' Robert L. Woodson, a black critic of social welfare bureaucracies, insisted in 1985; he helped popularize the word among conservatives.
In a 1990 Rose Garden awards ceremony, President Bush said, ''Each of these seven Americans provides a definition of the word that I have learned to respect so much, learned from Jack Kemp - empowerment.''
Since Mr. Kemp has apparently become ''Mr. Empowerment,'' at least in the Bush Administration's corridors of power, I called him to get his short definition of the term. Not a man given to brevity, he worked on it for a while, cutting his definition down to this: ''Giving people the opportunity to gain greater control over their own destiny through access to assets of private property, jobs and education.''
This is a word that has crept up on lexicographers; because empower, the verb, has deep roots in the language, its usage as a political noun in recent decades was not noted. ''We didn't regard it as anything that needed watching,'' says Cynthia Barnhart, a dictionary editor at Barnhart Books. ''Then all of a sudden it started coming in.''
Now we're all keeping an eye on it; obviously, empowerment is potent.
 
Denouncing Denouncement
 
THE SENATE ETHICS Committee's special counsel, in charging Senator Dave Durenberger of Minnesota with, among other lapses, padding his expense account, called for a punishment of denouncement.
This word is the noun form of the verb to denounce, which has a niche between ''to criticize'' and ''to censure,'' and is closest in synonymy to ''publicly to condemn, usually in a loud tone of voice.'' Denouncement was first used in 1544, and nobody can deny the noun its place in the backwaters of our vocabulary.
However, I rise here, Mr. President (that's how you talk in the Senate), to reprehend, proscribe, reprobate and even damn its use by my distinguished colleagues when another word has triumphed over it in common English usage.
The more familiar noun form of denounce is denunciation. It beat denouncement in fair usage combat, just as renunciation has whipped renouncement; why does the Senate (rooted, like senile, in the Latin senex, ''elder'') insist on dredging up the archaic alternative?
One word, one meaning, is my motto; when you use an alternative form to mean the same thing, you have wasted valuable space on the hard disk of your memory, and you have blocked the development of a different meaning.
For example, to pronounce spawned the noun pronunciation, meaning the sound of words, as well as the noun pronouncement, which means ''declaration, usually pompous.'' Another example: to announce has given us Annunciation, capitalized, meaning ''the revelation of the Incarnation to the Virgin Mary,'' as well as the more prosaic announcement.
Therefore, let us asperse, bad-mouth, revile, vilify and disparage denouncement; if we are to denounce anybody, a clear denunciation is in order.
 
Callous, My Foot
 
Dr. Scholl's Uses Gimpy English.
''Callous Removers'' is what the company calls its product to remove the hardened, thick skin properly spelled callus.
''We're asked this question every six months or so,'' says Joanne Brown, the Scholl Inc. public relations director. ''The noun spelling is callus, but we use the adjective in Callous Removers, and the adjective is spelled with an o.''
A lame excuse. First, the label sent to me by Charles Dahle of Greenwich, Conn., says to apply the ''adhesive side onto the callous.'' That means the adjectival spelling is being used mistakenly for the noun.
Second, the too-confident flack is stubbing her toe on her parts of speech: In callous removers, the word callous is not an adjective describing the noun removers; only hardhearted bankers who repossess cars might be called callous removers. In the Dr. Scholl misusage, callus - with a u, no o - is an attributive noun modifying removers.
Callus, from the Latin callum, ''hard skin,'' means just that - hard skin. Callous, same root, gives a figurative extension to the numbness: ''insensitive, unfeeling'' is the meaning.
After my yearly bout with manual labor, what I proudly show on my hand is a callus; pitilessly giving Dr. Scholl's a boot for its insolecism is being callous.
 
The Double Is
 
We have been observing the increased reduplication of is, as in the locution of John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff: ''The fact is, is. . . .'' This construction, more prevalent than linguists suspected, is an unnecessary attempt to give a verb to both parts of a sentence.
Members of the Squad Squad immediately complained about the word reduplication, contending that should mean ''three or four usages,'' or a repeat repeated.
Sorry, this is not like iteration and reiteration; in linguistics, logic does not always prevail.
Reduplication is the word used to describe the formation of words like willy-nilly, higgledy-piggledy, hocus-pocus and razzle-dazzle. (Those are second-order reduplications, because the second part of the term rhymes with but does not exactly duplicate the first.) Pure redupes are the perfectly repeated tom-tom and the slang term for ''hurry,'' chop-chop.
Is is is both a reduplication and a mistake. Maurtiz Johnson of Delmar, N.Y., writes with the suggestion that the White House chief of staff may be signaling the positive in Spanish: ''The real explanation is simply a sibiliant palindrome, viz., 'Is is is Sununu's Si! Si! Si!' ''

HEADLINE: IS HE A MATCH FOR THATCHER?

BYLINE: BY CRAIG R. WHITNEY; Craig R. Whitney is The Times's bureau chief in London.

 BODY:
The last time Neil Kinnock, the British Labor party leader, came to the White House, in March 1987, he had his work cut out for him, trying to convince President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger that the Anglo-American special relationship and the NATO alliance would actually be strengthened if Labor won the elections that year.
There he sat, spinning webs of Welsh eloquence around Labor's impossible defense position - unilateral nuclear disarmament and the forced withdrawal of American nuclear submarines, cruise missiles and bombers from England. The President consulted his cue cards, muttered that he was ''concerned'' about the effects of such a policy on the alliance, and let Weinberger poke holes in Kinnock's argument by asking skeptically whether Labor would be willing to multiply British defense spending on conventional arms to make up for the nuclear deterrent. 
What George Bush, who was also present at that March 1987 meeting, thought of Kinnock is not known, but there is little doubt that official Washington hoped that its loyal friend Prime Minister Thatcher could keep this Welsh windbag well clear of 10 Downing Street. Only Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware seemed to be impressed, lifting whole sections of Kinnock's rhetoric for his Presidential primary speeches, and paying for it with his candidacy. Kinnock hasn't been back to United States since then and a lot of things have changed. When Bush sees him in the White House on Tuesday, he will be well aware that Kinnock could indeed soon take the place of Maragaret Thatcher, increasingly unpopular after 11 years in the Prime Minister's office. At 48, he is 16 years her junior.
Most important, Kinnock has changed his party, and perhaps he's also changed himself. The former ban-the-bomb activist has tossed out the socialist militants who dominated Labor when he became leader in 1983, and gotten the rank and file to give up the unilateral disarmament policy. He no longer thunders about renationalization of the inefficient state industries privatized by Thatcher, but instead talks about how Labor can manage the market economy more efficiently than the Conservatives can, and make England a better member of the European Community to boot. With Thatcher nattering on about not surrendering the sovereignty of the British Parliament, and inflation at 9.7 percent running double that of West Germany or France, Kinnock makes an increasingly plausible argument.
His left-wing enemies say he's surrendered to Thatcherism. But Labor's new moderate policies reduced the center-left Liberal Democrats and Social Democrats - who had attracted droves of alienated Labor voters in the 80's - to such a marginal role that the Social Democrats disbanded their party early last month. This spring, Labor moved past the Conservatives (a.k.a. Tories) in the public opinion polls, soaring 20 to 25 points ahead. A lot of this is more Thatcher's doing than Kinnock's. She has been forcing the country to take its medicine for so long that many people have just gotten sick of her. What tipped the polls in Labor's favor was her most recent tug - the ''poll tax,'' a new per capita levy for local services that the Government calls the ''community charge,'' which replaced property taxes levied on only about a third of the electorate.
The Government's idea was that everybody over 18 - dukes and dustmen alike - should pay about the same amount of tax, set by local authorities across the country at rates that average $612 per person. The blow was doubly painful for homeowners who had followed Thatcher's advice and bought flats from the Government in the glory years of privatization. Then the Government jacked up interest rates to control inflation, sending variable-rate mortgage payments soaring to 15 percent and beyond. Thatcher characteristically ignored the warning signs and bashed ahead, arguing that angry voters would blame high-spending local authorities, many of them dominated by Labor. As protests mounted in March and militants turned rallies into riots, voters blamed the Prime Minister instead. Kinnock skillfully distanced Labor from the anarchism, and several weeks later his party swept to victories in parliamentary by-elections in the Conservative stronghold of mid-Staffordshire. After rioters swinging scaffolding poles and wooden clubs battled with police in Trafalgar Square, setting fire to parked Porsches and construction sites in the worst violence in Central London in 90 years, Thatcher even wobbled slightly and seemed in slight danger of being overthrown as party leader by her own disgruntled supporters.
She recovered somewhat in the May 3 muncipal elections. Though the Conservatives lost nationwide, they won important symbolic victories in the London boroughs of Westminster and Wandsworth, where they had managed to set two of the lowest poll tax rates in the country. They even took over control from Labor in the London borough of Ealing, where Kinnock has a corner brick house with a red door, a home that is reportedly worth $340,000, five times what he paid for it at the beginning of the Thatcher real-estate boom in 1981.
The victories enabled Thatcher to do what she does best, which is to wag her finger and say, ''See, I told you so.'' For the time being, most of the steam has gone out of the Conservative revolt, led by the silver-maned, 57-year-old Michael Heseltine, who walked out of Thatcher's Cabinet as Defense Minister in 1986 after a policy dispute. Labor's popularity dipped three months ago, but at the end of last month, the major polls still showed it was leading the Conservatives by about 49 percent to 38.
Barring an unforeseen personal crisis in the Thatcher household (her 75-year-old husband reportedly would like his 64-year-old wife to retire), or a suicidal full-scale mutiny among Conservative MP's, the next contest will probably be between Thatcher and Kinnock, sometime between now and June 1992, before the writ of the current Parliament runs out. In a negative campaign, Thatcher's unpopularity could be Labor's bigger electoral asset, just as Kinnock's inexperience could be the biggest thing going for the Tories.
Even among the British chattering classes, dominated by intellectuals who loathe Thatcherism and everything it stands for, it's hard to find many enthusiastic Kinnock supporters, though they acknowledge that Labor wouldn't have adopted its new moderate policies unless he had forced them through, Most political commentators dismiss Kinnock as a fuzzy-minded lightweight who has never held a Government job and has no grasp of policy details, a lazy debater who is regularly zapped by Thatcher's laser blasts in the House of Commons.
''Today's party, if the past could be forgotten, would not choose Neil Kinnock as its best shot,'' Hugo Young, The Guardian's political columnist, wrote in January, suggesting that many Labor members wished they could start all over and pick somebody like John Smith, an astute Scottish lawyer and the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. Unlike Kinnock, he has been a Cabinet minister. But experts do not think the Laborites will scuttle Kinnock, unless they want to disavow the whole process of change that has finally made them electable again.
Kinnock's problem isn't affability. When he lets himself go - increasingly seldom in these statesmanlike days of dark blue pin-stripe suits and rep ties - he's the kind of easygoing ordinary guy you'd feel comfortable having a beer with in the neighborhood pub. At Labor Party congresses, he used to greet people with, ''Hi, kid.''
Much of his time these days is spent closeted with his principal handlers: his press secretary, Julie Hall, and Peter Mandelson, Labor's media director, who adopted the Swedish Social Democrats' red rose as the party's new, soft image, to erase Arthur Scargill and his militant coal miners from the voters' minds after a decade of strikes, runaway inflation and steady national decline. Everybody knows what Thatcher stands for, but people aren't quite sure what Kinnock really believes; he has stood for so many contradictory things over the years. A campaigner for nuclear disarmament in the 60's and 70's, he now says Britain's independent nuclear deterrent is a useful means of encouraging the Soviet Union to keep cutting down its own and an essential part of the British strategic partnership with NATO and the United States.
His preference for 100 words where 10 would do when explaining his views raises suspicions that this is a man who either doesn't know or isn't saying what he really thinks. ''Throughout the late 1980's,'' as The Economist charitably put it not long ago, ''Mr. Kinnock had to blur his vision of where he wanted to lead the Labor Party, knowing that if he showed his hand too clearly or too early he would split the party, or be defeated, or both.''
In a sense, this is a man who's been trying hard all his life to be somebody else. The son of a coal miner from the poverty-stricken brick valleys of Tredegar in South Wales, Kinnock says his father ''would have been very disappointed if I hadn't been upwardly mobile.'' Unlike Thatcher, the grocer's daughter from Grantham, Kinnock didn't go to Oxford, a failure that English class snobbery seems to hold against him almost as much as his Welshness. ''What should one expect from a graduate in industrial relations at University College, Cardiff, in a thin year?'' Hugo Young once wrote.
This sort of gibe hurts Kinnock. He has sent his own son, Stephen, to Cambridge (his daughter, Rachel, attends the Hounslow Borough College), but he does not like journalists to observe his private life, or even his regular monthly forays to his constituency in South Wales. Julie Hall will tell you that Kinnock likes to sing (tenor) with a pickup Welsh male choir in London, and that he loves to watch (and sometimes even play) rugby, but she won't help you go to a game with him or even let you take tea with him in the House of Commons.
In the past, his wife, Glenys, whom he met at Cardiff University, added to the controversy. She is a strong political personality in her own right, though Kinnock and his advisers bridle at the suggestion that she is an eminence grise. But some of the things she has said make one wonder what the breakfast table talk about the ''special relationship'' with the United States would be like in a Kinnock 10 Downing Street.
In a letter to The Independent that was published just before the recent elections in Nicaragua, Glenys Kinnock wrote, ''The workers and peasants will acknowledge the achievements of the past 10 years and they will hope that the international community will at last feel able to end the isolation and stop the war.'' After the ''workers and peasants'' resoundingly repudiated the Sandinistas, neither she nor her husband, who had often described the Sandinistas as paragons of democracy compared with the United States-supported contras, had anything to say publicly about the results.
In asides at Labor gatherings, Kinnock often jokes that you probably never thought you'd hear him praising Ronald Reagan, whose breakthrough with Mikhail S. Gorbachev on nuclear arms negotiations he credits with making possible Labor's shift away from unilateral disarmament.
Kinnock's admirers say such changes of position are the finger-in-the-wind responses of an astute politician who saw firsthand how the leftist leadership of his mentor, Michael Foot, led his party to electoral disaster following Thatcher's popular victory in the Falklands War.
Kinnock's allies in the struggle are all handpicked aides who owe their party jobs to him. Among the closest are Larry Whitty, 47, party general secretary; Mandelson, a 36-year-old media specialist, whose grandfather Herbert Morrison was a Labor Party great of 50 years ago, and Charles Clarke, Kinnock's 39-year-old chief of staff.
The team was in place well before Kinnock's first try for the Prime Minister's office in his campaign against Thatcher in 1987, but Kinnock made the mistake then of thinking that he could win without any fundamental review of party policies. The election results, which gave the Conservatives a 101-seat majority, stunned him.
The two-year policy review that followed had to be undertaken, all the aides agreed, because it was clear from their polling that Labor could never win a national election as a party committed to unilateral nuclear disarmament, nationalization of industry and high income taxes - reduced by Thatcher to a maximum rate of 40 percent.
The ''old'' policies of the 80's were officially junked at the annual Labor conference in Brighton last October, but Kinnock had clearly signaled a year earlier where he was headed: ''The economy that we are faced with is a market economy, and we have got to make it work better than the Tories make it work.''
Many on the left though this kind of talk was betrayal. Kinnock explains it as dire political necessity. Smoking Capstan tobacco in a silver-stemmed pipe in the opposition leader's private red-carpeted office at the east end of the Palace of Westminster, behind the House of Commons chamber, Kinnock told me: ''For some sections of the movement, even defeat isn't enough to warn them about the inadequacy of what they were doing. What we needed to do was not to invent a new persona but to identify the things best about the Labor Party and then to insist, ruthlessly if necessary, that the best things were applied to the present and the future. I want the message to go through the movement and out to the public that we are constantly willing to take into account changing realities and constantly have the nerve to make the changes and say that we have.''
LABOR'S NEW domestic policies are sweet reason and responsibility: ''I will not spend money that the Government hasn't got,'' Kinnock declared on BBC television three weeks ago. A little earlier, he had said: ''It's no use using a slogan of full employment. In our commitment to training and education, and investment in the essential economic infrastructure, we are saying more about full employment than we could possibly say simply by using a convenient but less than fully illuminating phrase.''
Labor, he promised, would abandon Thatcher's illusion that the private sector, left to its own devices, could solve all economic problems. What it would do, he says in the same breath, would introduce a Government-business partnership. Asked how this was different from Conservatism as represented by such non-Thatcherites as Heseltine, Kinnock responded, as he often does, epigrammatically: ''We are committed to working with the market, not to worshipping the market.'' Even this fine-honed evasion would have sent his Welsh idol, the great Labor orator Aneurin Bevan, into fits.
Trying to explain Labor's tax policies in a BBC television interview in mid-June, Kinnock was slightly imprecise and had to be corrected later by John Smith. Kinnock had said that 14 out of 15 working taxpayers would not have to pay more under Labor; Smith explained that what he meant was 14 out of 15 working taxpayers paying the basic rate of 25 percent. But at the upper end of the scale, for the taxpayers who have benefited most from Thatcherism, Labor would raise the rate from 40 percent to 50 percent.
When asked about his alternative to the poll tax, which the Government currently has under review, Kinnock waffled: ''We've got our alternative, which as we've said very directly and very honestly is a tax, a local tax that is based on property and related directly to the ability to pay. We don't know precisely what our alternative is going to be an alternative to.''
Lack of specifics is a luxury a party in opposition may be able to afford, but a party in Government can't, and his critics say Kinnock is too often all at sea when it comes to details. In May 1989, just as the new Labor defense policies were being unveiled, Kinnock flew off the handle in a BBC radio interview with a political commentator, James Naughtie, who had been trying to get him to say exactly how Labor's handling of the economy would differ from the Government's.
Speaking into a microphone in a House of Commons studio at the other end of the line from his interviewer, Kinnock spluttered to a stop. Fuming, he went on to coin a new synonym for ''skewered'' - ''I'm not going to be bloody kebabbed'' - leaving the clear impression that he really didn't know.
Kinnock's short fuse is an old rap his opponents have long used against him. Before Christmas of 1986, indulging a well-known passion for Indian curry at a restaurant with his wife and friends, he became involved in an incident that the Conservatives said indicated that he would ''crack'' under pressure.
Two young men, apparently not admirers, spotted him and rushed over and hit him on the head with rolled-up newspapers. ''I got hold to the big one by the lapels and pushed him up against the wall and clipped him a couple of times,'' the stocky, 5-foot-10 Kinnock told Independent Television News later, maintaining that his response showed he was cool, collected and tough on crime.
''He's cracked,'' said John Gilbert, a Labor M.P., ''and once a man has cracked he'll crack again.''
In mano-a-mano with Thatcher in the twice-weekly Prime Minister's Question Time in the House of Commons, now seen in the United States on C-Span, Kinnock often looks cowed. Standing two swords' lengths across the dispatch boxes from the Prime Minister, when he rises to ask a question he usually does not look directly at her but leans down into the microphone, exposing his red-fringed bald pate to the glare of television lights and keeping his head bowed like a schoolboy expecting a scolding.
He seems to pull his punches. ''The reason is,'' he told me, is ''that she is a woman nearly 20 years older than myself, and even if I were to try - and I don't - to treat her as if she was a fella, it wouldn't work. If it's not chromosomic it's certainly something that I've got from my upbringing.''
In his first five years as opposition leader, Kinnock's performances were often dismissed as wordy hot-air balloons that Thatcher had no trouble in puncturing. But early last year he began keeping his questions to the point and sharpening them with wit, an effective weapon against the humorless Prime Minister. By autumn, Kinnock had one-liners refined to an art: ''When I hear the Prime Minister feeling sorry for the rest of the world, I understand why she has taken to calling herself 'we' - it is less lonely,'' he said, and brought down the House. This spring, he noted that Thatcher's recently appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, was obviously trying to wield a new broom. ''But that will not be terribly convincing as long as the broomstick is ridden by the Prime Minister,'' he cracked.
This sort of thing gets laughs but does not help establish Kinnock's gravitas. ''I don't believe for one moment that this country wants its national leader to be a jolly jester, a funny fellow, a cheeky chappy,'' said Thatcher's Home Secretary, David Waddington.
Kinnock's main task, Mandelson and Clarke believe, is to establish his seriousness as a credible Prime Minister. ''We have to fully and finally destroy the myth of Tory competence,'' Mandelson says. ''Beyond that, we have to get rooted in people's minds our alternative approach to Government, which is to coordinate, to lead, not, as Thatcher says, to keep hands off the economy. That's what Neil's got to be used for - encapsulating, with key messages, key arguments, key words.''
Mandelson will give up his post as communications director and run for a seat in Parliament, after the next party conference in October, but is expected to continue to play the key role in defining Labor's public image. The main internal issue at the conference, where party policy is set by delegates outnumbered by blocs of hundreds of thousands of votes controlled by the trade unions, will be a move by Kinnock and the leadership to whittle the bloc vote down from 90 percent to 70 percent, with the prospect of a further cut to 40 percent.
Clarke confirmed that a spate of trips to European capitals by Kinnock earlier this year was aimed at positioning him to exploit the splits in Conservative ranks caused by Thatcher's uncompromising opposition to European unification, which Kinnock is trying to get his party to embrace before the next election. So far, all he's been able to do is elicit a pledge that Labor will be ''strong in Europe,'' a far cry, though, from the days when the party was calling for Britain to get out of the European Community altogether.
In front of large, friendly crowds, hands gripping the lectern, torso moving with the melodious Welsh lilt of his voice, Kinnock uses the power of emotion to bring his listeners along. In an election campaign, he will need to convince British voters that he can be as effective an executive as Thatcher has been. His supporters say he's demonstrated that he can be just as ruthless, by watering down the power of the big unions that dominated Labor and nearly brought the country to economic standstill in the late 70's and early 80's.
Although the national mood has gone sour on Thatcher, she will try to turn it around before she calls the next election. The Conservatives have been most unpopular when mortgage rates were high. Thatcher could bring them down, perhaps, by taking the pound sterling into the European exchange rate mechanism once inflation starts to fall and pegging it more closely to the stable West German mark. If inflation and mortgage rates are low enough by the middle of next year, some of her advisers say she might call a snap election then.
Whenever it comes, the election could be decided more by negative factors than positive ones. If the voters are indeed tired of Thatcher and no longer buy her rap against Labor as the party of strikes, socialism and soaring inflation, they may elect Kinnock. If they are still unsure of what Kinnock really stands for, they may leave him where he's already had a longer continuous run than any other figure in modern British political history - leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. The only thing clear now is that it's no longer unthinkable that Kinnock could become Prime Minister.

LYING TOGETHER, by D. M. Thomas. (Viking, $17.95.) The final novel of the author's ''Russian Nights'' quintet purports to be an improvisation by characters from the other four; the engaging, witty result grapples with big issues like meaning and truth.
 
AN OPEN ADOPTION, by Lincoln Caplan. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $17.95.) Part research paper, part thriller, this case study broadens to examine a form of placement in which biological and adoptive parents are well known to one another.

TO ''HERLAND'' AND BEYOND
The Life and Work of Charlotte Perkins Gilman.
By Ann J. Lane.
Illustrated. 413 pages. New York:
Pantheon Books. $29.95.
Ann J. Lane begins her remarkable biography of Charlotte Perkins Gilman with the words, ''This is the story of my Charlotte.'' Later in the preface she describes the ''dialogue'' she has had with Gilman, and identifies other dialogues as well: between Ms. Lane and her readers, between Gilman's life and Gilman's work, between the old and the young Charlottes. 
In adopting such a personal, reflective biographical mode Ms. Lane -a professor of history at the University of Virginia - has joined other feminist scholars who are currently experimenting with innovative ways of telling the tales of women's lives. Although standard, chronological studies of individual women continue to appear, many feminists have become dissatisfied with conventional approaches to writing biographies of female subjects. They have accordingly begun to develop new methods of storytelling. Some of them even become explicit presences in the works they produce, a strategy rarely - if ever - adopted by male authors of books about men.
Thus near the end of the book Ann Lane directly describes an interview in 1978 with Gilman's daughter, then 93 and living in a California nursing home. ''She seemed unable to comprehend the point of my visit,'' Ms. Lane tells her readers. ''Why would I want to write a book about her mother? . . . Since it was clear that Katharine Chamberlin had her wits about her, I concluded that her reluctance to understand my visit had to do with her reluctance to acknowledge the growing respect for her mother's work.'' Ms. Lane then goes on to discuss what Chamberlin told her in that and subsequent interviews and to relate their content to what Chamberlin wrote about her mother in an autobiography and in correspondence with archivists interested in her mother's papers. Her personal encounter with Chamberlin becomes for Ms. Lane a key datum in her search for the woman she calls ''my Charlotte.''
Although ''To 'Herland' and Beyond'' proceeds in roughly chronological fashion, its chief organizing principle is not time but rather the primary relationships in Gilman's life. With two exceptions, the chapters focus serially on Gilman's successive interactions with other persons named in the chapter titles - Gilman's parents, her two husbands, three close female friends, a doctor who treated her, her daughter. This unusual plan works exceedingly well, as Ms. Lane returns repeatedly to similar themes that link the chapters while also exploring the development of each relationship over time. It is in this creative organizational scheme that the author's dialogue with Gilman is most fully realized.
Who then was the woman with whom Ms. Lane has held such an extended dialogue? Charlotte Perkins was born in 1860, to a lesser branch of the Beecher family - her father's mother was the sister of those famous siblings Catharine and Henry Ward Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Charlotte had little to do with these prominent relatives as she was growing up, however, for her parents separated when she was very young, finally divorcing in 1870. She and her brother were raised in genteel poverty by their mother, living in a succession of relatives' homes, boarding houses and other temporary lodgings.
The young Charlotte, who wrote fiction and poetry and kept a journal, revealed in her writings an intense conflict between her desire to be useful in the world - to have a career, though in what area was unclear - and her strong attraction to conventional married life. That conflict remained unresolved until her second marriage in 1900. Ms. Lane demonstrates how, during a lengthy epistolary courtship with her first cousin Houghton Gilman, the mature Charlotte came to understand that marriage and career could indeed be combined under the right circumstances. Before then, she had endured an unhappy first marriage, during which the birth of her daughter Katharine induced the deep depression that nearly drove her insane and led her to abandon her husband and daughter. Although the latter act caused a scandal of major proportions, she went on to forge a satisfying public career as a prolific author and lecturer.
It was her fascination with Gilman's writings, Ms. Lane tells her readers, that first interested her in this often-tormented woman. The feminist Utopian novel ''Herland''; ''The Yellow Wallpaper,'' a short story describing a woman's descent into madness, based partly on Gilman's own experiences; and theoretical works like ''Women and Economics,'' which have gained new admirers for their trenchant, gender-based analysis: all reveal an original and creative thinker. Gilman, Ms. Lane admits, was both a racist and an elitist. Yet her insistence on placing women at the center of her inquiry makes her stand out among her male and female contemporaries and renders her ideas relevant nearly a century after they were first expounded.
Given Ms. Lane's motives for embarking upon this biography, it is ironic that the dialogue between Gilman's life and work, alluded to in the title as well as in the preface, is the least satisfactory of the dialogues in the book. The two chapters not focused on relationships are entitled simply ''Work: Part I'' and ''Work: Part II.'' On the whole, they merely summarize the contents of Gilman's major writings - sometimes at great length, as in the 21 pages devoted to ''Women and Economics'' - and to no apparent purpose. Only in the discussion of ''The Yellow Wallpaper'' does Ms. Lane adequately connect the themes of Gilman's life with the themes of her writings. Readers are left to puzzle about this unfinished dialogue as they recognize in Gilman's work certain emphases that seem to resonate with Gilman's life experiences. What does Ms. Lane think about such resonances? To what extent did Gilman's work reflect or transcend the limitations of her personal experiences? Ms. Lane leaves such questions unasked and unanswered.
Even so, Ann Lane has performed her own useful public service by exposing to our eyes her longstanding dialogue with Charlotte Perkins Gilman. As Ms. Lane informs us in her preface, the nature of that dialogue changed while she worked on the book. I suspect that readers will find the same thing happening to them as they read.

AN AMERICAN LOOKS AT BRITAIN
By Richard Critchfield.
496 pp. New York:
Doubleday. $22.95.
Almost everyone agrees that something has been deeply wrong with Britain for many years, but what? Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher thinks it's ''socialism,'' the postwar consensus on cradle-to-grave welfare. The Labor Party thinks it's Thatcherism, which, fading at the edges after 11 years, has begun to reveal that economic and social malaise didn't stop with the North Sea oil boom. There must be some explanation for the increasing vulgarity and sheer bloody-mindedness in so much of British life, evident in everything from riots in Trafalgar Square to the complete boorishness evinced even by the most refined of the Queen's subjects once they get behind the wheel of an automobile. 
Richard Critchfield, a distinguished American foreign correspondent for the old Washington Star and a contributor to The Economist and other publications, who spent years reporting from the villages of former British colonies and from other cultures in India, Africa, Latin America and Asia, has come up with two familiar answers in this idiosyncratic book which is, as he acknowledges in his introduction, really about British culture rather than about Britain.
The first is that the British governing class has never recovered the faith in God, country or itself that it lost between 1914 and 1945. The second is that, nevertheless, it has basically refused to move aside and let anybody else run the country in its place.
The idiosyncrasy of Mr. Critchfield's approach is his explanation for the paradox: the British elite holds on because it is the arbiter of one of the most powerful instruments ever devised by the human race, the English language. What is wrong with Britain, he suggests, is that it has fallen in love with the sound of its own voice, which he lets us hear in all its eloquence in a book that is full of extended direct quotes, the British talking as only the British can about Britain.
To ''arrive'' in British society today, Mr. Critchfield amply demonstrates, one still has to have gone to Oxford or Cambridge and speak in their plummy tones. Moreover, one has to sound like that to be taken really seriously by people in most of the rest of the world, who consider American and English two different languages.
''Britain's educational system perpetuates the class and cultural divisions that hold the country back,'' he writes. ''There is nothing new or original about this perception. The British themselves have been complaining about it for thirty, forty years. Nonetheless, not much changes.''
One wonders (the British would never say ''you wonder'') why. This book does not really provide an answer, because Mr. Critchfield himself has been hypnotized by the British razzle-dazzle with words; he charms and fascinates us even as he falls under the spell. A whole section on the loss of empire and its importance to understanding contemporary Britain, for example, turns into an account of the making of ''The Jewel in the Crown,'' the dramatic television series adapted from Paul Scott's ''Raj Quartet'' that was shown on ''Masterpiece Theater'' in the 1980's.
Ultimately, the author says, words without faith are empty, and it is when he wonders whether the British really believe in anything anymore that he comes closest to explaining what has gone wrong. ''The great continuing theme of English letters going back to Matthew Arnold's 'Dover Beach' has been the loss of spiritual faith,'' he writes. ''Any society's loss of faith - in life, in the world, in the spiritual, in itself - can affect everything: how hard people work, how inventive they are, how much initiative they take, in short, their enterprise.''
In a leap of faith, he concludes that the British will recover their nerve, perhaps finding a new creed to take them into the next century in a real commitment to science and technology. The British, who usually find little merit in criticisms from mere foreigners, would do well to read his exhortations.

A HISTORY OF SOUTH AFRICA
By Leonard Thompson.
Illustrated. 288 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $29.95.
An old Zulu proverb warns that ''those who meet will meet again.'' Sure enough, thanks to massive pressures for change, South Africans who only recently met as jailer and prisoner, oppressor and oppressed, are today meeting again - as leaders trying to negotiate a new form of government. President F. W. de Klerk, the African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and their colleagues have undertaken a herculean task. As Leonard Thompson's admirably objective history of South Africa makes clear, whites have held racist attitudes ever since Dutch settlers first landed at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652; blacks - the term now commonly used to include ''coloreds'' (those of mixed blood) and Indians as well as Africans - have endless grievances to be redressed; and people within all ethnic groups have differing concepts of how the country should be governed. Nevertheless, in reading between Mr. Thompson's copiously documented lines, one finds grounds to hope that reason, compromise and reconciliation will prevail. 
Unlike many historians of the country, Mr. Thompson, the director of the southern African research program at Yale University, begins ''A History of South Africa'' by discussing the cultures of the country's original inhabitants: the San hunter-gatherers (usually called ''Bushmen'' by Europeans), the Khoikhoi pastoralists (dubbed ''Hottentots'') and the many communities of farmers. In so doing, he destroys many shibboleths about Africans being unproductive, uncompetitive or generally ''uncivilized''; he also shows that their governments, although headed by authoritarian chiefs, depended heavily upon the consent and participation of the governed. ''The Basotho,'' he notes, ''had two sayings that summed up the underlying tension: 'Morena ha a fose' (The chief can do no wrong) and 'Morena ke batho' (No people, no chief).'' He also says African justice focused on restoring harmony to the community rather than on exacting retribution.
Neither ethnic background nor skin color was a barrier to full membership in African societies. The Xhosas, for example, incorporated not only other black Africans but also the lighter-skinned Khoikhoi. ''The limits of Xhosadom were not ethnic or geographic,'' Mr. Thompson writes, ''but political: all persons or groups who accepted the rule of the Tshawe [the ruling family] thereby became Xhosa.'' Likewise, when the conqueror Shaka built his formidable Zulu kingdom in the early 19th century, ''every inhabitant, whatever his origins, became a Zulu.'' Even Europeans were no exception, the author tells us; among the Xhosas there were two clans, the Lungu and the Mholo, who traced their descent from the European survivors of shipwrecks. The 19th-century English trader John Dunn became not only a Zulu chief and adviser to the king but also the husband of 46 Zulu women.
The Africans' willingness to accept others was not, unfortunately, shared by ''the white invaders'' - first the amalgam of Dutch, French and Germans who became the Afrikaners, then the British who gained the Cape Colony during the Napoleonic Wars and subdued the rest of what is now South Africa by the turn of the 20th century. Coming from Europe - where, Mr. Thompson writes, ''ethnic chauvinism was already deeply embedded in the popular psyche'' - the early settlers soon became dependent on the labor of both indigenous blacks and slaves imported from Indonesia, India, Ceylon, Madagascar and Mozambique. Racial differences thereby became virtually synonymous with class differences, thus reinforcing white attitudes of superiority and setting a pattern of relations that endured until only recently.
Despite the social cleavages, however, interracial contacts took place from the start: with women in short supply, there were marriages between European men and freed slaves and numerous other liaisons, so that, in the author's words, ''it has been estimated that approximately 7 percent of the genes of the modern Afrikaner people originated outside Europe.'' The British, although pressed by humanitarian groups to free all slaves and accord blacks better legal treatment, extended the segregation, pass requirements and other humiliations started by the Afrikaners. And although they granted qualified franchise to the blacks in the Cape Colony, ''no black person ever became a member of the parliament or cabinet, and laws were passed to check the increase of the black members of the electorate, who never numbered more than 15 percent of the total.''
While the British were building their empire, Afrikaners built independent republics, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. Here they adamantly denied political rights to blacks, yet were egalitarian and democratic among themselves, even borrowing some ideas from the United States Constitution. Unlike the Nazis, with whom they are sometimes compared, they had no tradition of standing armies or all-powerful leaders, and hence no history of coups. Always survivors, they surrendered to the hated British after the Boer War rather than face complete destruction, and such Afrikaner heroes as Jan Smuts proceeded not only to cooperate with the British but to become leaders of the new Union of South Africa. And while most Afrikaners - and the British as well - were developing rationales for racism, a few indicated that they might not be committed to it irrevocably. Smuts' colleague J. H. Hofmeyr even told Parliament in the 1930's of his hope for ''the ultimate removal of the colour bar from our constitution.'' Such precedents, cited by Mr. Thompson, suggest why Mr. de Klerk today is willing to gamble on a new survival strategy and why he believes the majority of Afrikaners will follow him.
With the election in 1948 of the militant Afrikaner National Party, which advocated apartheid as the way to handle the recent heavy influx of Africans, segregation became an ideology. Classified into racial groups, compelled to live in areas, use facilities and perform jobs designated for their group, people were to have as little contact as possible with members of other groups. Africans were to be resettled in 10 tribal ''homelands,'' which, when granted independence, would presumably rid the country of its main race problem. As Mr. Thompson carefully demonstrates, however, the apartheid system was doomed almost from the start. While the Government was shipping as many Africans as possible to the homelands, the growing economy was becoming ever more dependent on Africans - not just for menial labor, but for skilled and professional manpower and consumer power as well. As the homelands became ever more overpopulated and impoverished, more Africans migrated to the urban areas. The gross inconsistencies and injustices, increasingly opposed by whites as well as blacks, spurred the growth of the anti-apartheid movement.
Mr. Thompson traces the history of the African National Congress from its founding in 1912 as the South African Native National Congress, showing why it turned to violence in 1960 and why some members, weary of relying on white support, broke away in 1959 to form the Pan-Africanist Congress. He discusses such later movements as the Azanian African People's Organization and the Zulu-based Inkatha, touches on the Communist Party - for many years the only multiracial organization around - and gives an excellent analysis of the crucial role of trade unions in bringing governmental concessions. These internal forces, assisted by mounting outside pressures, compelled the Government by 1986 to reverse many basic apartheid policies and to begin exploring arrangements in which Africans might at last be treated as full citizens. The book ends with the election of Mr. de Klerk in 1989, and with the conclusion that the outcome remains in doubt as to whether fundamental change from above, piecemeal peaceful change or revolution will finally end the apartheid state.
There are a few pertinent facts that Mr. Thompson neglects to mention. For example, a reference to the traditional system of values known as African humanism, with its belief that all people are children of God, would have helped explain the remarkable absence of rancor among most Africans. The British colonel C. F. Stallard, whose theory between the world wars that Africans were merely ''temporary sojourners'' among whites foreshadowed the ideology of apartheid, deserves at least a footnote. And there could have been some mention of the sense of remorse that has been sweeping Afrikaners in recent years. But these are very minor omissions amid the wealth of material that Mr. Thompson has so ably presented. ''A History of South Africa'' will be most useful in contemplating the country's future.

High-End Sales Are Down in Greenwich

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
In northeast Greenwich, 26 stately pleasure domes have been built at Conyers Farm, a 1,500-acre enclave resembling a contemporary Xanadu. Maintaining its private, pastoral quality is a set of covenants under which no more than 60 families may live on minimum lots of 10 acres, protected in perpetuity by deed restrictions.
Since it opened in 1985, four or five parcels a year have been sold at prices starting at $155,000 an acre. But with sales down to zero in 1990, the developer has changed brokers in an effort to stimulate interest. 
Greenwich's high-end properties, starting at $1.5 million, have been remarkably resilient through the general economic slump, but now''sales are down by 50 percent from the same period last year,'' said Peter Helie, president of William Pitt, a real estate agency based in Stamford that is affiliated with Sotheby's International Realty in Manhattan. The firms are now handling sales jointly at Conyers Farm.
Marketed as an equestrian community, this development of rolling hills, woods and meadows is patrolled by private security guards and electronically operated gates 24 hours a day. It has a polo field, grandstand and clubhouse with an indoor tennis court. Polo matches are open to the public on Sunday afternoons in the summer for a fee of $15 a car, and prizes are frequently given for the most imaginative tailgate picnic.
Lots on the shores of Converse Lake, a 100-acre body of water in the middle of the property, have an asking price of $250,000 an acre. The most recently sold lakeside lot of 10 acres brought $2.25 million last year. Homes range in size from approximately 13,000 square feet to 22,000 square feet, custom built for sums that begin at $3 million.
Some residents have purchased more than one 10-acre lot and spent up to $2 million on horse barns, paddocks, fencing and pasture, in addition to the cost of their homes. Some of them have sons who are members of the United States Olympic Equestrian Team.
Ivan Lendl, the tennis star, bought five lots. He retains two and is offering the other three for sale at slightly higher prices. Because he bought multiple lots he is exempt from a requirement to build a house within two years or sell the land. Other restrictions control fencing, landscaping, tree removal, buffer areas around waterways, garbage storage, television antennas, business use of property, siting of houses and architecture.
Assessments for security, snow-plowing, maintenance of the 6.5 miles of common roads, landscaping, trees and the clubhouse are around $5,800 a year.
Peter Brant, a polo enthusiast and owner of Bato Company and Riviere du Loup Newsprint Ltd. in Greenwich, bought the property for $18 million in 1980.
For the past 20 years, he has lived at White Birch Farm, a 200-acre spread facing Conyers Farm on North Street, with a polo field and training track. Last spring he was convicted in Federal Court in Bridgeport of charging $1.5 million worth of personal items to business accounts and was sentenced to three months in the Federal Correctional Institute in Danbury, starting Sept. 17.
He was also fined $200,000 and required to perform 500 hours of community service. Mr. Brant has an unlisted phone number and Joan Caldwell, his property manager, said he could not be located for an interview.
Miss Caldwell said his difficulties ''are not likely to affect his business, the real estate development or his personal finances.''
''Mr. Brant came to us because we can provide a worldwide source of buyers at our 56 offices in 27 countries,'' said Thomas B. Anderson, senior vice president for the metropolitan New York area at Sotheby's in Manhattan.
Jesse Sammis 3d, a principal in Sammis & Chadsey, a Greenwich real estate firm that formerly handled Conyers Farm, is independently marketing 10 resales by six lot owners. ''We closed on a 10-acre lot for $1.8 million at the end of June,'' he said.
Some 50 out of 95 lots have been sold since 1985. Two disputes over architectural designs, subject to review by a committee of the residents' association and a paid architectural consultant, resulted in litigation, ''but were settled out of court,'' said Miss Caldwell. Owners who failed to build houses, she said, ''negotiated with the result that we bought back some properties; others were sold on the open market.''
''Conyers Farm is the nicest place to buy in town,'' said Stanley J. Klein, president of Empire Realty, a Greenwich firm that tracks local sales and trends. ''It's a mix of old and new money, hard work and inheritance. Only these days a lot of people with that kind of money are buying 1,000 acres in Vermont for a million and a half.''
Conyers is the old English spelling of Converse, the surname of Edmund Converse, a founder of United States Steel and Bankers Trust of New York, who assembled the land in the early 1900's and named it Conyers Manor. An English country house and 40 outbuildings that he constructed were part of a working dairy farm and fruit orchard for more than two decades. The manor house burned down many years ago and some of the outbuildings have been restored as homes, guest houses and horse barns by Conyers Farm residents.
In 1936, Mr. Converse sold the property for $800,000 to the founder of Schenley Distillers, Lewis Rosenstiel, who shocked Greenwich in the early 70's by attempting to downzone the property from four acres to quarter-acre lots. When he sued the town for rejecting his scheme to build hundreds of moderate-cost housing units, state courts struck down his plan as an overwhelming burden on municipal resources.
Because there is no town water or sewage in north Greenwich, residents must dig wells and install septic systems. Fire protection is available from central Greenwich and nearby Banksville in New York State, where 300 acres of Conyers Farm lie.
To protect the water supply and prevent erosion of pastures, horse owners must submit a waste removal plan and horse management plan to the town's Planning and Zoning Commission. Residents are allowed one horse on 20,000 square feet or 20 horses on 10 acres. More than six horses on three or more acres requires special approval from the Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals.
''Problems for some people are opportunities for others,'' said Mr. Sammis. ''Lots of people are still making money and there is nothing else available where you can get this much property surrounded by other large properties in a prestigious community 45 minutes from Manhattan.''

Law Firms Top Financial Houses in Rental Activity

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
In one of the biggest deals of a slow year, the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy has signed a 20-year lease for at least 330,000 square feet at One Chase Manhattan Plaza in lower Manhattan, with options that could bring its space to 750,000 square feet - or fully one-third of the tower.
The transaction, which was announced last Monday, exemplifies the fact that law firms have become the most prominent players in the Manhattan leasing market, because they still need room to accommodate the tremendous growth that began in the 80's or simply because they have reached the end of their old leases in a buyers' market.
From January to May, legal-service concerns signed leases for more than 773,000 square feet in mid-Manhattan and lower Manhattan, almost 14 percent of the 5.7 million square feet leased during that period, according to the latest statistics from the Cushman & Wakefield brokerage. Financial-service concerns signed leases for 550,000 square feet, or nearly 10 percent. This continues a trend that began last year, when law firms first overtook financial houses. 
Other key players in the current leasing market are banks, which signed leases for 711,000 square feet of space from January to May this year; accounting firms, which took 636,000 square feet and insurance companies, which took 581,000 square feet.
''Today, the law firms are still in a growth mode,'' said Edward S. Gordon, president of the real estate concern that bears his name, which represented Chase Manhattan Bank, owners of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, in the Milbank transaction.
Three years ago, in contrast, the giant securities firms and financial houses were responsible for 28 percent of the 15.9 million square feet of space leased, Cushman & Wakefield figures show. The legal service industry accounted for only 10 percent and accounting firms for 3 percent.
Leading the deals so far this year has been the Milbank lease in the Chase Manhattan headquarters tower, at Nassau, Liberty, William and Pine Streets.
''This new lease reflects the significant growth that Milbank has enjoyed in the past few years,'' said Floyd Brandow, chairman of the firm's space committee, ''and is a renewal of our commitment to the Wall Street area, where so many of our clients are and where we have had our offices for the past 124 years.''
By this fall, the firm plans to have expanded from six to 10 floors in the 60-story tower. Mr. Brandow disclosed nothing about the rent that Milbank would pay other than to say that ''we have negotiated an attractive lease.'' Although Milbank explored moving to mid-Manhattan, he said ''nothing persuaded us to leave this building or this area.''
In another large deal, Olwine, Connelly, Chase, O'Donnell & Wehyer has signed a 20-year lease for 150,000 square feet at 750 Seventh Avenue, a 35-story tower by Solomon Equities that is now under construction at 49th Street. And Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker has signed a 23-year lease for 150,000 square feet in the Mobil Building at 150 East 42d Street.
''The law firms have been the most exciting part of this market,'' said Ira Schuman, a senior vice president at the Julien J. Studley real estate concern, which represented the Wilson Elser firm. ''It doesn't reflect current activity at law firms. It reflects the pent-up expansion that's been taking place over the past six or seven years. It's not that the legal business is so fabulous that people are now taking enormous amounts of space. But they are reflecting past demand. That's the phenomenon we're seeing.''
Pent-up demand was one thing that prompted Davis Polk & Wardwell, which has 250,000 square feet at One Chase Manhattan Plaza, to sign up for almost 500,000 square feet at 450 Lexington Avenue. That tower, under construction between 44th and 45th Streets, is being developed by Gerald D. Hines, Fred Wilpon and the Prudential Insurance Company.
''We're very crowded right now,'' said Colin E. Harley, one of the partners at Davis Polk who negotiated the new lease. ''We long ago ran out of space. Not only do we have to accommodate that growth, but we have to anticipate future growth.''
Mr. Harley said Davis Polk found that ''our present landlord was taking a very tough position on rent and the midtown proposal was less expensive.''
Growth and the cost of space were two of the principal reasons cited by the firm of Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood, which has signed a lease for 340,000 square feet (some of which it will sublet) in the former J. C. Penney Building, 1301 Avenue of the Americas, between 52d and 53d Streets. The firm now occupies less than 200,000 square feet in its headquarters at 140 Broadway, between Cedar and Liberty Streets, and an office at 101 Park Avenue, at 40th Street.
Expansion is not the only reason for the flurry of leasing activity. ''It depends on which firm you're talking about,'' said James S. Vanderslice, a senior vice president at Cushman & Wakefield, which represented the Olwine Connelly firm. ''Sometimes, it's making an attractive economic deal. Sometimes, it's getting into a state-of-the-art building that fits in with the needs of the firm. Sometimes, it could be floor layouts.'' Nearing the end of its lease at One State Street Plaza, the firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton began a search that ended last month with a move into 253,000 square feet at One Liberty Plaza, on Broadway, between Liberty and Cortlandt Streets.
No matter all the talk about the extremely high vacancy rates in Manhattan, the partners at Cleary Gottlieb found that there were very few buildings in the city that came close to meeting their needs, which included floors that were large enough to accommodate an essentially horizontal operation, but not so large as to be overwhelming.
Speaking about the leasing by law firms, Mr. Schuman, at the Studley brokerage, said: ''What it does do is put a premium on the large spaces. It's meaningless to have a 15-percent vacancy rate if it's all in small units. That's one of the paradoxes of this office-space market, which is that the very best space is still in short supply. The very best space still commands $50-plus rents.''
But Mr. Schuman also said he expected less activity among law firms in the future than there had been in the past two years. ''I think they will not take as aggressive a position as they have in the past,'' he said. ''I see law firms very, very seriously reconsidering how they use their space internally and giving serious thoughts to doubling up their associates.''
Although Davis Polk is taking steps to provide private offices for younger lawyers who are now doubled up, Mr. Harley agreed that the general trend was to less, rather than more, expansion. Indeed, he said, his firm took a 20-year average when attempting to calculate its future needs - factoring in the lower growth rate of the 1970's - rather than relying strictly on the more recent pace.
Of the legal profession generally, he said: ''I don't think there's much lateral hiring activity out there anymore because of concerns about the business slowing down this year. I doubt that you'll see many firms continuing the growth they had in the 1980's.''
''All the majors seem to have made their deals,'' said John M. Cefaly, executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield. Looking ahead, he said: ''I think there's a question as to where the market is headed. That's what people are waiting to see. There are a lot of tire-kickers out there, a lot of of people looking for bargains. I don't see any one particular industry leading the charge. It seems to be pretty well spread out.''
And, after all, it is possible to invest leasing statistics with too much significance, as Mr. Gordon pointed out. ''If you were to look at the trends of the last 20 years or even longer,'' he said, ''you're seeing - constantly - new industries, businesses and professions moving into the forefront. It would seem to be a constant movement of business, almost like shifting sands. Lots of people are looking for so-called trends. I'm not sure there is such an animal.''

Passing Along Costs
 
Question: I own an occupied, rent-stabilized apartment in Riverdale. Recently, new windows were installed throughout the building and I have started paying an assessment that will last for the next year to cover the costs of that project as well as other scheduled improvements. The assessment has put me in a negative cash-flow position. I would like to know if I can increase my tenant's rent to cover a portion of my share for these costs? . . . J. P., Yonkers, N.Y. 
 
Answer: No. The only legal way that such costs can be passed along to tenants is through a major capital improvement rent increase granted by the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which has jurisdicition over rent-regulated housing.
According to Thomas R. Viola, spokesman for the agency, an individual apartment owner is not an eligible applicant for an M.C.I. increase. Mr. Viola said that in the case of a co-op that still has rental tenants, any application for such an increase would have to come from the sponsor of the conversion or the co-op board. But while a sponsor holding rent-regulated units might make such an application, it is not likely that a co-op board would do so because it would hold no benefit for resident shareholders.
 
A Noisy Neighbor
 
Question: I live in a co-op and my problem is a noisy neighbor above me who rents his apartment. He stomps about the apartment and moves furniture at all hours. The managing agent has spoken to him aobut putting down carpeting but he says he can't afford it. Is there any New York City law that says he must cover his floor? . . . R. V., Brooklyn
 
Answer: No. There is no statute requiring a residential tenants to carpet their floors. However, many co-ops, condominiums and rental buildings have house rules requiring that tenants cover a certain amount of floor space with rugs or carpeting.
While any legal challenge to a tenant's refusal to comply would not carry the weight of the law, your building's manager, as the agent of the co-op board, would have the right to insist that your upstairs neighbor stop disturbing you. Since your co-op apparently does not have a carpet rule, you might write to the board and suggest that one be adopted.
 
Mortgage for a Co-op
 
Question: Does a co-op board's interview committee have the right to turn down a prospective purchaser based on financial qualifications, even if the buyer has met the bank's requirements for a mortgage? . . . P. C., Peekskill, N.Y.
 
Answer: Yes. According to Stuart Saft, an attorney who is a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, one reason the financial criteria of some co-ops are stiffer that those used by many banks is that the co-op's concern goes beyond a shareholder's ability to meet his mortgage obligations.
''It is conceivable that the bank could grant a loan to someone who could meet initial maintenance costs,'' he said, ''but not handle a substantial hike if the board decided it was necessary.''
Mr. Saft said that most co-ops where the majority of residents are owners require that buyers make cash down payments of 25 to 50 percent of the purchase price. However, he said some co-ops will accept an arrangement whereby the buyer fills the gap between the mortgage amount and the board's cash requirement with borrowed money. ''What is important to the co-op,'' Mr. Saft said, ''is how high a lien the bank will have against the building, not how the borrower comes up with the cash to meet its requirements.''

HEADLINE: New York City's Property-Tax Squeeze

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
In what may lead to a larger battle over New York City's property tax system, the City Council has approved tax rates for the current fiscal year that hold down increases for the owners of cooperatives, condominiums and rental apartments.
The limits, adopted in last-minute negotiations on the city's $28 billion budget as the fiscal year began on July 1, are far from a windfall. Struggling with severe economic problems, the city has imposed $263 million in new property taxes, and bills will increase for almost all owners, including apartment owners.
But behind the decision to cut the rate on apartment properties this year, according to political analysts and Council members, is mounting opposition to the city's tax structure, a complex system shaped by years of political arm twisting and infused, according to its critics, with glaring inequities.
At the heart of the system, employed since fiscal 1983, are four classes of property, with tax bills based on different formulas for each. The classes are one- to three-family homes, apartment buildings (including cooperatives, condominiums and rentals), utility property, and other types of commercial property. 
In adopting the new rates for the 1991 fiscal year, the City Council accepted changes that reflect growing political strength among co-op and condominium owners. The tax rate on their class of property, which also includes rental apartment buildings, was lowered slightly to 9.154 from 9.229 in the last fiscal year.
The rate is the percent of every $100 in assessed value that will be billed as tax. All other rates were increased: to 9.840 from 9.452 for one- to three-family homes; to 15.079 from 12.903 for utility properties, and to 9.924 from 9.539 for commercial buildings.
Pressure to lower the rate on co-ops, condominiums and rentals came largely from the City Council's Manhattan delegation, whose constituents include a larger share of co-op and condominium owners than those in the other boroughs.
LONG before the New York City system was established, groups representing homeowners, large landlords, corporate tenants and developers all claimed to be paying an unfair share of the tax burden.
But research in recent months by several groups and government agencies has produced solid evidence of wide inequities. Calls for reform are being heightened by the slowdown in the city economy, which is putting a financial squeeze on most taxpayers, and more particularly by the weak real estate market, in which many owners fear that their property values have declined at the same time their tax bills have risen.
Beneficiaries of the system include the owners of one- to three-family homes in some wealthy neighborhoods, according to a recent report by Edward V. Regan, the New York State Comptroller. In one example, it found that the owners of a brownstone in the prosperous Brooklyn Heights neighborhood were likely to be paying about half as much tax in proportion to the value of their homes as those in the nearby Fort Greene section.
Co-op and condominium owners pay far higher taxes. City records show that those who own two-bedroom apartments are likely to be paying as much or more than those with one- to three-family homes. Taxes on commercial property, which have risen faster than on residential property, are prompting some business people to warn that buildings will be abandoned and many small merchants forced out of business.
''Ten years ago the assumption was that people in one- to three-family homes paid their property taxes and voted, and those in apartment buildings were renters who didn't care,'' said Councilman Robert J. Dryfoos, a Manhattan Democrat-Liberal who sponsored the reduction in rates. ''That attitude has changed, and we have only seen the beginning of advocacy on this issue.''
Tax rates are only part of the equation for setting taxes. Since tax assessments have been rising on almost all properties, even a slightly lower rate will not prevent higher tax bills this year.
Indeed, many critics maintain that constraints on the city's tax assessment procedures have created greater problems than the tax rates.
Under the same state legislation that established the city's four classes of property, assessment increases are limited sharply for one- to three-family homes.
The result is that the assessed value of the one- to three-family home was held down during the real estate boom years of the 80's. A study by Dean Michael Mead, an analyst for the Citizens Budget Commission, found that the average small residential property was now assessed at only 9 percent of its market value, while larger apartment buildings and commercial properties were at 45 percent of their market value.
That means a one-family home in the city with a market value of $200,000 would be assessed at $18,000. Calculating its tax at the 1991 rate of 9.9840, its bill for the year would be $1,797.12. In contrast, a co-op or commercial property worth $200,000 would be assessed at $90,000. The co-op, with a tax rate of 9.154, would have $8,238.60 in tax, and the commercial property, with a rate of 9.924, would have $8,931.60 in tax.
For most buildings that have received large assessment increases, city rules require that corresponding tax increases be phased in over five years. That means that few co-ops, condominiums, rental buildings or commercial properties are paying the full amount dictated by tax rates and assessments, but that the bills will rise to the maximum during the subsequent years.
''I am glad the City Council is finally focusing in on things, but a lot of abuses still have to be remedied,'' said James Manolatos, the sponsor and president of a 52-unit co-op at the corner of Prospect Park Southwest and 11th Avenue in Brooklyn. He said the entire building's assessed value, $250,000 in 1984, has been raised every year since to $938,250 for fiscal 1991.
Tax bills on the co-op have soared. Based on the latest assessment, the owners of a typical one-bedroom co-op in the building will pay a tax bills of $1,277 this year, he said, more than some one- to three-family homes in the neighborhood. And in a response that is being echoed in many co-ops and condominiums, shareholders in the building have held meetings, phoned City Hall, written letters to Albany and sought other ways to protest. ''There is a groundswell,'' Mr. Manolatos said. The rapid growth in co-op and condominium ownership during the 80's has made their owners a far more powerful politcal force. An analysis by the Real Estate Board of New York found that more than 290,000 co-op and condominium apartments had either been built or converted from rentals since 1983.
The city's landlords, who have always lobbied heavily for lower property taxes, are not likely to reduce their efforts. Last week, when the New York City Rent Guidelines Board approved rent increases of 4.5 percent on one-year leases and 7 percent on two-year leases, some landlords contended that the increase would not be enough to cover their higher property taxes.
''It's a disaster,'' said John J. Gilbert 3d, president of the largest owners group, the Rent Stabilization Association.
Nor are landlords and co-op and condominium owners the only ones making their displeasure known. ''The system is grossly unfair and badly administered, and there has got be a serious effort to make it better,'' said Eugene Russianoff, director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit concern that analyzes city policy.
No one is predicting an immediate overhaul of the system. Any change would probably mean shifting a heavy share of the tax burden to homeowners who form a powerful political constituency.
Nonetheless, senior officials in the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins say property tax reform is a high priority.
''THE inequities have gotten worse and worse, and we intend to look at the whole question of property taxes,'' said Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President.
Carol O'Claireacain, the Commissioner of the Department of Finance, has said repeatedly since her appointment to the post by Mayor Dinkins in January that she intends to create a committee of business people, tax experts and community representatives this year to review the entire property tax system and recommend changes.
Neither she nor other senior Finance Department officials were willing to elaborate on the proposal last week, or describe what the priorities of the committee would be. Kip Bobroff, a department spokesman, said the officials were seeking a broad review of the system and intended to avoid the ''tinkering'' that, according to critics, has contributed to its problems.
Mr. Mead of the Citizens Budget Committee found that the four-class system, from its inception, has been employed as a means of avoiding more fundamental changes in the way New York City property is assessed and taxed. The system was mandated by a 1981 state law enacted after the New York State Court appeals upheld lower court rulings that found the state's assessment process illegal.
Before 1981, state law required all properties to be assessed at full market value, but the law was ignored. Although assessment increases were made frequently for commercial property, the report said assessments on small residential properties changed little during the 1960's and 1970's.
By the early 1980's, complying with the requirement for full market-value assessments would have shifted a heavy tax burden on small-home owners. One study commissioned by City Hall estimated that their taxes would have doubled.
That prospect was untenable, not only because elected officials at City Hall and in Albany considered small homeowners a powerful voting block, but because of fears that a large tax increase would spark a renewed exodus to the suburbs of affluent families from neighborhoods of detached one- to three-family homes in the city.
The 1981 law eliminated the requirement for full-market-value assessment by establishing the four classes of properties. It also made the City Council responsible for assuring that the distribution of the tax burden between the four classes remained roughly constant.
Every three years, the New York State Board of Equalization and Assessment was to review the system and make sure the distribution was in order.
The law also set limits on assessment increases for some property owners. Assessments on one- to three-family homes could be raised only 6 percent a year, or 20 percent over five years. Apartment buildings with four to 10 units would have assessment increases limited to 8 percent a year or 30 percent over five years.
There were no limits placed on the assessment increases for larger residential buildings and commercial properties, but the law required that large increases in any given year be phased in over five years. The result is that most of these property owners receive city assessments broken out as ''transitional'' and ''actual.'' The former is the amount that the current tax bill is based on, the latter is that amount on which their bill will be based after the phase in period is complete.
AS a result of the complex system of tax classes and assessment limits, some property owners had their bills held down during one of the greatest booms in New York City property values. Commercial property owners and those with co-ops, condominiums and rental apartments in large buildings found their assessments surging, and years of further increases are assured as the transitional assessments catch up with the high actual assessments.
''With the disparity in tax burdens firmly entrenched'' by the 1981 state law, said Mr. Mead, ''city tax policy in the ensuing years has widened the gap.''
The report found that the market value of one- to three-family homes in the city had risen faster than any other class of properties, by 175 percent from 1983 to 1989, but the assessed value of that property for tax purposes rose only 22 percent.
In contrast, the report said the market value of commercial property rose 132 percent during the same period, while its assessed value rose 74 percent, and the market value of co-ops, condominiums and rental apartments rose 95 percent, while their assessments rose 46 percent.
Since the four-class system was enacted, the way it is administered has also proven flexible. Although the State Board of Equalization and Assessment was to conduct its first three-year review of the system in fiscal 1987, that review was postponed through later legislation to fiscal 1990.
Anticipating the state review of the system - and changes that would have to be made to bring the system in line with the class distribution that had been established in 1983 - a City Hall commission estimated that tax bills on one- to three-family homes would have to be increased 42 percent, or an average increase of $506 a year.
That posed another unpalatable prospect for elected officials. In response, in a measure sponsored by Mayor Edward I. Koch last year, a two-year moratorium was placed on any major redistribution of the tax burden among classes. It also requires future adjustments to keep the distribution in line with where it stood in the 1990 fiscal year, instead of the 1983 fiscal year.
The moratorium on redistribution was in effect when the City Council approved the new tax rates on July 1. But it will expire before property rates are deliberated next year.

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: GEORGETOWN;
Plan for Factory Site Alarms Neighbors

BYLINE: By JAMES LOMUSCIO

 BODY:
WHEN Margaret Popper and her family moved from suburban Wilton to working-class Georgetown five years ago, they did not view the move as a step down. The 1860's Victorian house she and her husband, Neal, had purchased was the most beautiful house she had seen, Mrs. Popper said. Tree-lined Church Street, with a Methodist church dating back to the 1700's, had little traffic.
Main Street was welcoming. The mile-long street had a barbershop, market and restaurants. The community of just under 1,000 people had everything she wanted, Mrs. Popper said. Her house was also within walking distance of the Gilbert & Bennett Manufacturing Company complex. Gilbert & Bennett, a manufacturer of metal fencing and one of the nation's oldest companies, had been on the site since 1818. 
''The factory never bothered me,'' Mrs. Popper said. ''I remember my first night in the house. I heard this hum. It was the factory, and it made me feel comfortable. It reminded me of the town I grew up in in upstate New York.''
Today, the hum of the factory is gone. Only a quiet breeze rolls through the old brick factory, the corrugated-metal outbuildings and the wooden shacks. Now Mrs. Popper and other residents of this community - which includes corners of Wilton, Weston, Ridgefield and Redding - are worried about what will replace the factory.
 
300 Condominiums
The residents said they fear that a large commercial structure will replace the factory on the 52-acre site. Gilbert & Bennett, which closed the factory a little more than a year ago and moved its manufacturing to Georgia, now proposes to put an estimated 300 condominium units and about 140,000 square feet of commercial space on the site.
While the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce has applauded the plan, a group calling itself the Concerned Citizens of Georgetown views the proposal as an attempt to build an entirely new community.
''The grand scheme of things is that it is the creation of a new Georgetown with little regard for the community around it already,'' Mrs. Popper said. ''The fact is that they never recognized that there was a community here already.''
Corning Townsend, whose house sits on the Redding side of Church Street about 100 feet from the Gilbert & Bennett site, said the development would bring in high-priced shops that would be out of the range of local customers.
''I would love to see it stay the way it is,'' Mr. Townsend said. ''I would love to see anything here, anything but to turn this area into another Westport and New Canaan. Economically, it just isn't attractive to Georgetown.''
Another concern is increased traffic. Alan Davis Associates, of Norwalk, found that the proposal would mean about 11,000 cars coming into the area daily.
''And there would be no peak for traffic,'' ' said Elizabeth Edwards, a Georgetown lawyer who lives on West Church Street in the Wilton quadrant. ''This would be a constant stream.''
 
'Almost Like a Colony'
Because the Gilbert & Bennett property is in Redding, Georgetown residents in other towns have little say in the matter, Mrs. Edwards said. Redding officials ''will essentially be making decisions that will affect those of us in other towns,'' she said. ''We're almost like a colony. Lately, I've been thinking about how colonists must have felt during the Boston Tea Party.''
Paul Gossling, president of the privately held Gilbert & Bennett, said he expects to bring his latest proposal before Redding's zoning commission late this month. If all goes well, he said, the proposal might be approved by early 1991 and the development could be completed by 1993 or 1994.
''The governmental process has to go slow, because Redding's Zoning Commission is only used to somebody coming in and asking for an approval to put a new deck on their house,'' Mr. Gossling said. ''This totally overwhelms them.''
Redding's First Selectman, Hank Bielawa, said he supports the development plan. While he found Mr. Gossling's first proposal, which had as many as 365 condominiums and 200,000 square feet of commercial space, too ambitious, Mr. Bielawa said he has no problems with the scaled-down version.
''I think it will be good for the Georgetown community,'' Mr. Bielawa said. ''After all, the alternatives are not very appealing. You'd wind up with an empty factory sitting there with broken windows and transients living there, whereas instead you could have a nice community with shops that would be in keeping with the community.
''They plan to retain all the historic landmarks and buildings. It's not a decimation of the history of Georgetown but an incorporation of it.''
Mr. Gossling said the 150-year-old red brick factory building would be restored and used for stores and offices. The metal outbuildings would be torn down, he said, to make way for brick condominiums and stores. He said his initial plan to put in a movie theater had been put aside because of community concern that it might generate too much traffic.
Adam Lubarsky, owner of the Georgetown Saloon on Main Street, has also given his support to the project. He called it ''development in a controlled fashion.''
Mr. Lubarsky said Georgetown had been locked in a ''time warp'' compared with the rest of Fairfield County. Main Street has no sewers, and the rotary-dial telephones still require a dime to get a dial tone, he said.
''A lot of my customers, even those from out of state, when they come in here feel the same way,'' Mr. Lubarsky said. ''They feel like they're in the middle of Colorado or Nebraska.''
Still, traffic worries local residents and officials in several towns who say they are worried about more cars using roads like Roues 7 and 57.
The officials also talk of environmental concerns. While Georgetown merchants support Gilbert & Bennett's plan to put in sewers and a sewage-treatment plant, environmentalists argue that the plant would hurt the Norwalk River, into which it would empty, and ultimately Long Island Sound.
 
Open Space Around Pond
But Mr. Gossling said the sewage-treatment plant ''would be cleaner than anything in that water already.'' He also said the development would reclaim the 14-acre factory pond, which is in the center of the Gilbert & Bennett property.
Before the metal outbuildings were constructed around the pond in the early 1960's, many Georgetown residents used it as a fresh-water beach. Though Mr. Gossling did not promise that swimmers could use the pond again, he said the waterfall behind it and about 13 acres around the pond would be set aside for open space.
Mr. Gossling said his critics were wrong to say that the proposed shops would be too exclusive for what Georgetown residents might want.
''We're trying to give the community what it doesn't have now,'' he said. ''We're talking about usable shops, like cleaners, a bank and hardware store. We're not talking about Saks Fifth Avenue.''

HEADLINE: Special Museums From Subs to Nuts: Enough Already?

BYLINE: By CHARLOTTE LIBOV

 BODY:
THE American Silver Museum, in Meriden, was supposed to open this summer, but the building is locked shut. The museum has run out of money, and while it seeks more support, some people in the state wonder whether Connecticut already has too many specialized museums.
The latest vacation guide published by the state lists more than 140 museums of all kinds, including institutions like Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford. The vast majority, though, are small museums that cater to special interests. These include museums that pay homage to carousel horses, circuses, submarines, fire engines and even nuts. They dot the state, from the 18th-century Ogden House in Fairfield to the Museum of Fife and Drum in Essex.
Tourists can visit the nation's first law school, the Tapping Reeve House and Law School in Litchfield. And visitors to eastern Connecticut can learn about the state's textile heritage at the Windham Textile and History Museum in Willimantic. 
 
Silver in a Vault
The American Silver Museum would like to join these ranks, but its opening has been indefinitely postponed. The building is nearly completed, but $500,000 more is needed, said Brenda J. Vumbaco, one of the museum's organizers. The museum's staff is working temporarily in the Connecticut National Bank building in Meriden, and the museum's collection of silver is stored in the bank's vault.
The focus of the museum would be national, Ms. Vumbaco said. ''It would be the only museum in the country devoted to silvermaking. What the museum is to be is a living memorial to the silver workers and their families all over the country,'' she said. Ms. Vulbaco estimated that the museum would eventually draw 50,000 visitors a year.
The latest plan to provide the museum with the needed funds was rejected by the Meriden City Council in April. John Quine, a member of the council, said he voted against it, in part, because he is concerned that Connecticut has too many museums.
''If you look at a map of Connecticut, there's dozens and dozens of museums,'' Mr. Quine said.
''There's more museums than you can shake a stick at. I just don't think this museum will draw in the numbers to pay the tab, and, with that, they can't survive,'' he said.
But a spokeswoman for the State Department of Economic Development, Barbara J. Beeching, said she believes that having more museums attracts more tourists.
''We think the Silver Museum will be a very popular place to visit,'' she said. ''Here is a little bit of Connecticut history that's begging to be brought to life. The casual traveler who comes in and wonders what to do would find this very intriguing.''
But harsh economic times are ushering in a difficult era for museums, and more of them may end up in the silver museum's situation, said Wilson H. Faude, executive director of the Old State House in Hartford, a historic museum that is the state's largest tourist attraction, he said.
''For years, nonprofits such as museums have thought there would always be a corporate godfather to bail them out, that they didn't have to be run like a business,'' Mr. Faude said. ''Those days are gone.''
 
Cannons and Purple Hearts
Despite this, there are new museums hoping to join Connecticut's already crowded field.
In the final stages of preparation is the Military Museum of Southern New England, which is to open in Danbury early this fall, said Dolores Levy, a member of the museum's board. The museum is leasing a building, but, Mrs. Levy said, ''eventually we hope to get a larger building, because we have so much equipment.'' The collection includes ''about a dozen cannons, a lot of wheeled vehicles, amphibious vehicles, rifles and uniforms,'' she said.
The collection of medals and documents of the Purple Heart Museum in Enfield is temporarily housed in the municipality's Old Town Hall Museum, but an architect will soon be selected to construct a permanent building. Once that is done, a national fund-raising campaign will begin, said Anthony Porto, chairman of the Purple Heart Museum Inc.
''We anticipate busloads of people coming in from everywhere,'' he said. ''This will be the only national Purple Heart Museum sanctioned by Congress.'' The museum is to honor recipients of the Purple Heart, the medal given to members of the armed forces killed or wounded in action.
But starting a new museum is risky, said Claudia Finkenstein, who operates the New England Carousel Museum in Briston, which opened last year. About 15,000 visitors each year come to seeits collection of carved antique carousel horses. But the first months were very slow, said Mrs. Finkenstein, who, with her husband, William, raised the funds to open the museum themselves.
 
'Doing Very, Very Well'
''At first, people had no idea we were here,''Mrs. Finkenstein said. ''It was harder than I thought it would be. You really have to try to publicize as much as you can, but when you open up, you're on a limited budget.''
The Windham Textile and History Museum opened last fall in Willimantic, and so far it is ''doing very, very well,'' in part because of aggressive marketing, said the museum's director, Laura Knott Twine.
''We knew right from the beginning that we had to base our support on the community, state and regional grants and businesses, so we wouldn't be putting all our eggs in one basket,'' she said. ''It would be wonderful to find someone out there to give us a million-dollar endowment, but we're not counting on it.''
Established museums are also scrambling for funds, said Joyce Stoffers, managing director of the American Clock and Watch Museum in Bristol.
''The economy is our greatest concern,'' she said. ''In the past, we've gotten some state funding, but there is a concern over how much of that will be available in the future.''
To try to compensate, the museum is starting an aggressive new membership campaign. This includes more advertising, as well as the creation of a special clock-shaped brass-plated bookmark to be given to new members, Ms. Stoffers said.
 
An Individual's Interest
At the Connecticut River Museum in Essex, twice yearly fund raisers help finance the museum's $200,000 annual operating budget, said Kathleen Fajen, the business manager. The museum is dedicated to the history of the Connecticut River, but the fund raisers have broader themes, she said. There is an annual benefit auction, which includes items like antiques and trips. A jazz cabaret will be held on July 21.
Some museums stem solely from an individual's interest. The most celebrated of these is the Nut Museum, which features nut-oriented artwork, including ceramics, jewelry, paintings, sculpture and masks. It is operated by Elizabeth Tasjian, who started it 18 years ago in her 100-year-old Victorian mansion in Old Lyme. She has been a guest on the Johnny Carson show eight times, she said. Ms. Fajen credits the success of her museum to her sense of humor. ''I know there is a double meaning in the word 'nut,' '' she said. ''I didn't realize that at first, but then I realized that some people consider nuts not only the kind that grow on trees, but also the two-legged variety. So I went along with it. I didn't stubbornly hold with the vision I had expected it to be.''

Because of a transmission error, an article last Sunday about museums in Connecticut misstated the ranking of the Old State House in Hartford, by number of visitors. It is the state's sixth-largest tourist attraction, not the largest.

HEADLINE: HOME CLINIC;
Easing the Task of Buying Lumber

BYLINE: By JOHN WARDE

 BODY:
BUYING lumber can be confusing. For example, any piece of lumber that is less than two inches thick and eight inches wide is called a strip; any piece less than two inches thick but more than eight inches wide is called a board.
Pieces of any width that are more than two inches thick, but less than five, are called dimension lumber. Those whose smallest dimension (thickness or width) is at least four inches are called a timber. 
Yards typically stock only standard-sized lumber used for house construction. Those from evergreen trees - pine, fir and spruce, - are classed as softwood; those from deciduous trees - oak, maple and walnut - are classed as hardwood.
Lumber dimensions are always given starting with the thickness in inches. This is followed by the width in inches and then by the length, usually in feet.
The thickness and width by which lumber is designated are nominal dimensions (those to which pieces are sawed at the sawmill). Nominal dimensions do not take into account shrinkage during drying or trimming necessary for smoothness.
With softwood, lumber having a nominal thickness of one inch actually measures about a quarter-inch less; that with a nominal thickness of two inches or more actually measures about a half-inch less.
Softwood with nominal widths of two through five inches has an actual width about a half-inch less; that with nominal widths greater than five inches has an actual width about three-quarters of an inch less.
For instance, if you ask for a 1x4 strip (a standard softwood size), the piece you get will measure only about three-quarters of an inch thick and about 3 1/2 inches wide.
Nominal thicknesses for hardwood are usually expressed in quarters of an inch. For example, hardwood lumber designated 4/4 is nominally an inch thick.
Nominal thicknesses of hardwood differ from actual thicknesses by about 3/16th of an inch for smoothed lumber up to 1 3/4 inches thick, and by about a quarter-inch for smoothed lumber that is thicker. Differences between nominal and actual widths can vary, and so specify the actual width you need.
Lengths for lumber are always actual. If you ask for a 10-foot-long board, that is what you will get.
Lumber is graded according to quality and appearance. Most softwoods are classed as either Select or Common. Select grades are:
* B and Better (or 1 and 2 Clear), pieces free of any but minor blemishes.
* C Select, which allows for some minor blemishes, including small knots.
* D Select, which allows pieces to have imperfections on one side that can be covered by paint, and larger, less-easily disguised imperfections on the other.
The grades of Common lumber are:
* No. 1 (or Select Merchantable), which allows minor blemishes and tight knots less than two inches in diameter.
* No. 2 (or Construction), which allows tight knots and blemishes up to three inches in diameter (none may be near edges).
* No. 3 (or Standard), which allows pieces to have either several coarse or loose knots accompanied by other major blemishes, or a single large defect surrounded by good wood.
* No. 4 (or Utility), which allows pieces to contain more knots and blemishes than No. 3 and even some holes.
* No. 5 (or Economy), the lowest grade of usable lumber.
For trim, molding and other interior woodwork, one of the Select grades is usually the best. For most other home repairs, No. 2 Common is usually sufficient. Lumber for structural use - rafters and joists, say - carries additional grading. Check first for the grades specified by local codes.
Hardwoods are graded primarily by the percentage of unblemished wood in a board. The finest grade is FAS (Firsts and Seconds); such boards must be at least six inches wide and eight feet long, and more than 81 percent of the surface must be defect-free.
The next grade is Select. These boards must be at least four inches wide and six feet long, and have one side comparable to FAS. The remaining grades are:
* No. 1 Common, lumber narrower and shorter than Select and at least 66 percent unblemished.
* No. 2 Common, for which the boards must be at least 50 percent unblemished.
* No. 3A Common, for which the boards must be at least 33 percent unblemished.
* No. 3B Common, for which the boards must be at least 25 percent unblemished.
Lumber is usually sold by nominal volume, called board feet. One board foot equals a cubic foot (144 cubic inches). To find the number of board feet in a piece of lumber, multiply its nominal thickness in inches by its nominal width in inches and then multiply this number by the board's length in feet.
Finally, divide the product of all three numbers by 12.

HEADLINE: ART;
Bluemner's Vision of Landscape In Drawings and Watercolors

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: CROSS RIVER

 BODY:
REBUTTING criticism of the 1913 Armory Show, one of the participants, Oscar Bluemner, contended that art was still ''largely misunderstood'' in America. Art is not meant ''to amuse or instruct,'' he said, nor is it to be taken as ''imitation of nature.'' Its purpose, rather, is to elevate and liberate by making ''articulate the life of its time.''
Were he alive today, the painter would find the situation grander but essentially the same. And he might agree with his friend, Paul Rosenfeld, who said that in leaving his native Germany for the United States, ''Bluemner would seem to have exchanged a milieu potentially sympathetic to his peculiarities of temperament'' for one that was far less so. 
But none of this will be apparent to viewers of the Bluemner show at Nardin Fine Arts unless they come primed - especially by Jeffrey Hayes's catalogue to the Barbara Mathes Gallery retrospective of 1985, from which the quotes above were taken.
Spanning the period 1909 to the early 1930's, the 36 works at Nardin are drawings and watercolors and, most of them postcard-sized or smaller, they are dotted over the walls in no particular order.
Many of the works follow a formula whereby the center of interest is a road or river winding into the distance and the image is framed by trees or, when the scene is urban, by buildings. Some bear the imprint of Symbolism mixed with Cubism and a few imply a visionary agitation that recalls a much younger artist, Charles Burchfield.
There is repetition enough to suggest obsessiveness but on the whole the selection reveals little of the man whom Rosenfeld described as ''a shaggy German in baggy clothes'' and a ''rank boheme'' with a Rabelaisian sense of humor. Nor are there signs of the romantic bent on reconciling Far Eastern art with that of the West and given to ecstatic pronouncements directed at the materialistic philosophy of Herbert Spencer: ''Ultimately, the painter feels the unknown absolute.''
Bluemner, born in 1867, trained as an architect, and it was in this capacity that he left Germany for Chicago, in 1892. He was dissatisfied with the conservatism of German culture and had high hopes for art and architecture in a new country that he felt would be hospitable to new ideas. But after a stint designing for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, the young man fell upon hard times and, moving to New York City, was reduced to peddling calendars in the street. He would have gone home if he had had the money.
Then the economy picked up and his fortunes with it, so that by 1900, Bluemner, married and the father of a son, was again employed as an architect.
He was also sketching landscape around the city and, less than a decade later, was consorting with Alfred Stieglitz and the vanguard group around the 291 Gallery. Even more important, however, was his trip to Europe, which was financed by a court ruling in his favor over plans for the Bronx County Courthouse that had been stolen from him by a former partner.
Bluemner took in a lot of art while abroad, including exhibitions of Post-Impressionism and Futurism and - in the Berlin of 1912 - had his first one-man show. Theories of color were in the air and he was developing some of his own, which involved the frequent use of red - not for nothing was the artist nicknamed ''the Vermillionaire.'' Two years after the Armory came a solo exhibition at 291 but by this time anti-German sentiment was making itself felt and Bluemner, although a citizen, withdrew to the quieter setting of Bloomfield, N.J.
The artist remained in New Jersey until the death of his wife, in 1926, when he joined his son in South Braintree, Mass., and it was there that he produced the startling Arthur Dove-like watercolor of a November moon - a smaller version of the one reproduced in the retrospective catalogue. Looking like an orange fruit with a crescent of red along the lower edge, the orb hangs above black roofs in a rust-colored sky streaked with mauve clouds. Its companion, a smaller white moon with the ''man'' clearly visible, has a hazy yellow aureole and is suspended in a dark purplish sky.
Other remarkable efforts from this period include the gouache, ''Brookline,'' where houses looking like blocks of pink and white adobe cluster behind a green tree, and a tiny street scene that is a newspaper clipping enhanced by pencil and an explosion of white light.
Still, not all the noteworthy works were done in Massachusetts: for example, there is ''North Bloomfield'' (1922), a stylized view of houses and trees in gentle pinks and grays, together with a bold charcoal sketch of the waterfront at Port Elizabeth, N.J. (1925). Of interest, too, is the 1920 gouache of a red hut and black tree standing on white ground with a railroad in the distance. It is called ''The Scales House Soho.'' Could this mean that New Jersey gets credit for the first American Soho as well as the first baseball game? Bluemner enjoyed good critical notices but evidently not the luck needed for total success. Coming one after another, the death of his wife, the Depression and physical illness all took their toll. In 1936, he produced his last painting, an atypically detailed self-portrait that is not in the show; early in 1938, he committed suicide. Mr. Hayes does not say if it was death by vermillion but he quotes a letter written a few weeks earlier in which the artist says he will someday eat his stock of that color and ''stretch out on all fours like a cat,'' adding that ''the exit'' should be made ''with a nice bow, quick and short.''
The show remains through next Sunday. Nardin is in Yellow Monkey Village on Route 35, and its hours are 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Tuesday through Sunday.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Chefs With Stylish Cuisine Find a Home on L.I.

BYLINE: By Florence Fabricant

 BODY:
FOR some prominent chefs from New York City, restaurants and food shops on the Island are providing safe harbors in the economic storm.
With fewer new restaurants opening and more empty pages in the reservation books of established places in Manhattan, chefs are lighting stoves elsewhere, especially in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. This spring, Brendan Walsh, who was once the chef at the trend-setting Arizona 206 on the Upper East Side, opened Coyote Grill in Island Park. Len Allison, the chef and owner of Hubert's, also on the Upper East Side, is spending the summer cooking at the Chequit Inn on Shelter Island.
And for the last two months, Michel Fitoussi has been running the kitchen at Cafe Blueberries, a catering shop in East Norwich. In his 25 years as a chef, he has cooked at the Palace, once New York's most expensive restaurant, as well as at Regine's and most recently with Jean-Jacques Rachou at La Cote Basque, waiting for a position to materialize in a new hotel. It never did. 
''This is a very good job, and for me the pressure is off,'' Mr. Fitoussi said. ''I'm cooking great good, but I can also have a life with my family.'' Mr. Fitoussi, whose children are 3 and 8 years old, lives in Kings Point.
The move to the Island by many chefs is largely a response to a downturn in business in the Manhattan restaurant trade - a reflection of a troubled economy. Restaurants say they have been particularly hurt by the shrinking amount of expense-account money that coprorations and other businesses are making available to employees. Other patrons, unwilling to pay higher prices for meals, are staying away; reservations are less difficult to come by these days. As a result, many chefs are having trouble finding work.
 
'I Do Not Miss Manhattan'
''I'm a chef and the most interesting thing for me is to be cooking,'' Mr. Walsh said. He left Arizona 206 to open his own restaurant in lower Manhattan, but when the deal soured he began exploring other options, finally making an arrangement to open Coyote Grill with John Vitale, who owns Paddy McGee's, a bar and restaurant next door.
''I do not miss Manhattan,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''I've been too busy. There's been too much work.'' He has been turning out 250 to 300 Southwestern-style dinners a night in the informal, bustling waterfront restaurant that has been a hit from the moment it opened its doors.
On Shelter Island, Mr. Allison said his spending the summer at the Chequit Inn is ''an experiment.''
''Last summer was a disaster for Hubert's,'' he said, ''so I knew I wanted to try something else. I've always wanted to be in a resort area near the water, but Shelter Island is simpler than being in the Hamptons.'' He described the pace at the inn as ''more relaxed and comfortable'' than at his Manhattan establishment.
The allure of the Island for New York chefs and restaurateurs is nothing new. More than 25 years ago the esteemed Henri Soule, chef and owner of Le Pavillon, once one of New York's greatest restaurants, created a summer outpost at the Hedges Inn in East Hampton.
A decade ago, Bruce Bozzi, an owner of the Palm Restaurant in Manhattan, opened a branch in The Huntting Inn in East Hampton and subsequently took over the Hedges Inn as well. Dean and DeLuca also opened in East Hampton around that time, and although that store closed, Joel Dean, one of the partners, is still a co-owner of Dean & Company in the village.
Peter Luger in Great Neck and H.S.F. in Bridgehampton are two other New York restaurants with Long Island locations. George and Helen Studley, the owners of La Colombe D'Or on East 26th Street in Manhattan, owned the Long Wharf in Sag Harbor until last year. That restaurant has now been taken over by Howard Steins, owner of a midtown Manhattan club called Au Bar. Mr. steins has reopened the Long Wharf as Aussi, a restaurant and club.
And Pino Luongo, who owns Sapore di Mare in Wainscott, was once involved with Il Cantinori in Manhattan and now owns Le Madri on West 18 Street and Seventh Avenue.
 
Opening in St. James
It has been more than six years since Guy Reuge, who worked at Tavern on the Green and Le Plaisir, relocated to St. James and opened Mirabelle. In some respects he fore shadowed the current trend.
''I wanted to open my own restaurant,'' he explained. ''Le Plaisir had just closed and things were not going so great for me, like with some of the chefs now. I had this opportunity because my wife's family was here and willing to help finance the restaurant. It would take a lot to convince me to go back to New York now.''
Geography can be as important a factor as the economy. One reason Mr. Bozzi opened the Palm in East Hampton is because he vacationed there. And like Mr. Fitoussi, Mr. Reuge has young children and appreciates being able to work on the Island close to where he and his family live. The same holds true for Mr. Walsh and Mr. Allison. ''The lifestyle has a great deal of appeal,'' said Mr. Walsh, who has rented a house near his Island Park restaurant.
The chance to work near his home and family also inspired Tony Russo of Lake Grove to open a branch of his Italian prepared-food business in Glen Cove four months ago. He is an owner of A. Russo and Sons, a food shop that was started by his grandfather and is still thriving in the East Village of Manhattan.
''I live here, and it was becoming harder and harder to get up at 5:30 in the morning to travel into New York every day,'' Mr. Russo said.
He said he had been delighted to find that his clientele is more sophiticated than the customers in the Manhattan store and that he can carry a wider range of products.
''The really know all about the esoteric regional stuff like special cheeses, and meats,'' he said. ''They're not just interested in mozzarella and pasta. I have had to hire a kid who speaks Italian.''
 
Customers 'Not as Aggressive'
At the Coyote Grill, Mr. Walsh said his particular brand of spicy Southwestern food had also found an appreciative audience. And at the Cafe Blueberries in East Norwich, Mr. Fitoussi said: ''The clientele here is the same as the New York clientele. The difference is that the people are not as agressive or uptight.''
Greater culinary sophistication has made it possible for chefs like Mr. Reuge, Mr. Fitoussi and Mr. Walsh to succeed, and it is also why a club like Glen Oaks in Old Westbury hired as consultants Richard Lavin, a Manhattan restaurateur, and Harriette Rose Katz, a Manhattan party palnner to revise the menu. And it is why David Liederman, owner of both Chez Louis and Broadway Grill in Manhattan, is now in his second season as consultant to the Montauk Yacht Club.
 
Plenty of Local Suppliers
Not only do those dining out on the Island have a keener food sense today, but the farmers and fishermen are more willing to cater to those tastes, supplying chefs and restaurants with a bountiful harvest of local foodstuffs.
''I found small purveyors who will supply me with the kind of things I need to supplement the basics I can get from major sources,'' Mr. Allison said.
Pino Luongo and Mark strausman, his chef at Sapore Di mare in Wainscott, have cultivated a number of local sources for produce, fish and even game and baked goods.
And while big distributors and whosesalers might not be willing to make daily deliveries to restaurants on the Island, the small producers go out of their way to serve the restaurants.
Perhaps the hardest part of running a restaurant on the Islands finding a staff comparable to those in Manhattan. ''We can't draw on the same pool of reasonably well-trained waiters that you have in Manhattan,'' said Mr. Walsh.
The uneveness of the business, with a crush of reservations on weekends and slower nights midweek at restaurants throughout the Island, also complicates staffing.
In vacation areas the problems are even more severe. ''If you use college students, they all quit by mid-August,'' said Mr. Bozzi of the Palm in East Hampton. His solution is to house some of his help, especially the people who come to the Island for the season from his Maimi restaurant. Mr. Luongo and Mr. Allison have done the same thing. ''We're lucky to be able to provide housing,'' Mr. Allison said. Costs Increasing The costs of doing business, including insurance, taxes and wages, have also increased, making profits on the Island narrower today than they were a few years ago, said Mr. Reuge of Mirabelle in St. James. But it's still less expensive and easier than opening a new restaurant in Manhattan. ''With the tightened market and the competition, young chefs may now be more willing to be on the Island,'' Mr. Reuge added.
''It all comes down to the fact that this is a business and you have to go to the market where your business is going to thrive,'' Mr. Walsh said.
Still, despite the relative health of the business on the Island and the influx of well-known chefs, the area remains in Manhattan's shadow. In the suburbs of other cities like Washington, Chicago, Minneapolis or San francisco, however, fine restaurants are treated with as much respect as those in the cities, especially by the press. But some chefs and restaurateurs on the Island feel that the New York press and dining public has yet to cross the rivers and discover what chiefs are accomplishing 45 minutes or so from midtown, not only to the east but also in Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey.
''I resent that we don't get the same recognition we would if we were in the city,'' said Mr. Reuge. ''That's the hardest part.'' But if the current trend continues, it's likely to happen before long.

THE RED KING'S REBELLION
Racial Politics in New England, 1675-1678.
By Russell Bourne.
Illustrated. 273 pp. New York:
Atheneum. $22.95.
Popularizing history is a tricky business at the best of times, but particularly in these days of professional specialization. To sell their books but not their souls, popularizers must steer between the rocks of half-baked research and the shoals of academic prose. The best have been either readable professors like Garrett Mattingly and Samuel Eliot Morison or scholarly journalists like Allan Nevins and Barbara Tuchman. They all did their homework but wrote for the elusive general reader rather than the professoriate. 
The publication most responsible for popularizing America's history has been American Heritage, a Nevins brainchild. The accessible magazine and the highly visual American Heritage books have put our history within reach of every library-card-carrying citizen in the country. So it is a good omen that Russell Bourne, the former editor of American Heritage Books, has written a short, eminently readable retelling of the bloody tragedy known as King Philip's War.
The war was the deadliest and costliest, proportionately, in American history, worse than the Civil War or Vietnam in terms of lives lost, communities destroyed and economic dislocation. It had no winners, only losers. Named for the unregal chief of the Pokanokets, a Plymouth Colony tribe, the conflagration engulfed all of New England between 1675 and 1678, when it burned itself out in Maine.
Philip (or Metacom) was the younger heir of Massasoit, the Wampanoag sachem who befriended and allied himself with the Pilgrims in a treaty in 1621. For Mr. Bourne, this treaty inaugurated an exemplary era of good feelings, a period of ''biracial harmony'' when Native Americans and newcomers lived side by side with equity and cooperation. But he never examines its provisions, which were, in fact, tipped heavily toward the English, the self-appointed policemen of America's allegedly lawless forests.
The only reasons for Plymouth's relatively benign behavior in the early decades were the Pilgrims' demographic disadvantage and their lack of interest in converting the Indians to Christianity. After the great migration of 1630-42, their pugnacious Puritan neighbors to the north operated from no such weakness. When English land lust, sharp trading practices and disdain for Indian sovereignty pushed the New England Indians to the wall by the 1670's, Philip's local insurrection ignited discontent the length and breadth of New England.
A heedless attack by the settlers on the neutral Narragansetts, the most populous and powerful tribe, drove them and the rest of the region's tribes into furious resistance. Canonchet, the able Narragansett chief, became the field commander of the uprising. Before it was over, the war had claimed 9,000 victims (two-thirds of them Indian) and destroyed most or all of nearly 50 English towns. Homelessness, starvation, crushing taxation and our earliest veteran problem preyed on New England for years afterward.
Mr. Bourne blames the breakdown of political accommodation on both sides for the war. Men of the caliber of Roger Williams and Massasoit were replaced by hotter heads whose basic distrust of the other culture precipitated pre-emptive acts of aggression rather than bold initiatives of peace. Maj. Richard Waldron, for example, disarmed the Indians on the New Hampshire-Maine border out of fear that they might be seduced into war by the ''rebels'' just south of them. The only result was winter starvation for many Indians, who depended on their guns for hunting, and the destruction of Maine's coastal towns in angry reprisal.
Any student of the war has an unbeatable cast of characters to direct: Benjamin Church, the most effective and most principled Indian fighter in the colonies; Mary Rowlandson, the minister's wife who, captured by One-Eyed John (Monoco), sewed her way to freedom; Weetamoo, the mercurial and much-married ''queen'' of the Pocassets; Stone-Wall John, the Indian mason who built impressive walls around the Narragansett swamp fort; Thomas Gardiner, arrested for treason for suggesting that Massachusetts caused the Eastern war by disarming the Abnakis; and Mugg Hegone, the Abnaki war captain, who planned to capture a navy of English fishing boats and attack Boston. Mr. Bourne makes a lively job of it. Actors on both sides of the buckskin curtain come alive as engaging, fallible human beings, not cardboard stereotypes.
But ''The Red King's Rebellion'' is only a mixed success as popular history. Mr. Bourne, descended from the minister who founded the town of Mashpee, where his converts, or ''praying Indians,'' lived, aimed at a ''personal narrative'' of the war rather than a new interpretation. Yet his text is pockmarked with dutiful bows to the ''competing professionals'' who have fought over his historical turf. The reader is subjected to confusing references to ''conservatives,''
''revisionists'' and ''scientists'' (or ''ethnohistorians,'' his favorites), and surprisingly Mr. Bourne comes to a revisionist conclusion that ''an ineluctable sense of guilt'' is our major legacy from the war.
This gets us no farther than do his discredited references to New England's ''theocracy'' (the Puritans practiced strict separation of church and state), Indian ''braves'' (only on the 19th-century Plains), ''French and Indian Wars'' (not from French or Indian viewpoints) and particularly the ''racial'' nature of the conflict between ''red and white.'' The meeting of Native Americans and the English was a cultural encounter in which boundaries were permeable and values transferable; race played no part until after 1689.
Nevertheless, this is a good and largely reliable rendition of a cautionary tale that cannot be heard too often by modern Americans, especially after Vietnam, Grenada and Panama.

HEADLINE: Focus: The Lake Erie Waterfront;
A Shrinking Supply of Developable Land

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STOFFEL

DATELINE: SANDUSKY, OHIO

 BODY:
After several years of rapid construction in the resort areas along Lake Erie, little waterfront property remains for additional development. As a result, attention is turning to a tiny cluster of islands off the shore here.
Since the mid-80's, planners and developers along Ohio's 265 miles of Lake Erie shoreline, especially in small towns like Vermillion and Huron west of Cleveland, have been looking to the lake's ecological recovery to drive a thriving second-home and leisure-time economy.
Now, after a tenfold increase in condominiums in Ottawa County alone since 1980, developers are looking to the islands to continue the trend. 
This renewed interest in the recreational potential of Lake Erie comes on the heels of the much-heralded rebound of the lake's water quality. Improved sewage treatment in major waterfront cities, the decline of the area's heavy industries and their accompanying waste and several years of high water levels worked through the 1980's to reduce phosphorus pollution. No longer is Lake Erie covered with thick blue-green algae, nor is it the subject of national jokes.
''It's not as though Lake Erie were just now being rediscovered; that happened a few years ago,'' said Lucius McKelvey, president of R. I. Resort Properties, the Cleveland developer of Rattlesnake Island, one of the smaller of the lake's islands. ''The problem today is that the lakefront is getting overpopulated.'' For the most part, the eight Put-in-Bay Islands in the offshore cluster have remained far removed from the condominium and hotel fever on the mainland. Much of the island property is farmland. With lake-effect weather providing milder winter temperatures, the islands have an ideal climate for grapes and have been farmed as vineyards for more than a century. North Bass Island is home to a winery; the island is owned by Paramount Distilleries, a Cleveland producer.
In contrast, as the island's port-of-call for summer tourist boat service from Sandusky and the nearby Marblehead Peninsula, the town of Put-in-Bay on South Bass Island is anything but sleepy. During the summer, Put-in-Bay's 410 year-round residents are visited by an estimated 10,000 tourists a day. On South Bass, the second-home market is flourishing, and interest has begun to spread to the other islands in the group.
TWENTY lakefront home sites on 65-acre Rattlesnake Island were put on the market earlier this year, ending the island's halof century as a privately owned hunting and fishing preserve. Averaging one-half-acre each, with Lake Erie frontage ranging from 150 to 280 feet, the lots begin at $175,000.
And under a proposal unveiled late last year by Johnson Island Inc., 200 single- and two-family homes are planned for 148 interior acres of the 300-acre JohnsonsIsland. The plan also includes a marina with 825 dock slips on an abandoned 20-acre limestone quarry to be linked by a man-made channel to the lake.
Concern about the impact of growth on the islands has prompted area planners to reconsider zoning regulations drafted in the mid-60's, as well as the capacity of roads and utilities.
''We are not geared to consider resort and condominium properties,'' said Walter C. Wehenkel Jr., director of planning for the Ottawa County Regional Planning Commission. ''And as we run out of lakefront on the shore we are going to see more and more pressure put on these islands.''
New construction on nearby Marblehead Peninsula and Cawtawba Island north of Sandusky has prompted the county to add a $37 million sewer system. Additional sewage and water treatment plants would have to be added to meet the demand of further island growth.
''There's always the question of where the land would come from,'' said Charles Herndon, chairman of the Kelley's Island Planning Commission. ''No one wants a sewage plant in their backyard.''
The expense of ferrying building materials is a drawback to island construction. Even passenger service is limited to summer tour boats out of Sandusky and a car ferry from the tip of Marblehead Peninsula from April through November.
Resistance from each of the islands' small group of landowners has been the biggest obstacle for developers thus far. The proposal for Johnsons Island, for instance, has been submitted for approval four times in efforts to overcome islanders' objections. Carl Zipfel, a developer from Strongsville, dropped plans for 200 condominiums as part of the new Bay Cliffs residential development after the plans were rejected by the zoning board.
Now, while the Ottawa County Planning Commission has granted preliminary approval for Mr. Zipfel's latest plan of single-family homes and duplexes, he has also agreed to set aside 22 acres for purchase by the state or Federal Government to meet the concerns of preservationists interested in the island's history as a Union fort and prison for Confederate soldiers in the Civil War.
As the island's primary tour-boat port and closest major city, Sandusky has much to gain from continued growth. The demands of the new summertime population have helped the city's economy by creating new service sector jobs.
The city has begun work on an overall waterfront plan to guide future developments. Thus far, public marinas, condominiums and a shoreline park have recently replaced out-of-date and unused industrial properties and warehouses along the city's waterfront.
City planners are also confronting lake frontage as a diminishing resource. ''We are looking at the possibility of relocating some remaining industrial users to free up more lake-front property,'' said Gary Boyle, Sandusky's planner.
With 40 undeveloped acres, the $50 million, 110-acre Harbor condominium community in eastern Sandusky is one of the few residential developments on Ohio's shore with remaining waterfront land. Begun in 1983, the Harbor's 188-unit complex is one of the largest of the area's recent second-home developments. In addition to residences, a 237-room Radisson Hotel opened in mid-1988 and a $1 million, 90-acre wetlands preserve was completed last year.
Condominium units range from 800-square-foot studios at $100,000 in the five-story Marina Tower, to 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom villas on the lakefront for $270,000. Each of the Harbor's residences also includes a boat slip.
In response to a continuing demand for second homes from boating enthusiasts across the state and from local executives who maintain winter homes in Florida and summer homes near their offices, another 69 single-family-home lots ranging inprice from $135,000 to $330,000 are to be offered later this year. Construction is set to begin in mid-1991. Each lot will have access to the water after the addition of three man-made channels.
''There is no doubt that the islands are a major attraction,'' said Jack Brubaker, site manager for Northill Corporation, the Fort Wayne, Ind., developer of the condominium community. ''If you dock in Cleveland there is no place to go in the lake but out and back.''

HEADLINE: Little Progress Is Seen OnEnvironment Goals

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
THREE years after Connecticut developed a comprehensive environmental plan setting out goals for the year 2000, a state environmental panel has reported little progress toward meeting them.
''The current rate of progress will not allow us to reach the '100 percent of target,' or anywhere close, by the year 2000,'' concludes a report released this month by the State Council on Environmental Quality.
Beach closings, one measure of coastal water quality, rose to 70 in 1989 from 57 in 1988 and 48 in 1987, the report said.No major parks have been acquired, it said, and meeting the goal for farmland preservation will take the state almost a century, at the present rate. 
''Something is going to have to change to meet all of the goals,'' said the executive director of the council, Karl J. Wagener.
 
'A Lot of Frustration'
The director of the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Suzanne Y. Mattei, was a member of the original Environment 2000 panel, appointed three years ago by Gov. William A. O'Neill. ''There's a lot of frustration,'' she said. ''There was nothing in that document that could not be accomplished. We can set the goals that we want, but we're not going to be able to meet them, unless we have a governor and a legislature committed to meeting them.''
Another member of the committee, John E. Hibbard, director of the Connecticut Forest and Parks Association, said: ''As a society, we're often short-lived in our commitments. Back in the 1960's, we set a lot of goals, too. We were going to clean up the water and separate the sewers from the storm drains and clean up Long Island Sound.Did we reach them? But I think 1990 is a good year to look at these goals again.''
The 20th Earth Day in May helped to renew interest in the environment, Mr. Hibbard said, and the lack of progress toward meeting the goals in the first three years of the 12-year state plan could galvanize the public, and spur Connecticut to increased environmental efforts.
State Rep. Mary M. Mushinsky, Democrat of Wallingford, co-chairwoman of the legislature's Environment Committee, said the plan was forged in what turned out to be the last very good year for the Connecticut economy, at a time when people thought there would be more money for environmental programs.
''But it's been downhill since then,'' she said. ''And it doesn't look very rosy for the next couple of years. So if we don't want to lose ground, we've got to come up with innovative funding, and I think the public will support us in that.''
 
Set a Precedent
The first steps were taken this year, with the General Assembly's approval of user fees that go directly to the state Department of Environmental Protection, Ms. Mushinsky said. The money this year will pay only to maintain the department's staff, she said, but the action has set a precedent, breaking an unofficial prohibition against so-called dedicated funds.
Now it is up to the Connecticut lawmakers to come up with fund-raising mechanisms like California's gasoline tax, which is dedicated to environmental programs, she said.
The Environment 2000 plan, first released in September 1987, set out goals in 42 areas that were to be met by 2000. The council's report on progress, making its way now through the environmental community, cites a number of areas where advances have been limited.
For instance, one goal of the plan was separation of combined sewer and storm-drain systems in some cities. The combined systems overflow in heavy rains, dumping raw or partially treated sewage into streams.No systems have been separated since 1987, the report noted, and at current financing levels, reaching the goal will take more than 20 years.
Some 550 miles of the state's 880 miles of rivers and streams are classified as swimable and fishable, the report said, but that has not changed since the goal of 100 percent was adopted, and about 5,000 acres of lakes remain polluted by excessive nutrients from septic systems, lawn fertilizers and agricultural runoff.
Of 54 stations that test for heavy metals in five major rivers, 20 showed some improvement, but the majority, 31, showed no improvement, and 3 stations recorded worsening conditions.
 
Wildlife Restoration
There are some bright spots in the report. Wildlife restoration programs seem to be succeeding, it said, with populations of piping plover, osprey, bald eagle, deer, turkey and otter showing improvement. Black ducks have shown some decline, and the D.E.P. is trying to bolster their population, it said, ''but existing development will likely preclude a recovery to their past population levels.''
And even where improvement is noted, a delicate balance has been achieved. The number of days when Connecticut air met Federal standards for smog has increased, for instance, but the State Department of Transportation projects that between 1970 and 2000, the number of vehicle miles traveled will increase from 45 million to 75 million, wiping out the gains made with cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars.
The D.E.P.'s Environment 2000 liaison, Hugo Thomas, said the department cannot force people to stop driving their cars or watch to make sure every backyard mechanic is not dumping motor oil down a storm drain.
''We're frustrated that so many of these things are beyond our control,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''But at the same time, we're developing some very good documentation to show we need better programs.''
Ms. Mattei said some environmentally conscious legislation would have no cost attached and could even save money. For instance, laws governing the filling of inland wetlands now require consideration of a number of factors, she said, but if the regulations were made simpler, fewer of the cases would end up in court.
 
'Wishy-Washy Laws'
''We need laws that set much stricter standards,'' Ms. Mattei said. ''A very clear law is actually going to save money. But what we have are a lot of wishy-washy laws.''
Ms. Mattei said she hopes that the governor and legislators elected this year will bring new ideas and new vigor to the environmental movement.
''I don't think it's too late,'' she said. ''Most of the goals we should be able to accomplish. But it means a concentrated effort from now through the turn of the century.''
Mr. Hibbard said the $100 million proposed to acquire parkland is insufficient to meet the goal of Environment 2000, which is 140 acres of public recreation land for each 1,000 residents. The state, with about 3.1 million residents, has some 310,000 acres of public recreation land, the report said.
Mr. Hibbard said $400 million to $500 million will be needed for buying parkland, and a like amount will be needed for farmland preservation.
''We need to redouble our efforts in the next decade, if we are going to approach these goals,'' he said.
Ms. Mushinsky said that if public support grows for the environment, as the advocates predict, the programs could advance.''To do an effective program, we're going to need a new funding source,'' she said. ''And I think the public supports user fees for the environment, when they know that's where it's going.''

HEADLINE: Courts Are Undoing Efforts To Aid Minority Contractors

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
As a result of a recent Supreme Court decision, courts around the country are dismantling state and local programs that set aside contracts for companies whose owners are members of minority groups.
The businesses' owners, most of them black or Hispanic Americans, say they have suffered substantial economic losses because of the ruling.
In the wake of the January 1989 decision ruling that a Richmond, Va., ordinance was unconstitutional, lower courts have struck down such programs in San Francisco, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Birmingham, Ala., Jacksonville, Fla., and Dayton, Ohio, and at the state level in Michigan.
 
Law Violated 14th Amendment
In the Richmond decision, the Court voided the local law stipulating that work valued at 30 percent of the value of city construction contracts had to be awarded to businesses with minority owners. It said the ordinance violated the Fourteenth Amendment, which says no state may deprive any person of equal protection of the laws. 
Before adopting racial or ethnic preferences, the Court said, a city or state has to show evidence of discrimination ''with some specificity.'' Societal discrimination is ''too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy,'' it said.
The Court has upheld a set-aside program established by Congress at the Federal level, and last month it sanctioned the Government's preference for minorities in awarding licenses for television and radio stations. The Court said the Federal Government had ''unique remedial powers'' far exceeding those of cities and states.
 
Consultants Benefit
The Richmond decision is proving to be a boon for consultants and statisticians who help local governments catalogue and document past discrimination. To address the Court's objections, many local governments have commissioned studies of racial, ethnic and sexual discrimination in the marketplace for construction, supply and other goods and services.
White contractors in Columbus, Ohio, are already challenging the fairness and objectivity of such studies, and similar protests are expected elsewhere.
To avoid lawsuits, many agencies, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, have voluntarily suspended the use of minority set-asides, which involve the solicitation of bids exclusively from companies with minority owners. The New Orleans school board, citing the Richmond case, repealed its set-aside program four months after the Court's decision.
Some cities, including Minneapolis, have abandoned numerical goals in dealing with such companies and have adopted preferences for ''emerging small businesses,'' defined without reference to race or ethnic background. Many states and cities, including South Bend, Ind., are re-evaluating their affirmative action programs in light of the Court's decisions.
 
A 'Devastating' Impact
''The impact of the Richmond decision on state and local government programs has been devastating,'' said Anthony W. Robinson, president of the Minority Business Enterprise Legal Defense and Education Fund, a legal group that represents minority contractors.
It ''opened the floodgates to additional litigation'' and has caused a substantial loss of income for black and Hispanic contractors, he said.
Richmond adopted its set-aside program in 1983 and suspended it under court order in 1987 after a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond. Michael K. Jackson, an assistant city attorney, said last week that the proportion of the total value of city contracts going to businesses with minority owners declined to 11 percent last year from 32 percent in 1986.
E. R. Mitchell Jr., a black contractor in Atlanta, said the value of his work in progress, $13 million in January 1989, has dropped to $5 million currently, forcing him to lay off workers.
 
'We Lost Business'
''We have lost business with the City of Atlanta, the Atlanta School Board and Fulton County,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''Some general contractors decided that because of the Richmond decision, they do not need to seek out minority subcontractors or minority joint venture partners on their projects. Some local government agencies that did not have set-aside plans in the past are afraid to adopt them now because they fear that a white contractor will sue them.''
At least 11 lawsuits challenging such programs have been filed against local governments by members or local chapters of the Associated General Contractors of America, which represents 32,000 companies in the construction industry. Michael E. Kennedy, special counsel for the association, said: ''The lower courts are faithfully following the Supreme Court decision in the Richmond case. The net effect is to strengthen the competitive-bid system because they reject efforts to inject irrelevant factors, like race and sex, into the award of public contracts.''
Rebecca Doggett Andrade, director of minority and small business development for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said: ''Before awarding a contract, we ask contractors for a good-faith commitment to use the services of minority businesses. But we no longer have the ultimate penalty: denial of the contract for failure to do so.''
Over and over, in cases filed by white contractors, lower courts cite the City of Richmond v. Croson as a reason for holding set-aside programs unconstitutional.
 
Ordinances Fall
The Georgia Supreme Court, citing the Richmond case, struck down a set-aside program in Atlanta, saying the city had produced ''no evidence of discrimination against black contractors.''
In Florida, Federal District Judge John H. Moore 2d struck down Jacksonville's set-aside program, saying it ''suffers from the same constitutional infirmities that the Supreme Court found in the City of Richmond plan.''
The chief judge of the Federal District Court in Philadelphia, Louis C. Bechtle, recently struck down a 1982 city ordinance that set aside 15 percent of city contracts for minority businesses and 10 percent for companies owned by women.
He said the Philadelphia ordinance ''suffers from the same defects as the Richmond plan'' in that it was not based on ''specific identified evidence'' of discrimination and was not ''narrowly tailored'' to remedy such bias. Different Standard for U.S. The Federal programs meant to address racial discrimination ''are subject to a different standard than such classifications prescribed by state and local governments,'' Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote last month in a case involving affirmative action programs of the Federal Communications Commission. The court upheld those programs, which give a preference to blacks and other minorities seeking licenses to operate radio and television stations. And in 1980, the Court upheld a Federal law under which minority-owned businesses were given at least 10 percent of certain Federal grants for the construction of public works.
But those decisions did nothing to save many state and local set-asides.
Judge Alex Kozinski of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco gave one reason for making such distinctions in a decision striking down a San Francisco ordinance that reserved city contracts for minorities and women.
Members of Congress, he said, represent a much broader ''spectrum of interests'' than do the members of a state or local legislative body, so there is less ''likelihood of oppression'' when Congress establishes a program favoring one race or ethnic group over another.
A few set-aside programs have been upheld. Ronald C. Sims, a member of the King County Council in Seattle, said, ''We tried to anticipate what the Supreme Court would rule, and we repeatedly adjusted our ordinance so it could withstand a legal challenge.''
Immediately after the Court decision in the Richmond case, King County retained a consulting firm to augment findings of racial discrimination it had compiled since 1986. In addition, the county set separate numerical goals for different categories of work, like architecture, engineering and construction, so it could not be accused of having a rigid quota.
The effort paid off. In December 1989, Federal District Judge William L. Dwyer in Seattle upheld the county's program giving preference to women and minority groups in letting contracts.
In revising their affirmative action plans, many other local governments have shortened the list of intended beneficiaries to include only groups that have experienced discrimination in their markets.
The Richmond ordinance, like the Federal public works law, gave a preference to businesses owned by blacks, Hispanic Americans, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts. The Court criticized the ''gross over-inclusiveness'' of the Richmond plan, saying, ''There is absolutely no evidence of past discrimination against Spanish-speaking, Oriental, Indian, Eskimo or Aleut persons in any aspect of the Richmond construction industry.''

HEADLINE: Data Verify Economy's Malaise: 16 States in or Near a Recession

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The national economy has become so sluggish that 16 states, with more than a third of the nation's population, are in a recession or close to one, an analysis of employment data shows. And throughout the country, people are talking of stagnant wages, falling real estate prices, deeply indebted corporations and jobs that are getting harder to find.
But the economic statistics collected by the Federal Government do not confirm that a national recession exists. Instead of a classic recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of a decline in output and a surge in unemployment, the statistics portray an economy that has been expanding for nearly nine years and continues to do so, although slowly. That has left a number of economists searching for ways to characterize the hardships that afflict the American economy.
 
Problems Amid Prosperity
''There are many problem areas and only a few pockets of prosperity, none very inspiring,'' said Clair Asklund, an expert in regional economics at DRI/ McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting firm. ''Most of the country is slipping back from the lively 1980's into nothing exciting economically.'' 
Sindlinger & Company, which asks nearly 800 households a week questions about their incomes, has found a rising level of frustration in the answers. Nine of 10 people surveyed said their incomes were being squeezed because insurance premiums, taxes and other fixed costs had risen faster than wages or the opportunity to work more hours.
''This is not a recession peopled by the unemployed,'' said Albert Sindlinger, owner of the firm, noting that the nation's civilian unemployment rate is 5.2 percent. ''This is the employed becoming ever more squeezed.''
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, came back from a trip through the Midwest during the Fourth of July Congressional recess with a similar assessment. ''People are making it,'' he said. ''They are getting along. But there is no spark left.''
 
Losing the Touch
The United States, in sum, has temporarily lost its golden touch, economists, public officials and executives say. Even the most prosperous states, principally those in the Northwest, seem unable to generate the sort of boom times that brought quick wealth almost overnight to many companies and their executives in the 1980's.
The Boeing Company, in Seattle, is probably the nation's most visible example of a boom company, with a huge backlog of orders for commercial airliners and its round-the-clock operations. To make the planes, Boeing built a big factory and greatly expanded its work force, injecting wealth into the region. But the expansion is over and, despite the order backlog, Boeing has announced layoffs because of a cutback in its military business.
''We are beginning to see a slowdown in growth in the Northwest, partly because of Boeing,'' said Carolyn Sherwood-Call, an expert on West Coast economies at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. With more than 100,000 employees and many suppliers, Boeing has a big impact on the region.
Exactly what is happening in the nation's various regions is hard to track. The Commerce Department reports the performance of the national economy by calculating each quarter whether the gross national product has increased or shrunk, but no similar figures are kept for the states or regions.
The national G.N.P. measures the value of the goods and services produced in the United States each year, a sum that exceeds $5 trillion. It has been growing lately at an annual rate of 1.5 to 2 percent - sluggish, but enough to avoid a classic recession.
 
Measure of Recession
Because the Government does not calculate G.N.P. state by state, some economists use job growth within a state to measure economic performance. If the number of jobs rises over a 12-month period, a state's economy has expanded by this criterion; if the job total shrinks, the state is in recession.
Various surveys tend to confirm state-by-state assessments based on job-growth figures. Marcia Howard, research director for the National Association of State Budget Offices, for example, said 25 state governments have had to draw on savings to cover expenditures in the 1990 fiscal year, which ended June 30, because weak economies produced less-than-anticipated tax revenues. Her list includes most of the states that the job data show to be in recession or close to one.
By the measure of job growth, Michigan and five New England states - Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont - are clearly in recession. Michigan is suffering because the auto industry has been in a slump. New England has been hurt by the collapse of the construction industry and by stagnation in three other former engines of growth: military contracting, computer manufacturing and financial services.
 
On the Borderline
Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania are not doing much better than the New England states, suffering some of the same problems. Jobs in these states and five others - Alabama, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri and Wyoming -are increasing at a rate of less than 1 percent a year, which Mr. Asklund of DRI/McGraw-Hill describes as ''teetering on recession.''
For the nation as a whole, job growth over the past year has been 1.8 percent.
The differences among state economies are not simply regional: sometimes strong states are neighbors of weak ones. Jobs in Ohio and Wisconsin, for example, are growing by more than 2 percent annually because these states are home to electronics companies and machine tool manufacturers that are benefiting from the one major bright spot in the national economy: strong exports and a related demand for new machinery.
Illinois, on the other hand, while benefiting from the strong exports of a company like Caterpillar Inc., is being dragged down by Chicago, where layoffs at big department stores, banks and other financial institutions have hurt the city. And Chicago has not done as well as Indianapolis and Des Moines in attracting new companies, said Robert Schnorbus, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. He blames Chicago's higher housing costs and wage levels.
Similarly, Nevada is a boom state, largely because of a burst of construction in Las Vegas. But next door in California, economic growth has begun to slow, with cutbacks in military spending forcing layoffs among aerospace companies and the construction industry losing steam.
 
Anecdotal Evidence
The surveys and statistics aside, anecdotal evidence of hard times is proliferating.
Don Sweeney, an economist at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, for example, reports that long-distance telephone traffic is stronger than ever, thanks to discounted rates. But equipment sales, which provide 40 percent of A.T.&T.'s revenue, are falling, largely because the customers for switchboards, phone lines and the like are corporations suffering from the weak economy.
The story is similar among airlines. George James, chairman of Airline Economics, a consulting firm in Washington, said that airlines have been forced in the last six months to introduce more discount fares. This has reduced the average revenue for each passenger for the first time in several years, he said.
The sluggish economic growth has reduced corporate profits and slowed the growth of income for many Americans. Less income, in turn, has meant lower tax revenues for many cities, leading them to cut spending for roads, sewers, airports and other projects that are a huge source of income for the private sector. That has helped to push up the unemployment rate in the construction industry to more than 10 percent.
 
Capital Spending Cutbacks
In a survey of 570 cities released last week by the National League of Cities, 37 percent reported having reduced capital spending in the just-ended fiscal year. More than half cut operating spending and either froze or reduced the number of city employees.
Yet despite all these problems, the national economy has not been dragged down into a traditional recession, in part because the economy is more resistant to recession than in the past, not only in the United States but also in other industrial nations.
The usual trigger for a recession is an unexpected pileup of unsold goods - an accumulation that often develops when corporations become too optimistic about future sales. The bloated inventories dissolve the optimism, prompting nervous executives to cancel orders for goods and supplies. The canceled orders, in turn, force layoffs at factories and the unemployment rate rises. The unemployed, as well as frightened workers who still have their jobs, cut back on purchases. And the economy contracts.
But a different pattern has emerged in this slowdown, leading many economists to suggest that Corporate America, with the help of various computer techniques, has temporarily cured itself of its tendency to let inventories balloon. The Eaton Corporation, a Cleveland manufacturer of axles, transmissions, engine valves, construction equipment and machinery, illustrates the new style.
 
Inventory Controls
''We never have more than a two-day supply of parts and materials on hand,'' said Adrian Dillon, Eaton's chief economist. ''The downside of this tactic is that we might not be able to meet the demand if the economy suddenly accelerated. But we're operating in anticipation of hard times, not a boom.''
So far, Commerce Department data have shown no unusual surges in inventories - with two glaring exceptions: new autos piled up in dealers' lots early this year, forcing cutbacks in production and layoffs, and a huge stock of unrented apartments and office buildings, built in the 1980's, has compounded the construction industry's problems.
In recent speeches and in Congressional testimony, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has cited the new inventory controls as a major factor that reduces the odds of a traditional recession. Partly for this reason, the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to use its power over interest rates to lower them and stimulate the economy by encouraging credit-financed spending.
The Bush Administration has been pushing for this stimulation, and Mr. Greenspan finally said last Thursday that the Federal Reserve might push down rates slightly - not to stimulate the economy, he said, but to offset credit restrictions imposed recently by banks.
Mr. Greenspan has also acknowledged that the old inventory problem could return.
''We should not presume,'' he said in a recent speech, ''that the extraordinary changes that have occurred in inventory management in recent years have fundamentally altered inventory purchasing patterns in a manner that will eliminate, henceforth, any concern we may have of inventory excess and inventory-induced recession.''

HEADLINE: Report by World Bank Sees Poverty Lessening By 2000 Except in Africa

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
The first major study of the world's poor in a decade says that poverty is likely to decline by the year 2000, except in sub-Saharan Africa.
There, the number of impoverished people is expected to rise by 85 million and to continue to account for more than 40 percent of the region's population.
The report, being issued on Monday by the World Bank, the largest provider of aid to developing countries, found that 1.1 billion people - a fifth of the world's population - still live with annual incomes of less than $370 a year. The bank draws its poverty line at that amount, below which people are deemed unable to buy adequate food, shelter and other necessities. 
But the report foresees a decline by nearly a third in the number of the world's poor in the next 10 years. It bases its forecast on the World Bank's projections of somewhat faster economic growth in developing countries, a continuation of historical trends of moderate growth in industrial countries, declining interest rates and slowly improving commodity prices.
 
Fewer of the Very Poor
The report said that if those projections hold up, there would be 825 million people living in poverty in the year 2000, down by 300 million from 1985. Put another way, 18 percent of the world's population would live in poverty, a decline from 32.7 percent in 1985.
The study on poverty, issued as the World Bank's annual ''World Development Report,'' is the most thorough compendium of data on the world's poor. Earlier World Bank reports on poverty have been widely used by policy-makers in both developed and developing countries.
The report refocuses the bank's attention on poverty after a decade of dealing with global debt problems. It also marks a shift in tone, calling the prevalence of poverty ''staggering'' and ''shameful,'' given the general economic advances of recent decades.
But in contrast with earlier studies, it does not argue that more foreign aid is the answer.
Rather, the bank, which provides $20 billion a year in loans and grants to developing countries, looks at the quality of aid, criticizing some of its own earlier projects and emphasizing that aid has to be better directed. It says that both donors and receivers of funds must show a greater commitment to reducing poverty.
 
Gargantuan Projects
''Enormous sums have been spent for purposes that have nothing whatever to do with reducing poverty -military expenditures, for example, and lavish 'cathedrals in the desert,' '' said the report, referring to projects that it deemed to have little useful value.
The new tone reflects the influence of the Bush Administration and the American-appointed president of the bank, Barber B. Conable Jr., a former upstate New York Republican Congressman, who has inveighed against third-world military spending and is generally known for a practical, no-frills leadership style. As the biggest stockholder of the 152-nation, Washington-based institution, the United States has named the chief executive since the World Bank was founded in 1945.
The study was published within days of the conclusion of the economic summit meeting in Houston, at which leaders of the seven richest industrial countries gave scant attention to the problems of the poor. The summit agenda focused on global trade issues and economic help for the Soviet Union.
The study said there has been some progress against poverty in developing countries that have taken part in the overall economic growth that has taken place since the 1960's.
Indonesia is cited as a case in point. Over the last two decades, that country has reduced the incidence of poverty from almost 60 percent of the population to less than 20 percent. And in China, which accounts for a quarter of the people in the developing world, life expectancy rose from 52 years to 69 in the 25-year period ending in 1985.
 
Why Africa Is Different
The report said conditions in Africa were expected to run contrary to the worldwide decline in poverty because that continent faces such intractable problems as high population growth, weak basic installations, and wars that have devastated Liberia, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Somalia and the Sudan.
The study projected that 265 million people, or 43.1 percent of the population of Africa south of the Sahara, would live in poverty in 2000. In 1985, 180 million people, or 46.8 percent, lived in that condition.
It said that while Asia's share of the world's poor would decline to 53 percent by the end of the century from 72 percent in 1985, Africa's would double, from 16 percent to 32 percent.
Reacting to the report, John W. Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, a Washington-based policy research group specializing in development issues, said:
''This report puts poverty back on the policy agenda. In the crisis atmosphere of debt, recession and adjustment of the 1980's, development and poverty alleviation were too often overlooked.''
 
More on Arms Than Healing
In calling for a better allocation of aid money, the new report was critical of the way poor countries are using their resources.
It noted that in 1986, the latest year for which figures are available, the developing countries spent $159 billion on their armed forces - about five times what they received in aid. In 1984, they spent almost as much on arms imports as on all their health programs.
''The continued provision of aid needs to be carefully examined if it seems that developing-country governments are not serious about reducing poverty,'' the report said. Restating earlier policies, Mr. Conable outlined a two-tiered strategy to combat global poverty. The first element is the pursuit of a pattern of growth that insures productive use of the poor's most abundant asset: labor.
The second builds on the 1980 report's suggestion of increasing basic social services to the poor in education, health care and family planning.
A copy of the report can be obtained for $14.95 from the Publications Department of the World Bank, 1818 H Street, Washington D.C. 20433.

HEADLINE: Rail Line Makes Debut In the Land of Freeways

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 15

 BODY:
With a mixture of fanfare and skepticism, Los Angeles this week opens the first leg of a multibillion-dollar, 150-mile commuter rail line intended to help save this car-choked city from a future of paralyzed roads and unbreathable air.
The line, which begins regular runs at 5:30 Monday morning, covers a 22-mile, 22-station run between downtown Los Angeles and Long Beach in about one hour.
The same ride by car can be somewhat quicker or much, much longer, depending on traffic.
Over the next two decades, at a projected cost of $5 billion, new branches of the rail line are to link communities from the Pacific beaches to the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys and tie into a system of public transportation that is to include buses, car pools and a subway. 
Transportation officials say that in addition to easing congestion on the freeways, where the average speed has slowed to 35 miles an hour, the rail system will help Los Angeles meet Federal air quality guidelines. Will Anybody Ride? The question asked here is: Will anybody ride it?
Only 3 percent of all trips in Los Angeles today are made on public transportation, said Sharon Neely, director of transportation policy at the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. Most of those are on a fleet of 2,000 buses.
Skepticism is fueled by doubts that people here will give up their cars that are a symbol of Los Angeles culture. Adding to the doubts are a general mistrust of public transportation in an area that has had no rail system since the Red Line was abolished and the freeways were built, as well as fears of crime on a line through areas infested with street gangs.
 
Rail Line Called Anachronistic
Some urban planners say the rail line is anachronistic because it will link downtown areas at a time when Los Angeles, already a city without a single core.
Even if the new system efficiently serves commuters between downtown Los Angeles and downtown Long Beach, the planners say, most of them will be left with considerable commuting challenges at either end of the line.
''There is no Manhattan in Los Angeles,'' said Jonathan Richmond, a transportation consultant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Los Angeles has a very free-flowing, dispersed life style. People are going from anywhere to everywhere in a vast urban land area.''
The Long Beach line, known as the Blue Line, has cost $877 million, more than double some projections when work began in 1984. Construction was financed mainly by a half-percent county sales tax voters approved in 1980.
Each of the $1 million electric-powered, rubber-tired cars, built by Sumitomo Corporation of America/Nippon Sharyo of Japan, can carry 230 people seated and standing, with space for two wheelchairs, the transportation commission said. #5,000 to 7,000 Riders Expected Like other officials, Ms. Neely projected a very slow start for the line with 5,000 to 7,000 tentative commuters riding the Blue Line on its first day.
She said that figure should rise to about 35,000 by next summer, when some final portions of the line are completed in Long Beach and downtown Los Angeles. When the rail network is in full operation, the Blue Line is projected to carry some 54,000 passengers a day.
Planners project that the sale of tickets - $1.10 for a one-way fare -will pay only about 5 percent of the $33 million annual operating budget at first.
Ms. Neely said educational programs were under way to persuade people that public transportation can work.
People are also apprehensive about safety. The Blue Line passes through the heart of the hard-core gang territory of Los Angeles, and even before it opened, the police said they had arrested nearly 300 people along the line on charges ranging from vandalism to theft to possession of narcotics.
Capt. Frank Vadurro of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who is in charge of the line's security, said about 15,000 gang members, or nearly one-fourth of the county's gang population, live within a mile of the line.
''Of course, the gangs will view this system as part of their turf,'' Sheriff Sherman Block was quoted by The Los Angeles Times as saying.
 
A Third of Budget for Security
Fully one-third of the operating budget, $12 million a year, will be spent on security, which is to include 118 full-time sheriff's deputies. Painters will try to keep up with graffiti.
Skepticism here has been fueled by a recent study of commuter rail projects conducted by the United States Department of Transportation that found they are often more expensive and less successful than projected.
Don H. Pickrell, the author of the report, said he doubted rail transport in Los Angeles could fulfill the hopes that have been raised for it. Dr. Pickrell is an economist with the Transportation System Center, the research division of the Department of Transport.
His study found that construction costs in Buffalo were 59 percent higher than projected for its rail system, In Portland, Ore., the costs were 28 percent higher, and in Sacramento, Calif., they were 17 percent higher.
Operating costs were 45 percent higher than expected in Portland and 12 percent higher in Buffalo, though they were 10 percent lower than expected in Sacramento.
Besides higher costs, Dr. Pickrell found that average weekly ridership was 66 percent below expectations in Pittsburgh, 54 percent below in Buffalo and 30 percent below in Sacramento.
But the study said the 33-mile San Diego Trolley is so popular that the city plans to triple its length.
Once the entire system in Los Angeles is in place, he said, ''it will offer a pretty high level of transit service to some specific communities and for people making some specific types of trips.''
But he said a cheaper, quicker and more urgent need was to make automobile travel less attractive by reducing affordable parking and moving toward some system of tolls at rush hour.
Ms. Neely of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission said the problems of urban sprawl were being taken into account with plans to connect the rail system to other forms of public tranportation and a car-pool plan. Once the rail system is in place, she said, people will see that in comparison with congested freeways, ''it's safe, it's clean, it's convenient, it's quiet and it's reliable.''
And if habits do not change, she said, the average speed on freeways in Los Angeles is expected to slow to 17 miles an hour by the end of the decade.

HEADLINE: Drama Is Past Tense in Georgia Race

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 15

 BODY:
Near the end of a debate on Saturday between the five Democratic contenders for governor, former Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta said he wanted to sum up what distinguished him from his opponents.
''I think basically their dialogue is about dividing up your tax dollars, and I want to bring in new investment,'' Mr. Young said.
It was not the dramatic clarion call that those who remember Mr. Young as a civil rights leader and outspoken delegate to the United Nations might have expected to hear. But its low-key approach was revealing in a race that has failed to generate much excitement, for all its symbolic resonance. 
Mr. Young seems assured of a spot in an Aug. 7 runoff, probably against Lieut. Gov. Zell Miller, after the primary on Tuesday. Mr. Miller is leading the field in all major statewide opinion polls.
 
Dearth of Interest
But despite the attention the race has generated, Mr. Young's effort to become the first black governor of a state in the Deep South has been a low-key affair.
''I just don't see a lot of interest out there,'' said Charles Schroder, executive director of the Democratic Party in Georgia. ''There is no fire in this race.''
Georgia's Secretary of State, Max Cleland, is predicting that 900,000 to a million people, or a third of Georgia's registered voters, will turn out. ''So far it appears that Georgia voters are giving it all a rather cool reception,'' he said.
On the surface, this would seem to be a campaign rich in history and conflict.
There is Mr. Young's candidacy, juxtaposed with a quirky comeback effort by Lester Maddox, the former segregationist Governor. Mr. Maddox now bills himself as the only true conservative in the race but he says the issue of segregation is irrelevant in today's politics.
And the race pits two moderate-to-liberal candidates, Mr. Young and Mr. Miller, against two conservatives, State Senator Roy Barnes and State Representative Lauren McDonald.
But if polls are to be believed, the race may end about where it began, with the two early leaders, Mr. Miller and Mr. Young, controlling about two-thirds of the votes.
A poll made public by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Saturday showed Mr. Miller with 36 percent of the vote, up from 32 percent in June, and Mr. Young with 30 percent, down from 31 percent in June.
Mr. Barnes had 16 percent of the vote, Mr. McDonald, 5 percent and Mr. Mattox 4 percent. Nine percent were undecided in the telephone poll of 829 likely Democratic voters. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The race has seen few dominant issues and no riveting personalities. Mr. Miller, who has outspent all other candidates, has balanced liberal issues like a call for a lottery to finance educational programs with conservative causes like advocacy of Marine-style bootcamps for first-time drug offenders.
Despite his liberal national image, Mr. Young has stressed his record on economic development as Mayor of Atlanta, promising to create jobs and increase exports in the state. He also hopes to gain support from women, with the most outspoken abortion rights stand among the candidates.
The Journal-Constitution poll showed Mr. Young with 70 percent of the black vote. But there are no signs of a huge black turnout, and the poll shows Mr. Young with the support of only 14 percent of white voters. It shows Mr. Miller defeating Mr. Young 47 percent to 37 percent in the runoff, which will be held if no candidate gains more than 50 percent of the vote on Tuesday.
 
Liberals and Conservatives
To some analysts, the most interesting aspect of the election might not be race and Mr. Young's candidacy, but what it shows about the relative strength of liberal and conservative candidates in the Democratic Party in the South.
Mr. Barnes, in particular, had hoped that Mr. Young and Mr. Miller would divide the liberal vote, putting him into the runoff. Instead, despite trailing only Mr. Miller in spending on television advertising, his campaign has struggled to catch hold.
That has led to widespread speculation about the future of white conservative candidates, who have been the backbone of the party in Georgia and throughout the South.
Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University, said the real message of the Georgia primary, like earlier ones in Texas, Alabama, South Carolina and North Carolina, is that it is increasingly difficult for conservatives to win Democratic primaries in the New South.
''Barnes, Maddox and McDonald are going after phantom voters,'' he said. ''Their voters are much more interested in the Republican primary than the Democratic one.''
But others disagree. Loch Johnson, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, notes that the dominant Democrats in Georgia include Senator Sam Nunn, Gov. Joe Frank Harris and Tom Murphy, Speaker of the State House of Representatives, all products of the party's conservative wing. And he said all the Democrats were running essentially moderate campaigns.
 
Hopes of Republican
Nonetheless, the big winner on Tuesday may be State Representative Johnny Isakson, who is viewed as a shoo-in to win the Republican nomination for governor in a state that has not sent a Republican to the governor's mansion this century.
''If the polls are to be believed, the Democrats are going to nominate a liberal or an ultra-liberal,'' said Mr. Isakson's campaign manager, Jay Morgan. ''That gives us our opportunity just as it has in every other Southern state when the Democratic party leadership and activists led it into nominating a liberal.''
Some analysts say a victory by Mr. Young could enhance the chances of a Republican governor. But, aside from that, they say Mr. Isakson will be facing an uphill fight in perhaps the most Democratic state in the South.

HEADLINE: Another War - the One on Poverty - Is Over, Too

BYLINE: By Daniel Patrick Moynihan; Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, is chairman of the Senate Finance Subcomittee on Social Security and Family Policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The New York Times headline on July 7 was exuberant: ''NATO Allies, After 40 Years, Proclaim End of Cold War.''
On June 6, another headline announced an end of sorts of another war: ''White House Spurns Expansion of Nation's Anti-Poverty Efforts.''
The article reported: ''After considering a variety of ambitious options, the Bush Administration has decided against proposing any major new program or strategy to combat poverty. . . .''
It said that an interagency group convened by the White House ''to rethink the nation's anti-poverty efforts came up with a dozen broad alternatives.'' But the President's Domestic Policy Council concluded, in the Times's words, that ''the options were too expensive or would stir up too much political controversy.'' 
It is 26 years since Lyndon B. Johnson, on Jan. 8, 1964, proposed that the sitting Congress be known as the one ''which declared all out war on human poverty.'' Subsequent Presidents thought to leave their mark on the enterprise.
President Bush's team consulted with the best, and was itself made up of able and committed officials. One unattributed quotation was less than felicitous. ''A White House official summarized the upshot this way: 'Keep playing with the same toys. But let's paint them a little shinier.' ''
Three things have changed from the time the war on poverty began. First, there is no money. The Reagan deficits are doing their intended work, providing an automatic obstacle to any new program. A Bush Administration official said: ''The members of the Domestic Policy Council wanted to do something about poverty, but we realized we didn't have any cash.'' Big surprise, but let it pass.
Second, ''results'' are hard to come by.
The White House group considered a number of high-risk proposals and concluded there was no assurance of results. It judged that a major new ''investment in children'' would have a big payoff in the long run but was ''not likely to show an immediate reward.''
The ''easy'' war on poverty tasks have been accomplished. Medicare and Social Security eliminated large-scale poverty among the aged within a decade of President Johnson's declaration.
However, child poverty has worsened and is now the No. 1 problem. In 1960, 67 percent of black children lived with two parents; the proportion is now down to 32 percent. The trend is the same for Hispanic and white children. The locus of poverty today is neither regional, nor racial. It is the female-headed household. What is lacking is not money but what the sociologist James H. Coleman has called ''social capital'' - that fund of family and friends that pays ''dividends'' throughout one's lifetime.
Programs addressed to the manifestations of the central problem, the fractured family, rarely fulfill the hopes with which they are begun. As far back as 1978, the sociologist Peter H. Rossi formulated his ''iron law'' -''the expected value for any measured effect of a social program is zero.''
It has proved politically wiser to set goals than to start programs. Thus, Mr. Bush has set a series of educational goals for the year 2000. There is no possibility these can be achieved. ''Graduation rate . . . no less than 90 percent.'' ''First in the world in math and science.''
Ronald Reagan set precisely the same goals in 1984 for 1990. Nothing happened, but nobody got mad. By contrast, people get personal about studies of poverty programs. Third, there is not much reward. Over time, an adversarial style has developed in the poverty debates that warns the prudent policy maker not to get involved.
The White House group considered setting national standards for child support. ''Government funding would fill any gap between the minimum benefit and the amount paid by the absent father,'' the Times reported.
The sum of $3,500 for each child was discussed. But had the proposal gone forward, the air would be filled with denunciations of the $3,500 standard as barbarously and deliberately inadequate. By deciding to do nothing, the White House has spared the President from being denounced for doing too little.
So there it is. The metaphor of war has lost all its militance and urgency. What we, in fact, face is more like peacetime reconstruction after the devastation of family life in the period 1960 to 1990. Moreover, we have in place legislation that could be the instrument in this reconstruction over, say, the next 20 years: the Family Support Act. (I was the principal sponsor in the Senate and Thomas J. Downey was in the House.) The act redefined welfare. Absent fathers were to provide child support. Young mothers were to find work. There is real money behind this law. A billion dollars and more in Social Security entitlement funds. Every year. Guaranteed. It is the kind of money that lets you plan for, well, 20 years.
Typically, it took the New York State Legislature 18 months to enact legislation enabling the state to take the money. The sticking point was whether the new money would pay for four years of college rather than two. As of last week, the bill was signed, and now we shall learn if we have the social energy to implement it.
And there are things going for us. Demography - at last! - is on the nation's side. The most important fact about poverty in the 90's is that the birth rate plunged in the 70's. The size of the welfare population should soon drop by a third or more. Teen-age mothers-to-be were simply not born. Growth in the labor force will drop to 1.2 percent; white males will constitute less than 20 percent of new entrants. Everyone will be needed. We are short of young people. Here, then, is the proposition. As of now, it can be assumed that half the children born in New York City in 1990 will be on welfare by 2010. If we can cut that to one-quarter, we will have won a peacetime victory more momentous than all that war-on-poverty talk. For my part, I may skeptical. Prove me wrong.
