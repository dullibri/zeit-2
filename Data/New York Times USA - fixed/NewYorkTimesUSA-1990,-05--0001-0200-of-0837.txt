HEADLINE: Albany Leaders, in Budget Push, Agree on Sales Tax for Services

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 30

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders have tentatively agreed to extend New York State's sales tax into a broad new area - the service industry.
The sales tax is also expected to be applied to magazines, which now enjoy special exemption, and to telephone calls made to 900 numbers.
But under the agreement, the details of which were still being worked out today, the bulk of the new revenue would come from extending the sales tax for the first time to services like custom computer programming, management consulting, public relations and cleaning services. $500 Million in New Taxes The new sales taxes, it is estimated, would be worth almost $500 million a year. The budget is expected to total $50 billion, and legislators are looking for ways to fill a budget gap that is estimated to be as high as $4 billion. 
Business lobbyists, who have bitterly opposed the plan to expand the sales tax, say it represents a major departure from the state's longstanding policy of limiting the tax to tangible goods and to services that result in tangible goods, like film developing. They say they are concerned that the new sales taxes could crimp New York's service industry, which has been the fastest growing segment of the state's economy.
''For the first time in New York, we're going to be putting taxes on intangible property,'' said Daniel Walsh, president of the Business Council of New York State, the state's largest business lobby. ''It sets tax policy in a very disadvantageous way.''
The tax package appeared to be one of the few elements of the state budget still under negotiation today, four weeks after the legal deadline. The talks have been proceeding almost line by line through the budget.
After a round of late-night talks on Sunday, officials said they had resolved many of the outstanding issues and had already begun to print parts of the budget. It was still unclear, however, when the Legislature would act.
''It's down to two things: the tax package and school aid,'' said one legislative budget analyst. The distribution of state school aid totaling more than $8 billion is traditionally the last budget issue to be resolved. #32 New Judgeships Under an agreement reached Sunday night, the budget would include provisions to create 32 new judgeships across the state. The agreement would end a four-year political impasse that held the number of judges in the state constant while the number of criminal cases soared. [Page B2.] The sales-tax package is just one piece of a broad array of new taxes and fees that are expected to be imposed as part of the budget. All told, the increases are expected to total more than $1 billion. State officials say the increases are needed to counteract a slump in state income and business tax collections.
Officials plan to close the rest of the estimated $4 billion budget gap by making cuts and using one-time revenues like reserve funds and the proceeds from refinancing of bonds.
Maintaining the silence that has surrounded state budget talks, Governor Cuomo and the legislative leaders have refused to discuss details of the new sales taxes.
Under New York's current sales-tax laws, a 4 percent state tax is added to almost all consumer goods except food. On top of this, counties add an additional 3 or 4 percent sales tax - New York City imposes 4 1/4 percent - to all goods subject to the state tax.
Some personal services are subject to the sales tax now, including car repairs and appliance installations. New York City imposes additional sales taxes on parking fees, haircuts, private protection services and detective services.
 
Broadening the Base
Some of the changes in the state sales tax would simply extend taxes already imposed in New York City to the entire state. For example, state leaders have tentatively agreed to extend the state sales tax to cover parking, protection services and detectives.
Many of the new taxes, however, would bring the sales tax into a realm that has traditionally been avoided by both New York City and New York State. These are some of the services that would be taxed:
* Custom-designed computer software, which includes computer programs specifically designed for use by a single corporation.
* Management consulting and public relations services.
* Janitorial services provided by independent cleaning agencies.
By broadening the base of its sales tax, the state would simultaneously expand the base of the tax for counties and cities. Budget analysts said today that the new sales tax could provide as much as $100 million in new revenues to New York City, the center of the state's service industry.
 
Crucial to Balance the Budget
Budget analysts in the State Capitol were working today to draft legislation expanding the sales tax. They said that crafting the legislation so that it would effect only the services intended was proving difficult. But they said the taxes were considered crucial to a balanced budget.
In moving to tax a broader range of services, New York is following an increasingly well-trod but still controversial path, tax experts say.
''Our economy is moving away from tangible personal property to services,'' said Laird Graeser, a research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators in Washington. ''That's where the money is. But for lots of folks in the business community, it's the camel's nose in the tent.''
Groups like the Business Council say they fear it is only a small step from taxing management consulting to taxing services like legal advice or advertising. Only three states, Mr. Graeser said, currently tax such services: Hawaii, South Dakota and New Mexico.
Three years ago Florida acted to impose a tax on a wide spectrum of services including advertising. But the tax was repealed after out-of-state businesses that advertised in Florida objected to paying it.

HEADLINE: Bush Assails Congress for Delay Of $420 Million in Aid to Panama

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
As President Bush welcomed President Guillermo Endara of Panama to the White House, he used the occasion today to criticize Congress for delaying a bill that includes $420 million to help rebuild the Panamanian economy.
''It's embarrassing,'' Mr. Bush told the United States Chamber of Commerce before his meeting with the Panamanian leader. ''I've asked the Senate and the House to move on that legislation over a month ago, and they haven't done it. It's frustrating.'' 
 
Senate Approves Compromise
After President Bush's heated criticism, the Senate approved a compromise tonight that removed a major obstacle to the legislation, which also includes $300 million in aid to Nicaragua.
Senate action on the bill had been stalled over a series of unrelated amendments, including one that would have allowed the District of Columbia to pay for abortions for poor women and another imposing the death penalty in the district for certain drug-related crimes.
Mr. Bush had threatened to veto the measure if the provision on money for abortion was not removed. But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican minority leader, said that the President had interrupted a meeting with him this morning to call Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic majority Leader, and implore him to enact the bill.
Negotiations among the senators produced an agreement to pass the abortion and death penalty amendments and move the battle over those issues to a House-Senate conference committee. The House version of the bill on Panama aid does not address abortion or the death penalty.
Mr. Endara's visit to Washington is his first since American forces invaded Panama on Dec. 20 and ousted the country's military leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Mr. Bush, speaking to reporters after his talks with Mr. Endara, said the United States has a responsibility to see that Panama's shattered economy is repaired.
 
Meeting Expectations
''Unemployment in Panama remains unacceptably high, and we want to help President Endara reduce it to and meet the rising expectations of a liberated Panamanian people,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that trade and credit guarantees approved by Congress this year are only half the job.
While there is virtually no dispute in Congress that the United States has an obligation to assist Panama, some lawmakers have argued that the money in the aid package is more than can be effectively used now.
Mr. Endara, who had hoped for as much as $1 billion from the United States, made no public reference to the aid package today. He expressed general appreciation, saying: ''We are grateful for the American people. Everybody in Panama loves President Bush.''
Mr. Endara was installed as President by United States invasion forces in December. In May of last year, he was the opposition presidential candidate in elections. General Noriega claimed victory, but international observers said the election was a fraud; days later, the Noriega Government declared the elections void.

HEADLINE: German Unification Is Outrunning the Diplomats

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BERLIN, April 30

 BODY:
Representatives of the four victorious powers of World War II convened in a castle here today with East and West German Government specialists to discuss an agenda leading to a unified German state.
But even as the experts began their discussions, the German Democratic Republic created by the Communists is melting away piece by piece, hour by hour as West German companies and products move into the East German market and Bonn officials take the upper hand here.
Diplomats are already making jokes about the ''four plus two'' formula that brought specialists of the Soviet Union, United States, Britain, France and the two German Governments to the round glass-topped table in East Berlin's Niederschonhausen Castle.
 
Unification Arithmetic
''Four plus two. That equals five,'' says one current aphorism making the point that East Germany simply does not count any more as an international player. 
The experts are supposed to prepare talking points for the full scale four-plus-two meetings of their Foreign Ministers beginning Saturday in Bonn.
But the changes taking place in the lives of East Germans seem to be outpacing the deliberations in the castle. Already hundreds of West German entrepreneurs have set up businesses in East Berlin and other East German areas. An East German car owner was astounded the other day to find the People's Own Chemicals Factory tire store that he was accustomed to patronize was now labeled Kroning, a West German concern. Inside were products from the British company Dunlop and the French giant Michelin.
''Is this now a private shop?'' the driver asked a workman.
''I don't know,,'' the employee replied. ''It doesn't interest me. The main thing is the pay envelope.''
 
Quick Film Developing
Down the street a camera shop has announced that its customers can now have one-day service for developing and printing their films instead of the of two to three weeks that had been customary. The proprietor has begun sending film to a West Berlin firm for processing.
Such services, of course, cost more than the East German ones they are replacing and with East German wages scaled at roughly one-third those of West Germany, the new prices concern many people here.
More worrisome for the bulk of the East Germans is that as soon as a treaty between East Berlin and Bonn initiating a currency union goes into effect on July 1, rents, public transport prices and other items kept low by heavy subsidies all the years of Socialism will go sky-high.
''I've already started planning to move to a smaller apartment,'' said Hans Gerd Protsch, a Foreign Ministry official who has a four-room flat facing Karl-Marx-Allee.
 
Property Claims
Other East German householders have become anxious that many of the more than three million people who fled this country since it was founded in 1949 will now demand their properties back.
Recently West Germany's Central Association of House, Apartment and Property Owners calculated that as many as 500,000 citizens will raise such claims.
In addition claims are being made for properties confiscated by the Communist authorities after they took power. One such claim has been filed by a citizen of Switzerland who owned the land near Alexanderplatz where a huge television tower now stands. ''I don't want a television tower,'' the former Berliner told an interviewer.
The rapid approach of German unity on the practical level brought about by the March 18 Parliamentary vote in favor of East Germany's Christian Democratic Union Party has created elements of chaos here. The uncertainties have also prompted another increase in migration of East Germans to West Germany with 4,000 making the journey last week, a figure that is almost twice the low point that was recorded after the March elections.
 
Western Products
On the one hand, the stores filling up with West German goods have on the one hand, pleased shoppers, but on the other, led retailers to refuse to order from East German wholesalers on the premise that the goods were unsalable. A walk past the stores of Friedrichstrasse makes the point: French perfumes, Italian sunglasses and American cigarettes are on display, crowding out East German products.
Supermarkets carry West German eggs, beer and bread at three times the price but hardly three times the quality of East German eggs, beer or bread -yet East Germans are paying the premium for the Western products.
Because of these buying patterns, a surplus of three million eggs has accumulated in East Germany.
Over the weekend, hundreds of East German farmers mounted demonstrations with tractor convoys to protest the invasion of West German farm products, which have forced them to suspend deliveries of their own goods and put off slaughtering of animals for meat.
 
Prospect of Unemployment
A further concern of the East Germans is the prospect of mass unemployment as large numbers of state enterprises close down and others trim their work forces. Already 10,000 are officially registered as jobless in East Berlin and probably another 10,000 who have no work but have not declared themselves. The unemployed receive 70 percent of their wages.
Among the unemployed are many senior figures of East Germany's former Communist Party, including Egon Krenz, who was briefly First Secretary last Autumn and Gunter Schabowski, the Politburo member who declared the opening of the Berlin Wall on television on Nov. 9.
Mr. Schabowski, who is in his early 50's, told a party comrade last week that he had applied to the City Waterworks for a job as inspector of fountains. He explained that East Berlin had over 1,000 fountains and that water purity was often a problem. He was refused the post because of his membership in the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor of the Communist Party.

HEADLINE: Move to Suburbs Spurs The Poor to Seek Work

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill., April 30

 BODY:
Poor black women who have moved from Chicago public housing projects to the suburbs are more likely to find jobs than are women who moved to another neighborhood within the city, researchers at Northwestern University say.
The researchers found that many women had been hampered in pursuing jobs because of fear of crime around the housing projects. In large part, the suburban women told the researchers, they now felt free to pursue jobs because they felt safe to be outside. 
''Many of the women talked about how liberating it was to be able to go out at night and not feel danger,'' said James Rosenbaum, a sociologist who headed the study. ''They also talked about the availability of jobs in the suburbs.''
The women in the study were helped to move from Chicago Housing Authority complexes to subsidized housing units in mostly white suburbs or to more racially mixed parts of the city, as part of a settlement in a Federal suit over segregation in Chicago public housing. It is the choice of the families whether to move to a suburb or to another location in the city.
 
Motivation in Suburbia
The study, released last Tuesday, looked at 230 women, all of them mothers, who had moved to the suburbs and 112 who had moved within the city from 1982 to 1987. It found that the suburban women were far more likely to find jobs than were their counterparts in the city. The employment rate for those in the city was 50.9 percent; for those in the suburbs, 63.8 percent.
''Some women reported feeling a lot more motivated in the suburbs,'' Mr. Rosenbaum said. ''They saw all of their neighbors working. And the parents of their children's friends were working, and some women said this gave them incentive to get jobs.''
The study also found that women who moved to the suburbs were just as integrated socially with their neighbors as were the women who relocated in the city, a finding that the researchers said was unexpected. The researchers had expected that poor black women in more affluent, white suburbs might feel isolated.
But 75 percent of suburban and city women reported making friends, and both groups reported making the same number of friends. In the city, those friends were more often black; in the suburbs, they were more often white.
 
Rebutting the Critics
On average, the women in the study were 35 years old, had 2.5 children and had been receiving welfare payments for more than five years. The demographics of the women in the study largely resemble those of the population in the housing projects.
The researchers said the study showed that relocating poor people into suburban areas could be effective. Critics of the program had predicted that poor black women would not adapt in the suburbs or would not be accepted. In the 14 years since the program was started, about 3,500 poor black families have been helped to move from the public housing projects.
''People remarked repeatedly how oppressive it was to live in the projects,'' Mr. Rosenbaum said. ''They felt they couldn't get a job, because it wasn't safe to be out after dark. And they didn't want to leave their kids alone after school, because they were frightened they would be lured into the gangs.''

HEADLINE: The Perils of Bashing Junk Bonds

 BODY:
Michael Milken is a convicted felon. But he is also a financial genius who transformed high-risk bonds - junk bonds - into a lifeline of credit for hundreds of emerging companies. Snubbed by the banks, these businesses would otherwise have shriveled.
In other words, the Milken case presents issues far more important than one person's slide from the financial pinnacle. There is no condoning Mr. Milken's criminality. But if overzealous Government regulators overreact by indiscriminately dismantling his junk bond legacy, they will wind up crushing the most dynamic parts of the economy. 
Junk bonds are securities that pay high interest because they are issued by companies with little collateral, as is true of new businesses. After the credit crunch of the 1970's, banks retreated from lending to such concerns. So Mr. Milken came to their rescue, raising billions for upstarts like MCI, Turner Broadcasting and the Hovnanian home-building enterprise. About half the money was for capital investment and other internal needs. Used in this way, junk bonds promote economic growth.
The controversy surrounds the use of junk bonds to buy other businesses. And even these acquisitions were mostly non-hostile and non-controversial. Only one in twenty involved a takeover of a large company, and in these, the pressure of large debt impelled new management to improve operations. The mere threat of takeover forced greater efficiency even in non-target companies.
Mr. Milken reminds his audiences that only 5 percent of American corporations have high credit ratings. Cutting off junk bonds means cutting off vital credit for the remaining 95 percent, including nearly every company run by a minority member or a woman. Mr. Milken feathered the financial nest of many fat cats through dubious, even illegal practices. Still, his image as some sort of financial Robin Hood isn't entirely off the mark.
Some junk bond takeovers did harm, ringing up so much debt that even well-run companies like Bloomingdale's were driven into bankruptcy. The takeover binge saddled businesses with debt that creates a cloud of potential bankruptcies. Junk bond takeovers also paved the way for low blows. Raiders threatened managers of target companies with greenmail, a huge payoff at shareholder expense. Over all, however, the final verdict on junk bond takeovers isn't in. Meanwhile, the important need is to stop reacting hysterically to the fraud and excess of the Milken revolution.
First, Congress overreacted to the rash of savings and loan bankruptcies by requiring thrifts to shed all their junk bonds by 1994. This was done even though junk bonds contributed very little to S & L losses, according to Prof. Larry White of New York University and a member of the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
Now, state and Federal regulators are pressuring pension funds and mutual funds to divest their junk bonds. The group representing state regulators is considering further limits on junk bond holdings of insurance companies, even though these make up a small percentage of the assets of most companies. And bank regulators are raising their standards, penalizing higher-risk commercial loans.
The danger of crimping so much capital flow is obvious; a fifth of all new corporate debt issues involve junk bonds. There's a chilling message here for small businesses without valuable assets: Don't look to the banks for capital. Don't look to insurance companies or pension funds. Don't look to Wall Street. In short, don't look. Unless your name is Exxon or I.B.M., prepare to wither.
What's needed is not vindictive junk bond bashing; it's prudent financial regulation. For example, it makes sense to outlaw greenmail. It makes sense to help regulatory authorities by requiring that pension funds, insurance companies and banks provide updated figures for the market value of their junk bonds and other assets.
But a frenzied attack on all junk bonds makes no sense. If that continues, the nation will wind up transforming Michael Milken's downfall into an economic catastrophe.

Squeezing the Slorc

 BODY:
Since the army shot down a democratic revolution in Myanmar, formerly Burma, 19 months ago, that nation's 40 million people have been helpless victims of a capricious military regime. Washington has suspended official aid. But Myanmar's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc, has found a new way to pay for its brutal military operations. It recently opened Myanmar's long-closed economy to foreign commerce.
Teak, fish, seafood, petroleum and minerals are Myanmar's main legal exports. Myanmar is also the source for roughly half the world's heroin. The leading drug lord is Khun Sa, whose private army fights alongside Slorc troops against non-Burmese ethnic tribes at Myanmar's borders. Their aim is to make it easier to ship drugs and other exports abroad. The U.S., unfortunately, is a big market for both legal and illegal commodities.
But thanks largely to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, American consumers may soon stop subsidizing repression. Mr. Moynihan has attached a provision banning U.S. imports from Myanmar to this year's mini-trade bill. By accepting the provision, the House would squeeze the Slorc - and perhaps hasten the fall of one of the world's least savory regimes.

HEADLINE: 20% Dropout Rate Found For Italian-Americans

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
In movies, newspapers and best-selling novels, Italian-Americans say, they often find themselves depicted as killing, cooking or singing.
That biased view, experts said yesterday, has filtered through to classrooms in New York, where many Italian-American students suffer low self-esteem because of the stereotypes. A study released yesterday showed that 20.65 percent, or 1 in 5, will not finish high school.
Those figures are alarming to Italian-American leaders, who for the first time separated the statistics for Italian-American youths from those for whites in general. The dropout study, by City University researchers, showed that Italians, the largest white ethnic group in the city, have the third-highest dropout rate. 
Hispanic students have the highest rate, with 31.78 percent. Blacks are second, at 24.54. The rate for other whites is 18.55. Italians are one-third of the white students in the schools.
''Italian-American youth are highly influenced by popular culture, like all others,'' said Dr. Richard Gambino, director of Italian-American Studies at Queens College and a writer of books and studies of Italian-Americans.
''Hollywood has given an image over the years that Italian-Americans are inferior, physical, anti-intellectual,'' Dr. Gambino said. ''There is the criminal image of the Italian-American. This is not a healthy basis for a self-image to succeed in life or education.''
''The notion that we are all either bigots, bums or buffoons still lives,'' said Frank Arricale 2d, superintendent of Community School District 11 in the Bronx.
The dropout numbers and the reasons behind them were the focus of a daylong conference at the City University Graduate Center on West 42d Street. Held under the auspices of the state and the United Federation of Teachers, the session attracted 175 people.
 
'Driven by a Passion'
Matilda R. Cuomo, wife of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and honorary chairwoman of the State Council on Children and Families, was the leader.
''This is especially distressing, because Italians came to America driven by a passion to get a good education,'' Mrs. Cuomo said. The experts said the reasons for the high dropout rate included not only poor self-esteem and self-images, but also factors like peer pressure, parental ignorance about education and the belief that the benefits of education did not outweigh working.
The profile of Italian-American Educational Attainment, prepared by the John D. Calandra Italian-American Institute, showed Italian-American students in New York lagging behind those elsewhere in the country. Nationally, 15.5 percent of Italian-Americans have less than an eighth-grade education. In New York, the figure is 24.9 percent. Nationally, 18.7 percent have some college work, compared with 12.5 in New York.
 
Concern for 'White Underclass'
The director of the institute, Dr. Joseph V. Scelsa, said Italian-Americans in New York were simply suffering the same urban stresses that are so well documented for black and Hispanic youths, gangs, family dissolution and economic pressures.
''I personally think there is a white underclass in New York beyond Italians, and New York City needs to address that segment,'' Dr. Scelsa, a sociologist, said. ''When you look at the Bensonhurst situation you have to look at perception. There is the perception that Italian-American youths are not going to be given the same opportunities as those in affirmative-action categories. It creates an anger. Unfortunately black men become a symbol of the special treatment.''
The Bensonhurst incident, in which a black teen-ager, Yusuf K. Hawkins, was apparently slain at the hands of a group of white youths because of his race, was a topic throughout the conference. The killing and the press depictions of the predominantly Italian-American neighborhood in Brooklyn pointed up the need for education on the contributions of all groups, conference participants said.

HEADLINE: Pricing the Priceless: Museums Resist, Accountants Insist

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Astronauts have risked their lives to lug chunks of moon rock back to Earth, where the museum-going public has been able to admire them. Now comes the hard part: figuring out what the rocks are worth.
The moon rocks are only the tip of a nasty accounting dispute that has museum executives livid. Until now, hardly any museums have put a dollar value for their collections on the financial statements they show lenders or donors. Most museums believe the information is hard to compute and irrelevant to day-to-day operations. They also see little benefit in flagging the enormous riches in their collections if it would deter donors and tempt thieves. As a result, many museums' most valuable assets, from moon rocks to Michelangelos, are nowhere on their books.
To the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the private seven-member group in Norwalk, Conn., that makes most of the nation's accounting rules, the omissions reflect poorly on the museums' financial statements. So the board is drafting tough new accounting rules that would require museums to state the value of their collections on their balance sheets to earn the unqualified approval of their auditors. 
Though the rules do not have the force of law, most museums are concerned about this proposed change because they have long found it useful to have audited financial statements for fund-raising and other purposes, and auditors will not certify books that do not comply with the profession's chief rule-making body. Guardians of Art or Bookkeepers? But just as Fasbee, as the keeper of the accounting rules is informally known, is offended by the mass oversight, many museums find the proposed solution offensive. To them, the thought of putting a dollar value on their collections is inconsistent with their mission as keepers of rare artworks and other historical treasures.
The clash comes at a time when the art world at large is already under pressure from lawmakers and others to be more accountable for the handling of the treasures in its care. Indeed, a similar argument erupted two years ago when New York City began requiring art galleries to post their prices conspicuously and art dealers derided the effort as crass. More recently, some New York State legislators have backed a bill that would force museums to make their records of sales and purchases available to the public, a reform that the museums have fought in the past.
Many museum officials also fear that the proposed accounting rules could bankrupt smaller institutions. A preliminary estimate by the American Association of Museums in Washington put the cost of compliance at $50 billion, assuming that it would cost an average of $50 to appraise each of the country's roughly one billion museum objects.
Considering that the new rules would cover some 7,000 nonprofit institutions ranging from art museums and historical societies to zoos and botanical gardens, that estimate may be less farfetched than it sounds. Even if the job could be done for less, many museums say they would still refuse to comply rather than spend scarce money on what they consider an absurd exercise.
Robert N. Anthony, a professor emeritus of the Harvard Business School who has written about nonprofit institutions' special accounting issues, said, ''If there ever was a bean-counting rule, this is it.''
 
More Professionalism a Goal
The Fasbee official in charge of the project, Ronald Bossio, concedes that few investors or donors are clamoring for new rules. Nonetheless, he said, the new standards will advance the board's goal of making the books of nonprofit institutions more like those of for-profit institutions and should improve the level of professionalism at the handful of museums that keep poor records of their collections.
''The real question,'' he said, ''is if you're going to present a balance sheet, why would you leave out an asset, particularly one as valuable as a van Gogh?''
Some museums retort that the objects they own are held in perpetuity and thus are not assets in the traditional sense - a difficult claim to make in light of the growing number of museums that deaccession, or sell, items from their ''permanent'' collections to raise money.
To demonstrate what they consider the impossibility of the task, the museums also argue that these items are hard to price, if not priceless. Brisk markets may exist for select works of art, they grant, but the bulk of collectibles either have thin markets or are one-of-a-kind objects whose price cannot be gleaned from the sale of comparable items.
How, for instance, would anyone appraise the American Museum of Natural History's Star of India, the world's largest known sapphire? What about George Washington's false teeth at the National Museum of American History in Washington, Babe Ruth's uniform at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., or the giant pandas at the National Zoo in Washington?
 
Problems in Other Areas
Valuation problems, of course, plague other assets as well, from junk bonds to real estate, which suggests to some that the museums may have other motives for opposing the new rules.
''The arguments against doing so seem very strong,'' said William D. Grampp, a visiting economist at the University of Chicago who wrote ''Pricing the Priceless,'' a recent book that takes a dim view of government subsidies for art. ''But they actually are not, because they apply equally to the private enterprises, and private enterprises have managed to handle these problems.''
He believes that museums hate the idea because they want to spur gifts and deter theft. ''If the public knew what the value of museums' collections were, they would stop giving and start stealing,'' he said.
Aside from Professor Grampp, who calls the proposed new rules ''a very good idea,'' it is hard to find anyone with a kind word for the proposal -or for the accountants who dreamed it up. Even the appraisers, who stand to make millions in fees, are hard-pressed to defend it. ''Sure, I'd like to have the business, but I'm not sure what that's going to accomplish,'' said Ellen Epstein, a fine arts appraiser in Mount Kisco, N.Y.
And the debate is turning nasty. Edward H. Able, the executive director of the American Association of Museums, can barely conceal his impatience with ''Mr. Bossio and his near-sighted accountants.'' For his part, Mr. Bossio accused the museums of thinking they are above rules that are good enough for everyone else. ''They want to live in a different world and use different definitions of assets and liabilities,'' he said.
 
On a Field Trip
Nonetheless, many museums have urged members of their star-studded boards to write protest letters, and quite a few have done so. Several museums also volunteered to arrange field trips intended to make the accountants appreciate the mind-numbing ordeal ahead. Last month, William J. Moynihan, the director of the Amerian Museum of Natural History in New York, personally entertained a group of visitors from the standards board that included Dennis R. Beresford, the chairman.
The first stop was the entomology section, where the accountants got to see an eye-popping number of stink beetles and spiders, some suspended in jars and some ground up for experiments and some that had to be viewed under a microscope.
Inching their way to ichthyology, the guests admired shelf after shelf of dead fish, and capped their visit by passing around some 300-million-year-old fossils. Mr. Moynihan apologized for having to skip so many of the museum's other attractions. ''We only had one morning and you can imagine if you have 40 million objects, you can't get everywhere,'' he said, hoping they would take the hint.
Did they? Mr. Bossio said the show-and-tell session did persuade him that the natural history museums will have trouble meeting the proposed standards. He remains unconvinced that art museums share those problems. ''The art museums would like to use the problems of the natural history museums to get out of having to comply with this,'' he said.
Some accounting experts note that there are other businesses whose most important assets are nowhere on their books - the Coca-Cola Company's trademark is one example -and the standard setters have learned to live with it. ''Why are these assets any different?'' said Jean W. Horton, an audit partner at the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand.

HEADLINE: Bush's Tastes, Down Home to Less So

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Barbara Bush has blown her husband's cultural cover.
Remember during the campaign, when everyone suspected that George Bush was just pretending to like motorboats and pork rinds and country music so he would not be labeled an elitist, when his true tastes probably ran more to sailing, cucumber sandwiches and Brahms?
Now, pentimento style, the real George Bush is showing through the exaggerated campaign persona. First, it leaked out that President Bush preferred popcorn, the current yuppie snack of choice, to the earthier pork rinds. Now, it turns out, he loves opera. 
The music wafting through the White House residence when the Bushes sit around in the evening is more likely to be Leontyne Price or Placido Domingo than Loretta Lynn or the Oak Ridge Boys.
 
Country, Yes, but Also Classical
''I don't want to ruin his myth,'' Barbara Bush said, smiling conspiratorially as she did just that. ''We go to sleep and we wake up to country music. I want that known.'' The Bushes keep their bedroom radio tuned to a Washington country music station.
''But we also do love to hear classical music. And we have it bellowing through the house.''
''Through the house, we do not make people listen to country music,'' she continued. ''Through the house, we put on just beautiful music. We love to hear Leontyne Price, she is just great, or Domingo, that's wonderful. He loves all that.''
The President also loves the recordings of Sandi Patti, and he even named the gospel singer to his new Presidential Drug Advisory Council.
Wearing an American flag broach on her royal-blue blazer, Mrs. Bush chatted about culture and the arts as she sat in the residence one recent morning with the family's English springer spaniel, Millie, snuggled on the rug. Now that Mr. Bush is no longer criticized as an out-of-touch patrician, the Bushes are willing to talk about tastes that might once have been denounced as highfalutin, as well as their more down-home preferences.
 
Giggles Instead of Weeping
The First Lady said that she and her husband sometimes tune in to the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' on Sunday evenings, but now find themselves looking forward to ABC's new Sunday entry, ''America's Funniest Home Videos.''
While Ronald and Nancy Reagan liked to cry over ''Little House on the Prairie,'' the Bushes love to giggle over the videos of sleeping cats falling off television sets, children on sleds crashing into trees and houses, and bridegrooms fainting at the altar.
''Oh, gosh, it is funny,'' Mrs. Bush said. ''I would love to have the back tapes of that. This is terrible to watch people run into walls over and over again, but they are funny.''
Their other favorite program, she said, is ''Murder, She Wrote,'' also on Sunday on CBS. Now that ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' has settled into the same 8 P.M. time slot, the Bushes will have to choose between Angela Lansbury solving crimes and people crashing into walls, or use their VCR, which the President refers to as ''the V.''
 
No Solitary Filmgoing
Like the Reagans, the Bushes enjoy watching movies in the screening room at Camp David, the Presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains. Unlike the Reagans, they do not do their watching in romantic solitude.
''We had the Gatlin boys and Jimmy Dean up to Camp David for the weekend, and we saw a movie about three brothers who take a car trip,'' Mrs. Bush said. She was referring to the film ''Coupe de Ville,'' about three brothers who drive a vintage Cadillac south as a birthday present for their mother and argue all the way about the origin of the lyrics of the song ''Louie, Louie.''
''The Gatlin brothers kept saying, 'We relate to that, we relate to that,' and we related to it a little bit, too,'' laughed the First Lady, who has been on the road with her rambling husband as much as any country music star. ''I snoozed through a tiny bit, but it was cute.''
The President prefers action films, such as Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, to fantasy films like ''Field of Dreams.'' After watching the Kevin Costner baseball fantasy at the White House, the President shook his head and told his companions, ''If anybody figures that out, call me.'' What's Playing At Their Movies Mrs. Bush said that she and the President saw nearly all the Academy Award nominees for best picture: ''We saw 'Glory' up at Camp David. Wonderful. We saw 'Driving Miss Daisy.' We were sad Morgan Freeman didn't win, although we did see 'My Left Foot,' and we loved that, too.''
The Bushes are clearly movie fans. The films they have screened lately involve romance (''Pretty Woman'' ''The Fabulous Baker Boys''), farce (''Naked Gun'') the classics (''Henry V''), suspense (''Hunt for Red October'') and sentiment (''Stella''). There are also lots of films for the grandchildren (''The Little Mermaid,'' ''An American Tail'') and message movies, including one on Mrs. Bush's favorite project, literacy (''Stanley and Iris.'') Lately, the First Lady said, they have been watching tapes of a nine-part Civil War series produced for the Public Broadcasting Service.
Just as President Bush likes to pop out of the White House to buy bagels at Wagshall's, the local delicatessen, or to visit the Peking Gourmet Inn, his favorite Chinese restaurant, in suburban Virginia, so he likes to pop out to theatrical events on the spur of the moment.
In the recent past, Presidents did not go out to restaurants or theater much, fearing that it would create too much commotion. But Mr. Bush doesn't mind a little commotion.
While they usually take in the fare at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Mrs. Bush said they were thinking of trying some of the smaller and less conventional theaters in the capital. ''George and I were just talking about it the other day and saying we really ought to scare the living daylights out of some of these other theaters,'' she said. ''They have wonderful things, too, and we could pop in on one.''
Conjuring up the image of the unwieldy Battleship Galactica, as one Secret Service agent calls the Presidential entourage, Mrs. Bush wryly noted, ''The trouble is, when we pop in, it's 17 seats or something.'' Relaxation Heaven: The One-Act Opera She said she tries to choose shows that will be ''relaxing and easy'' for her husband, after a long, hard day of dealing with world problems. ''My idea of heaven would be an opera that was one act,'' she said.
For their 45th wedding anniversary on Jan. 6, they went to the Kennedy Center to see ''A Tuna Christmas,'' a comedy about life in a small Texas town with Jaston Williams and Joe Sears. They liked it so much they brought the show to the White House to entertain at a dinner for the nation's governors.
Mr. Bush collects celebrities the way he collects friends: a wide and eclectic mix. Helen Hayes recently visited the White House, and Michael Jackson was at the President's side in the Rose Garden when Mr. Bush announced the Washington summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Schwarzenegger, who campaigned for Mr. Bush and has visited the Bushes socially on several occasions, is the head of the President's Council on Physical Fitness. With the help of Vice President Quayle and President Bush, Mr. Schwarzenegger planned to show off the joys of excercise and sports with an exhibiton on the South Lawn Tuesday called ''The Great American Workout,'' featering stationary bicycles, golf, football, baseball and aerobics.
Entertainment for dinners has ranged from Ms. Price to Kenny Rogers to Maureen McGovern. Isaac Stern, the Boys Choir of Harlem, Simon Estes and Mstislav Rostropovich have also performed.
Playing President-as-groupie with enthusiasm, Mr. Bush extends his small gracious gestures to the stars. Elizabeth Taylor, who has been hospitalized with viral pneumonia, received a telephone call from the President. He also called Gloria Estefan several times after the singer's back was broken in a highway accident in Pennsylvania; when Pat Morita of the ''Karate Kid'' admired Mr. Bush's official navy-blue windbreaker, Mr. Bush took it off and gave it to him.
The First Lady says she loves to sneak out in the afternoons to art shows at the National Gallery or the Corcoran or the Phillips, or sometimes to smaller galleries. Although the President is not much of a museum buff, he knows he doesn't like ''filth,'' as he put it. Nonetheless, he pleased the arts community by rejecting government censorship of the arts, saying that artists ought to be able to paint or express themselves however they want. Books, Books, All of Them Open Mrs. Bush said that while she loved novels and nonfiction, she had been ''having trouble getting into books lately'' because of Graves disease, an immune system disorder that affects her eyesight. Although her difficulty with double vision has got better, she said that reading was not as pleasant as it once was.
''I can't read lying on my back at this moment, and that has an enormous amount to do with my eyes,'' she said. ''But I've got about 18 open books going, to tell you the truth. I'm not very proud of that. I just can't find one that I'm saying, 'Oh, I can't put this down at this moment.' ''
She said she has been ''fascinated'' by ''The Journalist and the Murderer'' (Alfred A. Knopf), by Janet Malcolm, an account of the uneasy relationship between the author Joe McGinniss and Jeffrey MacDonald, the Green Beret doctor convicted of murdering his family and the subject of a best-selling book by Mr. McGinniss. She also recently read ''What I Saw at the Revolution'' (Random House), the account by Peggy Noonan of her stints as as speechwriter for Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush.
Although Mrs. Bush often picks out books she thinks her husband would like, she says that ''he's been fairly good about picking out his own books lately.
''He always has a book open. He always goes to bed with a book.''
Recent Presidential reading includes ''Liar's Poker'' (W. W. Norton), by Michael Lewis, a young broker's experiences on Wall Street in the greedy 80's, and ''Megatrends 2000'' (William Morrow & Company), by John Naisbitt and Patricia Aburdene, predictions about economic, political and social developments. Mr. Bush has also been reading ''Barbarians at the Gate'' (Harper & Row), by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, an account of the RJR Nabisco takeover. On the lighter side, he has also been amusing himself with the spoof of American history ''Dave Barry Slept Here'' (Random House).
Mr. Bush confessed during the campaign that he is a ''terrible'' dancer and Mrs. Bush conceded that even with all the practice he is forced to get at state dinners, he still dislikes circling the floor. ''He'd rather do anything,'' she said.
She recalled that when her mother insisted that they dance at their wedding reception, her husband needled her by saying: ''I hope you're having a good time. Enjoy it. It's the last time I'll ever dance in public.''
''Little did he know,'' remarked the First Lady, with a mischievous smile.

HEADLINE: New U.S.-Soviet Trade Pact Stirs Criticism in Congress

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The structure of a new Soviet-American trade agreement, as well as its timing in the midst of the Lithuania independence crisis, is raising opposition in Congress.
The agreement, which was reached in broad terms last Thursday among negotiators in Paris, was quickly criticized the next day by nine Republican Senators who called on the Administration to renounce the agreement because of Moscow's policies toward Lithuania.
But the accord is also raising concern because it makes extensive use of sideletters, which are documents signed by governments that traditionally elaborate points of a diplomatic text.
In this case, many Soviet concessions are contained in sideletters rather than in the main text. 
The reason, said a State Department official, is the United States' desire to accommodate the Soviet Union. ''They wanted it for optics on their side, and we went along,'' the official said, adding that any commitments in the sideletters carry the same weight as provisions in the main agreement.
The perception of some lawmakers, however, is that the sideletters represent a lesser degree of commitment on the concessions the United States wants from the Soviet Union. Those concessions are intended to help balance the lower tariffs on exports that the United States would grant to the Soviet Union under the pact.
A Congressional aide complained, ''This appears to be a jerry-builtquick fix, based on the desire of both sides to show progress on the economic issues before the summit and of the Bush Administration to show support for Gorbachev at this time of trial.''
The pact is expected to be ready for signature during the summit meeting in Washington May 30-June 3 between the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and President Bush.
Under the agreement, the United States would provide so-called most-favored-nation tariff treatment, cutting tariffs on some Soviet items, like vodka, textiles and certain kinds of fertilizers and minerals, and putting Moscow in the same trade category as most other American partners for the first time in a half-century. Tariffs on some items could be cut by as much as 80 to 90 percent.
In addition to providing most-favored-nation treatment, the agreement contains these elements:
* Each side could open a trade office in the other country to advertise, meet with potential purchasers and otherwise promote commerce, although the office could not be used to make direct retail sales. They would also be able to have offices in their embassies to facilitate trade.
* Each country's commercial laws and regulations would be made readily available to the other. This information is already obtainable in the United States in public libraries, but it is closely held in the Soviet Union and tends to inhibit American business executives.
* The countries agreed to protect intellectual property and to abide by international conventions in this area. This is already done in the United States, but not in the Soviet Union.
* The negotiators established regulations involving the use of dollars, rubles and third-country currency in trade transactions. The precise rules have not been made public.
* They also agreed that if one country flooded the other's markets with a particular product, the other country had the right to stop those imports without endangering other trade agreements.
 
The American Demands
Some of the main American demands that have been met chiefly in the sideletters instead of in the central text are protection of patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property, full repatriation of profits for American companies with Soviet operations and improved working conditions for American business operators in the Soviet Union.
The pact has yet to be published, but the sideletters have drawn criticism because of what some see as previous bad experiences with the structure.
''We've had some bad experience with the Japanese and sideletters,'' said an aide to Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who is usually supportive of Bush Administration foreign policy initiatives. ''The sideletters here are going to be looked at very closely.''
The reference was to a 1986 accord with Japan in which a sideletter, and not the main agreement, committed Japan to more than double American penetration of the Japanese computer chip market over five years.
For some time, the Tokyo authorities were unwilling to acknowledge even the existence of the sideletter. Only recently has Tokyo publicly accepted that the market penetration commitment exists.
 
Dispute Over FSX Recalled
The degree of commitment in a sideletter came up, also with Japan, in a dispute over the advanced jet fighter aircraft called the FSX that Japan and the United States have agreed to build together.
Many members of Congress last year wanted to rewrite the production agreement that the Defense Department had already concluded with Japan to provide better terms for the United States.
The Pentagon offered to deal with the Congressional complaints through a sideletter, but Congressional critics insisted on changes in the main text, which the Bush Administration then reluctantly agreed to and negotiated with Japan.
A Bush Administration trade official said there is ''absolutely no difference'' between a commitment in a sideletter and one in the main text, adding, ''They both have the same degree of commitment and legality.''
But the Administration does not speak with a single voice on this issue. A second Bush official from a different department termed the sideletters in this agreement ''chiefly statements of intentions by the Soviets.'' Both spoke only on condition that they not be identified.
While the Administration risks a fight with Congress on the degree of Soviet commitment, it has backed off from what could be an even bigger confrontation by keeping Export-Import Bank credits off limits.

HEADLINE: Income Rise Not Matched By Spending

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
The savings rate of Americans rose to 5.8 percent of their disposable income in March as consumer spending failed to match an increase in personal incomes, the Commerce Department reported today.
Consumer spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.66 trillion, slowing to an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent after a rise of six-tenths in February, the department said. It was the lowest increase since a three-tenths rise in October. 
The department said that personal income grew by eight-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.67 trillion. The rise followed revised increases of eight-tenths in both January and February. The rises were originally reported to have been seven-tenths in January and nine-tenths in February.
 
Strong Inflation Cited
But analysts blamed rising prices for the subdued spending and not intentions of consumers to increase their savings rate. ''For each of the months of the first quarter, we had very strong inflation that cut into purchasing power,'' said David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association. It is likely to reverse itself in the second quarter, he added.
Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, agreed, saying inflation remains the ''single biggest threat to the consumer support of this expansion'' although he too expects it to moderate in the current quarter. ''That will enable consumers to continue to expand their capacity to spend,'' he said.
Consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic health because it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. It has been in the forefront of the economic expansion now in its eighth year following the 1981-82 recession.
''The March and February increases in personal income were boosted by increases in subsidy payments to farm proprietors,'' the Commerce Department said. ''Excluding these payments, personal income increased $24.6 billion, or five-tenths of 1 percent, in March and $28.9 billion, or six-tenths, in February.''
 
Largest Rise Since December
The income of Americans after taxes rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in March, the largest increase since a rise of nine-tenths in December, the department said.
The key component of the income category, wages and salaries, rose $14.1 billion at an annual rate after a $22 billion increase in February.
The rise in personal consumption, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, totaled $13.8 billion, down from $21.3 billion in February.
Purchases of durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last more than three years, fell by $6.8 billion. Purchases of nondurable goods also fell, down $2.5 billion, while services rose by $23.1 billion.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Con Edison's New Chief Comes From the Ranks

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
The Consolidated Edison Company of New York yesterday named Eugene R. McGrath, who started with the utility 27 years ago as what was then called a cadet engineer, to be chief executive, effective Sept. 1.
Mr. McGrath, 48, was named president and chief operating officer a year ago January. As chief executive, he will succeed Arthur Hauspurg, who will retire at age 65 at the end of August. Mr. Hauspurg said he would recommend to the Con Ed board on May 22 that Mr. McGrath be elected chairman as of Sept. 1. 
''These actions will provide an orderly transition of executive responsibility,'' Mr. Hauspurg said in a statement.
Mr. McGrath said yesterday the question of whether he would keep the president's title or whether the board would designate someone else would be resolved between now and September. In the past, the top man has often carried the title of president as well as chairman and chief executive.
Con Ed serves 2.9 million customers in New York City and Westchester County.
''We'll be balancing various issues dealing with energy, the economy and the environment,'' Mr. McGrath said. The two main components of Con Ed's strategy, he said, will be to meet about half of the expected new demand for power through conservation and demand-side management, while obtaining the rest from independent power producers. This will be the case for the next 10 to 20 years, he said.
Mr. McGrath, born and raised in Yonkers, joined the New York utility in 1963 after graduating from Manhattan College. He started as a cadet engineer, a program in those days to introduce new graduates into various Con Ed departments. He holds an M.B.A. from Iona College, earned in 1980 and completed the advanced management program at the Harvard Business School.
Mr. McGrath is a director of Barnard College, the Regional Plan Association and the United Way of New York City, along with many other posts. ''Con Ed is literally rooted in the city streets,'' Mr. McGrath said, ''You couldn't pick up and leave even if you wanted to, and we need to be involved in the community.''

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Unocal's Net Down 11.5%

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 30

 BODY:
The Unocal Corporation said today that its first-quarter earnings fell 11.5 percent, to $77 million, or 33 cents a share, from $87 million, or 37 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago.
Last year's results included a $46 million after-tax gain from a number of natural gas contract settlements. 
Revenues were $2.64 billion, almost identical to $2.63 billion last year.
Unocal said it enjoyed higher worldwide crude oil prices, lower interest rates and improved shale oil operations. But those positive factors were offset by lower chemical earnings.
Earnings from petroleum exploration and production declined 10.3 percent, to $130 million, but last year's period benefited from gas contract settlements.
Crude oil production fell partly because of the temporary suspension of oil production in the Cook Inlet area of Alaska as a result of eruptions from Mount Redoubt.
Unocal's refining, marketing and transportation segment recorded earnings of $11 million, more than double the $5 million reported a year ago. Chemicals operations earned $6 million, down 62.5 percent from $16 million a year ago.
Unocal's stock gained 25 cents today, to $28.25, on the New York stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Official Quits Futures Post

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 30

 BODY:
Robert R. Davis resigned today from his post as a member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to join the New York Mercantile Exchange as a senior vice president for planning and development.
Mr. Davis, who is 41 years old, is a specialist in financial markets and monetary policy. His resignation is effective immediately.
While at the C.F.T.C., Mr. Davis was an advocate of deregulation of the futures industry.
He also defended the C.F.T.C. and the futures industry from criticism in the wake of the October 1987 market crash. Mr. Davis said that there was no evidence that trading of stock index futures, which are traded on the futures markets, caused the decline.
In his resignation letter to President Bush, Mr. Davis said the C.F.T.C. was ''a model of good government that constructively channeled the invisible hand of the market and avoided laying on the dead hand of excessive regulation.''
He worked at the Joint Economic Committee of Congress before being selected by President Reagan to join the C.F.T.C. in the fall of 1984.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Continues Its Decline; Silver Prices Are Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures fell moderately yesterday on the Commodity Exchange in New York, extending a slide spurred by rising interest rates on the Government bonds that compete with stocks, precious metals and other instruments for investors' funds.
On other commodity markets, grains, soybeans, oil futures, livestock and meat futures were mixed. Silver futures were 1.5 cents higher across the board, with May at $4.932 a troy ounce. 
Gold futures settled $2.60 to $2.70 lower, with the contract for delivery in May at $368.40 a troy ounce. Gold prices have fallen about $30 an ounce since mid-March, including a drop of more than $10 in the last week. Interest rates on 30-year United States Treasury bonds climbed to more than 9 percent during the period, their highest levels in nearly a year.
''It seems the market is under pressure from the economics of where to invest money,'' said Scott Hinton, a metals analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
 
Element of Risk
Gold continues to weaken, he said, because it ''is not as attractive a vehicle as risk-free Government securities.'' While Mr. Hinton said gold would likely remain under pressure, Bernard Savaiko, a senior metals analyst with Paine Webber Inc., said he believed the most aggressive selling had already occurred.
Soybean futures retreated on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday amid profit taking after last week's big gains. Wheat futures rose strongly, partly reflecting frost fears in the central plains, while corn futures ended mixed.
Soybean futures had surged more than 30 cents a bushel last week, partly on ideas that last week's hot, dry Midwestern weather might set the tone for the growing season.
Oil futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid skepticism that OPEC could devise a way to curb its production.
Heating oil prices were bid sharply higher in trading tied to the expiration of the May contract, which finished 2.79 cents higher, at 56.53 cents a gallon.
Energy analysts said weakness yesterday in gasoline prices indicated the market was not expecting much from OPEC's emergency meeting scheduled for tomorrow.
Cattle futures settled mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures ended mostly higher, led by the May pork-belly contract, which soared the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound in a rally largely inspired by technical factors.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Finishes Day Mixed In Shortened, Quiet Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed yesterday against primary foreign currencies in thin, abbreviated worldwide trading.
Currency dealers said trading was quiet, with Japanese markets closed for a national holiday. Many European markets will be closed today for May Day, and some dealers took an early, extended break, they said. 
''With all the various holidays this week, there doesn't seem to be any reason to break from the trading ranges,'' said Trevor Woodland, chief corporate trader for Harris Trust and Company in Chicago. ''Everybody is in a bit of a wait-and-see mood.''
Mr. Woodland said the traders were marking time before several critical economic and political events occur later this week.
Today, the Federal Government plans to release figures on construction spending in March. Data on the index of leading economic indicators will be released tomorrow and those on April unemployment on Friday. The traders hope the figures will shed more light on the direction of the economy and interest rates.
Tomorrow, the Treasury also announces its quarterly debt refunding.
In West Germany, officials of the Bundesbank are to meet this week, although the traders said it was unlikely that they would move to raise interest rates in that country. Higher rates tend to support a currency.
In London, the dollar fell to a closing rate of 158.85 Japanese yen, from 159.08 yen on Friday in Tokyo. The dollar stood at 158.90 yen in New York, down from 159.30 yen on Friday.
The dollar was also weaker against the British pound. Sterling sold for $1.6390 in London, up from $1.6360 late on Friday, and for $1.6405 in New York, up from $1.6350.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Friday, included: 1.6795 West German marks, up from 1.6775; 1.4530 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.6330 French francs, up from 5.6290; 1,230.50 Italian lire, up from 1,230.00, and 1.16435 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16375.

Learning To Manage A Race Track

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
''THE racing world will be here this week, and we will be busy taping interviews to be used in class,'' Dr. Robert Lawrence, a professor at the University of Louisville, said the other day. He heads its race track management program. Then, on Saturday he and many students are off to the races - the Kentucky Derby at nearby Churchill Downs.
The Kentucky Legislature has allotted a percentage of betting money for the program, which began in the fall of 1987 in the business school. ''We're getting about $600,000 out of the Kentucky betting dollar yearly, but perhaps it has slipped a little this year.'' he said last week. ''It goes up and down with parimutuel results.'' 
Being a horse lover is not enough to qualify a student for the program, Dr. Lawrence said, explaining that the industry needs better-trained personnel in accounting, financial management, marketing, computer science and public relations.
Dr. Lawrence said the program also conducted ''research and offers service seminars.'' One recent seminar was held to train race track stewards and another was for veterinarians.
The program has produced only four graduates, but about 60 are in the pipeline. Students are required to take two years of humanities and business courses before they can choose the major at the start of their junior year. For the final two years they take courses with titles like ''Introductory Horse Science,'' ''Legal Environment of the Equine Industry,'' ''Race Track Management'' and ''Breeding and Syndication Finance.'' They also do internships. The degree: bachelor of business administration with an equine major.
''I think the race track management field offers a good opportunity for younger people with the right training,'' Dr. Lawrence said, even though he acknowledges that ''racing has been losing out to casino and other types of gambling'' with regard to the share of the gambling dollar.
Dr. Lawrence cited the latest figures, compiled for 1987, that put racing and the non-racing show horse business at ''a very conservative total of $15 billion.''
''Racing will survive despite doom-and-gloom thinking,'' he said. ''It needs creative and forward-looking managers. Our graduates will have an impact.''
Dr. Lawrence plans to add an international equine course in the fall. In August he will attend a gaming and wagering conference in London to discuss the program. ''The British do not have such training,'' he said.
Although Britain and France have long been noted for famous horse races, Dr. Lawrence said the enthusiasm for racing in Australia and New Zealand was even greater. ''Australians bet 10 times as much money on horses as do Americans on a per-capita basis,'' he said.
Dr. Lawrence is searching for a few good professors. ''We have a position open for an economist,'' he said. ''It is hard to find Ph.D.'s with experience in the horse industry.''
Dr. Lawrence is an experienced horseman. At the time the university found him he was a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Maryland. A native of Calgary, Alberta, he graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a geology major and then added an M.B.A. Later, he received a doctorate from Texas A & M. There are many programs for horse enthusiasts, mostly stressing animal science, but the most notable competitor to emphasize management aspects is the University of Arizona, in Tucson.
''Don't call that competition,'' Dr. Lawrence said. ''Call them colleagues.''
Arizona's program is in its 17th year, and Dr. Lawrence does not know why Kentucky, the horse racing and breeding center of the nation, started one so much later.
The Arizona program has graduated more than 160 people, including some middle-aged career changers, said Lonny T. Powell, its coordinator and director. He holds a four-day symposium annually. Last December it was attended by more than 1,000 racing executives, giving students a chance to mingle.
Mr. Powell said starting salaries for his graduates were about $20,000, depending on the region of the country, but went up quite rapidly, with some soon earning $60,000 and more.
Meanwhile, the four graduates of the Louisville program have had plenty of job opportunities. One accepted a post at the Pimlico race track in Baltimore, another took a job with the Golden Gate Fields track in Oakland, Calif., and a third joined an Ohio bloodstock agency. The fourth has not yet decided between two breeding farms.

HEADLINE: Israel Reports an April Influx Of 10,000 Jews From U.S.S.R.

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 1

 BODY:
For the 16th month in a row, the number of Soviet Jews arriving in Israel increased sharply in April and for the first time exceeded 10,000, Israeli immigration officials said today.
The Government said 10,500 Soviet immigrants moved here last month, compared with 7,300 in March and 544 in April 1989.
The 44 percent increase in one month's time came despite continued Arab threats against the immigrants and resultant uncertainty about the continued willingness of third countries to serve as transit points for the emigrating Jews.
This month's figures also continue a trend started late last year that has seen nearly all the departing Soviet Jews choose to move to Israel and not the United States. In April of last year, for instance, when 544 Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel, 4,000 went to the United States. The change came largely because the Israeli mission in Moscow, re-established a few months ago after after a two-decade break in relations, welcomes the potential new citizens and pays their airfare as well as many living expenses on arrival in Israel. 
 
Longer Waits for Visas
To move to the United States, most Soviet Jews must wait months or years for a visa, a delay made longer in the last year when the Bush Administration effectively reduced the number of immigrants from the Soviet Union to be able to increase the number of Vietnamese and Cambodians admitted to this country. In addition, those coming from the Soviet Union get little economic help on departure or after arrival.
The flow of Soviet Jews has continued unabated because of several factors, experts here and in New York and Moscow said. One is the ease with which Soviet Jews can receive permission from the Soviet authorities to depart, with the concern of Soviet Jews that the open door might be suddenly closed. Other factors are the declining Soviet economy and the fear of renewed anti-Semitism, spawned by the increased freedom of speech in the Soviet Union.
In Israel, the ever-larger numbers of immigrants set off another round of recrimination and debate this afternoon as Israeli officials pointed fingers, each blaming the other because the Government still has not completed a single new apartment for the immigrants and has not created more than a handful of new jobs.
This morning, an Absorption Ministry official, Ida Ben-Shitrit, said, ''The data we have show that there is only enough rental housing for the next two or three months,'' if the immigrants continue arriving at the current rate. ''We have a real problem,'' she said. But Uri Gordon, head of immigration and absorption for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, said the state should count on continued increases in arrivals.
 
'Temporary Housing' Plan
''In the coming months, we are expecting close to 20,000 a month,'' he said. Immigration typically increases in the summer, when children get out of school.
Last week Rabbi Yitzhak Peretz, the Absorption Minister, said the Government might have to begin putting up ''temporary housing'' for the new arrivals. Mrs. Ben-Shitrit said the Government was investigating the purchase of several thousand prefabricated, temporary wooden structures to hold the new immigrants until permanent housing is built.
The Ministry of Housing, she said, has just begun to build 6,000 new apartments for immigrants. If they are completed on time, ''they will be finished in March of 1991,'' she said. ''But more than 100,000 are coming this year,'' she continued. ''So we are making emergency plans.''
Housing is just one of the immediate problems. At the weekly Cabinet meeting today, Labor Minister Roni Milo said that ''unless thousands of jobs are found, the state faces a tragedy that could endanger the future of immigration.''
 
Skilled Immigrants, Few Jobs
Most new immigrants from the Soviet Union are highly educated professionals. An average of 200 Soviet doctors arrive here each month, Rabbi Peretz said this evening.
Immigration aside, Israel's unemployment rate is about 9.5 percent.
For more than a year now, Israeli leaders from every party and all political outlooks have been warning that the immigrants are coming and that Israel should get ready.
In his annual state of the nation address on Sunday, President Chaim Herzog expressed the exasperation many of his compatriots also feel at the Government's failure to heed even its own warnings.
 
Dispute in Christian Quarter
''We are discovering shortcomings in our own ranks - unnecessary difficulties, defects, neglect,'' he said. ''Inevitably one wonders how we were not prepared for the massive wave of immigration we all knew to be imminent.''
But while a record number of immigrants was arriving last month and plans were being made to put up prefabricated, temporary homes, the Housing Ministry was secretly channeling $1.8 million through a Panamanian front company so 150 Jewish settlers could take up residence in the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, setting off an international storm of protest.
''This is stupid in this situation,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''We need every spare pound for the newcomers to Israel.''
Absorption Ministry figures show that the Government spends about $3,666 during each new immigrant's first year of residence here.
 
Agency's Appeal for More Money
On Sunday the Absorption Ministry said it had run out of money and appealed to the Government for more. When the Government budget was written last fall, money was included for only 40,000 immigrants. More than 32,000 newcomers from all sources have already arrived.
The flow of Soviet refugees to Israel slowed slightly in late March, when the Hungarian airline Malev temporarily halted charter flights to Israel after threats from Arab terrorists against airlines ferrying Soviet Jews to Israel. Malev is now again bringing significant numbers of Jews through Hungary, and the Israeli airline, El Al, has almost daily charter flights from Budapest. An agreement in principle on direct flights from the Soviet Union to Israel has never been put into effect.
In April, the Government reported today, a total of 11,475 immigrants arrived from all sources, meaning that 975 came from countries other than the Soviet Union.
Most of the other immigrants came from Argentina and other Latin American countries, though a few were from Ethiopia, which recently reopened diplomatic relations with Israel, and a tiny number were from Iran.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE SEEKS A 'NEW LEADERSHIP' AT SAVINGS AGENCY

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The outspoken head of the Federal savings and loan bailout came under White House pressure today, with the President's chief spokesman saying that ''we are interested in getting new leadership'' in the rescue effort.
The pressure on L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, comes as the cost of the bailout to the American taxpayer is growing, and the public appears to be more aware of the magnitude of the rescue. The agency is gearing up to spend almost $1 billion a day over the next two months to cover losses on the scores of insolvent savings and loan associations it is trying to sell.
For months, senior Administration officials have said privately that their battles with Mr. Seidman and his practice of publicly speaking out when he disagrees with the Adminstration have soured the relationship.
 
Preference for Own Team
They also point to a policy President Bush instituted at the start of his Administration to replace Reagan appointees with his own people. 
Mr. Bush, who is prevented by law from dismissing Mr. Seidman, is also said to want to exert more control over the day-to-day management of the rescue, which Mr. Seidman, a fiercely independent regulator, has prevented.
The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater said at a news briefing today that at a meeting two weeks ago in the Oval Office, Mr. Seidman had not been asked to leave. But Mr. Fitzwater, in his comments,, implied that the White House would not resist if Mr. Seidman decided to go.
 
An 'Aggressive Program'
''Bill has indicated publicly that he would not like to serve out his entire term, which expires in 1991,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''And we are interested in getting new leadership there that will carry out an aggressive program when the time comes.''
The meeting with the President was first disclosed today in The Washington Post.
Many members of Congress and some banking experts said the pressure on Mr. Seidman, who is chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as well as the bailout agency, could not come at a worse time.
After months of a sluggish start-up process, the Resolution Trust Corporation, which manages the day-to-day affairs of the bailout, is poised to spend $57 billion by the end of June to either liquidate or induce investors to take over 141 insolvent savings institutions. Eventually, it is expected to seize as many as 800 institutions, at a 30-year cost to the taxpayer and to the industry of between $300 billion and $500 billion.
This spring's initiative is the most ambitious since the rescue bill was passed last summer and one that would serve as a clear signal that the bailout was working. Banking experts and members of Congress said the pressure on Mr. Seidman now placed the plan under a cloud.
 
'Don't Need This Backbiting'
''This is a time when we all need to be pulling together as never before, and we don't need this backbiting,'' said William M. Isaac, a former chairman of the F.D.I.C. and now head of the Secura Group, a financial consulting firm. ''I see no reason to be trying to get him to leave. I would be trying to keep him in the Government, not run him out.''
But industry lobbyists and Administration officials also noted that the not so subtle pressure on Mr. Seidman was the product of months of tensions between him and the Bush Administration, dating back to when Mr. Bush first came into office.
Lawmakers and industry experts have said that both Mr. Seidman's independent style and the new regulatory structure set up under the bailThe chairman of the F.D.I.C. is also designated to oversee the management of the bailout - taking control of insolvent savings institutions, separating the good from the bad assets, selling the good assets and deposits to banks and other investors, and, eventually, selling billions of dollars in unwanted real estate assets.
 
Oversight Board Set Up
But the law also set up a Resolution Trust oversight board, headed by the Treasury Secretary, and in the bailout process the board sets broad policies and oversees management steps taken by the F.D.I.C., which until last year had been entirely independent. Now, insofar as its bailout role goes, it is answerable to the Treasury and by extension to the White House.
Attempts by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Deputy Secretary John Robson to take more control rankled Mr. Seidman, and the two sides clashed repeatedly during the first months of the process.
Difficulties with the Treasury also led to the resignation in February of the oversight board's first president, Daniel P. Kearney. Since Mr. Kearney left, the working relationship betweeen the Treasury and Mr. Seidman has improved, both sides say. But both acknowledge that a lack of trust remains.
 
Possible Successors
While Administration officials say they have not decided who would succeed Mr. Seidman, William Taylor, the acting chief executive of the Resolution Trust Corporation's oversight board and head of bank regulation at the Federal Reserve Board, is the leading candidate, some officials say.
Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency and a member of both the F.D.I.C. and Resolution Trust boards, is also said to be a contender.
The White House cannot require Mr. Seidman to resign. Under the bailout law signed by the President last August, the President cannot remove the F.D.I.C. chairman, who is designated as an independent regulator.
And Mr. Seidman is not new to the political struggles of Washington. An accountant and lawyer by training, he was, as President Ford's chief economic policy adviser, considered one of the few power brokers in the Ford White House.
He then went on to be vice chairman of the Phelps Dodge Corporation, a mining company, and dean of the University of Arizona Business School. He was brought back to Washington by the Reagan Administration in October 1985.
The Treasury is not opposing Mr. Seidman's plan to dispose of the 141 institutions, even though it requires enormous sums of money and even though, at least for now, the budget deficit will increase by $57 billion.
But there are moves in Congress to dampen the budgetary effect of the bailout spending. A resolution introduced in the Senate would exempt a large amount of the financing Resolution Trust needs to close sick institutions from deficit calculations, in a process referred to as putting an expenditure off-budget.
 
Outrage in Congress
The reaction on Capitol Hill to the move to force out Mr. Seidman, especially among Democrats, was outrage. ''The Administration will be foolish to let the services of Bill Seidman slip away just because his straight talk ruffles some political feathers,'' said Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee. ''Seidman has great credibility with members of Congress and the American public. The Administration will be in dire need of all the credibility it can muster in coming months as the costs mount for taxpayers.''
A letter signed by 23 members of the House Banking Committee was sent to President Bush, warning him against trying to oust Mr. Seidman.
Mr. Seidman, when reached by telephone, said, ''I am not talking about my private conversations with the President.''
It is still uncertain whether Mr. Seidman will depart soon. Those who have worked closely with him said he had demonstrated such independence that he was not likely to leave before he felt he had the Resolution Trust Corporation up and running. That could be as early as this summer, but if his plan to dispose of the 141 institutions before July becomes a bureaucratic impossibility, he could well stay until later in the year.
 
One of Two Processes
The plan calls for one of two processes. Mr. Seidman has said the agency plans to liquidate at least 50 of the savings and loan associations. In that case, the agency would simply pay off depositors, take all the assets and warehouse them until it found buyers for them, which could take a number of years. Liquidation is often the most costly procedure.
A second option is called a ''clean-bank'' transaction, in which the Government takes a savings institution, removes the troubled assets, like loans in default, repossessed assets and dormant building projects, and sells both the deposits and good assets to a buyer.
In such transactions, the Government usually has to inject large amounts of cash - but not as much as in a liquidation - to cover the losses of depositors' money. For the right to take over these cleaned-up institutions, banks will pay a premium equal to between 1 and 2 percent more than the value of the deposits. For the bank buying a cleaned-up institution, the purchase can be a quick way to broaden its deposit base.
 
Goal Viewed as Difficult
Some banking experts warned that it would be almost impossible for Mr. Seidman to reach his goal. ''My own view is that selling off that many institutions under the present circumstances is impossible unless you are prepared to do an absolute fire sale,'' said Rodgin Cohen, a banking attorney for the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell.
Mr. Cohen added that there was very little capacity in the banking industry to buy. ''There couldn't be a worse time to bring all these institutions to the market,'' he said.

HEADLINE: House Backs $24 Billion in Cuts From Bush's Plans for Pentagon

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
The House today narrowly approved the Democratic majority's $1.2 trillion budget for 1991, calling for $24 billion less for the military than President Bush proposed and $5.6 billion more for domestic programs.
The budget, approved on a 218-to-208 vote with no Republican support, is essentially a political blueprint that sets out Democratic priorities for where money should be spent in the 1991 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1. Even Democrats acknowledged that it was an early step in a process that would probably end in negotiations between Congress and the White House later this year. The Senate's budget proposal is deadlocked in a committee.
House Republican leaders had intended to offer the President's budget as an alternative but decided against it late Monday, partly to avoid an embarrassing defeat by the Democrats. And they conceded that the military spending levels at first sought by Mr. Bush had now been all but repudiated by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 
 
'Would Have Been Ludicrous'
''It would have been ludicrous given what Dick Cheney said last week to have brought that budget to the floor,'' said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip. He was referring to a Pentagon review of aircraft programs in which Mr. Cheney recommended substantial cuts in production of the Stealth bomber and delays in making fighter and attack planes.
As the House was voting, Mr. Cheney announced the extension of a freeze on military construction and said he had ordered a review of 207 construction projects for possible cancellation. ''The extent to which we can go forward on those projects is directly related to what kind of funding levels we're going to get out of Congress,'' Mr. Cheney said.
 
Home Ports Under Review
Leaving little doubt about the message he intended to convey to lawmakers whose states and districts benefit from the projects, Mr. Cheney said that if the military budget cuts being contemplated on Capitol Hill were adopted ''then there is no question that a large number of those projects on this list, plus additional ones, will have to be canceled.''
Among the projects being reviewed are four of six locations planned as home ports for major Navy ships when they are not on active duty: Ingleside Tex.; Mobile, Ala.; Pascagoula, Miss.; and Staten Island.
Before adopting the Democratic budget, the House rejected, 334 to 90, an alternative proposed by the Congressional Black Caucus that would have made even sharper cuts in military spending and redirected the savings to domestic programs, including education, job training, social services, housing and nutrition. The plan also called for tax increases aimed at the wealthiest Americans.
''In the real world, people want peace; they want nuclear disarmament,'' said Representative Ronald V. Dellums, a California Democrat who is a member of the House Armed Services Committee. He argued for the elimination of major strategic weapons systems, saying, ''If everybody says we're never going to use them, it's crazy; it sets logic on its head.''
Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democratic who also serves on the Armed Services Committee, said it was wrong to spend billions of dollars on a program like the Stealth bomber and only a fraction of that on trying to control drug abuse. ''Substance abuse is much more important than building this plane that we don't know what we'll do with,'' she said.
 
Senate Is Struggling
With the House vote, the budget process remains in limbo until the Senate completes its own version of the fiscal blueprint.
The Senate Budget Committee has been struggling for weeks to come up with a measure it can bring to the Senate floor, but the lawmakers are stalled on issues like taxes and how much to cut military spending. There is no sign that agreement is near.
The Administration and House Republicans are hoping that the Senate deadlock will finally force the Democratic leaders there to agree that it is time for Congress and the White House to begin budget negotiations. The White House is eager for such negotiations, but Democrats are divided on whether to start the talks now or wait until later in the year.
The House plan calls for military budget authority of $283 billion, $24 billion less than Mr. Bush proposed. Budget authority is the amount of spending the Defense Department can commit for programs that may continue a number of years, like the purchase of an aircraft carrier. Limiting the figure would compel future military cuts.
The House plan calls for spending $224.3 billion on dozens of domestic programs like education, agriculture, grants to scientists and protecting abused children. That is $5.6 billion more than the White House proposed.
 
'Repudiation' of Bush Plan
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington joined a chorus of Democrats hoping to take advantage of the Republican decision to keep Mr. Bush's budget from a vote. ''This is, in effect, a quiet, if secret, repudiation of the President's proposals,'' he told reporters. ''A total abandonment.''
Representative Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee, acknowledged that some Republicans were unhappy with Mr. Bush's proposals for cuts in Medicare, agriculture and retirement benefits for Federal workers, but he said Republicans had a larger point to make in not offering the plan.
''The blunt fact is that both the Democratic budget and the President's budget are hopelessly obsolete,'' he said, adding that Republicans want to avoid ''debating history'' and to hasten serious negotiations between the White House and Congress. Mr. Frenzel said officials at the Office of Management and Budget now believe the Federal deficit will be some $20 billion higher than projected in either budget because assumptions the Administration made about the interest rates have proven overly optimistic.
''What we are trying to tell the Democrats is that we are needlessly beating our gums,'' he said. ''This debate is irrelevant, ineffective and unecessary.''
 
Totals Are Nearly Identical
Both the budget approved today and Mr. Bush's plan included virtually identical figures for total spending: $1.23 trillion, with revenues of $1.17 trillion and a deficit of about $63 billion.
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law requires that the deficit be held to $64 billion in the 1991 fiscal year and imposes automatic cuts in domestic and military programs if Congress does not agree to its own spending cuts or revenue increases to achieve that level.
But House Democrats rearranged the spending priorities within the overall budget, directing more money to domestic programs like housing and education and allowing room within the recommended foreign aid budget to provide $700 million to the new democracies in Eastern Europe, about twice the level suggested by the President.
The specifics of spending decisions will be made later this year by the Congressional committees that have jurisdiction over particular programs.
The budget measure that eventually emerges from Congress does not require the approval of President Bush, but the tax or spending bills that Congress passes to put the blueprint into effect do need the President's signature.
Although Mr. Bush has repeatedly said he opposes new taxes, his budget called for $13.9 billion in new revenue, including a variety of fees and an increase in the tax on airline tickets. The House adopted the same figure for new revenue, leaving it to the Ways and Means Committee to determine which taxes or fees would have to be raised.
 
Revenue Increases
As did the Administration, the House Democrats assumed that about $36 billion in spending cuts and revenue increases would be needed to meet the $64 billion deficit goal. But if new, more pessimistic economic forecasts by the Administration prove correct, Congress may have to find an additional $20 billion to keep the deficit at the prescribed level.
Mr. Frenzel said that prospect made immediate negotiations with the White House all the more crucial to avoid huge automatic spending cuts later in the year. ''If we don't,'' he said, ''a $56 billion train wreck lies ahead of us.''
Mr. Foley gave no indication of how quickly House Democrats might be willing to engage in such talks, noting that today's action was only the beginning of the process of agreeing to a budget. ''I think eventually there will be discussions with the Administration,'' he said, carefully avoiding the word negotiation.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Baker Is Off to Europe, Ready to Sell Soviets on United Germany in NATO

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d leaves for Europe on Wednesday for the first six-nation talks about the future of a united Germany, carrying a briefcase full of ideas that he hopes will help the Soviets accept what the United States sees as inevitable: a unified Germany in NATO.
The ''two plus four'' negotiations, which were agreed upon last February at an East-West conference in Ottawa, call for West and East Germany to sit down with the four World War II Allies - the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and France - to resolve all of the external security issues raised by German reunification, and to dissolve the four powers' legal rights and responsibilities in Berlin and Germany as a whole.
Whatever the formal agenda, Administration officials and analysts predict the talks will quickly come down to the Soviets asking the Germans what economic and security incentives they will grant Moscow in return for the Soviets' expeditiously withdrawing their 380,000 troops from East Germany, allowing a united Germany to become a member of NATO and terminating their legal rights in Berlin along with the other Allies. 
 
Package of Initiatives
It is not that the Kremlin is expected to try to prevent German unification, say officials. It is far too late for that. But the Soviets can drag their feet -with bluff, bluster, blandishments and by endless haggling over the arcane legal issues involved in Berlin - until they are satisfied that arrangements for a united Germany will be militarily and politically acceptable.
The question for the West, said an Administration official, ''is how we make it digestible for the Soviets so they will accept this inevitable outcome sooner rather than later.''
Administration officials say they have in mind a package of initiatives that would not only make the establishment of a united Germany in NATO something palatable for the Soviets, but also acceptable to the other Europeans, many of whom are also nervous about German unification.
 
Informal Discussions
Most of the initiatives the Administration has in mind will be discussed only informally in the two-plus-four talks, which begin Saturday, and then parceled out to the relevant negotiating forums, where they will actually be addressed. The package includes these ideas:
* The Western Allies will suggest to the Soviets that if they are concerned about the size of the West German army, now 500,000 men, then Moscow and Bonn should work out a troop reduction arrangment as part of the ongoing Vienna talks limiting conventional forces in Europe. The Soviets will also be invited to station a limited number of troops in East Germany for a fixed transition period, as will the Allies in Berlin.
* The united Germany is expected to reaffirm West Germany's promise never to obtain nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, and formally confirm the Oder-Neisse line as its eastern border with Poland.
* In order to make a united Germany in NATO a less-threatening, more politically acceptable entity to the Soviets, negotiations are expected to begin soon that would result in the elimination of all, or most, United States-controlled, short-range nuclear missiles, and perhaps artillery shells, in Germany in exchange for the removal of the Soviet's short-range missiles and nuclear artillery from Europe. That would leave NATO with only air-delivered nuclear bombs in Germany.
* West Germany is expected to reassure the Soviets that all of the contracts that they have with East German industries will be assumed by a united Germany, and, say German officials, Bonn will strongly hint to Moscow that if it plays along on two-plus-four, generous economic aid will follow suit. The West Germans are also expected to offer to help subsidize the cost - as the East German Government used to do - of maintaining Soviet troops in East German territory for the transitional period.
* The 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe will be given a new, expanded and formalized role for conflict resolution and intra-European dialogue for its member states, say Administration officials, so that after a united Germany joins NATO - and the Warsaw Pact inevitably fades away - the Soviets, Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, Romanians and Bulgarians won't feel left out in the cold.
 
'In the Same Club'
''With C.S.C.E. everyone can feel that they are in the same club,'' said a senior Administration official. ''It won't really provide military or economic security, but psychological security, a place where everyone can feel at home talking about any European issues they want.''
This could prove to be the most difficult part of the package to sell, both to the Allies and the Soviets. The French would prefer to see the American-dominated NATO downgraded and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe given a more formal security role that might eventually make it more of an alternative to NATO than a complement.
The same goes for the Soviets, who will find it hard to accept the notion of NATO emerging as the sole, dominating security structure in Europe. This could create the politically dangerous impression back in Moscow that while Stalin won World War II, Mikhail S. Gorbachev lost the peace.
There is a word that American officials say they have been hearing constantly of late from the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze: 'Synchronization.''
''What we think he means is that until they have a sense that all of their concerns and interests have been addressed - from the conventional forces negotiations to German unification - they will behave as though none of them have been addressed,'' a senior Administration official said. ''I think the Soviets are just now waking up to the monumental consequences of everything that has happened in Europe in the last year and this has introduced a kind of tentative and confused quality to their decision making.''

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Lithuanian Leader, on 'Private' Visit, to Meet Bush

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
President Bush will meet with the Lithuanian Prime Minister on Thursday, the White House announced today. It will be the first time that an American President has met with a leader of the Baltic republic since it was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940.
By the Administration's account, the meeting with Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene will also be the first direct contact between Mr. Bush and any Lithuanian official since Lithuania declared independence from Moscow on March 11.
The White House, aware of the diplomatic conundrum posed by the meeting, went out of its way today to portray Mrs. Prunskiene's visit to Washington and the White House talks as a private affair that did not signal a change in United States policy on Lithuania. 
 
Bush Decision Criticized
The announcement of the planned meeting came as Congress sharpened its criticism of Mr. Bush's decision last week not to retaliate for the Kremlin's economic sanctions against Lithuania.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d became embroiled in a testy exchange with several prominent Senators during a committee hearing, and the full Senate voted 73 to 24 for a nonbinding resolution urging Mr. Bush not to submit legislation to increase trade with the Soviet Union unless Moscow lifts its trade sanctions and begins negotiating with the republic's elected leaders.
Trying to walk a thin line between refusal to recognize the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union and support for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Bush Administration has not recognized the leadership of Lithuania as the government of an independent nation.
 
Letter Goes Unanswered
The White House has avoided direct contacts with Lithuanian officials during the crisis; Mr. Bush has not even responded to a letter from President Vytautas Landsbergis.
Mrs. Prunskiene has been quoted in news reports from Vilnius as saying that she was initially denied permission to visit Washington before the summit meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, scheduled for May 30 to June 3.
But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today that Mrs. Prunskiene was never denied a visa and sought to portray Mr. Bush's decision to meet her in the White House as a routine matter without any greater policy implications.
Mr. Fitzwater said: ''The President feels that it's important to get an authoritative readout and description of events in Lithuania, hear first hand from her what is occuring there. And so she is in this country, and he thinks it's an important opportunity to hear her views.''
 
Reaction in Lithuania
The Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman for the legislature in Vilnius as saying that the meeting was a positive sign. After Mr. Bush declined to retaliate against Moscow for cutting off shipments of oil and natural gas to Lithuania, President Landsbergis charged that Mr. Bush had sold out Lithuania in a manner reminiscent of the appeasement of Hitler.
''At least this shows Bush has not taken his comments too personally,'' the spokesman, Edward Tuskenis, was quoted as saying.
Even with Mr. Fitzwater's careful formulation, the meeting posed some subtle diplomatic problems, since the point was to avoid any suggestion that the meeting was a tacit recognition of an independent Lithuania.
Mr. Fitzwater was asked, for example, if Mr. Bush was meeting with Mrs. Prunskiene as a private citizen, or as the Prime Minister of Lithuania.
 
'A Private Visit'
''He is meeting with her as an acknowledged and freely elected representative of the Lithuanian people,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''She is here on a private visit, as we've said.''
Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Bush ''is not meeting with her as Prime Minister of an independent Lithuania. Just so there is no confusion.''
But what, Mr. Fitzwater was asked, will Mr. Bush call Mrs. Prunskiene? ''Prime Minister, I suppose,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.
Asked how that fit in with the Administration's position on Lithuania's independence, he said the ''title she carries is Prime Minister.''
''We'll be glad to call her that title,'' he said. ''We do not recognize Lithuania, and there's nothing changed about that.''
 
Message to the Kremlin
During a Senate hearing today, Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, told Mr. Baker that Mr. Bush's decision not to retaliate for the Kremlin's economic sanctions sent this message to the republic's leaders: ''Oh gosh, yeah, we want you free and we want to help, but you know, we're not going to do anything to upset Mr. Gorbachev.''
Mr. Baker listened with evident irritation and replied, ''I think that the President, frankly, Senator DeConcini, is in a better position to judge what might or might not be effective for the long run.''
The Senator said, ''I realize you guys are the masters here, and I'm just a little munchkin working around here, trying to express a view.'' But, he added, ''it seems to me that we're talking and that's all we're doing.''
Mr. Baker said, ''We have a lot of interests at stake here that are very important interests to the United States of America. One of these interests is to see the Soviets destroy 40,000 tanks as a part of a conventional forces agreement, and we want to lock that agreement in.''
''Another is to see them destroy 50 percent of their heavy strategic missiles which are targeted on United States cities. We want to see that agreement locked in. We want to see a continued approach by the Soviet Union that will permit us to hopefully bring freedom and democracy to other areas of the world.''
Mr. Baker said the Administration had to ''balance'' those concerns with pressure to push Mr. Gorbachev to allow Lithuania to secede. ''This is the way we see it for the time being,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Rich and Poor Lands Agree On Path to Economic Growth

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 1

 BODY:
Rich and poor countries reached agreement today on a declaration setting out new priorities for speeding up economic growth in the developing world in the 1990's after a difficult debate that ran longer than expected.
The declaration, unanimously adopted by a special session of the United Nations General Assembly, reflects the growing consensus on economic matters in the world since the majority of Eastern European countries abandoned Communism as an economic doctrine and recognized the importance of free markets and private initiative.
The declaration has no binding force on the nations that accepted it. But like all such United Nations agreements, it serves to record the shifting international consensus on what steps are needed to improve the third world's economic prospects after its generally disappointing preformance in the 1980's, when many poor countries grew poorer still. 
It emphasizes the importance of third world countries adopting sound domestic policies that reduce inflation, promote investment and make their economies more competitive. But it also acknowledges that democracy and the protection of human rights have a role in fostering the third world's economic growth.
 
Providing New Markets
In addition, the declaration recognizes that the political changes under way in Eastern Europe will help the developing world by providing it with new markets and sources of technology rather than absorbing Western assistance which it might otherwise have received. And it sees the safeguarding of the environment as a vital part of the development process.
Finally, it commits north and south to make a success of a series of international conferences dealing with specific international economic problems.
Those include the Paris meeting on the problems of the least developed nations in September, the Unicef world summit meeting on children's problems, also scheduled for September, the Uruguay Round of trade freeing negotiations and the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which will try to draft a new treaty combating climate change.
''Ideological conflict is yielding to a global approach to the real problems that beset the world,'' Boliva's representative, Hugo Navajas-Mogro, told the closing session on behalf of the Group of 77, as the third world calls itself at the United Nations.
 
The Need for New Policies
Speaking for the Bush Administration, Edward Marks, senior United States adviser to the special session, noted a ''fundamental rethinking'' of approaches to development and said, ''We are seeing a true convergence of views around the need for sound macroeconomic policies, enhanced competition and greater flexibility, creativity, innovation and openness.''
The consensus outcome came about only after delegates missed their original deadline of last Saturday for an agreement and carried on negotiations until late Monday night.
But the final consensus, diplomats say, also represents a personal triumph for the United States representative at the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering, who opposed a skeptical United States Treasury, which originally wanted the United States to boycott the meeting.
Mr. Pickering said at a news conference before the meeting that the United States was taking part only with ''a lot of skepticism and a lot of reluctance'' in Washington because in the past such discussions often degenerated into quarrels between the industrial north and the developing south.
Nevertheless, despite the general climate of compromise, sharp conflicts of interest arose between north and south, particularly over debt and access to Western technology. And for the first time in any United Nations document approved by consensus, today's declaration raises the possibility of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund's granting relief to third-world debtors, something those institutions have refused to do in the past.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves $720 Million in Aid for Panama and Nicaragua

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
In a spur to the Bush Administration's Latin America policy, the Senate today approved giving $720 million in economic aid to Panama and Nicaragua after an impasse of several days over an assortment of unrelated amendments.
The assistance, which was approved by voice vote, was included in a $3.4 billion spending bill, mostly for domestic programs. The measure will now go to conference, where senators will work out a final bill with the House of Representatives, which had already passed a $2.4 billion version of the bill.
The action on Nicaragua and Panama came hours after the Administration signaled that it may become more restrictive in allocating aid to a third fragile Latin American democracy, El Salvador. 
Secretary of States James A. Baker 3d said at a Senate hearing and in meetings with lawmakers that the Administration may link future aid to that country's progress toward peace and human rights, and specifically in bringing to justice the killers of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter. Eight members of the Salvadoran armed forces, including a colonel, have been arrested in the case, but no further judicial action has been taken.
 
'A Turning Point'
''This case has got to become a turning point in the history of El Salvador,'' Mr. Baker told the foreign aid subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. ''I think it's fair to say that the sentiment being what it is, our assistance is going to be affected by the way this case is handled.''
Mr. Baker spoke a day after a task force of House Democrats issued a report saying the Salvadoran investigation had been at a standstill since January. Mr. Baker praised the work of the 19-member Democratic task force, saying it had raised substantial questions about the investigation and had conducted itself in a balanced and professional manner.
The path for Senate passage of the spending bill was cleared Monday night, after the Senate voted to allow the District of Columbia to use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women. Republicans had opposed that provision, but relented after Democrats agreed to another provision in the measure that would allow courts in the capital to impose the death penalty for drug-related murders.
President Bush has threatened to veto the bill if, in its final form, it contains the provision for the funds for abortion. Before the vote today, the President complained that Congress was moving too slowly in approving the aid to Panama and Nicaragua, and accused lawmakers of delaying passage by including their pet projects in the measure.
 
Endara at Press Club
But in a speech at the National Press Club, President Guillermo Endara of Panama did not echo the criticism. ''This is the price we pay for democracy,'' he said of the delays.
Despite the delays, the Bush Administration got most of what it wanted in the aid bill. Mr. Bush had requested $800 million for Panama and Nicaragua. Although there were efforts to greatly slash the funding, both the Senate and House versions provide for $720 million.
Panama will get $420 million, some of which will go to repair damage caused by the American sanctions against that country and the invasion by American troops last December that resulted in the ouster of the Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Mr. Endara, who was installed as President by the Americans, said Panama will not seek more aid next year because the country will use some of the money to pay off overdue loans to international banks. That, he said, would make Panama eligible for new development loans.
Most of the $300 million for Nicaragua will be for development projects and agricultural supplies. Money will also go for repatriation of the contra rebels and emergency employment programs.
The Senate, in the last day of consideration, passed several amendments to the bill, including more funds for an educational program for gifted students and for the United National Environment Program. Other unrelated provisions had already been attached to the bill, like more money for fighting forest fires and for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The package also authorized $400 million in loan guarantees for Israel to build housing for new emigres from the Soviet Union. In a 73 to 24 vote, the Senate also approved a nonbinding provision urging Mr. Bush not to send to Congress a trade agreement with the Soviet Union until Moscow rescinds sanctions against Lithuania.

SAN SALVADOR, May 1 (Reuters) - Reacting to the possibility of deep cuts in United States military aid, the Salvadoran Government said today that its much-criticized inquiry into the murder of six priests could lead to a trial within 90 days.
The Salvadoran armed forces said cutting military aid would strengthen the hand of leftist rebels in the country's 10-year-long civil war, which has cost tens of thousands of lives.
''It hurts us that a cut in aid is being considered,'' said Maj. Mauricio Chaves Caceres, head of the armed forces press office.
Total American aid to El Salvador has been running at more than $1 million a day for the last decade. Military aid has totaled almost $900 million in that period, according to American Embassy figures.

Finding the Right Dog For a Left-Leaning City

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif., April 26

 BODY:
In many cities, what comes to mind when people think of a police dog is the kind of animal that becomes the canine equivalent of the business end of a .357 magnum when it bares its teeth.
But this is Berkeley, a city that prides itself on its exquisite sense of doing the right thing on every question, from plastic foam food containers to peace trips to Nicaragua. So when faced with hiring its first police dog in decades to help combat a growing problem with crack, the city did what comes naturally here: it insisted on a politically correct pooch.
Translated more broadly, that means a dog that will not conjure up memories of the snarling beasts used to attack civil rights or antiwar demonstrators in the 1960's and 70's. While many cities with neighborhoods that are being torn apart by crack might welcome a lean, mean drug-fighting machine, the last thing Berkeley wants is a German shepherd with an attitude. 
After a talent search that lasted for months, the Berkeley Police Department has obtained Pepper, a 19-month-old Labrador that can sniff out stashes of crack even when drug dealers hide them outdoors under debris. And Pepper may be the prototype for the 1990's - a kinder, gentler police dog.
Gary A. Farwell, the executive assistant to Mayor Loni Hancock, said: ''This is not an aggressive dog. He does not instill fear by his presence alone.''
Over the years, this city has had an attitude about both the police and drug use that could be described as complex at best. In the late 1960's, it was as common to hear antiwar demonstrators refer to the guardians of public order as ''blue meanies'' as it was to see some police officers slapping their nightsticks against their open hands while begging their superiors to let them bust a few demonstrators' heads.
At the same time, marijuana gained widespread use, touted as a ''natural'' drug. In 1979 voters passed an ordinance that directed the police not to enforce laws against the personal use of marijuana and instructed the city to lobby for legalizing the drug.
Today, with crack destroying the city's poorer neighborhoods, many people here demanded stepped-up police activity, including drug-sniffing dogs, and are circulating petitions to place a measure on the November ballot that would repeal the 1979 law.
''That law is completely out of step with the times,'' said James W. Smith, a postal worker who heads the 300-member Berkeley Black Property Owners Association. ''It's like telling kids this is the one drug you can say yes to.''
The group argued for a well-trained police dog by holding a meeting at which a German shepherd demonstrated its drug-sniffing capabilities.
''The idea of a politically correct police dog is nonsense,'' Mr. Smith said, citing the ''heroic role'' played by German shepherds in looking for people trapped under rubble after the earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay Area last October.
Once the city agreed to enlist a police dog, finding the right dog proved to be a challenging task. At first, the City Council specified a small breed, suggesting that perhaps the perfect beagle could be found.
There was a flurry of optimism late last year when Stride, an English cocker spaniel, trotted in from Berkeley's political antithesis to the south, Orange County, and instantly won everyone's heart. Alas, the canine crime-stopper was judged to be too emotionally attached to its owner.
A few months ago half a dozen dogs judged sufficiently mellow for the job were identified, and Pepper was selected by Charles E. Blake, general manager of Witmer-Tyson Imports Inc. of Menlo Park, which specializes in training dogs for law-enforcement agencies.
''He's a very nice dog from a personality standpoint,'' Mr. Blake said. ''One of their big concerns was that they did not want a fire-breathing beast that would be used for crowd control.''
But for some here, no police dog can pass muster. Maudelle Shirek, a member of the City Council since 1984 and a resident of Berkeley since 1943, helped lead the fight against German shepherds.
''I'm against any kind of dog,'' she said. ''People become confused and frustrated, so that's what they resort to. The drug problem is not a police issue. It's a social, economic and moral issue.''

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Two Unlikely Voices That Find Harmony On the Military Budget

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
It took Sam Nunn three months of research to pronounce the Bush Administration's 1991 military budget irrelevant. His series of carefully timed speeches on the Senate floor was front-page news.
It took Representative Les Aspin 24 hours to make virtually the same observation the day after the Pentagon announced the budget plans in January. His off-the-cuff remarks, delivered during a news conference on military-base closings, went largely unremarked upon.
The contrast speaks volumes about the two Democrats who as heads of the Armed Services Committees of Congress are as central to the debate about the United States role in the post-cold war world as their onetime colleague on Capital Hill, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. 
To the degree that ''new thinking'' on the nation's military programs emerges from Capitol Hill, it will almost certainly come from either Mr. Aspin or Mr. Nunn, partly because they are the members of Congress who think hardest about such issues and partly because their positions mean their thoughts and words will be heeded at the Pentagon, at the White House and in the press.
Sam Nunn is a small-town Georgia lawyer. Les Aspin is a Wisconsin economist with Ivy League credentials. For all their surface differences, they enter the military budget deliberations with a number of broad areas of agreement. (One of them is that they have both had their fill of odd-couple comparisons. ''You're going to say I'm owlish and he's effusive,'' grumped Mr. Nunn.) Different Routes Traveled Mr. Nunn is not just another go-along-get-along holder of a safe seat, Mr. Aspin is not merely a darling of the Northern liberal clique. And each has traveled a route that took him beyond the limitations of his political roots and his natural inclinations.
''We have very different backgrounds and a very different consultation process, but we often come out the same way,'' Mr. Aspin said. ''If you ask what's different between me and Sam Nunn, I tend to be more of a Congressional activist; my reaction is to do something, write it into a bill. Sam's reaction is to make a phone call or write a letter.''
Mr. Nunn's roots are the South -the tradition of patriotic responsibility and respect for authority, especially for the uniformed military. The ''Georgia heritage,'' as he calls it, virtually ordained his career path. He came to the Senate in 1972. His great-uncle, Carl Vinson, who ran the House Armed Services Committee, had left. But the Southern warlord tradition and influence - and the desire to perpetuate regional influence in Congress - was embodied in Senator John Stennis of Mississippi. Mr. Nunn was positioned for his chairmanship.
''I found out then, even though some people view manpower as boring, that this is the heart and soul of the military,'' Mr. Nunn said of his work as Mr. Stennis's cadet on the Senate armed services panel. ''I spent hundreds of hours in the manpower subcommittee; many times I was the only one there. But I learned an awful lot about personnel and people, promotion systems, numbers and generals and admirals - why that's such an emotional subject.''
Mr. Aspin's roots are a more complicated mixture of Midwestern populism and the Eastern establishment. His delight in challenging authority and his ready resort to a press release reflect his work as an intern and a campaign aide to William Proxmire, a Wisconsin Democrat who was a master at both while a Senator. But Mr. Aspin, who ran for Congress as an anti-Vietnam War Democrat, also had a stint at the Pentagon as one of Robert McNamara's whiz kids, in the early years of the Vietnam War.
''Informing and defining,'' he said when pressed to describe how that experience affected him. ''I at the time thought that gradual escalation was the right policy. In retrospect, that was not the right policy.'' As to what he learned in the Pentagon, he said, ''You learn the limitations on the political use of force.''
 
No Apologies From Aspin
The Aspin press releases are still pithy, if not quite as frequent as they were during his political adolescence. But even now he makes no apologies for the unabashed publicity seeking.
''You start out as a junior member of a committee,'' he said. ''How do you make an impact? One of the ways you do it is to call attention to problems. You kind of fall into it because it's one of the few outlets you have. As you get more seniority, you can move things without that device. You can get broader.''
In Mr. Aspin's case, getting broader meant disappointing the House liberals who in 1985 helped him leapfrog to the Armed Services chairmanship over half a dozen more senior committee members. By 1987, they were angry enough to win a no-confidence vote. He won the chair back two weeks later, and has spent two years trying to mend fences. He speaks of the abortive coup now as though it were some ancient tribal conflict rather than a reprimand for a nonconsulting style of operating.
''Every revolution sets up a counterrevolution,'' he said. ''It comes from a combination of people who don't think the original revolution went quite far enough and the people who think it went too far. If you survive the counterrevolution, then it's O.K.''
In the four years they have shared as chairmen, Mr. Nunn and Mr. Aspin have fundamentally agreed, brokering budget-driven compromises. Yet each year, politics and personality conspire to reinforce the typecasting: methodical Sam Nunn, a preeminent spokesman on defense because he finds bipartisan consensus; gadfly Les Aspin, with an academic's interest in arms control, driven to the middle by the tension between his committee's conservatives and the liberal House majority.
 
Uneasy With Interviews
''I hate this, I hate it,'' Mr. Nunn said, wincing at the prospect of having to talk about himself and adamant in his refusal to talk about any differences or similarities with Mr. Aspin. Mr. Aspin is no less uneasy with conversations that stray too far from the cerebral.
''I always have difficult problems with these interviews where I'm asked, 'Underneath, what do you really think?' '' he said with a sigh.
The clue to what Mr. Aspin thinks is the way he thinks - in big, analytical constructs and scenarios, as if the world were a gigantic puzzle and his job were to try the pieces in various combinations. Often he thinks out loud, a habit born of his years at Yale, Oxford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but one that leads some colleagues to complain that he is inconsistent.
''If I look at the Soviet Union now, in the spring of 1990, putting together the 1991 budget,'' he begins, ''what do I see?'' As he speaks, he is repositioning his gangling body sideways in his swivel chair so that his head is thrown back against one of its arms and his legs are dangling over the other. Staring up at the ceiling, he continues to spin out the arguments, pro and con - for cutting the Administration's military budget request.
But what does the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee believe?
''I say I want to hedge my bets,'' Mr. Aspin concludes, snapping back to an upright posture. ''I don't know whether the hawks are right or the doves are right, but it tells me that we probably ought not jump too much one way or the other until we see more evidence.''
 
The Body Language Clue
Mr. Aspin's body language should not be taken lightly, said Senator John Warner of Virginia, the senior Republican on Armed Services Committee, who has spent hours across the bargaining table from him.
''As the discussions go on, Les slides further and further down in his chair,'' said Mr. Warner, eagerly demonstrating the Aspin slouch. ''When he's slid almost to the floor, that's when you know he's going to cut his deal.''
Mr. Nunn gives away almost nothing with his body language and, 90 percent of the time, not a great deal more when he talks. The painstaking insistence on building a case before making it is a character trait that his colleagues find both admirable and irritating.
''If I know what I'm going to do, I don't mind telling people,'' he said, acknowledging that the more common impression is that he is simply avoiding a question until he has his political ducks in order. ''A lot of times, I really have not thought through it, or even if I know which way I'm going to lean, I don't have the clear rationale behind my answer at that stage.''
James Schlesinger, the former Defense Secretary and Central Intelligence director who is part of Mr. Nunn's kitchen cabinet, said, ''He is willing to reach judgments quickly in private, but unwilling to express them publicly until he has overwhelming evidence for them.''
Mr. Nunn did not spend a lifetime around Southern politicians without learning a few things about the grease that makes a legislature run. ''One of the great challenges around here is not just knowing the substance of something,'' he said, ''but knowing how to relate it to the timing and knowing how to relate it to other people's thoughts and ideas and knowing how to express it and knowing how many people and who you need to bounce it around with to get their input before you ever do it.''
For Sam Nunn, this is a proving time. His predecessor, Richard Russell of Georgia, decided to be a ''super-Senator'' after failing to win his party's Presidential nomination in 1952, and the conventional wisdom is that Mr. Nunn will take Mr. Russell's path.
Les Aspin's ambitions once included the Senate. But that flame has banked, and he is now busy doing what comes most naturally, tutoring. His latest pupils are the Russians, through an ad-hoc committee exchange program that brings Soviet military brass and legislators to his panel to observe the American brand of defense politics and policy making. ''Aspin was a self-proclaimed gadfly taking on the Pentagon powers, while Nunn was taking the role of uncle,'' said Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. ''Now Aspin is taking positions where gadflies criticize him, and Nunn is taking positions where his traditional allies often look at him with bewilderment. As they have changed they've become more alike.''
Mr. Aspin acknowledges that perhaps the two have moved closer together. ''We can speak to each other in shorthand,'' the Representative said of the Senator. On Capitol Hill, the view is that they'll need to.

HEADLINE: Warning on 'Risk-o-Phobia'

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1

 BODY:
Budget Director Richard G. Darman said tonight that the United States should not abandon its market economy and economic growth to clean up the environment.
''Americans did not fight and win the wars of the 20th century to make the world safe for green vegetables,'' Mr. Darman said in a speech at Harvard University. ''If we were to regulate houses with the same principles we now apply to our food and air, for example, we would all have to live in single-story homes - for fear of falling down stairs.''
Mr. Darman and the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, are the two senior White House aides most skeptical of strengthening regulation of the environment. They have argued in support of diluting Presidental positions on global warming and other environmental issues.
The budget director said Americans ''must counter the tendency to become a risk-o-phobic society'' because prudent risk-taking is central to the American spirit and standard of living.
''It would be a regrettable irony if just as the values of the American romance were to triumph in the East-West struggle, they were to be lost in what some environmentalists like to term the struggle for 'global management,' '' Mr. Darman said.
''Because so many people are self-proclaimed 'environmentalists,' the label is no longer a meaningful characteristic. It is a green mask under which different faces of politico-economic ideology can hide,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Why So Slow on S & L Thieves?

 BODY:
The savings and loan bailout is already a mess. Why does the Bush Administration seem so determined to make the cleanup even slower? Now it is not so subtly nudging out the man who is managing the bailout. That comes hard on the heels of Congressional hearings showing Administration stinginess in prosecuting S & L thieves. 
An argument can at least be made for retiring William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and of the Resolution Trust Corporation. He's a holdover appointee who has said he intends to leave before his term expires next year. But there's no excuse for the insufficient prosecutorial effort.
S & L officers and owners who bled their institutions bankrupt are proving hard to catch. Most of the plunder has been squandered on bad investments and high living. That's the frustrating message from the latest of the House Banking Committee's useful hearings on the scandal.
F.B.I. Director William Sessions testified that though his agents had found ''pervasive'' fraud, the paper trail was so difficult to verify that it would take years to catch the thieves. Last year's S & L bailout legislation authorized $75 million a year for additional agents and Justice Department attorneys for three years. More than 200 have been added, but still more will be needed. Yet the Administration sought only $49 million in new enforcement funds for the first year and contends that $50 million will do for the second.
Fraud alone did not bring on the crisis, and could not have flourished without lax Federal regulation. Even so, the fraud was widespread and huge. Public anger at paying taxes to bail out thievery is fully justified. Moreover, unpunished fraud undermines confidence in financial institutions.
Henry Gonzales, the Texas Democrat who heads the House committee, has built a valuable record of what went wrong. The most electrifying hearings, on the Lincoln Savings and Loan case in California, spotlighted the Senate's ''Keating Five,'' who took large campaign contributions from Lincoln's chairman, Charles Keating.
Two of the five are the Senate Banking Committee's chairman, Donald Riegle of Michigan, and its ranking Democrat, Alan Cranston of California. That may help explain why the committee hasn't picked up Mr. Gonzales's lead. All five are under investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee.
The thrift industry's troubles turned into the biggest financial crisis in history while Congress -and the Reagan Administration - looked the other way. To keep looking away is to endorse fraud.

HEADLINE: Maybe the Key To Long-Term Care

BYLINE: By William A. O'Neill; William A. O'Neill is Governor of Connecticut.

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
Solving the problem of financing long-term health care for the elderly is a pressing national priority. Connecticut has taken steps to address that problem, and is awaiting action by Congress that would help put its plan into action.
In 1986, I appointed a special commission to examine private and public responsibilities for financing long-term health care for the elderly.
In 1987, the commission reported that Connecticut was spending $274 million for that purpose. But, it said, with the growth in the elderly population and the projected rate of inflation of health care costs, that sum would grow to $1.4 billion by the year 2000 unless the state did something different. What could be done? There was substantial evidence that the private sector alone could not pay for long-term care. We realized that a publicly financed social-insurance program was equally unlikely, given America's national budget deficit and competing demands for Federal dollars. 
At this point, Connecticut realized that a public-and-private partnership offered the most promising alternative. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation then gave the state a two-year $350,000 grant to develop such a partnership.
The projected plan, called the Connecticut Partnership for Long-Term Care, was worked out in 1988 and 1980 by the state's executive branch, legislators, insurers, consumers, health-care providers and employers.
It would provide individuals with a way to plan ahead to meet long-term needs for care while also constraining the growth of Federal and state Medicaid expenditures.
The state's primary goal is to enable individuals to receive necessary care without having to impoverish themselves. Under the plan, individuals are offered an incentive of guaranteed protection of assets to purchase private insurance for long-term care in amounts they can afford.
If individuals need such care in a nursing home or at home, they will first receive benefits under their private insurance policy. When that coverage runs out, they can apply for Medicaid and protect one dollar of their assets for every dollar their private policy has paid out in state-approved benefits.
These protected assets can spell the difference between dependence and independence. No longer will people need to go broke to get Medicaid.
Simply put, the partnership would do the following things:
First, it would allow individuals to protect assets equal to the sum their insurance has paid out in approved benefits. Second, it would establish stringent standards for private insurance policies that can offer such protection. Third, it would create a public consumer-information service to help individuals choose appropriate coverage.
Fourth, it would lead to much more affordable policies by encouraging insurers to develop a variety of policies for a wide market, including the poor as well as the affluent. Fifth, it would save state and Federal dollars by delaying enrollment in Medicaid.
By testing this approach, we can demonstrate how far private insurance can go in financing long-term care. It will then be possible to design public benefits that are feasible and cost-effective.
In June 1989, the General Assembly unanimously authorized the demonstration. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awarded the state $1.8 million to finance the first three years of a six-year demonstration.
However, since Medicaid is a joint Federal-state program, Federal legislation is needed for the demonstration to go forward. This legislation would waive the requirement that individuals can retain only a bare minimum of their assets before qualifying for Medicaid assistance. Such a measure unanimously passed the Senate last November but still awaits action in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
We hope that the committee appreciates that the Connecticut partnership is a socially conscious, fiscally sound response to one of the most critical issues facing every state and the nation as a whole.
It offers a middle ground that is feasible, that will provide incentives to individuals to plan ahead and that will provide valuable information to guide a reasoned national solution.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Gay Dentists? Flirting Advice? Call the Hot Line

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Things hummed along at the Gay and Lesbian Switchboard.
''How do you know you're gay?'' a nervous Long Island high school student asked. He had ridden his bicycle to a pay phone with a roll of quarters in his pocket.
A lesbian called to say she was lonely. A man called from London to ask about gay hotspots in Paris, his next stop. Someone wanted names of violent sex clubs and received a half dozen suggestions. Someone wanted and got a list of moving companies owned by gay people. An unemployed laborer asked about jobs. 
Nothing startles at this all-volunteer telephone counseling, referral and information service for gay people and those who are interested in gay people - be they parents, spouses or simply the curious. More than 30,000 people a year call to talk about everything from the suicide of a gay friend to where to find a gay dentist.
The premise is simple: people who aren't cut from a standard-issue cookie-cutter are O.K. too. And they need someone to talk to.
''It's all anonymous,'' said Brad Becker, the financial analyst who is president of the 18-year-old switchboard. ''It's a chance to talk to other gay people, to say something one has never been able to say to anybody before.''
The switchboard's first headquarters was literally in a closet at a bath house called ''Man's Country.'' Now at 648 Broadway, it receives no corporate or government support -but in 1985 it was granted nonprofit, tax-exempt status. Bills are paid through small donations.
Three phones are staffed daily from noon to midnight. A vast majority of calls are local, and all are anonymous. Volunteers punching computer keyboards can almost instantaneously pass on information about groups of gay bakers, lawyers or advertising professionals. Where to find the right kind of gay psychotherapist. The addresses and hours of gay saunas. A gay insurance broker. Gay philosophers. Scores of gay religious services. A rundown of gay plumbers.
''People want to put their money back in the community,'' Mr. Becker said.
This is not a $1-a-minute ''party'' line, though people sometimes discuss intimate things in a more or less analytical fashion. In this time of plague, just 7 percent of the calls concern AIDS. Mr. Becker explained that life must go on and that gay people, like everybody else, have many concerns. ''We don't want to equate gay with AIDS,'' he said.
The scene was frenetic. As soon as a receiver was back in its cradle, the phone seemed to ring. Susan P., a volunteer who works for an executive search firm, picked it up. A lesbian asking about bars. Susan said New York has a couple of hundred gay bars for men, but just five or 10 regularly catering to gay women. She gave names, suggesting which might be best tonight.
Some anonymous callers allowed a reporter to listen in on an extra phone. Some didn't. Switchboard members - who thought this article might be useful to fund raising and to public understanding - stressed that the privacy of calls is fiercely protected.
The phone rang. A man said he had been in a gay relationship for 15 years but was so attracted to a man at work that he would give all that up in a second. He said he loved the man -though they hadn't had sex, only flirtations -and needed advice on how to get to the next step. ''Meaning?'' a volunteer asked.
''I mean committing a little bit,'' was the answer.
The issue remained unresolved, but the caller seemed thankful for the chance to chat for more than a half an hour. Somebody called asking about sadomasochistic support groups. Somebody hung up on Susan as soon as he heard a woman's voice. Somebody listened to descriptions of bars, then voiced interest in ''a Western leather kind of place.'' ''A Texan,'' a laughing Susan reported. A very articulate man called to say he had met a man of whom he was enamored and didn't want to ''scare him off.'' He had no problem discussing things with a woman.
''This isn't a very unusual situation,'' Susan said, trying to help the man talk through his volatile feelings without imposing any ideas. ''I was warned by my friend, 'He's shy; take it slow,' '' the man said.
''Ah,'' said Susan. ''The great variable, the other human being.''
The calls continued. Yes, you must wear a condom during oral sex. Yes, tell your friend we take calls from the deaf.
A man said he was ''used and abused'' because he was so good-looking. He then wandered around a bit, concluding: ''It's nice to have other people to talk to.'' (212) 777-1800.

HEADLINE: Would-Be Payers Fight New York Sales Tax Plan

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
The tentative agreement between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders to extend the New York State sales tax to magazines and a number of service industries was attacked by representatives of those industries yesterday. They said that it would drive many businesses out of the state.
Taxing magazines while excluding newspapers is similar to attempts that have been found unconstitutional in other states, magazine executives said yesterday.
''This kind of selective taxation of the press has been considered and rejected by the United States Supreme Court in two recent cases,'' said Peter Diamandis, chairman of the Magazine Publishers of America, in a letter to Governor Cuomo. ''Both cases involved sales taxes, singling out particular kinds of publications for taxation, and the Court ruled that such discrimination violated the free press clause of the First Amendment.'' 
 
Dry Cleaners Affected
The tentative agreement would also extend New York's sales tax for the first time to services like custom computer programming, management consulting, public relations, 900 telephone numbers and cleaning services.
''You couldn't ask for a worse time to burden the small business, when dry cleaning sales have been running 15 percent to 20 percent below last year,'' said Bill Seitz, executive director of the Neighborhood Cleaners Association, a regional association with 2,000 of its members in New York State. ''You also have a very large ethnic population in the dry cleaning industry who are trying desperately to survive, and they don't really need any more negatives.''
Harold Burson of Burson-Marsteller, the Young & Rubicam subsidiary that is the largest public relations firm in the state, said in a letter to Governor Cuomo that more than half of the firm's annual income of $50 million was derived from clients outside New York State. ''The work performed for these clients can easily be shifted to other Burson-Marsteller offices or, at the worst, to other public relations firms not subject to a state sales tax,'' he wrote.
 
Constitutional Implications
Although groups affected by the proposed tax generally reacted to what it would mean for them economically, the magazine industry was also concerned with constitutional implications.
Legally, some 15 states now tax magazine sales but not newspaper sales - as New York is proposing to do. But in most states these laws are not enforced, according to the Magazine Publishers of America. Whenever a state has tried to collect a tax on magazine subscriptions in one of these states, magazine publishers have challenged the tax in court and won, the publishers group said. Challenges have occurred in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Florida and Missouri.
In March, for instance, Time Warner and its magazine Southern Living challenged Tennessee's sales tax, which exempted newspapers but not magazines. Newsweek brought a similar suit on the same law. The Supreme Court of Tennessee unanimously declared that the Tennessee sales tax, applicable to magazines but not to newspapers, was unconstitutional.
 
Newspapers Taxed in 22 States
In 22 states both magazines and newspapers are taxed, the publishers group said. Generally speaking, courts have upheld taxes that affect both magazines and newspapers, if they are just a small part of a general product tax.
Asked about the constitutionality of the proposed tax, Gary Fryer, a spokesman for Governor Cuomo, said he could not comment on the proposal because there has yet to be a final agreement on the budget's contents.
It is unclear whether the proposed New York tax would affect subscriptions or newsstand sales or both.
John Paluszek, immediate past president of the Public Relations Society of America and president of Ketchum Public Affairs, said that the legislation was being ''designed behind closed doors'' and expressed fears that it would be passed before the affected groups could express their concern.
 
Public Relations Counter-Effort
The Public Relations Society of America said that public relations activities generated about $554 million of business in New York State.
Michael Henning, managing partner of the New York office of Ernst & Young, certified public accountants, called the proposed tax a ''disservice tax.'' He said, ''If Mr. Cuomo wants to go after the industry that has really raised the revenues for the State of New York, I think there is the possibility that he will lose as much revenue as he will gain, because people will decide that this isn't the place to be based, and they will move their operations elsewhere.''
Throughout the state yesterday, an effort was under way to derail the proposal, as public relations executives with all the expertise at their command took on a cause dear to their own.
''As you can imagine, we're trying to mobilize everybody,'' said Donald D. Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of America. ''We've got the New York State wholesalers involved as well.''

HEADLINE: THE WINE REGIONS: CHILE;
Land of Promise Seizes the Moment

SERIES: Future articles will discuss Argentina, Portugal and the Napa Valley of California.

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
THE highway runs down from Santiago toward Punta Arenas and, yes, the South Pole, but we weren't going that far, my leathery-faced driver and I. We were turning right near San Fernando, about three hours south of the capital, and heading into the Colchagua Valley to Peralillo. It was the fourth day of a weeklong trip through what is probably the most exciting wine region in the world right now.
As a wine-making country, Chile has a lot - some might say everything - going for it: a near-perfect climate, low land costs and low production costs, a long wine-making tradition, the complete absence of phylloxera, the aphid that can be fatal to vines elsewhere, and South America's only stable, export-oriented economy.
Add the fact that the seasons are reversed; the finest wine makers and viticulturists in the Northern Hemisphere, who might not dream of taking on extra work in their own territories, are eager to fly to Chile after their own wine is made. They can do an entire vintage and be back north just in time for spring. 
For the last six years, Chile has been busy capitalizing on these assets in an effort to become one of the world's important wine producing nations. And so, as I headed south in a pickup truck last month with the vineyard foreman who'd been sent to fetch me, it was the beginning of autumn, with orchards of gold, red and rust apple trees stretching off toward the Andes in the east. Chile's best wine region occupies the temperate middle of this 2,880-mile-long country, a region extending from Aconcagua Province near Santiago, through Colchagua Province and south to the towns of Sagrada Familia, Lontue and Molina.
Our first stop had been the Errazuriz Panquehue winery (pronounced eh-RAH-zoo-riz pan-KAY-way), north of Santiago in the Aconcagua Valley, where Augustin Huneeus, a Chilean who is president of Franciscan Vineyards in California, has an important financial interest. Then came Concha y Toro, by far the largest wine company in Chile, with 10 different wineries and vineyards spread through hundreds of miles of the fertile valleys of central Chile.
Last on this brief list, the place we were heading, was Vina los Vascos - Vineyard of the Basques - which has attracted considerable attention among wine lovers because it is half-owned by the owners of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild in Bordeaux.
Errazuriz Panquehue was founded near the beginning of the 19th century by Don Maximiliano Errazuriz, one of the first growers to plant French vinifera vines in Chile. The winery and its vineyards are relatively far north and thus, since this is the Southern Hemisphere, in one of the warmer growing regions. Each afternoon, however, the wind from the sea snakes through the mountains to cool the vines.
Errazuriz Panquehue is under the day-to-day direction of Eduardo Chadwick, the 30-year-old president who is a direct descendant of Don Maximiliano. He and his equally young staff work closely with the team from Franciscan in the Napa Valley and, in fact, have produced a line of wines, Caliterra, specifically for the American market.
The Caliterra line includes a cabernet made from grapes grown in the Maipo Valley south of Santiago, and both a chardonnay and a sauvignon blanc from a cooler new region nearly 200 miles south in Curico. The principal gem in the Errazuriz Panquehue diadem is the Don Maximiliano cabernet, made from grapes from the home vineyard.
Concha y Toro, founded in 1883 by Don Melchor de Concha y Toro, today is controlled by the Guilisasti family with a considerable interest held by several American banks. Longtime wine enthusiasts will remember Concha y Toros from the 1950's and before when its fat little bottles of Chilean riesling sold in the United States for under $1. For most of its life, Concha y Toro has concentrated on inexpensive wine. Its production is impressive: a projected 45 million liters or 5 million cases in 1990, more than double its 1988 production.
Even so, as the mass market has begun to slow down in Chile and elsewhere in the world, the company has moved resolutely into fine wines, especially for export. Its showcase vineyards are at Pirque, 30 minutes southeast of Santiago, but there are other plantings all over central Chile, including some experimental vineyards hundreds of miles to the south in cooler regions.
While much of that acreage is planted in common varieties for cheap wine, Concha y Toro makes almost all of the classic Bordeaux varieties, plus chardonnay, gewurztraminer and riesling. Its best-known premium wine is a cabernet sauvignon called Casillero del Diablo. More than half of all exported Chilean wine comes from Concha y Toros.
Los Vascos is far smaller than Concha Y Toro but its history is much longer. The resident owners of Los Vascos are Jorge Eyzaguirre and his wife, Maria Ignacia Echenique, both of Basque ancestry. The Echenique family have grown fruit in the Colchagua area since 1755, but the Eyzaguirre family acquired what is now Los Vascos only in the mid-1970's when the Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet divested itself of lands appropriated by the state in the Presidency of Salvador Allende Gossens, who was deposed in 1973.
Mr. Eyzaguirre realized that he had acquired a dilapidated, obsolete winery that would would require major investment and expertise to bring back into production. He found what he needed four years ago at Vinexpo, a wine exposition held every two years in Bordeaux.
Eric de Rothschild, who was managing Lafite-Rothschild for the family group, Domaines des Barons Rothschild, had acquired several chateaus in the Bordeaux region and was looking for other investments. He liked everything he saw and heard about Los Vascos's potential, and in 1988 bought 50 percent of the winery.
Since then, the winery has been transformed. The first of two new buildings is up, and new fermenters, new presses and, most important, new French oak barrels for aging the red wines, have been installed. Most of the work has been supervised by Gilbert Rokvin, Lafite's chief wine maker. Before going to Bordeaux, Mr. Rokvin spent almost 20 years making wine in Spain, so he speaks fluent Spanish to the workers.
Los Vascos's problems mirrored those of most other Chilean wineries six years ago, when the push for export markets began. They had operated in a highly regulated economy, protected from foreign competition and cut off from foreign investment and ideas. With few exceptions, the wines were mediocre, made in vast quantities to be sold at the very lowest prices. Even now, standard table wine sells in Santiago supermarkets for around 80 cents a liter in a brick-shaped box called a tetra-pak.
The conversion to high-quality wine has been rapid but not without pain. Some workers still resist more exacting standards and there are holdouts, even at high corporate levels, who see no reason why overseas customers should not adapt their tastes to traditional Chilean wine styles.
And in fact, not even the best of the current crop of Chilean wines are always free of some of the old faults. Most serious among those faults is overproduction: making too much wine from a given plot of vineyard. When quantity is paramount, it doesn't matter if the wine is light and bland and lacking in the characteristics of the grape. What sets the best wines apart from the others is their intensity: the amount of taste and character packed into each mouthful.
The Chileans recognize this, and the most recent vintages of the best wines show remarkable improvement. But don't expect to find the concentration of a fine Bordeaux or California wine in the older vintages. Some of them, yes; most of them, no. That should all change with many of the 1989's and even more so with the 1990 vintage, which with the reversal in seasons is already in barrels.
Small oak barrels - the standard 60-gallon aging barrel of France and California - is new to Chile. The older wines were aged in much larger casks - and aged and aged. Consequently, they taste oxydized to Americans. They taste oxydized to the Chileans, too, but they like them that way. Every winery is busily acquiring small oak barrels now and, in a few years oxydization should be a thing of the past.
White wines used to taste oxydized, too, but modern wine-making techniques, which keep the wine fresh and lively are now widely used.
This visit concentrated on three wineries, one with a strong degree of American influence, one with French, and the third, the country's largest, has had some French help, too: Emile Peynaud, the famous Bordeaux enologist was a consultant until he retired two years ago. While these three are among the outstanding Chilean wineries, they are hardly the only oustanding ones among Chile's hundreds of wineries.
 
Other Labels To Consider
CONCHA y TORO, Errazuriz Panquehue and Los Vascos don't have a lock on the best Chilean wines. Here are a few others to consider.
Among the cabernets are Santa Rita Medalla Real, 1986; Cousino Macul, Antiguas Reservas, 1986; Miguel Torres, 1987 Curico; Undurraga, 1987 Santa Ana, and Canepa 1987 Finissimo. Of the three featured wineries, look for Caliterra 1987, Maipo; Los Vascos 1987, and Concha y Toro's 1987 Private Reserve, Puenta Alto.
Sauvignon blanc may be Chile's best wine at the moment. The better versions have that leanness and touch of acidity that distinguishes the best sauvignon blancs in Europe and so often seems lacking in California versions of the wine. Some Chilean sauvignons are a bit dull but most are more than drinkable. Santa Rita's is excellent; Miguel Torres and Undurraga make delicious sauvignon blanc, as do Caliterra and Canepa.
Santa Rita's 1987 Reserva chardonnay is outstanding. The 1989's from Cousino Macul and Santa Carolina are worth seeking out as well.
That's the good news. The even better news is that the prices of these wines are all remarkably low. Most of them are $6 or less. But they will not remain that way. Nothing brings a glow to a Chilean wine maker's eyes quicker than the mention of higher prices. They'd all like to go to around $10, which is fine if the quality continues to increase as well. Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Approves the Irradiation of Poultry

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
THE Food and Drug Administration yesterday approved the irradiation of poultry to control salmonella and other bacteria that are responsible for an increase in food-borne illnesses in this country.
Most of the poultry industry, however, said it had no plans to use the technology because of strong consumer resistance to irradiated foods. Over the last 30 years, the F.D.A. has approved irradiation of fruits, vegetables, pork, wheat, and herbs and spices, but opposition has blocked the widespread use of the procedure.
As far as the agency knows, only small amounts of herbs and spices are being irradiated. New York, New Jersey and Maine have banned the sale of irradiated foods. 
The food and drug agency said the process, which does not make the food radioactive, would ''greatly reduce but does not eliminate all the bacteria'' in poultry. Irradiation is a process in which foods are exposed to gamma rays, X-rays or electron bombardment to kill insects, molds or bacteria that can lead to spoilage or disease. The F.D.A allows irradiation of up to 300,000 rads or 3 kiloGrays.
Foods that are to be irradiated are placed on a conveyor belt, which travels into a chamber protected by thick concrete walls. A radioactive source such as cobalt 60 or cesium 137, a waste product of the nuclear power industry, emits the radioactive rays.
As many as half of the chickens in this country may be contaminated with salmonella, which causes gastrointestinal illness, generally with mild flu-like symptoms. But among the elderly and those with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients and people with AIDS, salmonellosis can cause death. In 1987 there were 44,609 reported cases of salmonellosis, but the Centers for Disease Control say the actual number is more like 4.5 million.
In addition to salmonella, radiation could also be used to control camplylobacter jejuni, bacteria that cause 2 to 4 million cases a year of gastrointestinal illness.
Whether or not irradiated food is safe may be moot. The National Broiler Council and the Turkey Federation said today that they have no intention of irradiating their products. William Roenigk, an economist with the National Broiler Council, an association representing 90 percent of the companies that produce and process chicken in the United States, said the membership believed that the effort to convince the public that irradiated chicken is safe ''would be much too costly and time consuming because most people have made up their minds. They are not neutral about it.''
Mr. Roenigk added, ''Most consumers are not willing to make the tradeoff and they are aware that proper cooking will kill the salmonella and that seems to be a much better trade off than going to irradation.''
Stuart Proctor, the executive vice president of the Turkey Federation, which represents about 95 percent of the growers and processors, said that because of a lack of consumer acceptance, his members were not planning to irradiate their products. Approving irradiation for poultry ''is a step in the right direction,'' he said, ''but we are not going to go out and do a consumer education campaign.''
The approval of irradiation for poultry was sought by the United States Department of Agriculture, which regulates meat and poultry products, and Radiation Technology Inc. of Rockaway, N.J., a concern that irradiates food.
There are more than 1,200 scientific studies dealing with the safety of food irradiation, many of them hotly contested.
''As far as we are concerned, we found overwhelming evidence there was no safety concern,'' said Dr. Laura Tarantino, consumer safety officer of the agency's division of food and color additives.
But Dr. David C. Dodson, assistant clinical professor of medicine at Boston University, said the agency ''has not done the appropriate testing.''
''With food irradiation, you create new chemicals in the food, radiolytic products, and that is what should be tested,'' he said. A radiolytic product is a chemical that is potentially toxic. Some may be carcinogenic.
Dr. Dodson went on: ''There is vast literature which has shown adverse effects and an equal amount of literature that shows no harmful effects in animals. There is one published study on humans that was reported in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1985 which showed chromosomal damage'' from eating irradiated wheat.
In 1986 Richard Ronk, who was the deputy director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said the agency would continue to permit low-level radiation of food without further animal studies because after interacting with the molecules in food, ''energy from low-level radiation is not capable of forming radiolytic products, which might be carcinogenic.''
Dr. Ronk added, ''There is no way to test the effects of irradiated foods in animal systems.''

Regarding ''How Do You Fix a Broken Planet?'' by Dena Kleiman [April 25]: Many of us who grew up during the Depression practiced conservation for reasons of economy. Here are some of the unwritten rules at our house in the 30's:
* Turn off lights that are not in use. 
* Shampoo hair once a week.
* Wear clothes until soiled.
* Use napkin until soiled, keeping in napkin ring.
* Use hot water sparingly (a hot tub means three or four inches of bath water).
* Mend clothes; darn socks.
* Use paper cups, plates and napkins only for picnics.
While these measures seem drastic, perhaps they can be adopted in modified form. We would do well to heed the old New England wisdom:
Use it up, wear it out, Make it do, do without.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
In Philadelphia, 3 Arts Centers, 2 or One?

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
For the last half-century, Philadelphia has had only one major downtown performing-arts center, the venerable Academy of Music, but now the city is struggling over the fate of two others.
The first is a new hall planned for the Philadelphia Orchestra that is designed by Robert Venturi, a Philadelphian who is one of the world's most celebrated architects. The second is the old Metropolitan Opera House, a crumbling wreck of a theater in north central Philadelphia, which a local foundation wants to restore as the centerpiece of a major urban-renewal project.
While proponents of both projects insist that the two halls have nothing to do with each other and say publicly that they are fully in favor of both projects moving ahead, they express private doubts that the city will have the economic means to make both happen.
Although the halls would not be directly competitive - the orchestra hall would replace the 134-year-old Academy of Music as the setting for the Philadelphia Orchestra's concerts, while the restored opera house would mainly be used for popular music and touring shows - each project would cost upward of $100 million, a considerable amount of money for an old city that has traditionally turned up its nose at the splashy big-money spending on the arts characteristic of many newer cities. 
Behind the question of whether Philadelphia will build the Venturi building, restore the old opera house, do both or do neither, is a tale of cultural politics intertwined with architecture and urban sociology.
Each project has been promoted as providing a unique mix of urban elements offering the city not only cultural benefits, but social and economic ones as well. The new orchestra hall holds out the allure not only of an improved building for the city's most cherished cultural institution, the Philadelphia Orchestra, but also of the possibility of giving Philadelphia its first major public building by its greatest living architect.
While perhaps Philadelphia's most beloved cultural entity, the Academy of Music was originally built as an opera house, and it has never been considered ideal for symphonic concerts. But since the new hall would be diagonally across the street from the Academy of Music, which would remain as a secondary hall, and would be close to the Shubert Theater and a planned new repertory theater, the orchestra has promoted the project as the centerpiece of a new Avenue of the Arts, which would concentrate cultural activity on South Broad Street.
But the likelihood that the hall will be built anytime soon is slim, given a lackluster fund-raising campaign, which after several years has yielded only $19 million, a tiny fraction of its $110 million goal. The effort to build the hall is expected to be further crippled by the recent decision of Riccardo Muti, the orchestra's popular conductor, to return to Italy after the 1991-92 season.
A restored Metropolitan Opera House offers the city something quite different: not significant new architecture, but the prospect of bringing a palatial, landmark-quality theater back to life as a dramatic centerpiece for a renewed north central Philadelphia, a neighborhood now ridden with drugs and crime.
The proposal to restore the 3,400-seat opera house, which was built by Oscar Hammerstein in 1908 but has been used over the years for everything from gospel services to boxing and is now almost completely abandoned, envisions the huge old building as the anchor of a broader effort to build housing and new commercial buildings amid the dilapidation of the area.
The effort is at least as much of a long shot as the new orchestra hall, not only because the old opera house is in appalling condition - its elaborate plaster ornamentation is largely ruined, and much of the orchestra pit was filled in with concrete years ago - but because it would also require the cooperation of a daunting coalition of government officials, private developers, community leaders and the major foundation that has expressed interest in acting as a catalyst.
Officially, no one in Philadelphia sees the two projects as an either-or proposition. But the new orchestra hall has been estimated to cost $110 million, with construction costs rising continually. Restoring the old opera house and providing community improvements along with it would cost at least $100 million. While it is possible that money could be found for both in the next couple of years, it is unlikely.
Complicating the political situation is the role of Philadelphia's largest foundation, and one of the wealthiest in the country, the Pew Charitable Trust. The Pew Trust is the instigator of the Metropolitan Opera House project; it has acquired an option to buy the property and it has also hired economic development, architectural and theater-management consultants to study the opera-house project.
Its board has said it would put $20 million into the project if the right combination of Federal and state funds and private investments could be found to assure that the project would move ahead.
The $20 million figure rankles the Philadelphia Orchestra since that is precisely the amount the Pew Trust informally pledged to the orchestra's building project several years ago, when the planning for the Venturi hall began. Since then, the foundation, traditionally Philadelphia's charitable leader, has shifted its priorities from old-line Philadelphia philanthropies to seek innovative projects with major social impact.
The director of the Pew Trust, Rebecca Rimel, has a particular interest in inner-city problems, and she and her colleagues saw the opera-house project as a means of showing the foundation's commitment to creative ideas in philanthropy and to helping its home city at the same time.
 
The Complications Of Finding Money
The trust has made only a token grant to the orchestra project, although its board has said it will consider a larger grant later. But the foundation has told the orchestra not to rely on it as the core of its fund-raising effort. And some people close to the foundation have expressed irritation with the orchestra's expectation that it could rely on traditional charitable sources to pay for its new building, and have urged that it be more aggressive in building bridges to other potential donors.
The Pew Trust's reluctance to play a major role in financing the new hall has in turn affected other gifts, since the trust, which has total assets of roughly $3.2 billion spread out over several related foundations, has generally set the pace for philanthropic giving in Philadelphia. So far, the orchestra has found no other donor willing to come forth with the major gift necessary to assure that the building will go ahead. And the $19 million it has raised is far short of the $50 million it says it must have in hand before it can start construction on the Venturi building.
Architectural issues are far from the fore here, but they are not irrelevant, either. For the Venturi design, if it does get built, holds the potential of being a civic building of some consequence. As with much of Mr. Venturi's work, it is best described as a modern building based on old-fashioned models: a building that attempts to combine the thin, flat forms of modernism with traditional, decorative imagery.
The best thing about the overall form is the way in which Mr. Venturi has managed to shape a building that manages to have a strong and traditional presence on the street and at the same time to defer to the demands of the automobile.
The hall would appear from South Broad Street to be a large, formal and nearly symmetrical palazzo, with big windows facing the street; on the side, the mass of the building would be slightly scooped out to permit a large automobile approach and a second entrance. So this is a truly urban building, but one that acknowledges the reality of life at the end of the 20th century, in its very shape celebrating the pedestrian-oriented cityscape and yet symbolizing the way in which it is forced to accommodate the needs of the automobile.
The facade of the new orchestra hall is a bit flatter than it might be, hardly sleek but more blunt and plain than so important a civic building probably should be on South Broad Street. The interior of the 2,700-seat hall, to the extent that its designs - which are still developing - are any guide, is inventively decorative, with intricately patterned balcony fronts joining to create an overall geometric pattern.
Russell Johnson, the acoustical consultant who worked with I. M. Pei on the design of the recently completed Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, is working with Mr. Venturi here. As in Dallas, Mr. Johnson has led the architect to a long, narrow auditorium, with lots of architectural detail and few flat surfaces. If some of the ornamental themes of this auditorium could make their way onto the too-blunt facade, the hall would be a much stronger building.
The Metropolitan Opera House is neither as gracious a jewel box as the old Academy of Music nor as intriguing an architectural possibility as the new orchestra hall. As a building, it more resembles the great movie palaces, though it predates them; it is vast, a quirky combination of the ornate and the barnlike. Its acoustics, however, are said to be superb, and for some years it was used by the Philadelphia Orchestra as a recording studio.
 
Beneath It All, A Commitment
Can the two projects be combined and the opera-house project made the orchestra's new home? Neither side likes that alternative. The orchestra, cognizant of the slow speed with which Philadelphians give up their sentimental attachments, made a point of saying it wanted to stay close to the old Academy of Music on South Broad Street. Orchestra spokesmen say the orchestra's patrons do not want to go to the neighborhood of the old opera house on North Broad Street.
The Pew Trust dislikes a combination because its consultants warned against letting the restored opera house be the home of a nonprofit company. In their study on the viability of the opera-house project, the consultants told the trust that the hall's financial success depends on its being booked with profit-making musical events.
What ties the thinking underlying both projects together, however, is the commitment of both sponsors to downtown Philadelphia, and to the idea that a major arts building can become a kind of symbolic base on which other kinds of community improvements can be built. While the Venturi orchestra project offers much greater architectural potential, the old opera-house restoration is a much more innovative piece of urban planning. The unfortunate thing is that Philadelphia may have to choose between them.

HEADLINE: Purchasers' Economic Index Rises

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
After an 11-month decline, the nation's manufacturing economy expanded in April, stimulated by strong levels of new orders, particularly from foreign customers, the nation's purchasing managers reported yesterday.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said that its index of economic activity rose to 50.2 percent in April from 48.8 percent in March. The index is at its highest level since April 1989.
A reading below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector of the economy is in a decline, while a reading above 50 percent indicates an expansion. A reading below 44 percent indicates a decline in real gross national product. 
Analysts said that the figures suggested the economy was beginning to rebound following a lackluster fourth quarter. However, some cautioned that it was too soon to tell whether the expansion would be sustained through the rest of the year.
''This indicated that the economy is growing at a rate of about 2 percent in real gross national product,'' said Wayne C. Stevens, chief economist with Duff & Phelps Inc. ''To run above that level, you need a stimulus, like lower taxes or lower interest rates. It's too soon to tell whether the economy will continue to grow beyond that level.''
 
Report Is Hailed by Analysts
Still, many analysts hailed the purchasing managers' report as a harbinger of more robust economic growth for the remainder of the year. ''The figures are very positive, because they show that the economy is leaving the danger zone of recession and embarking on a path of moderate growth,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.
Mr. Kudlow added that the reports earlier this week on higher levels of new orders for machine tools offered further evidence that the economy was entering a period of expansion and that capital spending was increasing. ''These figures tell us that the United States economy is far more resilient than its critics have suggested,'' he said.
The purchasing managers' report is considered an important economic indicator because it is compiled from information supplied by managers from a range of industrial companies throughout the country.
The report showed that the index for new orders for export rose one percentage point, to its highest level since September of last year. It climbed to 60.5 percent in April from 59.5 percent in March.
The level of new orders generally increased in April, the report said, with the index for new orders rising to 55.5 percent in April from 50.4 percent in March. Analysts said that the increase in export orders contributed significantly to that increase.
At the same time, the level of imports remained essentially unchanged in April, with the import index holding at 50.5 percent. ''This apparent stabilization in growth of imports coupled with the increasing growth in exports bodes well for the continued decline in the United States trade deficit,'' the report said.
Production in April expanded, although at a slower pace than in March. The production index dropped to 53 percent in April from 54.4 percent in March, the report said. The report said that it was unlikely that production would decline in the rest of the second quarter because of the surge in new orders in April.
The purchasing managers also reported that prices increased in April. Their price index rose to 50.8 percent, from 48.2 percent in March. The managers surveyed said 17 commodities had risen in price, up from 11 in March. Those items included a number of metals - aluminum, copper, nickel and zinc - as well as several chemical products like methanol, Freon and polypropylene.
The employment index slipped slightly in April, to 45.1 percent, from 45.2 percent in March. Some members continued to report hiring temporary workers and working overtime to handle inreasing production activity, rather than hiring new employees.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Capital Squeeze: Guess Who Pays

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT has never been much fun at the bottom of the third world's economic pecking order, and for millions in Latin America, Africa and the backwaters of Asia, it is grimmer than ever. Cut off by private lenders in the 1980's, most poor countries have been forced to make ends meet without much help from the industrialized economies. The flow of capital actually reversed direction in the last decade, with rich countries reabsorbing $20 billion to $40 billion in resources each year from their impoverished neighbors.
For the relatively affluent debtors like Brazil and Mexico, the resulting squeeze on imports has increased social friction and delayed a likely leap into modernity. For many others it has meant a cut in living standards for people who were already obliged to make every calorie count. 
Since the mid-1980's liberal advocates have been pressing the case for a better deal for the debtors. Now there is a freshly issued report on the global dimensions of the capital scarcity problem, complete with an estimate of how much it would cost to jump-start growth in 40 low-income nations.
The analysis, which was sponsored by the United Nations' World Institute for Development Economics and written by Lance Taylor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is in one sense upbeat: A mere $40 billion in capital each year, just one-third of 1 percent of the affluent world's income, could raise annual growth rates in poor countries by more than one percentage point.
The catch, however, is that the $40 billion would almost certainly have to come from American savers, who do not seem to be in a particularly thrifty mood these days. What is more, it comes when competing demands for capital - for rebuilding Eastern Europe and for environmental cleanups, among other needs - are on the rise.
Most poor countries cushioned the oil shocks of the 1970's with money borrowed from Western banks. The world recession of the early 1980's savaged the markets for their raw-material exports, forcing them to borrow more merely to stay in place. And high interest rates, driven by America's newly whetted appetite for foreign capital, made it more difficult to service their foreign borrowings.
When the dust settled, most poor countries were hopelessly in debt, and capital from foreign banks had dried up. Indeed, the tight supply of funds to meet foreign obligations was made even tighter by domestic capital flight: The middle and upper classes of Latin America, no fools, had stashed as much as they could manage in banks from Miami to Milan.
This reversal of capital flows typically added up to about 5 percent of national income. But the impact on output, Mr. Taylor notes, was often two or three times as great because the ability to use existing economic capacity was sharply reduced by the scarcity of imports. Farmers in the Philippines, for example, might be forced to cut grain production by $1 million for want of imported fertilizer costing $100,000.
Separate econometric models, constructed for individual countries by the U.N. consultants, made it possible to measure the cost of the capital squeeze. Mr. Taylor then used the equations to calculate the amount of cash it would take to undo the damage.
A $40 billion annual fix, he estimates, would go a long way, unclogging a lot of bottlenecks, allowing a lot of capital already in place to operate more efficiently. Such a fix, one might think, would hardly be beyond the means of lending countries with combined incomes of some $12 trillion a year.
But as Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard and Warwick McKibbin of the Brookings Institution have argued, the macroeconomic effects of the transfer could wash out part of the benefits absent a corresponding cut in consumption or investment in developed countries. Without a little belt-tightening north of the Equator, interest rates might actually rise enough (or third world export prices fall enough) to send the debtors back to square one.
West Germany and Japan already do most of the savings for the industrialized nations, and they are not about to save more. And America, which now absorbs most of those savings to cover its trade deficit, does not seem inclined to change its profligate ways. Even if the rich countries chose to make the effort, it seems likely that any extra capital freed in the process would end up in, say, new auto plants in Budapest or in new flue-gas scrubbers for power plants in Illinois.
In the global economy, it has often been argued, no nation is an island: Poverty is everyone's problem because the fate of the winners is inextricably linked to the fate of the losers.
Maybe. But for the moment the rich nations are doing a pretty good job of ignoring the linkages.

Ex-Merrill Executive To Head Reuters Unit

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
Michael O. Sanderson, a former chief of Merrill Lynch-Canada, has been named president and chief executive of the Instinet Corporation, an electronic equities trading operation owned by Reuters Holdings P.L.C. of London.
Mr. Sanderson, 47, succeeds Robert H. Reid, 61, who has managed Instinet since 1988. Mr. Reid will remain as executive vice presdient, reporting to Mr. Sanderson, who in turn reports to John S. Hull, executive vice president of Reuters America Inc., Reuters provides news and financial information worldwide. 
The screen-to-screen trading system was purchased by Reuters in 1987 and became profitable for the first time in 1989. Under Mr. Reid, Reuters said, Instinet's annual shares-traded volume increased 78 percent, to 2.56 billion shares at the end of 1989 from 1.44 billion shares at the end of 1987.
''Electronic equity transactions continue to grow in the marketplace in North America and other equity centers around the world,'' Mr. Sanderson said. The company, which now trades in United States and British stocks, plans to expand in Europe and elsewhere, he added.
Mr. Sanderson plans to travel extensively from his New York base to sell the system. ''I plan to cover the world,'' he said, ''with a very extensive customer calling program.''
After graduating from Brown University, Mr. Sanderson did his graduate work in politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford. He joined Merrill Lynch in London as an investment executive in 1967.
After a series of moves and promotions, Mr. Sanderson went to Toronto in 1984 to become president and chief operating officer of Merrill Lynch-Canada. He was named chief executive two years later.

HEADLINE: Dow Surprises Some by Rising 12.16 Points

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices rose yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 12.16 points, to 2,668.92.
The gain came despite some expectation among traders that prices would fall after figures from the National Association of Purchasing Management showed that the manufacturing economy was expanding. That situation can be bad for the stock and bond markets because it suggests that interest rates may be increased to curb inflation. Bond prices did decline on the day. 
Volume on the Big Board, however, while relatively light because of a holiday in much of Western Europe, rose to 149 million shares, from 122.8 million Monday. Advances outnumbered declines by 820 to 679.
''The stock market's up despite the fact that bonds are down,'' said Hildegard Zagorski, market analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''Maybe there's some perception that interest rates have peaked.''
 
Index Up to 50.2%
Stock prices would normally decline in the wake of a report like yesterday's from the purchasing group. Its manufacturing index rose to 50.2 percent in April - enough to strengthen investor sentiment that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates soon to cool off the economy.
After the close, Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said he expected the nation's real interest rates to remain high.
''Stocks sold off for a while'' when the inflation figures came out, said Robert G. Freedman, chief portfolio manager for John Hancock Advisers. But then, he said, the market ''didn't pay any attention to the figures.''
''Maybe we're getting to the point where we can move up,'' he argued. ''But I don't see any tremendous rally.''
Expressing more a hope than a conviction, the John Hancock executive said, ''Maybe we can get to 2,700'' on the Dow, ''and if we get there, maybe we can get a little higher.''
 
Active Boeing Trading
The solid market standout, particularly among the blue chips, was Boeing, the Seattle-based aircraft company, which jumped 2 1/2, to 72 1/4, with 1.49 million shares changing hands. It was the Big Board's eighth-most-active stock.
The company said on Monday that because of an accounting change, its first-quarter profits fell by 34.2 percent, but that without the change, its profits would have jumped by 87 percent. The company also raised its dividend to 37.5 cents a share, from 30 cents and announced a 3-for-2 stock split. Analysts subsequently beefed up their recommendations of the stock.
In another strong move, Tosco, the oil company, plunged 5 1/4, to 17 1/4, after it said it had abandoned plans to sell the company or its refinery operations because of unsatifactory offers. The company, based in Santa Monica, Calif., also reported on Monday that it had lost $6.9 million in its first quarter, down from a loss of $8.03 million in the comparable period a year earlier. Tosco was the Big Board's third-most-active issue, with 2.4 million shares changing hands.
Chrysler rose 3/4, to 15 1/4, on 1.1 million shares, after reporting better-than-expected results for the first quarter. Many analysts forecast a loss, but Chrysler showed a profit of $71 million, against $351 million a year earlier.
 
American General Up
American General, the insurer, rose 1 1/8, to 40 1/8. Analysts voiced optimism that Torchmark, another insurer, could win a proxy vote scheduled for today to install its team and take over the Houston-based company. A Federal court in Nashville yesterday granted Torchmark a temporary order that prevents Tennessee insurance officials from blocking the battle.
MGM/UA, which Pathe Communications has agreed to buy for $20 a share, or $1.2 billion, fell 1 1/8, to 17 1/2, after it gave only vague details about the financing. It said on Monday that it had access to the last $450 million it needed, but gave scant information on how it would raise the money.
Unocal, the oil company, rose 7/8, to 29 1/8, in heavy trading, although it reported on Monday that its first-quarter profits fell by 11.5 percent. Richard J. Stegemeier, the chairman, told stockholders at the its annual meeting that he expected demand for natural gas - and prices - to rise steadily over the long term.
 
Slight Changes in Blue Chips
Most other blue-chip industrial stocks changed only slightly, except for I.B.M., which fell a point, to 108, in heavy trading; Texaco, which rose a point, to 58 5/8, and Procter & Gamble, which also rose a point, to 71 5/8.
The Dow transportation index advanced 6.93 points, to 1,136.91, with Airborne Freight up 1 5/8, to 42 3/8; UAL up 1 1/2, to 153 1/4, and Federal Express up a point, to 55 3/4.
Oracle, the computer company, topped the over-the-counter active list, falling 1 1/8, to 14 3/4, on 2.7 million shares. Hilton Hotels, an occasional takeover stock, rose 3 1/8, to 49 1/2, in strong trading.
Among the indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 1.45, to 332.25; the Nasdaq composite was up 1.78, to 421.85, and the Amex market-value gained 0.22, to 343.32.

HEADLINE: Fed Official On Inflation

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BOCA RATON, Fla., May 1

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve governor, John P. LaWare, said today that the nation's high inflation rate in the first quarter might have been an aberration.
''Food, energy and apparel had up-blips and shouldn't continue,'' Mr. LaWare said in an interview at a meeting here of the Bankers Association for Foreign Trade. ''The labor cost increase was a little worrisome.''
The Government previously reported that consumer prices rose five-tenths of a percent in March, which translated to an 8.5 percent gain in the first quarter.
Mr. LaWare said he hoped inflation would be almost unchanged in 1990, ''but the signals are mixed.'' Last year, consumer prices rose 4.6 percent, after a 4.4 percent gain in 1988.
A report by the Commerce Department showed that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter. ''I think we will see a continuation of slow, steady growth,'' Mr. LaWare said. ''I think this slow, steady growth is very healthy under the circumstances.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed in Light Day; Gold Prices Mostly Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed yesterday in light trading as many European markets were closed for the May Day holiday. Gold prices rose.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for May delivery settled at $370 a troy ounce, up $1.60 from late Monday. The Republic National Bank of New York also quoted a late bid for gold at $370 an ounce, up $1.30. 
The dollar gained after the release of the monthly index figure from the National Association of Purchasing Management, which indicated the United States industrial sector expanded slightly in April for the first time in 11 months.
News of an upturn in economic activity is good for the dollar since it makes it more likely that interest rates will rise. Higher interest rates make the dollar more valuable relative to other currencies.
 
Gains Given Up
But the dollar was not able to sustain its gains yesterday and soon gave them up, Bob Morrissey, a trader with the Bank of Boston, said.
Many European markets were closed for May Day, and trading in the United States was thin, he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 158.90 Japanese yen, from 159.08 yen on Friday. Japanese markets were closed Monday for a holiday. Later yesterday, in London, the dollar fell to 158.80 yen. In New York, the dollar bought 158.85 yen, down from 158.90 late Monday.
In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $1.6385 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6390 late Monday. In New York, the dollar lost ground, with the pound trading at $1.6445, more expensive than $1.6405 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday quotes, included: 1.6805 West German marks, up from 1.6795; 1.4555 Swiss francs, up from 1.4530; 5.6370 French francs, up from 5.6330; 1,231.75 Italian lire, up from 1,230.50, and 1.1646 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1644.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday rates, included: 1.6785 West German marks, down from 1.6787; 1.4562 Swiss francs, up from 1.4512; 5.6450 French francs, up from 5.6335; 1.8927 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8884; 1,232.50 Italian lire, up from 1,230.50, and 1.1645 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1649.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $368.50 a troy ounce, up from $367.75 bid late Monday. Zurich gold markets were closed for the holiday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.72 to close at a bid of $370.83 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Outlook for G.O.P.: Senate Gains in '90, A Showdown in '92

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
As Senate races shape up around the country, officials in both parties say Republicans are bucking the usual trend in midterm elections: they are in good position to pick up several seats this fall and narrow the gap with Democrats.
Some Republicans are even hoping and some Democrats are worrying that Republicans have a chance to retake the Senate, where Democrats hold 55 seats to the Republicans' 45. But most analysts predict a gain of two or three seats by Republicans this year, with the showdown for control coming in 1992.
''It is possible we can get a majority of Republicans back in the Senate this year,'' Vice President Dan Quayle told a group of Republican state chairmen the other day. ''The Democrats are talking about holding down their losses. If we don't get a majority, perhaps we can get a 50-50 split. And I wouldn't mind spending the next two years of my life casting every tie-breaking vote for President Bush.'' 
Less partisan analysts predict less sweeping, but still important, changes. Two well-known monitors of Congressional races, Charles E. Cook Jr. and Stewart Rothenberg, each of whom edits a political newsletter, both predict Republican gains in the Senate of one to four seats, in large part because of the party's unusually successful recruiting of strong candidates.
Such gains could have an important impact on the Senate, where Senator George J. Mitchell, the Democratic leader, already has to operate with a margin that is less than overwhelming.
The most vulnerable Democratic Senators, politicians generally believe, are Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Paul Simon of Illinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jim Exon of Nebraska.
 
White House Looks to Hawaii
In addition, the death of Spark M. Matsunaga, Democratic Senator from Hawaii, last month has created another opportunity for Republicans. One of the state's most popular Republicans, Representative Patricia Saiki of Honolulu, is expected to run for the seat this fall and is given a good chance, despite the state's Democratic leanings. Representative Daniel K. Akaka has been named the interim Senator and is expected to be the party's candidate this fall to serve the full four years remaining in Mr. Matsunaga's term.
To emphasize the importance the Republican Party places on the push for the Senate, President Bush invited Ms. Saiki to the White House this afternoon, urged her to run and promised to help.
Democrats concede that they are on the defensive and that their goal now is simply to hold their current majority. They insist there are several states where Republicans are vulnerable, although independent analysts say that so far none seems as threatened as the Democrats.
The three Republicans most often cited as vulnerable are Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Larry Pressler of South Dakota. The Democrats, still locked in primary fights, have yet to pick their candidates in Kentucky and North Carolina.
 
Attention on North Carolina
But national attention is already focusing on North Carolina. Well-known artists, including Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschenberg, have contributed to a Democratic contender, Michael Easley, a county district attorney, hoping he will be the best challenger to Mr. Helms, who has sponsored legislation to bar Federal support for works deemed to be obscene.
In South Dakota, Ted Muenster is challenging Mr. Pressler, who is best known in Washington for voting against President Bush more than any other Republican senator. Democrats say that in a year when an anti-Washington mood is rife, Mr. Muenster, a businessman and an aide to a former governor, is an ideal candidate.
No great national issue has caused the Democratic vulnerability. President Bush's popularity is of some modest help to Republican candidates, politicians say, and the improved farm economy is making it easier for Republicans in places like Iowa and Illinois, two of this year's battlegrounds.
But many of this year's main topics - abortion, the environment and the peace dividend - tend to give an advantage to Democrats.
 
Good Recruiting by Republicans
Instead of using issues, the Republicans have achieved their advantage this year largely through a mundane but crucial bit of politics: They have done a better job of recruiting Republican candidates to challenge Democratic incumbents than the Democrats have done at finding candidates to challenge Republican incumbents.
''We've probably had our best recruiting season ever for these midterm elections,'' said Wendy deMocker, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which raises money for and provides services and advice to Republican Senate candidates.
Republican Party officials persuaded eight members of the House to give up their seats and run for the Senate. Democrats see an irony in this: the Republican failure to dislodge Democrats from control of the House has left many Republican members so frustrated that they are willing to walk away from a safe House seat for a shot at a Senate seat.
''Republican members of the House do not have a lot to lose by running for the U.S. Senate,'' said Anita Dunn, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''They have no power in the House and no future. If they actually felt Republicans would regain control any time in their lifetime it would have been worth staying.''
Moreover, with a Republican Administration, Ms. Dunn said, Republicans can be confident that the White House will find them a job if they lose.
 
Abortion Rights Republicans
In Iowa, Illinois and Rhode Island, Republican members of the House are challenging incumbent Democratic Senators. In Michigan, Representative Bill Schuette is favored to win the Republican nomination to challenge Senator Levin. In Colorado and Idaho Republican House members are running for seats left vacant by the retirement of Republican Senators, increasing the party's chances of holding those seats.
One important change has occurred in the type of candidate recruited by the Republicans - women who support legal abortion. This description applies to Ms. Saiki in Hawaii and to the Republican candidates for the Senate in Rhode Island, Representative Claudine Schneider, and in Illinois, Representative Lynn Martin.
By contrast not a single Democrat in the House is seeking a Senate seat this year. In both Indiana and Oregon, members of the House delegations, including Representatives Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana and Ron Wyden of Oregon, resisted pleas from their party that they challenge the Republican Senators, Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon and Daniel R. Coats of Indiana.
''Democratic congressman were in a position where they felt they had established some strength in the House,'' said Ms. Dunn. ''They did not feel like leaving that for a risky Senate race.''
A number of prominent Democrats outside the House also declined entreaties to seek Senate seats. Former Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia declined to challenge Senator John W. Warner and former Vice President Walter Mondale turned down requests that he challenge Minnesota Senator Rudy Boschwitz.
So even though there are actually more Republican-held seats up for election this year, 18 as against 16 Democratic-held seats, more Democrats than Republicans face tough races.
Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, said that Republicans may be overrating the value of recruiting so many House members. ''In a period when I detect a lot of anti-Washington sentiment, I don't think it's a help being from Washington. They can't make a good case in this atmopshere that it's time to get new blood in Washington. They're just getting new blood from the other side of the dome.''
So while his contenders are not as well known as some Republican candidates, Mr. Breaux said, they are in better position to wage an outsider-style campaign.
There has been a virtually ironclad rule that the President's party loses ground in the House in midterm elections. It has been broken only once since the Civil War, in the Depression year of 1934. In the smaller electoral world of the Senate, the pattern is not as predictable. But on average, said Ms. deMocker of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, the party in control of the White House has lost 3.7 Senate seats in midterm elections.

HEADLINE: U.S. SEEKS TO EASE TECHNOLOGY SALES IN EASTERN EUROPE

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today proposed a relaxation of restrictions on the export of advanced technological products to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, including computers, precision machine tools and telecommunications equipment.
As cold war tensions ease, America's allies have sought more liberal trading rules, and the business community has expressed concern that what it considers excessive control of exports is denying markets to the United States. The change was opposed by conservatives in the Pentagon.
The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the idea was to ''build higher fences around fewer goods.'' 
 
Seeking Allies' Approval
The proposals, which have been considered by an interagency group since early this year, are to be submitted in Paris on June 7-8 to a high-level meeting of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, an adjunct of NATO formed 41 years ago to keep militarily sensitive technology out of Soviet hands. Debate is expected over whether the Administration plan goes far enough.
While the reaction from American business was generally favorable, many executives said the moves, which could expand exports by hundreds of millions of dollars, were inadequate. Similar views were expressed in Congress.
Some Congressional aides saw more than just a coincidence in the fact that today's announcement came just a day before the House Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to draft legislation that would mandate even greater liberalization of export controls than the Administration now contemplates.
''The proposal is better than what we've seen before, but falls short in areas critical to the United States,'' said Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connnecticut, who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade, which is initiating that legislation.
Under the Administration proposal, restrictions would be eliminated on 30 of the 120 categories of products now on the export-control list and there would be a partial lifting of the controls in 13 categories.
The plan would treat exports destined for Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union differently.
Virtually all personal computers used in office automation, word processing and light industry would be decontrolled. In addition, computers used in banking, travel reservations and publishing would get favoravble consideration for export to four Eastern European countries that have begun moves toward democratic reform: East Germany, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
The European allies of the United States are expected to push for even more liberalization. As Germany nears unification, some Europen officials see Cocom as an anomaly. Cocom has 17 member nations - all the countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization except for Iceland, plus Japan and Australia.
No one has been more outspoken about the export restrictions than the Foreign Minister of West Germany, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who said in a speech last week, ''The Cocom wall through Europe must be dismantled.''
A spokesman for the West German Embassy here, Hans-Henning Horstmann, declined to speculate on whether the June talks might be heated, confining his reaction to saying, ''We welcome every step that facilitates the transfer of technology to Eastern and Central Europe.''
On the other hand, there are American conservatives both in and out of Congress who want the restrictions kept. They said they were distressed that the move to make advanced technology available to the Soviet Union has come at a time of tensions over Lithuanian independence.
The Center for Security Policy, a Washington-based policy research institute, expressed its ''disbelief'' that the Administration had ''rewarded Moscow for its economic crackdown'' on Lithuania.
The institute said this was the second such move recently. Last week the Administration announced that it was near concluding a trade agreeement with Moscow that would lead to sharply lower American tariffs on imports from the Soviet Union.
 
The Administration's View
Mr. Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the timing was related to ''the status of events in Eastern Europe, the changes we see in the Soviet Union, the changes in Allied attitudes towards sales, changes in our assessment done by the Defense Department and others.''
''Timing is dictated by the process itself and its impact,'' he said.
Although Defense Secretary Dick Cheney went along with the proposal, officials said that strong opposition had come from the Pentagon's Defense Technology Security Administration, which plays a major role in export-license approvals.
Asked about these divisions today, Mr. Fitzwater said the Defense Department had done the basic analysis and had joined other security agencies in a ''unanimous'' recommendation to the President. Officials said the deliberations were the most exhaustive and comprehensive export-control review ever.
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher termed it a ''quantum leap'' from earlier positions. He said in an interview that the United States would now be having ''informal discussions'' with Cocom allies to try to establish as much common ground as possible before the June meeting in Paris.
At a Cocom meeting in February, the United States found itself isolated. Anticipating tough negotiations in June, Mr. Mosbacher acknowledged that there ''may be some flexibility, depending on the area.''
 
Raising the Limits on Computers
In technical terms, the plan calls for complete decontrol of computers that can process up to 275 megabits of data a second. That processing rate is about four times the current limit on computers allowed to be exported to restricted countries. One megabit is a million bits.
On computers for civilian uses, the limit would be extended to the so-called China Green Line - a processing rate of 550 megabits a second, the current limit on computers that are shipped to China.
For machine tools the changes would result in decontrol of many tools with a positioning accuracy of plus or minus two or three microns. This would still bar exports of the kind of milling equipment that the Toshiba Machine Corporation of Japan and Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk of Norway sold illegally to the Soviet Union in the 1980's. That equipment could be used to make advanced submarine propellers, and the discovery of the sales caused a furor in Washington in 1987.
In telecommunications, the United States proposed relaxation of some cellular communications systems and some satellite ground stations. For Eastern European destinations, there would be greater access to fiber-optic equipment and some microwave telecommunications systems. But access to the more advanced technology would be dependent on adoption of safeguards against diversion to the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Former Official Says Bush Aides Swayed $500,000 H.U.D. Grant

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
A former senior Federal housing official testified today that staff aides to Vice President George Bush intervened with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to win a $500,000 grant for a Kansas City developer in 1985.
The witness, DuBois L. Gilliam, told a House panel that he was directed to arrange the grant for the developer, Hector Barreto, the founder of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and a longtime supporter of Mr. Bush, even though the project did not qualify for Federal assistance.
Mr. Gilliam did not suggest that Mr. Bush had personally ordered the grant, and White House aides said today that they had no knowledge about the project, a study of the feasibility of an international trade center in Kansas City. ''I never heard of Hector Barreto,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the chief White House spokesman. 
But Mr. Barreto said at a news conference this afternoon that he had lobbied Mr. Bush and former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. on behalf of the project.
None of the actions mentioned in the testimony today would amount to a crime by Vice President Bush or his staff. But the testimony was further indication of a pattern of widespread political favoritism at the housing department during Ronald Reagan's Administration. The testimony also offered the clearest example to date of how Mr. Bush's name may have been invoked in the distribution of politically desirable H.U.D. awards.
Mr. Gilliam, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Housing who is now serving an 18-month prison sentence resulting from his actions at the housing agency, has emerged as a central witness in the year-old Congressional investigation of favoritism and corruption at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Gilliam, appearing under a grant of immunity from further prosecution, said the Kansas City project did not quality for Federal assistance, and that the grant was eventually approved as part of an unusual arrangement with officials in Kansas City.
Under the arrangement, Kansas City paid for the study out of the city's Community Development Block Grant funds, which are provided by H.U.D. In turn, Mr. Gilliam arranged a $500,000 special grant for Kansas City from one of Mr. Pierce's discretionary funds. ''In other words, let's make a deal -you do this and I'll do this,'' Mr. Gilliam said.
James I. Threatt, a Kansas City official, confirmed Mr. Gilliam's account in an interview today, saying he was told by Mr. Gilliam at the time that ''Vice President Bush's office was interested in having this project funded.'' The trade center is under development. At his news conference, in Kansas City, Mr. Barreto, a trade consultant who was a member of President Reagan's 1980 White House transition team, said he recalled discussing the project with Mr. Bush at two or three meetings in the mid-1980's.
''I mentioned that we were very actively'' pursuing the grant, he said of his conversations with the Vice President. Mr. Barreto said one of the conversations occurred during a ''very private meeting'' with Mr. Bush on Sept. 21, 1985, at a gathering in Puerto Rico of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
News reports show the $500,000 grant was announced in Kansas City in early October 1985.
In his appearance before the House Government Operations Subcommittee on Employment and Housing, Mr. Gilliam did not identify which aides to Mr. Bush may have contacted the housing department on behalf of the project. He said the White House discussed the grant with Deborah Gore Dean, Mr. Pierce's executive assistant, and that Ms. Dean had relayed the information to him.
 
He Tells of Call From Dean
''I received a call from Deborah Dean,'' Mr. Gilliam recalled. ''Deborah Dean said she had been over visiting with the Vice President and she indicated that she had received a call from the Vice President's staff asking about the grant and indicating their desire to try to help to get this project funded.''
Earlier that same day, Mr. Gilliam said, he had been visited at his H.U.D. office by Mr. Barreto.
At that meeting, ''I shared with Mr. Barreto that we could not fund'' the Kansas City project because it did not qualify under the department's technical assistance program, Mr. Gilliam said, adding: ''He then indicated to me that he was going to go to the Vice President's office to visit with him and his staff people. He then left my office in that direction.''
Ms. Dean has refused to talk with reporters in recent months. A lawyer for Ms. Dean, Charles Leeper, would not comment on today's testimony.
Despite his criminal record and his acknowledgement this week that he received more than $100,000 in illegal payoffs while at H.U.D., lawmakers have presented Mr. Gilliam as someone whose testimony could be believed even though he has engaged in illegal conduct. Much of his information, they say, has been corroborated through documents and other witnesses.
 
'Admitted Cheat and Liar'
A statement issued by Mr. Pierce's lawyers said, ''Mr. Pierce denies all allegations of wrongdoing and improper conduct. It is inconceivable that the subcommittee has accepted at face value the unsubstantiated testimony of an admitted cheat and liar who repeatedly violated the public's trust while at H.U.D.''
''By granting him immunity,'' the statement said, ''this subcommittee has provided Gilliam with a free ride, virtually assuring that Gilliam will never spend another day in prison for these multiple criminal acts. Under the circumstances, it is impossible to imagine how this subcommittee can vouch for Mr. Gilliam's credibility.''
In his testimony, Mr. Gilliam said he resigned from H.U.D. in 1987 after an internal investigation had turned up evidence of the illegal payoffs he now acknowledges that he received from H.U.D. contractors. Mr. Gilliam said he met with Mr. Pierce, who was aware of the inquiry.
''He thought it would be best for me to go ahead and leave,'' Mr. Gilliam testified. ''And I told him I would leave, but I'd need some help from him. He told me he would help me in any way he could.''
Working through Ms. Dean, Mr. Gilliam said, he obtained a promise from Mr. Pierce of housing grants that could have been worth more than $2 million.
The grants, he said, were to be in the form of rent subsidies for the rehabilitation of 250 low-income apartments. Mr. Gilliam left H.U.D. to become a housing consultant and, under the arrangement described at today's hearing, he could have sold rights to the subsidies to developers or other housing consultants.
Mr. Gilliam said he originally asked for H.U.D. subsidies for 400 apartments. ''Deborah went and spoke to the Secretary,'' he said. ''She came back and told me I had 250 units. I couldn't have the 400 units because I was being greedy.''
''She indicated to me that Secretary Pierce thought I was being a little greedy,'' Mr. Gilliam added.
Representative Tom Lantos, the chairman of the House subcommittee, described the arrangement as ''a multimillion-dollar severance package,'' a ''golden parachute'' offered by Mr. Pierce to a corrupt aide.
''That's a fair statement,'' Mr. Gilliam replied.

HEADLINE: Burmese Rights Abuses Are Said to Continue

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Amnesty International has charged in a report that ''severe human rights violations'' have continued to be frequent in Myanmar, formerly Burma, under the current military Government.
The report, made public Tuesday, was criticized yesterday by a Burmese diplomat in Washington as containing untrue allegations. Parliamentary elections are to be held in Myanmar on May 27. 
The report said these rights violations had kept on occurring ''at a very high level'' in Myanmar since September 1988, when its Armed Forces Chief of Staff, Gen. Saw Maung, led a military coup that ended the 26-year rule of the Burma Socialist Program Party of Gen. Ne Win.
The report said that months of pro-democracy demonstrations and ''the deaths of thousands of mostly peaceful demonstrators as a result of shootings by the army'' preceded the coup.
The study said that ''recent testimonies obtained by Amnesty International'' described the rights abuses under the current government and said they have included ''mass arrests of prisoners of conscience and possible prisoners of conscience, widespread torture, summary trials, and extrajudicial executions.''
Asked to comment, Soe Win, a first secretary in the Burmese Embassy in Washington, said yesterday that he had not read the report, but that ''these allegations are not true.''
''The torture of detainees, inhuman and cruel treatment of prisoners, etc., are unknown to us, except when we were under foreign domination,'' he said, referring to colonial rule by Britain, which ended in 1948.
Mr. Soe Win, who said he was not related to Mr. Ne Win, said more detailed comment would be forthcoming later.
The Amnesty International report said that the testimony it had obtained ''indicates that real or imputed critics of Myanmar's military Government run a high risk of being imprisoned, interrogated, and tortured for the peaceful expression of their politial views,'' although it noted that the Government had ''pledged political and economic reforms that appeared to go some way toward meeting the demands of pro-democracy protesters.''
The study also said, ''Evidence based on interviews conducted in November and December 1989 by Amnesty International from recently released political prisoners and refugees who have fled the country suggests not only that torture and unlawful killings of civilians in ethnic minority areas continue to be widespread, but that torture of political suspects occurs in other parts of the country.''

HEADLINE: World's Legislators Urge 'Marshall Plan' For the Environment

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Legislators from 42 countries called today for a ''global Marshall plan'' under which industrial nations would help less developed countries grow economically while still protecting the environment.
The three-day conference, presided over by Senator Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, ended here today. It did not specify how much such an effort might cost, but urged the richer countries to help finance environmentally benign growth in the third world.
Delegates agreed to immediately begin steps to reduce the air pollution that many scientists believe triggers the process of global warming.
The legislators who took part are not empowered to set policy for their Governments. Many of them said they would bring the proposals adopted by the meeting to their Parliaments and seek legislation.
 
Some Specific Proposals
These were among the specific proposals for legislative action:
* Setting a worldwide target of reducing by half over the next 20 years the emission of industrial gases that are building up in the atmosphere.
* Establishing national goals of achieving economic growth in ways that can be sustained without long-term damage to the world and national environments. The conference called for the creation of a ''green common market'' and proposed ''a bank for sustainable development'' to help finance growth in the third world without harming the environment.
* Instituting a world strategy that links population growth with poverty and environmental degradation, and seeks to stabilize global population, now just over 5 billion, at 10 billion people.
* Creating an ''international convention for the protection of all the world's forests,'' in both temperate and tropical regions.

HEADLINE: All Forgiven, Jamaican Will See Bush Today

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINGSTON, Jamaica, April 28

 BODY:
When he visits the White House on Thursday, Prime Minister Michael N. Manley will be welcomed as a friend of Vice President Dan Quayle and a partner of the Bush Administration.
Such a visit by a Caribbean leader would be fairly unremarkable were it not for Mr. Manley's not-so-distant past as a sometimes strident advocate of socialism in the third world.
But in a turnabout that anticipated the move toward capitalism in Eastern Europe, Mr. Manley was reborn before the elections that returned him to power early last year as an advocate of free markets, privatization, global economic integration and competition.
''It was just a matter of time before these highly bureaucratic and centralized states yielded to more democratic processes,'' Mr. Manley said of Eastern Europe's political changes. ''I cannot claim to be surprised.'' 
When in office during most of the 1970's, Mr. Manley was more often perceived as a thorn in Washington's side than as a partner. After a visit to Cuba, he declared that he would accompany Fidel Castro ''to the mountaintop.''
The Reagan Administration openly rejoiced at Mr. Manley's defeat in 1980 at the hands of Edward P. G. Seaga, a conservative whose friendship with Washington was cemented when he strongly supported the United States invasion of Grenada in 1983.
Returned to office by an electorate disillusioned with growing economic hardship, Mr. Manley has courted the United States, conscious that from tourists to investments in the bauxite industry his large neighbor's attitude toward his Government can profoundly affect the economic climate here.
One of Mr. Manley's first gestures was to insure cooperation with the United States anti-drug efforts.
''This time he started out by making all the right noises,'' said a Western diplomat in Kingston, who suggested that for a canny politician like Mr. Manley more than the right noises were needed to soothe some doubters.
But after observing the leader since his return tp power, even skeptics with sour memories of Mr. Manley's policies of two decades ago have come to agree that the change is real, the diplomat said.
Wycliffe Bennett, a Jamaica scholar who headed the National Broadcasting Services under both the Manley and Seaga Governments, said, ''Manley is now rather centrist, I would say.''
The actions that have persuaded doubters include raising interest rates, ending subsidies for some basic commodities and devaluing the Jamaican dollar. These and other austerity measures were included in an agreement the Government recently signed with the International Monetary Fund.
Despite such unpopular measures, the People's National Party of Mr. Manley defeated Mr. Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party in local elections in March, a testament to his enduring support among the country's poor.
Mr. Manley has replaced many of the social programs and promises of the past with a call to hard work. ''There are economic problems and they are deep,'' he now warns, adding that the country's salvation will come about only through ''a great national effort.''
But Mr. Manley emphasized in an interview in his airy colonial-style offices that he was not merely seeking to placate an outside neighbor but hoping to initiate an era of more meaningful cooperation between the two countries and with others in the Caribbean Basin. ''I'm hoping to use my visit to strengthen the impression in Washington of the huge problems facing the developing world,'' he said, placing particular emphasis on the imposing sums owed to Western governments and multinational financal institutions like the World Bank and the I.M.F.
Still championing third-world development, Mr. Manley says he also hopes to impress upon the White House a concern that haunts many developing countries: that the dissolution of political blocs in Europe will lead the West to completely forget them.
''It is a shortsighted error of the greatest magnitude and it is amoral to support the development of Eastern Europe at the expense of places like the Caribbean, where many of us have long been in the trenches of democracy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Europe Seeking Greater Unity by '93

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 2

 BODY:
With plans to create a single trading market already well advanced, the 12 nations of the European Community have set themselves the task of achieving still greater economic and political unity by Jan. 1, 1993.
Yet as they move toward such vague goals as ''economic and monetary union'' and ''political union,'' mobilized this time by the revolution sweeping Eastern Europe, the 12 are facing mounting difficulties in defining just what they mean.
Their long-term objective remains unchanged: to create an economic and political unit that will enable Western Europe to compete for influence on the world stage with the United States, Japan and Soviet Union.
But in the coming year they must decide how this is to be achieved and, more specifically, how much additional national sovereignty must be surrendered to the community's various supranational bodies. And on this, they are still far from agreement. 
 
Conflicting Views
The British Government is strongly opposed to giving any extra power to what it refers to scornfully as the ''bureaucrats'' at the community headquarters in Brussels, while even advocates of regional unity, like France and West Germany, hold conflicting views on how power should be redistributed.
Further, despite the acceleration in the process of integration over the last five years, no government believes that the proposed changes will bring the community much closer to becoming a federation of European states, with a single president, government and parliament.
Nonetheless, moves toward greater economic and political unity, which began when six countries signed the Treaty of Rome establishing a common market in 1957, were given significant new momentum by community leaders at a special summit in Dublin last Saturday.
Overriding British objections, they endorsed a plan to achieve ''economic and monetary union,'' which could include creation of a common currency and regional central bank, and ''political union,'' which remains a nebulous concept, by the time the single market goes into effect in 1993.
 
Conferences in December
To make the necessary changes in the Treaty of Rome, all but Britain also favor the idea of holding parallel inter-governmental conferences dealing with each aspect of integration. To allow time for national parliaments to consider the measures, the conferences should open in December this year.
One reason for confusion about the community's aims stems from the fact that the new drive toward European union has been inspired not by a new surge of regional solidarity but by fear of the impact of the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the rush towards German unification.
France in particular argued for speeding the community's integration as a way of tying a united Germany to the West and of strengthening European stability at a time of uncertainty throughout the Continent. And Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and, eventually, West Germany agreed.
While East Germany will automatically join the community when it is absorbed by West Germany, other Eastern European countries will be offered loose association agreements rather than membership. In the language of European experts, the decision was to ''deepen'' rather than ''widen'' the community.
 
Deadline of Jan. 1, 1993
As a result, the Dublin meeting ruled that economic and monetary union, which had been expected to go into effect in the mid-1990's, should be achieved by Jan. 1, 1993. And political union, originally planned as a follow-up to economic and monetary union, was provisionally given the same deadline.
Community leaders felt emboldened to take on this new challenge by progress toward a single market. For example, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who remains deeply suspicious of such notions as political union, supports the single market as a way of freeing businesses and banks from the shackles of government intervention.
Even this, though, has involved a steady erosion of national sovereignties. Almost weekly, the community issues ''directives'' that affect everything from subsidies to state enterprises to company merger policies. These are routinely approved by national parliaments, including Britain's Intended to permit the free movement of people, goods, services and capital, the single market will also bring the removal of internal borders within the 12-nation region. And here, the community has to work out rules to control terrorists, drug traffickers, illegal migrants and refugees.
 
Agreement Could Be Elusive
Agreement on future stages of integration, though, may prove more elusive. A commission headed by Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, has defined economic and monetary union as harmonizing policies through creation of a regional central bank and a common currency. Its report has been endorsed by all governments except Britain.
It anticipates that the European currency unit, or ECU, which already exists as a reference mark, would become legal tender throughout the community. The central bank, or Eurofed, would be independent, although its power to impose policies on individual governments is still subject to debate.
But Britain, which has so far refused to tie the pound to other community currencies, has made it clear that it is unwilling to transfer decisions on interest rates, exchange rates and even gov ernment spending to any regional body. And it hopes to block the required community consensus for such radical changes.
It is already clear that ''political union'' will not mean a single European government. Rather, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers will assume some powers currently exercised by national governments and parliaments. The central question, then, is what powers should go to which bodies.
The 12 Foreign Ministers are to prepare a report on different concepts of political unity for the next community summit in Dublin on June 25 and 26. The leaders are then expected to formalize their call for an intergovernmental conference on the subject this December.

HEADLINE: Timid, and Destructive, in Albany

 BODY:
In a year rich with examples of poor judgment in Albany, for New York's political leaders to agree on a patchwork of nuisance taxes offers the most disappointing and dangerous news yet.
There's no question about the need for more tax revenue. The state faces a deficit that could reach $4 billion. But Gov. Mario Cuomo and legislative leaders could not bring themselves to raise money the right way, from a broad-based tax. Instead they have concocted a package that extends the state sales tax to a spectrum of goods and services. They don't seem to understand the message that conveys to the business community, already antsy: Leave town. 
The tentative agreement, part of a $1 billion tax plan, extends the 4 percent sales tax to all manner of new targets - magazines, 900 telephone numbers, custom-designed computer software, public relations services. Imposing sales taxes on the service industry is particularly troubling, because that's the healthiest, fastest-growing segment of the state's generally flagging economy.
New York already imposes sales taxes on nearly every consumer item except food. With the new tax on services, little short of a handshake will go untaxed.
Also troubling is that even now, with the budget already a month late and the deficit mounting, Senate Republicans are playing politics. Led by Ralph Marino of Long Island, the majority leader, they're resisting efforts by Mr. Cuomo and the Assembly Democrats to distribute school aid equitably and reasonably. They're pushing for inflated school spending, especially in wealthy suburban districts.
The tax package is even more of an offense against sensible government because the state has reasonable options. One is a corporate surcharge higher than already planned, which would be temporary and affect all businesses, not just the service industry. Another option is a higher gasoline tax. New York's 8-cent-a-gallon tax is among the lowest in the country. For one day Mr. Cuomo floated the idea of an increase, then quickly retreated when it drew opposition. Nobody else has gone even that far.
Politicians don't like to make unpopular decisions - particularly in an election year. This year, that timidity will hurt the constituents they're trying to placate, by damaging the state's fragile economy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Can Only Suffer From Failure to Join 1992 Fair in Seville

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report that Congress has ''approved only $2.9 million of the $15 million seed money needed for the United States to officially guarantee its attendance'' at Expo 92, the Seville World's Fair (news article, April 17).
However, Congress has not appropriated any money for United States participation in the Seville World's Fair. Since President Reagan committed the United States to participate in the fair, and President Bush endorsed that commitment, the United States Information Agency (the Federal agency that oversees American participation in world's fairs overseas) has been working to persuade the Senate and House Appropriations subcommittees to come up with $15 million in Federal funds to match the $15 million the U.S.I.A. expects to raise from states and corporations. 
In a Feb. 5 news article, you reported Representative Neal Smith, chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommitte as saying: ''I doubt there will be any Federal Government money. We shouldn't put world's fairs as a higher priority than housing for State Department personnel or broadcasting for the Voice of America.''
Representative Smith obviously believes that Expo 92 is just another fair and not the proper subject of Government expenditure. But more than 100 nations are attending, including all other North Atlantic Treaty Organization members, and virtually every Western Hemisphere nation. Puerto Rico will spend more than our Government is asked to spend! France, Britain, Germany, Japan and Italy are each spending more than triple the United States budget. As I understand it, without Congressional approval of $2.9 million for the Seville Expo, our participation in the fair may be a dead issue by May, as architectural, engineering and design deadlines remain unmet.
While the United States stands back and lets Western Europe prospectively bear the main financial burden of rebuilding Eastern Europe, the failure of the United States to be present at Seville during the most important world's fair ever held, coinciding with the integration of the European Economic Community and the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage, could raise in Europe's mind the specter of a new isolationism. At the very least the world will wonder about America's behavior.
Perhaps deciding in 1990 to spend money on a fair that will take place in 1992 seems frivolous. Worrying about the United States image in Europe and Latin America may not seem compelling at this date, but I predict that when the fair opens April 20, 1992, were the United States not to be present, our absence will have great repercussions.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Six, the Magic Number

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
In the unlikely but not impossible event that the Democrats lose control of the Senate this year, they'd do well if they gave up only five seats, no more, no less. That would result in a party tie at 50-50, and give the Republicans control only by virtue of Vice President Quayle's tie-breaking vote.
For the next two years, in that case, Mr. Quayle would have to decide personally and visibly all the numerous divisive issues on which neither party could muster 51 votes. He must be kidding if he says he wouldn't mind. 
It isn't likely to happen and the Republicans aren't likely to get control of the Senate in that or any way -though their chances are a lot better than the Democrats' 10-seat edge might suggest. Republicans need to win at least six Democratic seats, while losing none of their own, to produce a 51-to-49 majority.
If that happened, those six seats changing hands probably would come from among the following:
* Illinois: Senator Paul Simon, a liberal and an unsuccessful Democratic Presidential candidate in 1988, is being sharply challenged by Representative Lynn Martin, for whom both George and Barbara Bush already have campaigned.
* Iowa: Senator Tom Harkin, a Democratic freshman in a state where no Democratic senator ever has won re-election, faces Representative Tom Tauke, who - Republicans say - has raised $2.1 million from more than 20,000 contributors.
* Michigan: Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat, won by only about 52 percent of the vote in 1978 and 1984 in a state that's been losing Democratic strength. The Republicans will pick a candidate, probably Representative Bill Schuette, in a September primary.
* Rhode Island: Claiborne Pell, a Democrat and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been around a long time. Democrats note that both he and his popular opponent, Representative Claudine Schneider, are pro-choice and equally liberal -''so why replace Pell with Schneider?''
* Montana: Two years ago, Senator John Melcher, a Democrat, was beaten, as were all incumbents in statewide races. This year, Senator Max Baucus, another Democrat, faces a primary and Republicans think him vulnerable; but four Republican contenders have entered a possibly divisive primary of their own.
* Nebraska: Republicans believe that Representative Hal Daub can beat Senator Jim Exon, a conservative Democrat, because the Senator got only 52 percent of the vote in 1984. But that was 24 points more than Walter Mondale, the Democratic Presidential nominee.
* Hawaii: After Spark Matsunaga's death, Gov. John Waihee, a Democrat, appointed Representative Daniel Akaka, also Democratic, to fill the seat. Republicans think they can win a special election this fall, even in a Democratic state, if they can persuade Representative Patricia Saiki to run; and she doesn't seem reluctant.
Even Republicans concede that winning six, much less all of these seven seats, would be remarkable; Democratic sources scoff at the idea, though conceding that all these races are close. Democrats claim also to be ''competitive'' in Kentucky, where the Republican freshman, Mitch McConnell, won by fewer than 6,000 votes in 1984. Harvey Sloane, the former Mayor of Louisville, is the probable Democratic nominee.
Three G.O.P. Senators (Humphrey of New Hampshire, Armstrong of Colorado and McClure of Idaho) are retiring, but Republican officials see ''no contest'' for their seats. Democrats contend they have decent chances in Colorado and New Hampshire (which they consider a strong pro-choice state) and even hope to win Mr. Quayle's old seat in Indiana.
That supposedly Republican state has a Democratic Governor and seven Democratic representatives (out of ten), including Jill Long. Last year she won the House seat from which Mr. Quayle and his appointed successor, Dan Coats, moved up to the Senate; Democrats cautiously hope State Representative Baron Hill, a former basketball star, can beat Mr. Coats.
Republicans are squirming and Democrats chuckling - for now - at the special case of Louisiana. The seat of Senator Bennett Johnston, a Democrat, is at stake and the Republicans want State Senator Ben Bagert for his opponent. They may be embarrassed with David Duke instead; the former Ku Klux Klansman is running in Louisiana's nonpartisan primary as a self-anointed Republican and might well win the right to face the Senator in a runoff.
Neither party would laugh about that. To avoid a runoff, Mr. Johnston needs to win over 50 percent in the primary - a tall order in a state with the nation's highest unemployment.

HEADLINE: Hartford Shifts Revenue in Move to Adopt Budget

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 2

 BODY:
The General Assembly today moved toward adoption of a $7.05 billion budget that would solve the state's financial problems for the next year by using a series of short-term infusions of tax revenue, postponed payments to the state pension plan and shifts in budget accounting.
The proposal, part of which was approved on Tuesday night by the House of Representatives, avoids what lawmakers had dreaded: a tax increase or layoffs of state workers in an election year. It also allows budget increases for some of the most pressing needs like Medicaid payments, state employee health insurance and staffing for prisons.
But the route used by the Assembly in getting to that point has troubled lawmakers in both parties. For example, the budget would take $102 million from the state's rainy-day reserve fund to help erase the $246 million deficit projected for the fiscal year that ends on June 30. That leaves the reserve fund almost empty. 
The proposal would also push an additional $90 million in one-time accelerated payments from mostly corporate and inheritance taxes into the budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1; that money then could not be used next year. A $76 million quarterly payment to the state's pension plan, which is to be skipped next year, will also likely have to be made up in the following budget.
 
Bond Rating Lowered
Almost $200 million in expense items that had previously been paid from the state's general fund, using regular tax revenue, are shifted off the budget and are to be paid in the future through the sale of bonds or other special accounts.
Standard & Poor's, the bond-rating agency, recently lowered the state's bond rating from AA-plus to AA because of the anticipated depletion of the reserve fund and the increase in borrowing.
The items shifted off the budget, which include $111 million in grants to local municipalities are not in the budget bill and will have to be approved later with bond authorizations or other legislation. Combined with $7.05 billion in the main budget proposal, total state spending would be $7.38 billion, up 6.12 percent from the year that ends on June 30.
The co-chairman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, Representative William J. Cibes Jr., Democrat from New London and a candidate for governor, has publicly denounced the plan he helped construct, saying he believes it is not a responsible budget in the long run. Republican minority members in the Assembly have been even more to the point. $500 Million Deficit Expected ''They're just gimmicks,'' said Representative Robert G. Jaekle, Republican of Stratford and the House minority leader. ''When you add up all the non-recurring sources of revenue, there's a big hole for next year.''
The combination of postponed payments and one-time revenue sources, Mr. Jaekle said, would give the state a guaranteed $500 million deficit for the year beginning July 1, 1991, if the economy did not significantly change.
The Assembly's Office of Fiscal Analyis, a nonpartisan research arm of the legislature, projected an even larger gap of more than $600 million earlier this year, based on the budget plan proposed in February by Gov. William A. O'Neill. And while no new projections have been made based on the changes in Mr. O'Neill's budget that were adopted in the Assembly, the tax-revenue stream has clearly worsened.
In the three months since Mr. O'Neill presented his budget, for example, the projected size of the deficit grew to $246 million from $90 million for the year ending in June, according to estimates from the State Comptroller, mainly because of corporate tax revenues that were weaker than expected.
Those declining tax-revenue numbers helped make up the backdrop as lawmakers struggled to write a budget that would be accepted by the Democratic majority.
The resulting document cuts $150.8 million from the $7.2 billion budget proposed by Mr. O'Neill, said the House Speaker, Richard J. Balducci, Democrat of Newington.
As the House debated the budget bill for almost eight hours before approving it 84 to 60 along party lines, the question on Tuesday was what was properly labeled a cut.
''Some of the things we're doing are one-shot items,'' said Deputy Speaker Janet Polinsky, Democrat of Waterford. ''What do we do for an encore?''

HEADLINE: Growing Soviet Export: Military Technology

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A high-ranking Soviet scientist came to Capitol Hill recently to lecture members of Congress on why the United States should buy technology developed for the Soviet Union's military and space programs.
Such an address would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. But economic pressures in the Soviet Union are forcing the nation to market its hard-won expertise in the West, in return for hard currency.
Among the products of Soviet research that have already found their way into the American market are metal-forming techniques, coatings that greatly extend the life of cutting tools and a new way to track radiation dosages.
That the Soviet Union is willing to offer technology even with military applications was evident in a recent deal involving a consortium including the Soviet Institute for Structural Macrokinetics, which the visiting scientist, Dr. Aleksandr G. Merzhanov, directs. The institute, situated near Moscow, studies materials fabrication. The consortium agreed to supply Soviet-made high-temperature superconducting powders to a small American company that would seek markets in this country. 
Superconducting powders have no resistance to electricity and can be formed into valuable components in electric motors, power transformers and the like. They remain on United States lists of products that cannot be exported to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union without special permits.
 
Company 'Pretty Impressed'
''I don't think Dr. Merzhanov and his process would have been in the United States three or four years ago,'' said Peter Walsh, vice president of Project Development International Inc., based in New York, which helps market Soviet products and technology in this country. ''The Soviet Government is actively promoting defense-related technology.''
Robert D. DeLuca, the chief executive of HiTc Superconco Inc., the small research company near Philadelphia that is buying the superconducting powders, said his company was ''pretty impressed'' by them. He said the Soviet material, like other high-temperature superconductors a synthetic compound of copper oxide, yttrium and barium, is purer than the powders his company makes internally. And the Soviet fabrication process is much faster, taking place in seconds rather than the several days required for conventional processing.
The Soviet research establishment is vast, amounting to 1.5 million people working in thousands of institutes and industrial establishments, Soviet officials say. But while in the past it was supported completely by the state, such financing is now being cut back, so the scientists and engineers employed there are trying to find new sources of revenue. Most of the deals being signed now are small and largely experimental in nature.
''We have to organize our work so we are not depending so much on Government support,'' Dr. Merzhanov said. ''This includes broader sources of financing.''
More deals are likely as Soviet research institutes forge links with marketing organizations in this country.
In recent weeks Genesis Technology Group in Cambridge, Mass., formed a partnership with Biogen, a group of 26 Soviet biological institutes. The partnership will try to market such products as amino-acid food supplements and drugs to treat alcoholism. It will also try to interest Western pharmaceutical companies in sponsoring research at the institutes in return for rights to the results.
 
'World-Class Technology'
Arthur D. Little Inc., a consulting firm also situated in Cambridge, signed an agreement with the Soviet Academy of Sciences to evaluate a wide variety of technologies and to market them in the West. The two are to form a company called E'West Managers, which will have its headquarters in Geneva and Moscow.
''There are some fields where Soviet research institutes are known to have world-class technology and science,'' said Theodore P. Heuchling, a senior vice president at Little. Among them: nuclear fusion, which is both the basic mechanism of the hydrogen bomb and a potential source of cheap electric power; high-energy lasers, and gallium-arsenide solar-power cells.
''Some of the technologies involved were clearly developed for military defense reasons,'' said Alfred E. Wechsler, another Little official. ''The attitude is that now they should be moved into the commercial area.''
John Kiser, the president of Kiser Research Inc. of Washington, which represents Dr. Merzhanov's institute in this country, said the Soviet Union had long been more willing to market advanced technology in the West than Western governments had been to permit technology to flow the other way. In the book ''Communist Entrepreneurs,'' he notes that technologies as diverse as surgical stapling, magnetic casting of aluminum and synthesis of polycarbonates originated in the Soviet Union.
 
Metal-Coating Process
Joseph H. Filner, the president of Project Development International, said a metal-coating process now being marketed in the United States by Multi-Arc Vacuum Systems Inc. of St. Paul had originally been developed for the Soviet nuclear program. The process increases the life of cutting tools like drills and mills as much as sixfold by depositing a thin layer of titanium nitride on the surface.
Researchers in the United States knew the advantages of titanium nitride, but the temperature of the process they had developed, more than 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit, was so high that many of the tools became deformed, limiting their usefulness. Meanwhile, Soviet scientists had found a way to apply the coating at 800 to 900 degrees. ''We found they had better technology, so we bought it and brought it back to this country,'' Mr. Filner said. The treated tools, recognizable by the golden coating, are now widely used in American industry, including in military plants, and are beginning to turn up in consumer markets, Product Development officials said.
More recently, Mr. Filner found that scientists at the Riga Medical Institute in Latvia had developed a radiation detector - a crystal that has been treated with selected impurities - that is 50 times more sensitive than the one commonly used in the United States.
The Soviet aluminum-oxide crystal detector can measure one-tenth of a millirem of radiation, compared with a maximum sensitivity of five millirems for a standard lithium fluoride detector, said Arthur C. Lucas, vice president for technology at Victoreen Inc., in Cleveland.
 
Questions of Origin Not Asked
Mr. Lucas said the devices ''may have been developed for the Soviet nuclear navy, but they are not saying and we are not going to ask.'' He said the quality of Soviet materials science was very good.
''All they need is an economic structure that can take advantage of the advances they have made,'' he said.
The detectors are being made in a Soviet-American joint venture in Riga as Victoreen attempts to build a market in the United States. Mr. Lucas said the company estimated it could sell 300,000 to 500,000 of the detector crystals a year.
Because the Soviet Government allocated resources to military and space programs rather than consumer goods, it stands to reason that military-derived developments are among its most marketable products, Mr. Kiser of Kiser Research said. ''The closer something is to a military application, the less likely it is they need help from us,'' he added.
 
Freedom From Profit Pressure
The lack of commercial markets for much of the technology developed by researchers in the Soviet Union has been a big economic drag on the nation. Then again, Soviet scientists, free of the pressure to push technology into applications that improve quarterly profits, have been able to pursue projects for decades. The process that produces the superconducting powders and other materials has been developed over 20 years by Dr. Merzhanov, a physicist, and his wife, Dr. Inna Borovinskaya, a chemist.
Lacking commercial interests to protect, Soviet scientists are also eager to license their technologies so they can gain access to Western computers and analytic instruments.
Mr. Filner cautioned, however, that the quality of Soviet finished goods remained uneven and that some Soviet scientific claims tended to be exaggerated. ''They are converting a missile plant in the Urals to produce videocassette recorders,'' he said. ''I don't think we will be able to sell many Soviet VCR's over here soon. For the next 10 years their best exports will be brains and semifinished goods.''

HEADLINE: Economy Improving, Data Show

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Having avoided recession, the economy is gradually picking up strength, with the long-suppressed industrial sector setting the pace, private analysts said today after publication of another batch of Government economic data.
The Commerce Department reported that factory orders climbed 3.8 percent in March and that its predictive index for overall economic activity rose nine-tenths of 1 percent for that month. Both figures were a bit stronger than expected and represented the biggest monthly gains since 1988.
Consistent with this picture of modest rebound was the Federal Reserve's periodic survey of business conditions throughout its 12 districts. The survey found that ''overall economic activity continues to expand slowly.'' Six districts reported that industry was on the rebound. 
 
No Credit Crunch Seen
The Fed's report, prepared before the mid-May meeting of the central bank committee that sets monetary policy, also cited little evidence of a credit crunch and scant expression of inflation fears.
While the report, known as ''the beige book,'' consists largely of anecdotal evidence, the findings appeared consistent with other recent indicators of the economy's performance and suggested, among other things, that recent worrisome inflation figures were probably temporary.
''The trend is toward a stronger manufacturing and goods-producing sector,'' said Lincoln F. Anderson, an economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. Inflation, he added, appears to be concentrated in the service area, where consumers are resisting attempts by companies to pass along their higher costs for health care and other benefits.
The Columbia Business School's Center for International Business Cycle Research said on Tuesday that its leading index of service-sector activity rose five-tenths of 1 percent in March, suggesting ''a more subdued pace'' of growth than in recent years.
 
Fed's View on Prices
Various Federal Reserve officials have in recent days declared first-quarter inflation - at an 8 1/2 percent annual rate on the Consumer Price Index and a 6 1/2 percent annual rate on the fixed-weighted gross national product index - to be unacceptably high. But analysts caution that it is not at all clear that the Federal Open Market Committee will decide to tighten policy at its next meeting because much of the increase resulted from weather-related jumps in food and energy and those prices have begun to ease.
The gain of 3.8 percent in factory orders for March followed a 1.8 percent increase in February. Together they offset a January plunge. The latest gain, the largest since December 1988, was heavily affected by gains for aircraft and motor vehicles.
The nine-tenths of 1 percent rise in the index of leading indicators, which is intended to forecast the economy's path, about offset February's decline. Still, it was the seventh gain in the last nine months and the biggest since June 1988.
Six of the index's 11 components contributed to the advance, led by a rise in contracts and orders for new plant and equipment. The other gainers were the change in the price of materials especially sensitive to the business cycle, manufacturers' orders for consumer goods and materials, stock prices as measured by the Standard & Poor's stock index, the speed of deliveries from suppliers and initial claims for state unemployment insurance.
 
Three Lagging Categories
Three categories held the index back: building permits, the change in manufacturers' unfilled orders and the M-2 money supply.
The length of the average workweek and the University of Michigan's index of consumer expectations were unchanged.
Two companion gauges, the coincident index for current economic activity and the lagging index, the components of which tend to move only after a turning point has occurred, rose two-tenths of 1 percent and eight-tenths of 1 percent, respectively, the department also reported. The coincident-to-lagging ratio - an alternative predictor - eased to 1.115 from 1.121.
A private forecasting index compiled by Safian Investment Research rose six-tenths of 1 percent in March, with 12 components rising and 11 falling. On the other hand, a subindex that excludes stock market and monetary elements fell two-tenths of 1 percent, its fourth straight decline.
The Federal Reserve's survey, compiled this time by its Philadelphia district for the period up to April 20, reported that manufacturing activity had risen in Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco. St. Louis continued weak, while Boston and Philadelphia reported conditions in their districts as ''mixed.''
 
Real Estate 'Generally Weak'
Residential real estate was described as remaining ''generally weak'' but with pockets of strength in upstate New York, parts of California and in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Retail spending was ''growing slowly,'' and loan demand varied but was ''flat'' over all.
Despite complaints from business people about tightening access to credit, the Fed survey suggested that this was not a serious problem.
''There is little evidence that a general 'credit crunch' is developing; the majority of businesses say they have not seen any change in credit terms and have had no trouble getting credit,'' the report said. ''Where credit tightening by banks and thrift institutions has been noted, however, it has mainly affected newer small businesses and the real estate industry.''
Retail sales were said to be strongest in Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis and San Francisco and weakest in St. Louis and Dallas.
The report made remarkably little mention of inflation, although the respondents in Cleveland said there was concern that ''commodity prices continue to firm gradually and service prices have been accelerating.'' But it was widely expected that inflation would moderate this spring.

HEADLINE: Mexico Plans To Privatize Bank System

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 2

 BODY:
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sent the Mexican Congress a constitutional amendment today that would reprivatize the country's banking system, which has been in state hands since 1982, and allow private interests to set up new financial institutions.
The proposal, if passed by both houses of Congress, would authorize the Mexican Government to sell off its 66 percent share in the nation's 18 commercial banks, a stake that is worth several billion dollars on the open market.
Government officials said it was still unclear whether foreign investors would be allowed to acquire a voting share in existing banks or in new ones expected to be formed.
''Circumstances have changed'' since 1982, Mr. Salinas argued in the amendment proposal made public today. He said that while the nationalization of the banking system eight years ago may have been justified at the time, privatization was the only way now for Mexico to ''respond to the challenges of the last decade of the 20th century'' and ''confront with sovereignty a world that is transformed, more competitive and technologically revolutionized.'' 
The sweeping bank privatization plan is the latest in a series of Government moves intended to open the Mexican economy to competition and make it more efficient. Since taking office in December 1988, Mr. Salinas has liberalized the foreign investment code, greatly lowered tariffs, put state-owned companies like Mexicana Airlines and the telephone company Telmex up for auction and begun discussions with the United States about the possibility of negotiating a free trade agreement.
 
Move Was Expected Eventually
A liberalization of bank ownership rules was expected to come eventually but not soon. Many believed that Mr. Salinas would wait until after next year's midterm elections to take this step.
The measure is also in line with a more recent policy of looking to the Mexican private sector, rather than abroad, for the bulk of the investment needed to fuel economic growth. The Mexican government had hoped that the signing of a foreign debt accord last summer would bring a flood of foreign investment, but those hopes have been dashed by the sudden interest of Western investors in Eastern Europe after the end of Commmunism there.
''This is one of a series of policy announcements aimed at keeping the Mexican private sector interested in investing in Mexico,'' said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a leading independent economist here. ''The emphasis was on foreign investment before Salinas visited Europe in January, but now the main target is the Mexican private sector.''
A Government official said that one of the objectives of Mr. Salinas's proposal was ''the democratization of credit and bank service.'' He predicted that bank customers would benefit from lower interest rates and more competitive loan policies.
Mr. Salinas said that even though the Government ''does not intend to be the majority shareholder in each and every banking institution, it will retain a participation in the commercial bank system.'' Government officials said they did not yet know what percentage of which banks Mr. Salinas wanted to keep in state hands, but suggested that the Government might keep a small stake in the three banks that together dominate Mexican banking - Banamex, Bancomer and Banca Serfin.
Mexico's commercial banks were nationalized on Sept. 1, 1982, at the height of a fiscal and foreign debt crisis, by then-President Jose Lopez Portillo as punishment for what he called their role in the ''looting'' of Mexico through capital flight. Early in 1987, the Government began allowing Mexican private investors to buy up to 34 percent of shares in commercial banks, but the private sector has long clamored for a total withdrawal of the Government from the banking system.
Whether foreign banks and investors will also be able to take advantage of the opportunities created by banking privatization is unclear. The revised foreign investment code announced last May reserves virtually all financial activities except leasing for Mexican nationals, but new legislation approved by Congress in December appears to permit foreign investors to buy nonvoting shares in Mexican banks.
''The precise amount and conditions for foreign participation in the process of privatizing Mexican banks would be a matter of discussion and debate within the Mexican Congress,'' one Government official said today. ''That is likely to happen, but nothing is definite and there is clearly going to be a lot of debate on the issue.''
According to Banamex, 87 foreign banks maintained representative offices in Mexico at the end of last year, including 27 banks from the United States. But only Citibank, which was also one of only two banks to escape nationalization in 1982, functions as a commercial bank.
 
Battle in Congress Expected
The President's proposal is certain to face a struggle in the Mexican Congress, where it must be passed with a two-thirds majority to become law. Mr. Salinas's Institutional Revolutionary Party has 263 seats out of 500 in the lower house, and while he can probably count on the support of the 100 representatives of the right-of-center National Action Party, the left-nationalist Democratic Revolutionary Party has strongly opposed other measures to reduce state ownership or control of the economy and is sure to fight this one.
Anticipating that debate, Mr. Salinas said that selling off state-owned bank shares ''will contribute to the strengthening of the country's economic stability, broaden the perspectives for long-term development and meet the most urgent demands of those who have the least.'' He said he would use such an infusion of funds to improve ''basic services such as drinking water, sewers, electricity, schools, housing, health centers and sports facilities.''

HEADLINE: Orders to Factories Rose 3.8% in March

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 2

 BODY:
Orders to factories for manufactured goods rose in March for the second straight month, the Government said today in a report that analysts interpreted as another sign that the industrial sector is recovering from months of weakness.
The Commerce Department said orders rose 3.8 percent in March, to a seasonally adjusted $240.4 billion, after advancing 1.8 percent in February. Orders had dropped 5.5 percent in January, the worst decline in 16 years. 
The January decline was the steepest since a 7 percent drop in December 1974. The March increase was the largest since a 4.7 percent gain in December 1988.
 
Supported by Other Reports
Also yesterday the Government reported that its index of leading indicators rose nine-tenths of a percent in March, the largest rise in more than a year. The orders report coincides with statistics from purchasing managers that indicate the manufacturing sector is expanding and follows a Government report last week that the gross national product grew at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter.
Robert G. Dederick, chief economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said a spell of weakness ''is behind us and we now have a flat, slightly upward bias.''
Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Company, said: ''I think the worst is over. The question now is what kind of rebound and whether the interest spike over the last month or so will abort what appears to be a recovery.''
The department said most of the overall March increase was in durable goods, up 6.6 percent, to $128.7 billion, after a 2.4 percent increase the previous month.
Durable goods are relatively expensive items expected to last more than three years. Many buyers must take out loans to purchase them, and their sales have been hurt by high interest rates.
 
Jump in Transportation Orders
Most of the increase in durable-goods orders was concentrated in the transportation category. It was up 22.4 percent, to $36.6 billion, largely because of a 63.2 percent increase in aircraft orders. Transportation orders rose 10.1 percent in February.
Excluding transportation, orders were up 1 percent.
Orders for primary metals were up 7.3 percent, to $11.7 billion, after a 4.2 percent decline in February, and nonelectrical machinery was up 1.2 percent, to $22.6 billion, after falling six-tenths of a percent in February.
Electrical machinery orders fell 1.6 percent, to $19.6 billion, after rising 2.8 percent in February.
Orders for nondurable goods rose eight-tenths of a percent in March, to $111.7 billion, after a 1.1 percent gain in February. Food and chemicals accounted for most of the rise.
 
A Crucial Category
In the category of nonmilitary capital goods, considered a barometer of business investment plans, orders rose 14.4 percent, to $41.3 billion, after declines of 5.9 percent in February and 13.6 percent in January.
But military orders dropped 3.9 percent, to $7.4 billion, after jumping 18.3 percent in February. Excluding the military, orders gained 4 percent, the largest such increase since a similar advance in April 1989.
The Commerce Department also said shipments were up 1.1 percent in March, to $236.8 billion, after gaining 3.4 percent a month earlier.
Inventories fell three-tenths of a percent, to $371.9 billion, their third decline in four months.

HEADLINE: Oil Outlook Is More Confused Than Usual

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOULDER, Colo., May 2

 BODY:
Unusual complications in predicting oil supply and demand - including uncertainty about the economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the effects of the environmental movement - are making producers reluctant to invest in new wells and pipelines, experts at an international conference here say.
The reluctance comes even as spare capacity is rapidly disappearing and as many producers appear eager to avoid the kind of capacity shortage that has twice caused convulsions in the oil markets in the last two decades.
Fewer new investments in production capacity could result in shortages and price increases, and eventually crash development of new capacity that would then depress prices, the experts said.
Elaborating on the increased difficulty of making investment decisions based on predictions about supply and demand, Thad Grundy Jr., a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Energy, said, ''It's always been a moving target, but there are so many variables now.'' 
William L. Liscom, publisher of Energy Listener, a newsletter, cited a prediction by a Chevron Corporation economist at the conference that oil prices would vary between $15 and $25 in the rest of the decade, a huge range. ''The only certainty is it's going to be volatile,'' he said. ''That's going to bring a lot of investment to a halt.
''I'm not sure who is going to put money into Algeria or Nigeria on the basis of those prices,'' he added.
Experts say they cannot even tell whether some of the factors causing uncertainty would raise or lower demand. The increased emphasis on the environment, for example, could bring new requirements for efficiency and conservation, meaning less demand, but also a call for cleaner fuels, which require more crude oil to produce. Similarly, the opening of Eastern Europe to the West could bring economic stimulus or an economic slump.
Another pending change, the restructuring of the Soviet economy, could also raise or lower the demand for oil, depending on the country's economic progress, and raise or lower the worldwide supply of oil. The Soviet Union is the world's largest producer of oil and gas and the third-largest producer of coal, and small changes in the health of those industries could be reflected quickly in Soviet exports of fuels.
Internal upheavals threaten Soviet production, experts say, as do pressures to invest in the production of consumer goods instead of oil and gas. Domestic demand could also grow. But both the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe could consume less because of efforts at modernization or efficiency or because of recessions brought on by the restructurings.
Technical changes also loom, in the long term at least. ''Superconductivity is a huge and present threat to oil demand in the future,'' said Charles T. Maxwell, vice chairman of C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., although he said the threat was probably 20 to 25 years away. The development of superconductive materials, which have vastly lower resistance to electricity, would allow more efficient energy use.
Other changes will come sooner, in Europe and East Asia, he said. He cited co-generation, the burning of fuel to obtain not only electricity but also industrial steam, lowering fuel requirements.
Significant progress in solar cells would make them more suitable for displacing oil for electricity generation late in this decade, he added. Current solar cells would be a feasible replacement for oil priced at $60 to $100 a barrel, he said, and that range is falling fast as the cells are improved. And many experts expect the average price of oil, now under $20 a barrel, to rise.
Oil prices tend to respond rapidly to very small shortages or surpluses. How close the world is to shortage is not clear, as several conference participants noted, because the capacity to produce and even the actual amount produced are often unclear. But a steady growth in worldwide demand in recent years, combined with a precipitous decline in production in the United States and other non-OPEC producers, appears to have put about 82 percent of OPEC's capacity in service.
The conference was sponsored by the International Research Center for Energy and Economic Development, an autonomous research center at the University of Colorado.

HEADLINE: Brazil and Argentina Seeking Aid

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Despite a backlog of more than $11 billion in interest owed to commercial bankers, Brazil and Argentina will be negotiating for new official aid when the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meet in Washington next week.
And both countries are likely to win approval of aid in the next several months, underscoring one of the major changes in third world debt policy since the announcement of the Bush Administration's new approach just over a year ago.
The new strategy, in addition to calling for the voluntary reduction of debt, also allows for continuing negotiations and financial support from the international financial institutions, even when the countries are far behind in their commercial-loan payments. Bank loans make up the major portion of third world debt. 
 
Debate Over Policy Change
There has been strong support for this change in policy within the I.M.F and the Bush Administration and among some experts on the debt crisis. But it also worries others, especially the bankers who are owed the interest.
The Institute for International Finance, which was established by commercial banks, is expected to criticize the policy in a report to be released today. The report, which says the payment backlog now totals $18 billion, with more than half of it owed by Brazil and Argentina, will conclude that the policy is an incentive for countries to miss their loan payments. The practice, the report says, could become a habit and, even more importantly, spread to international institutions like the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
Because of this policy, said one official familiar with the institute report, ''it seems that countries are using arrears'' as a way to ease pressure on their economies.
 
No Other Option
But in the case of Brazil, with arrears of $5.1 billion, and Argentina, with $6.1 billion, some officials and bankers see no way to deal with the problems before the countries get aid from the I.M.F., or before they begin debt-reduction negotiations with their commercial bankers.
To refuse the aid, as long as the countries are taking approved steps to restructure their economies, would just aggravate the problems in each of the countries, officials said, and would favor the banks in debt negotiations.
A precedent for this kind of negotiation - with countries still in arrears - has been established in some of the deals already reached under the debt strategy named for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
Venezuela was $600 million behind in loan payments while negotiating with its commercial bankers. As part of the agreement reached in March, Venezuela paid off these arrears. Costa Rica, which also negotiated while in arrears, agreed to pay off 20 percent of its backlog at the time of its agreement and the rest over several years.
 
'Bankers Were Very Unhappy'
''It is true that bankers were very unhappy with this change in policy,'' said one banker who will be involved in negotiations with Brazil. ''But it is also true that it is probably necessary for the I.M.F. to have negotiations with Brazil because the arrears are so large.''
If the I.M.F. refused aid outright to countries in arrears, added John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, ''the bargaining advantage is too heavily with the commercial banks. By standing pat they could bring all assistance to a country to a halt.''
But Mr. Williamson and the banker insisted that the policy would get out of hand if the I.M.F. didn't insist on strong economic reform programs and some prompt payments to the commerical banks.
 
Argentina Exemplifies the Risks
Argentina is an example of the risks of the arrears policy. Argentina won a standby agreement with the I.M.F. last September and received one payment of $240 million from its $1.4 billion allotment. This agreement came soon after the inauguration of Argentina's new President, Carlos Saul Menem, and amid hope that he would be able to make the changes necessary to bring down rampant inflation and open the economy to foreign investment. But the program has run into serious problems since then, and the I.M.F. has stopped any further aid.
Argentine officials have submitted a new economic program to the I.M.F. and are hoping to get the standby loan reactivated. One official said that ''it's a strong possibility'' the request would be granted.
Brazil can make a stronger case to the I.M.F. for aid. However, even if the I.M.F. approves a standby aid program for Brazil, the arrears problem could still make negotiations with its commerical bankers on debt reduction difficult.
 
Brazil Seeking Debt Reductions
Brazilian officials have said the country would not make payments of more than $5 billion a year on its foreign loans, including those from the international institutions and commerical banks. The Brazilian Ambassador in Washington, Marcilio Marques Moreira, said the Government had not yet decided on its strategy for debt negotiations, except that it will seek substantial debt reductions.
He said that the Government wanted to work out a deal with I.M.F. first so that it could have a ''basic agreement'' before negotiating with the commerical lenders. Such an agreement, which would include I.M.F. approval of the Government's new economic policy, would give Brazil extra support in its negotiations with its bankers.
Another banker who will be involved in negotiaitons with Brazil said he was not too concerned about the $5 billion limit on loan payments. He thinks it is a negotiating position. But, he added, ''No doubt it is going to be a tough negotiation.''
He said that Brazil had more economic potential than Mexico or Venezuela, which have already reached debt agreements under the Brady plan. But President Fernando Collor de Mello must prove that his radical economic program can halt hyper-inflation in Brazil, where prices rose 48-fold in the 12 months through March. The heart of the program is a freeze for 18 months on about 75 percent of the country's bank deposits.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Fund Yields Are Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday.
Donoghue's average seven-day compounded yield for a taxable money market fund declined 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.96 percent, while the 30-day average yield slipped a basis point, to 7.98 percent. The decline is only temporary, analysts say. Indeed, yields on tax-exempt funds rose. 
Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's, said the financial markets were exerting some pressure on the Fed to signal some awareness that rates had risen.
Assets of taxable funds declined by $3.5 billion for the week, to a total of $378.1 billion. Assets of institutional funds rose $948 million, to a total of $79.4 billion, while assets of consumer funds fell $4.4 billion, to $298.7 billion.
 
Effect of Tax Filings
Money managers said the decline in consumer assets could be attributed to the tax-filing season, during which many investors paid their taxes by writing checks against their money market funds, and to rising interest rates that have made one-year certificates of deposit and one-year and two-year Treasury securities more attractive.
The average maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios is 44 days. ''If they were worried about higher rates, then the number of days would decline more than where they are now,'' an analyst at Donoghue's said.
Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million that are surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's, Dreyfus World Wide Dollar Money Market Fund, distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation in Garden City, L.I., posted the best return for the week, with a yield of 8.91 percent.
Although yields of tax-exempt funds were up for the week ended yesterday, assets declined by $1.2 billion, to total $75.4 billion. The average seven-day compounded yield rose 5 basis points, to 5.79 percent, for an equivalent yield of 8.04 percent for investors in a 28 percent tax bracket and 8.64 percent for those in a 33 percent bracket.
 
Best Tax-Exempt Yield
Donoghue's said the Calvert Tax Free Reserve California portfolio, distributed by the Calvert Group, Washington, had the best yield for the week. The return was 6.67 percent, about 88 basis points points better than the seven-day average.
By comparison, The Bank Rate Monitor's national index shows bank money market accounts down a basis point, to 6.24 percent, while certificates of deposit were up.

Stocks advanced briskly yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 20.72 points, to 2,689.64.
Prices rose despite growing sentiment that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates to cool off the economy. Program traders, moreover, were noticeably absent. 
Volume fell to 141.6 million shares, from 149 million on Tuesday, with 864 issues rising and 612 declining.
If the Fed increases rates, that will almost certainly lure investors instantly away from the stock market to the higher returns of bonds and money market funds. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bonds, meanwhile, remained steady at 9.02 percent.
The traders said many investors largely ignored new data showing that the economy was expanding because many had already adjusted to the strong possibility that interest rates would be going up.
When asked why the market was so strong, one trader noted that ''The 1990 Stock Traders Almanac,'' published by Yale Hirsch in Old Tappan, N.J., said that for the last 40 years, stock prices have risen 72.2 percent of the time on May 2 - the highest percentage in May.
In Old Tappan, Mr. Hirsch said, ''The market tends to be strongest on the last, first, second, third and fourth days of the month.''
The market could advance again today, the analysts said.
In an announcement that came as a relief to stock and bond traders, the Treasury said well after the end of the trading day that it would raise $30.5 billion next week.
The analysts said that they had expected the total to be that high but that the markets would have been under pressure if the refinancing had been much higher.
In one of the biggest developments of the day, American General, the big Houston insurer, jumped 7 1/2, to 47 5/8, with 7.1 million shares changing hands - by far the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said it would put itself on the block.
Among the Dow industrials, I.B.M. rose 1 1/8, to 109 1/8; Primerica 1 1/8, to 30 1/8; USX 7/8, to 34, and Westinghouse a point, to 73 5/8 - all in strong trading. Chevron rose 5/8, to 66 1/8, and Texaco 3/8, to 59. Other oil stocks gained, with Royal Dutch/ Shell up 7/8, to 73 3/4; British Petroleum a point, to 61 1/4, and Amerada Hess 7/8, to 47 1/4.
The Dow transportation stocks rose only 1.78, to 1,138.69, with Union Pacific up a point, to 68 7/8, but UAL down 2 1/4, to 151.
In a move that generally follows the end of an offer to buy a company's stock, Rorer, the drug company, fell 5 1/4, to 64 1/2, with Rhone-Poulenc's offer expiring tomorrow.
Among the indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500 gained 2.23, to 334.48; the Nasdaq composite 1.73, to 423.58, and the American Stock Exchange's market-value 0.91, to 344.23.

HEADLINE: Diamond Sales Outlook

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, May 2

 BODY:
Diamonds are headed for an eighth consecutive year of record sales, the world's biggest producer, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., said today. The South African-based company's chairman, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, said that world retail sales rose 4 percent in 1989 in terms of United States dollars. Growth was particularly strong last year in Europe, where economies were buoyant, and in Japan, where a tax concession on jewelry purchases helped to increase sales. In the United States, the world's largest market for polished diamonds, growth was modest because of an easing in economic activity, Mr. Ogilvie Thompson told thr De Beers shareholders.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher; Gold Prices Down Slightly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher yesterday in quiet trading following a mixed performance overseas. Gold prices were slightly lower.
Currency dealers said the markets had little reaction to Government economic reports that pointed to continued strength in the economy. 
The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in March, nearly offsetting a 1 percent drop the previous month. It was the steepest rise since a 1.6 percent gain in June 1988. In another report, the department said factory orders rose 3.8 percent in March, rebounding from January's worst decline in 16 years.
''The numbers were within expectations,'' said Gabriele Schmitt, a corporate trader for the Bank of New York. ''Most of the figures were pretty much priced in.''
She said traders also shrugged off news that East and West Germany had agreed on key terms of their July 2 monetary union, since that announcement was also within expectations.
 
Declines Against Yen
In Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar eased to 158.55 yen, from 158.90 yen late Tuesday. The dollar traded at 158.25 yen in London, and at 158.015 yen in New York, down from 158.845.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound from late Tuesday. Sterling sold for $1.6435 in London, up from $1.6385, and for $1.6425 in New York, down from $1.6445.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.6848 West German marks, up from 1.6805; 1.4550 Swiss francs, down from 1.4555; 5.6530 French francs, up from 5.6370; 1,234.75 Italian lire, up from 1,231.75, and 1.16715 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16455.
Late European dollar rates, compared with Tuesday, were: 1.6823 West German marks, up from 1.6785; 1.4535 Swiss francs, down from 1.4545; 5.6425 French francs, up from 5.6365; 1.8910 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8892; 1,232.25 Italian lire, up from 1,231.25, and 1.1672 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1635.
Gold prices fell slightly in New York after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $369.50 a troy ounce, down 50 cents from late Tuesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $369.70 an ounce, off 30 cents.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Europe Picks Its Lodestar

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, May 3

 BODY:
The NATO alliance and the European Community are now making all their major decisions about the future in the shadow of German strength and Soviet weakness.
The alliance's agreement today to hold a NATO summit meeting in London early this summer to discuss future strategy, the need for nuclear weapons, and its political role in light of impending German unification and continuing Soviet collapse is only the latest example.
The American decision to forgo the modernization of short-range nuclear missiles that both the United States and Britain were insisting on until a year ago, and to cancel plans to modernize nuclear artillery systems stationed in Germany, is another striking illustration. It was warmly welcomed by the West Germans at the NATO foreign ministers' meeting here. 
 
A Respect for Bonn
Here and at a meeting last weekend of European Community leaders in Dublin, the other Europeans - even Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain - have shown a respect for West German positions on political and strategic issues that simply did not exist a year ago.
But a year ago nobody seriously anticipated the possibility of German reunification. Nor did anyone foresee such a rapid decline in Soviet economic and political conditions that, as Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain put it today, there is ''a serious possibility that the whole thing will crumble'' at a Communist Party conference in Moscow scheduled about the same time as the NATO summit.
''What we're doing,'' a NATO diplomat said, ''is trying to define a vision of the future that both the Germans and the Soviet Union will feel is clearly in their interests.''
 
A Unanimous Affirmation
In line with that approach was the unanimous affirmation by NATO foreign ministers of the idea that a united Germany should remain a full member of the Western alliance, with security guarantees for the Soviet Union and provisions for Soviet troops to remain stationed in eastern Germany for a transitional period.
''A stable, united Germany within secure borders is a loss for no one,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said. And NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner, said, ''We have no intention of strengthening the balance in Europe to the detriment of the Soviet Union.''
But to make that clear, diplomats here say, the alliance must seek in the months ahead to redefine itself and reassess the fundamentals that have guided its strategy for 20 years.
The questions range from whether NATO should continue to rely on forward-based nuclear weapons to how many conventional troops the alliance will need to defend itself against the incoherent, ever less threatening, but still sizable military potential of the Soviet Union.
 
Keeping Germans in the Ranks
Any reassessment will also have to produce results acceptable to the Germans. The West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, warmly welcomed the decision to cancel the modernization of short-range missiles. He and Chancellor Helmut Kohl had long resisted plans to upgrade the missile force. But over coming months and years, NATO diplomats say, the alliance will have to persuade the Germans that they should stay with NATO rather than follow the Soviet Union's call for vaguely defined pan-European security arrangements springing from the framework of the 35-nation Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
To head off the pan-European drive without frightening the Soviets, NATO and the European Community have suggested discussing other roles for the security organization at a 35-nation meeting in Paris this year if the United States and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement on troop reductions. Indeed, NATO ministers were making uncharacteristically solicitous remarks today about President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, no longer the enemy.
In a speech before Mr. Kohl and other German Government officials in Cambridge, England, in March, Mrs. Thatcher suggested that the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe could play a mediating role in disputes between member states, hold foreign ministers' meetings twice a year, and institutionalize commitments to free elections, private property and the rule of law.
 
French-German Cooperation
Within the European Community, after a period of nervousness last winter about how rapidly the Germans would proceed toward unification and what they would do to their borders, the postwar pattern of French-German cooperation is again emerging as the core - and perhaps even most of what there is - of the slow progress toward European unity.
Viewed in this light, the sonorous call last month by President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Kohl for a new drive toward European political unity was simply another way of eliciting a German profession of loyalty and commitment to common Western European values, in the tradition of Adenauer and de Gaulle, or of Helmut Schmidt and Valery Giscard d'Estaing a generation later.
Even Mrs. Thatcher, who said she suspected deeper pan-European political designs that would rob the British Parliament of its hard-won political sovereignty, went along with the call by Paris and Bonn, to the extent of agreeing to commission foreign ministers to study the question of whether the community's charter should be amended to strengthen the commitment to unity by 1993.
 
Eye on Local Politics
The aim of political union, the 12 leaders agreed in Dublin, would be to enable the European Community and its institutions ''to respond efficiently and effectively to the demands of the new situation,'' meaning partly the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe but mostly the reunification of Germany.
For the moment, European politics are still, and perhaps always will be, local politics. Part of the reason for Mr. Kohl's new influence is the respect other leaders have for his success in leading East Germany's Christian Democrats to power there in the March elections, and for the strong showing they expect him to have in the West German elections, possibly the last, set for December.
Mrs. Thatcher, whose party has fared disastrously in opinion polls conducted in the run-up to municipal elections today, was feisty as usual on Saturday at the Dublin meeting. But she was not obstructive about what the Germans clearly wanted: the endorsement of German unity, and some warm words about European unity to go along with it.
 
'Never More at Stake'
What is at issue in all this, as one statesman here observed, is the shape of the Western economic and political community, based on trans-Atlantic partnership and shared cultural values - and the commitment of a united Germany to that Western community.
''There's never been more at stake,'' the official said, ''and the Germans have never been more important to its success than they are now.''
Diplomats and ministers will clearly keep a worried eye on developments in the Soviet Union as they try to chart a course. ''The ambitious goals we have set before us can only be achieved with the success of Gorbachev's proposals for change in the Soviet Union,'' Mr. Genscher said today.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Lithuania Premier Sees Bush, But There's No Red Carpet

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene of Lithuania was not expecting the White House driveway to be lined with her nation's gold, green and red flags. She was not expecting an honor guard or an Oval Office lunch or a joint departure statement with President Bush on the South Lawn.
She knew there would be no diplomatic fillips because the Bush Administration does not recognize Lithuania's declaration of independence, and because the White House did not want to trumpet the visit for fear of offending the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
But the Prime Minister never expected to have her Lincoln sedan stopped at the White House gate. She did not expect to have to get out of the car, show her red Soviet passport to a security guard, go through a metal detector and walk up the long driveway to the White House on her own. 
White House officials put the best face on the embarrassing do-it-yourself reception, asserting that the driveway gate was broken. But they had no excuse about why there was no one there to greet the Prime Minister until after the party had spent 10 minutes trying to get inside, for what turned out to be a 45-minute meeting with the President.
Mrs. Prunskiene is nothing if not unflappable. If President Vytautas Landsbergis took the hot emotional route in recent remarks, saying that President Bush had sold away Lithuania just as the Allies appeased Hitler in 1938 by allowing Nazi Germany to claim the German-speaking part of Czechoslavakia, Prime Minister Prunskiene took the cool, reasonable approach today as she pleaded her nation's cause with members of Congress, the President and the press.
''Even the world's darling does not have the monopolistic right to decide the fate of other nations,'' she said on Capitol Hill, in a scathing reference to Mr. Gorbachev.
Talking through a translator, she calmly warned that too much sympathy for Mr. Gorbachev soon ''degenerates into toadyism, and the latter gives birth to a cult.''
The Prime Minister's meeting with President Bush, the first direct contact between the White House and a representative of the Vilnius government, was hastily arranged by the White House just two days ago, after Bush officials realized she had a highly visible schedule on Capitol Hill.
She told Mr. Bush that her country would never revoke its declaration of independence, but that it was willing to suspend new laws passed by the Lithuanian Parliament to put into effect the declaration of independence if she received international guarantees. The guarantees would consist of international recognition of the government, of Lithuania's sovereignty and of its boundaries.
President Bush reminded Mrs. Prunskiene of Hungary in 1956, when the Western powers encouraged a rebellion against Soviet domination and then watched helplessly as Soviet Army tanks rolled into Budapest.
''The message was, 'You can't face down the Soviet Union if they don't want to be faced down,' '' said a senior Administration official. ''He told her that the U.S. wants dialogue - talk, talk, talk.''
The official also said the President told the Prime Minister that a compromise proposal on suspending Lithuania's independence laws, recently suggested by President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, ''had merit.'' The Bush Administration, the official said, had ''privately and earlier suggested something similar.''
 
'Very Impressive Lady'
President Bush found Mrs. Prunskiene ''a very impressive lady, very articulate, very balanced,'' said the official. For her part, the Lithuanian leader was cautiously happy with the meeting. Unlike some members of Congress, who said the summit meeting scheduled for later this month should be postponed, she said she wanted it to go forward, and hoped both leaders would listen ''not only to the voice of the strong but also to the voice of those who are not quite strong.''
She said she told President Bush that she hoped that at the summit meeting, the United States could find a way to take a formal role as a mediator in the dispute between the Soviet Union and Lithuania.
As though he were afraid of letting the self-possessed Lithuanian Prime Minister have the Washington stage to herself, only weeks before the summit is to begin here on May 30, the President held one of his impromptu news conferences this morning and offered his most lavish praise yet of Mr. Gorbachev.
''I salute the man for what he has done,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I think he's under extraordinary pressure at home, particularly on the economy. I do, from time to time, worry about a takeover that will set back the whole process.''
But Mrs. Prunskiene argued that Mr. Gorbachev would become stronger if Lithuania were democratic because it would aid him on overcoming ''the reactionary forces'' who oppose Baltic independence and his program of change.
The President said reports that the Soviet military was pressing Mr. Gorbachev to take a harder line on some arms-control issues were ''a matter of some concern.''
He also cast doubt on the Prime Minister's notion that the United States could mediate the Lithuania dispute. ''If there was a constructive role for the United States, of course, we should fulfill that, but there's not,'' he said.
In an interview in her car, as she drove from the Hill to an appointment with Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Prime Minister warned President Bush and the American people against pursuing a policy that is too dependent on Mr. Gorbachev's future.
''Freedom, like a genie that's been let out of the bottle, doesn't necessarily want to listen to the dictates of the person who uncorked the bottle,'' she said, explaining Lithuania's defiance of Mr. Gorbachev.
She spoke only in passing, and without emotion, of her country's ''difficult times, deprived of oil, most of her gas, metal and other important products.'' She recast the case for her country in logical terms, saying that the United States did not need to choose between helping Lithuania and helping Mr. Gorbachev.
''The solution is this: Gorbachev together with a breakthrough for democracy in the Soviet Union and an independent Lithuania,'' she told the members of Congress on the Helsinki Commission.''
At a dinner tonight, with journalists at the house of Christopher Matthews, a columnist for The San Francisco Examiner, Mrs. Prunskiene was asked why Lithuania had not waited a year to declare its independence.
She smiled and said, ''We felt we had to do it quickly, like a karate chop, if it was to work.''
Mrs. Prunskiene, a 47-year-old economist and former Communist Party official, had a small entourage, no security guards and she rode in a dark-blue sedan paid for by a private person in the Lithuanian-American community. As a translator, she used the head of a Lithuanian-American organization based in Washington.
Even so, she showed a natural aptitude for American politics. When the Prime Minister settled in her room at the Embassy Row hotel here on Wednesday night, her friends and advisers gathered around to counsel her on how to handle the American politicians she would be meeting.
They told her that each politician would think he was more important than the last.
''And my job,'' she said, smiling knowingly, ''is to confirm that.''

HEADLINE: Developers Offer a Garden to Sell the Kitchen Sink

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
With huge inventories of unsold homes in the New York region and New England, home hunters this spring are being offered an array of offbeat incentives and promotions.
Select the right house and the sellers will throw in the cost of commuting to Manhattan for a year, or a fully landscaped English garden, or a 1984 Mercedes-Benz or an all-expenses-paid vacation to Disney World.
''Price cutting is too commonplace,'' said one developer, Steve Maun. ''We are trying to be creative.''
Mr. Maun is the developer of Horizon Farms, a subdivision in Warwick, N.Y., about 40 miles northwest of New York City, and he thinks one of the top priorities of young home buyers is saving for their children's college expenses. So a buyer at Horizon Farms, at prices from $299,000 to $389,000, gets up to $20,000 in United States Treasury bonds. At their maturity in the year 2008, the bonds will be worth more than $100,000 for college bills. ''It's a natural,'' Mr. Maun said. Other promotions, lacking some of the flair of Mr. Maun's, involve complex negotiations. In some new projects, buyers can sell their old homes to the developer at a guaranteed price. Or they can get reduced-rate mortgage financing. Or they may be given the option of renting for a year and then buying at a pre-established price, with part of the rent going toward the down payment. 
Financial experts say some of the incentives really do reduce buyers' costs or add to the value of homes. But others, they warn, are no more than frivolous prizes in expensive boxes of Cracker Jack.
''Any time a seller is giving something away, it should probably tell you there is room left to negotiate the price,'' said Lowrey Nabb, a broker and president of the Association of Realtors in Houston, where an even deeper real-estate slump led to many promotional giveaways and deep price reductions in the mid-1980's.
In the Northeast, most of the aggressive incentives have cropped up since January and apply to a fraction of the houses on sale. Sellers say it is too early to tell how many buyers will take the promotional bait. Mr. Maun, who began offering his Treasury bonds in March, said two families have been won over so far, signing contracts to buy in his Orange County subdivision. But skeptics are not hard to find. Big Price Cuts ''Any developer who thinks a trip to the Caribbean is going to sell a house is in fantasy land; he should take the trip himself,'' said Jon Gollinger, president of the Collaborative Companies, a Boston concern that is marketing hundreds of homes for struggling developers and banks that have foreclosed on property in the weak New England market.
Mr. Gollinger's approach to selling houses is straightforward: he has cut prices sharply, in some cases 40 percent below what is being asked for comparable houses on the market.
Aggressive marketing and unusual incentives are nothing new to the real-estate market.
During a slump between 1978 and 1982, when interest rates on mortgage loans climbed to more than 15 percent, the catch-all phrase for real-estate promotion was ''creative financing.'' Lenders and sellers concocted a flurry of strategies, taking out second or third mortgages, offering low-rate loans that came fully due in a ''balloon payment'' after five or 10 years and employing even more complex financial acrobatics to keep interest charges down, at least temporarily.
 
Builders and Lenders
But the biggest problems facing sellers in 1990 are not high interest rates. Instead, with 30-year fixed-rate mortgages available at slightly over 10.5 percent, the sluggish sales around New York City and in the Northeast reflect broader problems: a downturn in employment growth, home prices that remain beyond the reach of most potential buyers and a change in buyer psychology that has kept others out of the market because they believe home values will increase little, if at all, during the early 1990's.
Home builders are in a financial squeeze, often putting them in a precarious position with their lenders. In most development financing, the builders stipulate before they begin construction a minimum price that they expect to receive for each home; if they wish to sell at prices below the stipulated amount, they must receive the lender's approval.
That means some are struggling to prop up selling prices, even if it means throwing expensive giveaways into the bargain.
 
'A Very Tough Market'
Still, some real-estate executives say aggressive promotions are less an indication of developers in trouble than of sellers hoping to receive special attention.
''This is a very tough market, and you need a red flag to make a property stand out,'' said Bill Higgins, owner of Higgins Real Estate, a brokerage in Hillsdale, N.J.
Mr. Higgins has persuaded one of his clients, Hill Top Construction, to offer trips to Disney World to buyers of six houses it has been unable to sell in subdivisions in Mahwah, Saddle River and Hillsdale, all priced between $350,000 and $600,000.
Another of his clients, East Crescent Developers, is offering to build, plant and landscape an English garden costing $5,000 for the purchaser of a large five-bedroom house in Mahwah, priced at $589,000.
 
Selling the Old House
''Maybe the cost of the vacation or the garden will simply be reduced from the selling price, but these things draw attention,'' Mr. Higgins said.
Perhaps most unusual in the weak markets of the region are offers by many developers to help buyers sell the homes they are leaving. Large development concerns that have their own brokerage offices are offering to market the homes at a discounted brokerage fee, while others are offering to buy them outright.
''The worst fear among buyers is that they are going to wake up one day owning two homes,'' said Hal Knopf, the broker for Lion Estates, a subdivision of 30 homes priced at $389,000 to $560,000 in Rockville Centre, L.I.
The developer for the subdivision, Joel Chinman, is offering a ''guaranteed sale'' to those who want to buy in Lion Estates but must first sell their present houses. Although people taking advantage of the offer may not be thrilled by the price they receive, Mr. Knopf said, the promotion ''gives them a safety net.'' He said half the Lion Estates houses have been sold, and two of the buyers have taken up his offer to buy their old houses.
 
Renting With Option
Another strategy becoming widespread in the Northeast is the ''rent to buy'' option offered by many sellers. One is John Wallice, president of the Glen Hudson Development Corporation of Huntington, L.I. He is trying to sell 22 units at Indian Trace, a town house condominium complex in Smithtown. The prices range from $185,000 to $200,000.
Other, more unusual incentives have been tried but failed.
Since September, the AmeriFederal Savings Bank of Lawrenceville, N.J., has been trying to sell new three-story town houses at New Colony, a project designed in part to spur an economic rebirth in its neighborhood, the Mill Hill district of downtown Trenton.
One promotion is AmeriFederal's offer to cover commutation costs for a year for buyers who work in Philadelphia or in Manhattan. So far, no big-city commuters have taken the bait.
The biggest incentive is cut-rate financing, which the bank said it was able to provide because it received $1 million in cut-rate loans from the State of New Jersey. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages are being offered to buyers at 8.375 percent interest.
The bank has received tax abatements for the Colony Hill buyers, reducing their bills by 50 percent for 15 years. Monthly common charges on the town houses, which are operated as condominiums, have been reduced to $77, from $100 a month.
The bank has also cut prices, from between $148,000 and $162,000 to between $118,000 and $132,000. Ten of the 19 town houses have been sold.
One determined family is the Ansorges of West Windsor, N.J. In a sequence of events not unlike those affecting other anxious sellers in the region, the Ansorges have come under pressure to sell their house because Harry Ansorge, a senior copyright lawyer for Bristol-Myers Squibb, has been transferred.
With their 3-year-old son, they have signed a contract to buy a cooperative apartment on the East Side of Manhattan, close to Mr. Ansorge's new office, and they plan to move by July.
In addition to reducing the asking price, the Ansorges are now offering to throw in a symbol of suburban affluence - their blue 1984 Mercedes-Benz, which they say is worth more than $20,000.
''A lot of people might dream of a Mercedes but never take the initiative,'' Mr. Ansorge said, sounding more like a television pitch man than a corporate lawyer. ''Here is their chance.''

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Excerpts From Session By Bush on Arms Talks

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's White House news conference yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
The revolutions of '89, 1989, that have brought democracy to Eastern Europe, the prospect of German unification, and my hope for rapid conclusion of a C.F.E. agreement bring us close to a peaceful and more stable Europe, whole and free. . . .
We've arrived at this historic point by maintaining a strong partnership with our European allies. NATO will remain vital to America's place in Europe. It is a proven structure upon which to base our security and from which to promote a stable, cooperative European order. The alliance is now ready to take on new challenges, and in order to set a new Western strategy for these times, and after consulting personally with my allied colleagues - a consultation completed by Secretary Baker in Brussels today - I'm calling for a NATO summit in early -in early summer, late June or early July, probably.
A fundamental purpose of this summit should be to launch a wide-ranging NATO strategy review for the transformed Europe of the 1990's. To provide direction for this, I suggest that this summit should address first the future political mission of the alliance, reaffirming its crucial role in managing and stabilizing the transformation of Europe. 
Second, the alliance's conventional defenses for the future, and next steps for conventional arms control. While we're still in a period of transition, as Soviet forces leave Eastern Europe and our arms-control works move forward, we need to develop a new strategy for the period ahead. And third, the role of U.S. nuclear forces in Europe. As democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet troops return home, there is less need for nuclear systems of the shortest range.
 
Short-Range Misslile Talks
And in response to these new conditions, I've decided to terminate the follow-on to Lance program, and cancel any further modernization of U.S. nuclear artillery shells deployed in Europe. The NATO summit should agree on broad objectives for future negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the current short-range nuclear missile forces in Europe, which should begin shortly after a C.F.E. treaty has been signed.
Fourth, the future of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, C.S.C.E., to give it and especially its Eastern European member states a more active part in shaping Europe's future. The C.S.C.E. can help to build free societies and provide a forum for political dialogue in a united Europe. My allied colleagues and I should agree to take up these ideas at the C.S.C.E. summit this fall, to be held around the signing of a C.F.E. treaty.
The future of the United States cannot be separated from the future of Europe, and so along with our allies we must prepare for the magnificent opportunities that lie ahead. In these times of uncertainty and hope, NATO will continue to be vital to America's place in Europe and a bulwark of democratic values and security. So this is what I'll be talking about tomorrow, and it has been discussed by Jim Baker with our allies in Brussels yesterday and today. . . .
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. Mr. President, you said that things were moving on the hostage front, and can I ask you what are the prospects of getting all the hostages out? They may sometimes feel like sacrificial lambs as the U.S. stands and waits. What good-will gesture do you have in mind to facilitate this and expedite their release?
A. I would have in mind any gesture that wouldn't be perceived as negotiating for the release of hostages. We have a policy. I'm going to stay with that policy. But let me give you an example, Helen. One of the things that the Iranians are interested in is the fate of -I believe it was four? - four Iranians that were taken, I think, back in '82. Now if there's some way that we can go back and get any information that would relieve the anxieties of the loved ones of those four people, we ought to do that.
And it is our view - and I have said this, made this clear - that it is the best information we have that these people are not alive. But just as we'd like a full accounting for Higgins, our heroic Marine that apparently has been killed, I can understand the Iranians wanting a full accounting, even though they know we have nothing to do with this.
So here's an area where they have said they'd like some information and if we can get it, I think we ought to get it, and we're trying. So if that is good will, so be it. I hope it is. That's the way I would intend it. And there may be other things we can do. But look, I understand the anxiety of the hostage families and I can understand the broken hearts, and that's why I'm not going to shift and act like everything is normal.
Q. Are you passing this word to Iran, and also in terms of the frozen assets?
A. Well, that's been going on, as you know, some discussion on frozen assets. Abe Sofaer's been over there. So, and if they view that as good will, fine. And if that can continue now in some way, fine. But that we've already discussed and opened, and I'm not sure they would view that as enough, you know?
Q. Is it brighter, though?
A. . . . Look, I have tried very hard not to raise the hopes of the hostage families only to have them dashed. And there's a certain cruelty in this process. When you flash a picture of a person that's held hostage and then another person appears in freedom. I welcome the release of Polhill and Reed, but I can't rejoice and say that my heart is full of great good will as long as six others are held hostage. . . .
 
Penalties for Moscow
Q. Mr. President, within the last few weeks you've been considering penalties against Moscow for its treatment of Lithuania. Now, however, you're liberalizing sales of computers and other hard technology to Moscow. Senator D'Amato, among others, says that now is not the time to be nice to the Soviet Union. Why have you decided on this course of reward rather than punishment?
A. Well, I don't consider the COCOM re-evaluation as a policy of reward. I'll have to discuss that with Al D'Amato to see that he understands the facts, because what we're doing is putting up tighter walls around needed items that are in the national security interest. And then where there aren't - when the other items that are not on the list for pure national security now, they're going to come off. And I don't view this as giving something to the Soviets at all.
 
Gorbachev's Future
Q. The May Day parade where Mr. Gorbachev was heckled - your Defense Secretary says that he doesn't think that Mr. Gorbachev can succeed with his reforms. Do you?
A. The May Day parade? He ought to come join some of the parades I go to around here. . . . That's the fruits of democracy. He's just learning. He's just learning. So, I wouldn't read too much into that. Yes, there's some discontent. And a lot of it relates to the economy. And some of it relates, by Lithuanians inside the Soviet Union, to the handling of Lithuania. But that's what's, there's a good side to all of this. I sometimes ask myself if that's true. But it is. Because that's the way, you know, fledgling democracies are beginning to work. And that's the way our system has worked. And I don't suppose, if everybody - anytime anyone points to a vi - a demonstration that gets rambunctious in the United States and points to 'that means instability in the United States system,' there's got to be something crazy. Because that isn't the way it works.
 
Foreign-Aid Review
Q. What about a full-scale review of American's foreign aid requirements? Are you interested in doing one of those or not?
A. Well, I'd be interested in a full-scale review. I mean, we've heard a lot - you know, a lot of our percentage of aid goes to a handful of countries. And here we have a man coming in here today, Prime Minister of Jamaica, Mr. Manley, who has just done a first-class job in trying to move Jamaica forward in many, many ways. And I salute him for that. But his aid was a small amount and I believe it's been just lined out because of insufficient resources, or failure to reallocate. I've suggested that the President be given a discretionary fund out of all this foreign aid so we can accommodate a person that is trying to take his small country and firm up its democracy.
 
Policy on Beijing
Q. Mr. President, it's been nearly a year since the Tiananman Square massacre. Can you point to anything in the last year in your policies there - improve the situation there after a year of trying to head off severe sanctions and keep the rhetoric down?
A. Several things. I've already mentioned them, and I'd repeat - you know, Fulbright and Peace Corps and some of these matters. But I'm disappointed. I've said that publicly before, and I am. Because I would like to think there would be a more vigorous response. I was pleased that they lifted martial law in Tibet the other day, so there are some things that are happening that are going in the right direction. But overall, I'm disappointed.
And yet, preserving a relationship with the People's Republic of China in the broad, global context is important. And so I've no apologies, I have no feeling that I took the wrong path. I mean, we did, by Executive action, what - everything that the Congress would have done by legislative action. Everything. And so there wasn't any substantive difference with the Congress on this. And so - but look, I'll express a certain disappointment because I'd like to see more action, more things happen that really move the whole process forward.
 
Nuclear-Arms Talks
Q. Mr. President, do you think your proposal on nuclear weapons in Europe will be enough for the Soviet Union to accept a reunified Germany within NATO?
A. Our policy on what?
Q. Your change on nuclear weapons in Europe.
A. You mean on the Lance follow-on?
Q. Will that be enough for the Soviet Union to accept a unified Germany?
A. I think they're going to accept it because that's the right thing to have happened. And I want to see that determined by the alliance, and keep the solid alliance position. And I want to see the Soviet understand that it is in their interest for a U.S. presence, in their interest for an expanded NATO, in their interest on a united Germany to be inside that expanded NATO. . . .
Q. Mr. President, the Soviets seem to be backpedaling on both Start, on the cruise missiles, and some of the things we think they agreed to on troop levels and C.F.E. Are you concerned about this? And what's your assessment now of the prospects for both a Start treaty and a C.F.E. treaty this year?
A. We're going to have to hustle, we're going to have to hustle. And they're going to have to come forward. I don't want to say we're not going to get a C.F.E. agreement and I don't want to say we're not going to get the principles of a Start agreement locked in. And that's what I'd like to see happen. And the summit that's coming up serves as some incentive for that to take place.
 
Relations With Mexico
Q. Mr. President, do you think that the relations with Mexico have been damaged by the Machain case and can the United States pay bounty to foreigners to abduct people in other countries?
A. I, you know the United States has had a system of, official system of rewards, you remember at the time of Noriega and stuff, there were some rewards out. But I don't, I hope the relations haven't been damaged. The Vice President, incidentally, did a very, very good job in explaining the policy to President Salinas himself. Our Attorney General has worked very closely with the Mexicans. We have had superb cooperation from Mexico in fighting drugs, outstanding. And so I salute them. But yes, there were some misunderstanding here and I've told our key people eliminate the misunderstanding. We don't want misunderstanding with Mexico. We don't need it. We need continued cooperation and we're getting continued --
Q. But in the future, are they going to continue going into Mexico, the agents of the --
A. That's a matter for Mexico to decide. And if Mexico wanted to have some people work with our people here, and that could help the fight against narcotics, I would be very open to that if it fit into our fight against drugs.
 
U.S. Troops and Peru
Q. I want to know if you're going to ask permission from Congress to send U.S. troops into Peru and take $35 million of our much needed money right now and build a military installation down there for us to train their troops to fight drug cartels.
A. To send U.S. troops in there to do that?
Q. Are you going to ask Congress for permission to do that?
A. I have not considered asking Congress for that. But, if Peru, if there's some training role that will facilitate the fight against drugs I would be willing to consider it. But I have no intention of asking Congress at this moment for anything of that nature.
Q. Do you feel now that you have the authority to send, to build this installation, which has been reported that you were planning to build down there in Peru.
A. Just a minute. I need expert advice on that.
You're talking about building a facility. We'll have to get back to you. You see the kind of advice I'm getting here. No, really, I'm sorry, but I just don't know about any facility. But I do know that the concept of training is a very valid concept. I don't think it requires approval from the United States Congress, but if the law requires me ask if we do something that's going to require that along the lines here, then I'd, I would ask. We're not trying to get around Congress. We work very cooperatively with them. . . .
 
Iranian Hostages
Q. Earlier you dropped a hint about the United States helping obtain the release of some Iranian hostages. Who's got them and how could you help?
A. These were diplomats, these were four Iranian diplomats that were taken in Lebanon in 1982. And they, the Iranians don't feel that they've had a full accounting of these people. In fact, I think they still hope that those people are alive. The best information we have as an outside party to all of this is that they are not still alive. But my point is, if Iran feels that way and the families of these four people feel that way, this is something where we should use every, every asset we have to, to disperse the lack of information, to bring them the facts, if we can. And see, this is something they feel strongly about. They've mentioned it to us several different times. And here's something we can do without there being any, violating our policy. It's something I'd like to do. And I think they would consider this a gesture of good will. So we're trying very hard again. I wish I felt that the answer we gave them would be different than the one. Because there's a human equation here. There is some suffering here on families in Iran, and so it's you know.

HEADLINE: Stutter-Step Democracy in Korea

 BODY:
Thousands of riot police storm the world's largest shipyard, at Ulsan, South Korea, to break up a strike and sit-in by workers. Two days later, they club strikers at the Government-run Korean Broadcasting System. Is this the new democratic South Korea? 
Yes, and democracy is an important factor in how the U.S. should respond. It is for Korean voters, not Washington, to pass judgment on how their freely elected Government conducts domestic affairs. Still, in light of the importance of U.S. economic and military ties with Korea, any threat of a return by Seoul to the discredited repressive ways of the past is a legitimate cause for U.S. concern.
President Roh Tae Woo deserves great credit for his role in peacefully moving South Korea to a democratic path. His efforts made free, fair presidential elections possible in 1988. After his election, he worked with opposition parties when they controlled the legislature, proposing useful, though incomplete, social and economic reforms.
But democratization is not yet secure. President Roh's own mandate rests on less than an absolute majority. And while the merger he recently engineered with former opposition parties is legal, it has stifled democratic give-and-take. Steady progress has now given way to a stutter-step.
President Roh has yielded to big-business pressure and pulled back from some of his bolder proposals for financial reform. With Korea's annual growth rate down from an astonishing 12 percent to a merely robust 6.5 percent, he has grown nervous about anything that might threaten business confidence. That nervousness explains the Government's violent assaults on labor. Repression has brought a dose of confidence to a shaky stock market. But it also risks setting off a dangerous backlash.
For generations, rural Koreans deferred to authority, according to Confucian tradition. Today's urbanized, educated population is less docile. Koreans, as they showed in 1988, insist on a significant say in their own affairs. So long as the authorities are facing down relatively isolated labor militants or student radicals, they will likely prevail. But when, as in 1988, wider sections of society conclude that the Government is acting unjustly, the tables can abruptly turn.
President Roh has, until now, shown himself astute enough to keep his balance. But neither he, nor Korean democracy, can afford to rest on past achievements.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid to Peru Military Is Blow to Democracy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Bush Administration's new $35 million program to aid the Peruvian military (front page, April 22) in fighting guerrillas involved in the drug trade carries the risk of exacerbating human rights violations in Peru.
The announcement could not have been worse timed. The first round of presidential elections was held in Peru in April, and the two top candidates, Mario Vargas Llosa and Alberto Fujimori, face a runoff in May. By announcing the new aid program in the midst of these presidential elections, the United States has signaled the irrelevance of civilian leadership in Peru and has strengthened the military against the new president. The result could be the weakening of democracy in Peru and the deterioration of Peru's human rights record, one of the worst in Latin America. 
Democracy is a fragile institution in Peru. The country has been dominated by military dictators for most of its history. The 1985 election of President Alan Garcia was one of the rare times since the country became independent in 1821 that power was transferred from one democratically elected leader to another.
Even under civilian rule, the military has retained a large measure of independence. About two-thirds of Peru is under emergency law. In these parts of the country, all power has been ceded to the military, leading to increasing human rights violations in the fight against the leftist Shining Path guerrillas.
Since the guerrillas first became active in 1980, more than 18,000 people have died in fighting or disappeared. Of these, roughly half are attributable to the military, in a dirty war beginning to look more and more like the situation in Argentina in the early 1980's. In some instances, the military has slaughtered entire male populations in the desperately poor Andean villages where the guerrillas derive most of their support.
Although President Garcia took office amid pledges to respect human rights, his authority has been severely weakened by Peru's economic crisis, and he has virtually no power to control human rights violations by the military. So complete is the military control in emergency zones that army officers have been able to prohibit Peruvian governmental commissions created to investigate human rights abuses from even entering the areas where violations are said to have taken place.
The last thing the United States Government should do is bypass Peru's civilian government and deal directly with the military. Yet by signing the new aid agreement before the new president is even chosen, that is essentially what the United States has done.
Although the agreement apparently contains promises that the Peruvian Government will improve its human rights record, promises by the military are worthless. The best way to improve Peru's rights record is to strengthen the authority of the new president. Instead, the Bush Administration has chosen to bolster the independence of the often brutal Peruvian military.

HEADLINE: The Unscientific Charm of the Big Bang

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is playing to the grandstand or ignoring direct observation to try and rationalize the superconducting supercollider project by claiming it will illuminate the first few femtoseconds following the big bang (letter by Sidney D. Drell et al., April 4).
The big bang is a charming literary conception, but is it science? What this means can be clarified by a classic story about Wolfgang Pauli, the late, great, sometimes irascible physicist. Dunned for his report on an article he was supposed to referee, he replied: ''That paper isn't even good enough to be wrong!'' In Pauli's sense, the big bang may be just barely good enough to be wrong, but there is no positive support for it in clearly disinterested direct observation. 
Indeed, of its two pillars, the Hubble Law and the cosmic microwave background, the first is supported only by data gathered largely assuming the Hubble Law, and indulging in other elementary statistical improprieties.
It is rejected by efficient statistical analysis of the clearly disinterested galaxy samples now available. The observed black-body form of the cosmic microwave background is simply the most likely disposition of remnants of light on a purely random basis, assuming the classic principle of the conservation of energy, and is not at all uniquely indicative of a big bang. In any event it is consistent with the big bang only in conjunction with the ingenious but contrived hypothesis called inflation, which is not testable by practical direct observations.
The scientific case for the superconducting supercollider is seriously weakened by representing it as a handmaiden to the big bang. I hope it can be built, but it is important to discuss it in a scientifically responsible and equitable way.

HEADLINE: Baruch College, Proud of Its Record, Seeks Minority Faculty

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We, department chairmen of the School of Business and Public Administration of Baruch College of the City University of New York, wish to respond to your April 5 and April 18 articles about minority representation in our faculty and administration.
We are proud to belong to the long tradition of public education that began with the establishment of the Free Academy in 1847. The mission of this college has always been the superior education of students from diverse ethnic and racial origins, training them to be the skilled professionals required by the city's economy. The school provides access to career opportunities and social advancement that our students would not otherwise have; for example, within a year after graduation many of our students are the principal wage earners of their families. The path of upward mobility is open to all who would take advantage of it, and we take pride in enrolling more black and Hispanic students in business-degree programs than any other college in the country. 
The programs of our business school are accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, the Accrediting Commission on Education for Health Services Administration and the National Association of Schools of Public Administration. These accreditations signal international recognition of quality and achievement. Baruch graduate students had the highest pass rate in the country on the November 1988 certified public accountant exams, and CUNY-Baruch ranks eighth nationally among colleges whose graduates are partners in the big six accounting firms.
Among masters-degree-granting economics and finance departments, ours ranked first nationally in the frequency with which their articles are cited in the professional literature. This record of achievement grows out of the commitment to excellence in teaching and research that attracts more than 350 companies and government agencies to recruit our students.
Our recruitment of faculty and administration is blind to color, ethnicity and gender. It is distressing but a fact of life that some minorities are woefully underrepresented in the doctoral programs from which we draw our faculty. We will continue to seek out qualified minorities, and call upon the community - government, business and alumni - to provide the resources to further our responsibilities.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Iraq's U.S. Support

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At 4:15 on a recent Friday afternoon - which, in the nation's capital, is the news equivalent of the dead of night - the Department of Agriculture put out a short release: a team of its officials had left for Iraq to look into ''possible irregularities'' in our Government guarantees of bank loans to finance purchase of U.S. commodities.
When a bureaucracy protects itself with a phrase like ''possible irregularities,'' look out.
Officials are now doing their best to put together a report that will not displease President Saddam Hussein, but there is this problem:
Thanks to our generous loan guarantees (now up to a billion dollars a year to Iraq), Baghdad has been buying U.S. farm products - but at considerably above world prices. In some cases - corn, for example -Iraq has often paid 10 to 15 percent above the market. 
Why? The Iraqis are not babes in the woods when it comes to bargaining, and the sales are risk-free; payment to our exporters is guaranteed by the U.S. One possibility: something about doing business with Iraq limits the field of sellers and makes possible the high pricing.
Another possible reason for the whopping difference in price is called ''excess markup diverted for an improper purpose.'' This translates to what Middle East traders call baksheesh - kickbacks to Iraqi Government officials or businessmen, which the American taxpayer is not supposed to guarantee.
Moreover, from 1985 through 1987, a period during the Iran-Iraq war in which a billion dollars in U.S. guarantees went to our preferred warriors, the cost of freight was not included in our guarantee. The full guarantee was supposed to help U.S. farmers, not foreign shippers.
However, Department of Agriculture officials - prodded by hints of wrongdoing in this space and from the U.S. Attorney's office in Atlanta - have stumbled over some funny business in the files.
The cost of freight to Iraq can amount to one-fourth of the price of a ton of corn, and it seems that - contrary to law at the time - freight was being underwritten by the American taxpayer. We'll get some of the details when Paul Dickerson's report is made available to the Congress.
That's where Senators Daniel Inouye and Bob Kasten of Senate Appropriations, and Representative Howard Berman of House Foreign Affairs, have put forward bills to stop all aid and technology transfer to the nation that gasses its Kurds, develops missiles to deliver binary poison gas warheads, and hangs a newsman who dared investigate a mysterious explosion.
Will the abuse of the loan guarantee appropriation in 1987, and the suspected skimming of ''excess markups'' by corrupt Iraqis and middlemen, help these legislators put through the Iraqi Sanctions Act of 1990?
Second question: Will the Justice Department and Federal Reserve investigations of Iraq's abuse of the U.S. banking system - running a billion in secret financing through the Atlanta branch of Italy's Lavoro bank - lead to indictments in coming weeks, adding to the urgency of the need for sanctions?
You might think so, but do not overlook the relentlessly pro-Iraq tilt of the Bush White House or Saddam Hussein's new supporter, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of corn-producing Kansas.
What's with the New Dole? It's as if a combination of his Armenian defeat, old anti-Israeli resentments and Kansas corn interests suddenly let the dark out.
Nowhere can the mind-set of Senator Dole better be seen than in the transcript of the meeting he and four other senators held with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on April 12. (Somebody should put that complete transcript, proudly broadcast by Baghdad radio as evidence of the dictator's clout with U.S. leaders, into the Congressional Record.) Senator Dole assured the Iraqi strongman that the Voice of America had taken action against the staffer who had offended him recently: ''That person was fired.'' (Wholly untrue: the writer of the pro-human-rights editorial is still on the job.) Senator Dole also hastened to remind Mr. Hussein that ''we condemned the Israeli attack in 1981'' (a point he did not remind Americans of when running for President) and shared his assessment of pending legislation: ''I assume Bush will object to the sanctions. He may veto them, unless something provocative occurs.''
Suspicion of scandal is minor provocation, not on a scale with gassings and hangings, but if serious investigations develop - 'tis enough, 'twill do.

HEADLINE: Newark's New Image Buoys Mayor on Eve of Election

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 3

 BODY:
Every city has its symbol, and Newark's may still be the 1967 riots that scorched the city and left 23 people dead. But Sharpe James, a believer in the strength of symbols, has spent as much time over his four years as mayor trying to change that image as he has trying to solve the most serious problems.
Mr. James spent $100,000 to install 775 nylon banners printed with flags or civic messages on downtown lampposts. Changing the banners every six months costs $30,000. He knows the banners may not help the 100,000 residents on public assistance nor shelter the 16,000 homeless people nor reduce the 50 percent high-school dropout rate. But he said he believed they were absolutely necessary.
''What they are is like the eagle somebody puts over a garage,'' he said. ''It just says: 'I live here. I care.' '' 
 
Bond Rating Upgraded to BBB+
As Mr. James approaches the election next Tuesday unopposed for a second term, business and community leaders give him high marks for image building and say there is substance behind the symbols.
The state's largest home builder is putting up 1,100 residences in the Central Ward. For the first time in 20 years the city's bond rating has been upgraded, to BBB+ from BBB, saving the city millions in interest.
Business leaders say the plans of Blue Cross-Blue Shield of New Jersey to move 2,500 workers from the suburbs to a new office tower downtown show that Newark is bouncing back.
No one, not even Mr. James, believes all the problems have been solved. Crime and drug abuse are still out of control. Much of the housing is substandard, and rents are still climbing. Schools are old and often wild, and children born here have a 1-in-5 chance of dying before reaching their first birthday. Still, using his energy and the talents of newly hired employees, as well as big corporations, Mr. James has managed to keep many of the promises he made in 1986, when he turned out his solidly entrenched predecessor, Kenneth A. Gibson, the first black mayor of a major Northeastern city. Mr. James has gained national attention as a second-generation black mayor in a city where members of minority groups are no longer satisfied just to have one of their own in City Hall. Having severely criticized Mr. Gibson in the campaign, Mr. James has had to deliver a combination of economic development, municipal services and fiscal accountability downtown and in the neighborhoods.
In a city that once seemed to have lost hope, many of Mr. James's initiatives have been symbolic, like the banners on Broad Street, the newly organized mounted police, the hundreds of new trees and a new law that requires security gates on downtown stores to be open meshed, so the city does not appear to be under seige.
Residents and community leaders said the biggest change in this city of 315,000, founded in 1666 by a band of Puritans searching for a heaven-on-earth, may be a can-do attitude, personified by the Mayor's unstoppable image.
''He has uplifted the spirit of the city,'' E. James Ferland, chairman of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, which has its headquarters in Newark, said at a recent gathering of executives at the newly refurbished Newark Museum. ''He has changed the way Newark thinks about itself and the way others think about Newark.''
Much of the turnabout is a spillover from the state's economic vigor of the 80's. Newark was late in reaping the benefits of that expansion, but now it remains active while the suburbs have grown quieter.
Richard W. Roper, director of the program for New Jersey affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, said Mr. James's personal energy and enthusiasm for leadership suited Newark's needs in the mid-80's in much the same way that the low-key style of Mr. Gibson fit the need for calm in the contentious days of the 1970's.
There are other differences between the two men that reflect their contrasting styles and differing challenges.
 
Changes in Circumstances
''Gibson focused at the beginning on direct delivery of social and human services,'' Mr. Roper said. But as the 80's began, the Federal assistance supporting such programs evaporated, and ''it was clear that by Gibson's third-term economic development was what he should have been attempting to secure for the community.''
The people of Newark had observed Mr. James from 1970 to 1986 as a maverick City Council member, with independent ideas and humorous barbs as his trademark, but lacking a clear agenda. By the time he took over at City Hall, the people were demanding safe streets and affordable housing and they wanted them at once.
''Ken Gibson was a hero,'' Mr. James said in a recent interview. ''I'm supposed to be a miracle worker.''
Mr. James spends as much time in the streets as in City Hall and said he felt the impatience keenly. ''I got elected by criticizing an entrenched black leader,'' he said. ''The day I took over, the people wanted me to solve all the problems.''
 
Administrator From Atlanta
His first priority was to avoid the mistakes of other black mayors who, after winning City Hall, had rewarded supporters by giving them jobs without regard to ability.
Mr. James conducted a national search for staff members. His most important appointment was Richard A. Monteilh as business administrator. Mr. Monteilh was administrative and financial officer of Atlanta and had earned a national reputation for an efficient, responsible style.
Mr. James and Mr. Monteilh began by hiring the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand to study management; 700 recommendations came out of the study. The most important dealt with improving the 80 percent rate for collecting taxes, water bills, parking tickets and other fees. The city became tough, putting liens on properties, turning off water and towing scofflaws' cars. The collection rate is up to 95 percent, and revenues have risen $30 million.
 
Conflict With School Board
Although many lots remain, more than $3 billion in commercial development has been completed or proposed since 1986, and 2,000 houses and apartments have been built. The city also won state support for a proposed $200 million performing-arts center.
Despite the general smoothness of his first term, Mr. James has had setbacks. He has engaged in a running battle with the Board of Education over patronage, accountability and its $421 million budget. By comparison, the city budget is $346 million. Last week voters approved a budget for the next school year despite his opposition.
 
Jump in Infant Mortality
Poverty and unemployment rates remain significantly higher than the state average, the incidence of AIDS is among the highest of any major city in the nation, and recently there has been a troubling rise in infant mortality, which jumped from 15.5 percent in 1987 to 19.3 percent in 1988, according to the latest available figures. The state average is 9.8 percent.
City officials said drug abuse, in particular crack, is at the root of many of those problems.
Mr. James also fought for control of the Housing Authority. This year he won the power to appoint its members, but he has been stymied in his plan to demolish most of the hellish high-rise projects until the units to be destroyed are replaced one for one.
Critics fault the Mayor for being too eager to promote the city and offer tax abatements to developers. ''If the city is going to give abatements and land, it should get something more in return,'' said Victor DeLuca, executive director of the Ironbound Community Corporation and a candidate for councilman-at-large. Mr. James said it was the abatements that kept developers interested in Newark when they abandoned the suburbs.
 
Impatience With Small Details
In an interview at City Hall, Mr. James said he had grown more cooperative in four years and he conceded one longstanding fault, an impatience with the small details of government.
''I hate meetings just for meetings' sake,'' he said. ''I'm a problem solver. I'm not a numbers person. I don't sit down and play with slide rules and calculators. I have a hard time reading my telephone bill.''
Though he professes to not being a fiscal expert, Mr. James said the two accomplishments he is proudest of are the upgrading of the bond rating and keeping administrative budget increases to below 4 percent every year.
In his next term he plans to focus on adding police officers, building rental housing and improving schools.
Bettering the image also remains high on his list, even if many of the efforts are purely symbolic. He recently decided not to replace his 1986 Lincoln with a new car. But he did have the license plates changed, from NWK 86 to NWK 90.
''If you can't buy a new suit, you buy new shoes,'' he said. ''Putting 90 on there makes it feel new.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about Sharpe James's first term as Mayor of Newark misstated the infant mortality rates for Newark and New Jersey. In 1988, the last year for which figures are available, the city's rate was 19.3 per 1,000 births, and the state's was 9.8 per 1,000.

HEADLINE: LAW;
The fleecing of the client, a cautionary report about the lawyer's conflict of interest.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
''Tell me a man is dishonest, and I will answer he is no lawyer,'' Daniel Webster told the Charleston, S.C., bar in 1847. ''He cannot be, because he is careless and reckless of justice; the law is not in his heart, is not the standard and rule of his conduct.''
It is a lofty ideal. But Lisa Lerman, a law professor at Catholic University in Washington, reports that it is also a self-serving myth. That, at least, is what is suggested by her interviews with 20 lawyers. Once promised anonymity, they spoke with her with a candor and contrition more appropriate to a confessional than a scholarly journal. 
All lawyers face a fundamental conflict of interest, between clients and careers, Professor Lerman writes in the current issue of University of Pennsylvania Law Review. The latter usually prevails, particularly in times of cutthroat competition and straitened economics. But never, never is the client to know.
What results is a House of Games, a panoply of deceits: padding bills, puffing expertise, ducking responsibility, meter-running, posterior-covering. Lying to clients, she writes, is ''a serious and pervasive problem'' in law firms, whose subculture ''does not put much emphasis on truthfulness.'' Or, as she paraphrases Nietzsche, for some lawyers, ''lies are necessary in order to live.''
Professor Lerman concedes her survey is not scientific. What she did, essentially, was turn over 20 rocks at random, and with great delicacy.
The lawyers who spoke with her -most of them youngish and in private practice - were given comic strip pseudonyms like ''Miles Marcus,'' ''Beth Forrester,'' ''Martin Richards,'' and ''Alison Price,'' with a ''Deborah Greenberg'' and ''Arthur Katz'' thrown in for flavor. No locales are mentioned; presumably they work in Metropolis and Gotham City. Once she got her quotations, all interview tapes were promptly destroyed.
Some of these lawyers practice in the personal injury bar, which tony lawyers have always loved to hate. One, ''David Larsen,'' tells of a defense lawyer who settled a $100,000 case for $4,700 because he was short of cash. But the professor's examples suggest that cheating may be even more rife in the ostensibly impeccable large firms, whose clients have deeper pockets and, often, less of a ringside seat.
The lawyers describe a world in which clients can be charged just about anything. There is the tale of a client who farmed out similar assignments to two firms, and got bills of $100,000 from one and $5,000 from the other.
''Winston Hall,'' described as ''an associate at a large firm,'' tells of how his employer updated Robin Hood to the Boesky era, regularly bilking the mega-rich, often foreigners. He put the prevailing attitude this way: ''They've got so much money in these countries where there is nothing to buy, they might as well give it to me.''
Then there is ''Mary Helen Murphy,'' an associate at a ''middle-sized firm'' who recalls her futile efforts to blow the whistle on a senior associate who, under pressure to get his billable hours up, routinely charged a couple of clients for 12 to 16 hours of labor a day when he averaged only two. When the lawyer discovered her snitching, he came into her office.
'' 'You're not going to get away with this,' he said,'' she recalled. ''And he closed the door and he started gesturing. His face was splotchy. I said 'Get out!' and I started to scream. One of the senior partners came down and said, 'We'll have to up his dose of lithium again' and then the partner said to me, 'Don't leave your scissors on that side of the desk.' That was their response to what this man had done.'' She later quit the firm in disgust.
The only clients smart enough to see through the make-work, double-billing and other assorted rip-offs, ''Winston Hall'' said, are people who presumably used to do it themselves. ''The worst clients from the point of view of a lawyer are the ex-partners, who know damn well that lawyers do work to run up the meter,'' he explained. He tells of a time when a client paid an inspection call on his firm, and saw how little the eight lawyers he was bankrolling were producing. ''It was like a customer going into the kitchen of a restaurant,'' he said. ''They were utterly horrified.''
What clients also don't know, the interviewees said, is that lawyers routinely blame secretaries for their own foul-ups, take credit for the work of underlings, exaggerate their expertise, say work they still haven't started is off ''in word processing,'' and forever duck phone calls.
The article has already provoked its share of curmudgeonly criticism. ''One gathers that Professor Lerman does not like lawyers,'' Edmund B. Spaeth Jr. wrote in a comment in the same issue of the publication.
Professor Lerman, a graduate of New York University Law School, denies the charge. ''I work with lawyers all day,'' she said. ''And I'm also married to one.''

2 Caryl Churchill Plays Show Dark Side of 80's

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
Attending a Caryl Churchill play is asking to get one's face slapped, repeatedly, frequently and with vicious force. ''Ice Cream With Hot Fudge,'' as the English writer calls her new pair of one-act comedies at the Public Theater, is short in length but bottomless in its cynicism about citizens of the Thatcher-Reagan 1980's on both sides of the Atlantic. Ms. Churchill doesn't like Americans very much. She may like the English less. ''Ice Cream With Hot Fudge'' is a livid, nasty piece of work.
Even at its most intellectually vapid, the evening is usually charged with the black humor and esthetic adventurousness one expects from the author of ''Cloud 9,'' ''Top Girls,'' ''Fen'' and ''Serious Money.'' In past plays, Ms. Churchill has scrambled chronology, allowed overlapping dialogue to erupt into cacophony and asked actors to ricochet between sexes and roles. Some of these techniques resurface here, but so does a new, Mametesque (or Pinteresque) spareness. ''Ice Cream,'' the bill's hourlong main event, and ''Hot Fudge,'' its 20-odd-minute curtain raiser, hurtle forward in mysterious, strobe-bright, snapshot-quick vignettes of acidic verbal wit and oblique events. The larger dramatic twists - three grisly deaths in one play alone - are often confined to the shadows offstage. 
''Ice Cream'' at least begins on familiar ground, as another ugly-Americans-abroad play. Lance (James Rebhorn) and Vera (Jane Kaczmarek) are a chatty, Anglophilic middle-aged suburban couple slobbering over castles and pubs while searching for familial roots in the British countryside. They find those roots in Lance's two English third cousins, but the relatives, Phil (Robert Knepper) and his sister, Jaq (Julianne Moore), are themselves rootless. They're alienated, amoral punks living at the dank fringes of the Thatcher economic miracle.
''I completely loathe the United States of America,'' says the thuggish Phil, who nonetheless wouldn't mind having his way with his American cousin's preppy wife. He darkly adds that Americans, having exported so much cultural and imperialistic ''filth'' to the rest of the world, should be prepared to have some of it ''thrown back.'' As if to prove the point, he and Jaq lead the square Lance and Vera into a real-life, Ramboesque crime that gives the first half of ''Ice Cream'' the narrative shape of Alfred Hitchcock's ''Man Who Knew Too Much.''
In the play's later scenes, the action switches to the United States, with Phil and Jaq becoming the tourists. En route to Yosemite and perhaps Disneyland, they discover a country no less ''violent and stupid'' than their own England. But the American horrors Ms. Churchill subjects the visitors to - lecherous men, dreary surburbanites, doomsday-fixated evangelicals, all firmly caricatured by John Pankow and Margaret Whitton - seem to have been culled from old Dennis Hopper road movies and television reruns. Ms. Churchill's writing flattens out, a sure sign that her observations are secondhand, and her visions of a poisoned Middle America seem embarrassingly dated and quaint when stacked up against ''Twin Peaks.''
Until it melts, ''Ice Cream'' is very funny, especially once the previously chipper Mr. Rebhorn and Ms. Kaczmarek sink into panic after unearthing the grotesque England beneath the picturesque tourist vistas. Even in the dud stateside episodes, Ms. Churchill does effectively limn one American trait - the compulsion to confess, whether to shrinks or officemates - and, as ever, she finds sick laughter in her menacing young British drifters, chillingly embodied by the cruel-eyed Mr. Knepper and the affectless Ms. Moore.
While the title of ''Ice Cream'' refers to its characters' cultural and linguistic differences, that of ''Hot Fudge'' is more elusive. Suffice it to say that the characters in this brief, explosive work are on the gravy train. In three dense, fast-talking scenes, set in a pub, wine bar and private club on the same night, Ms. Churchill captures present-day hustlers of several classes and nationalities. The rackets may involve old-fashioned theft, sophisticated credit-card fraud, real-estate speculation or faddish tennis instruction, but to this playwright, they are all part of the same bankrupt new Anglo-American empire of multi-national corporations, ''random walks,'' currency shifts, ecological vandalism and disingenuous corporate public relations.
As is explained in one hilarious speech, even the once-romantic calling of travel agents can now be rationalized in cold market terms because everyone in the world is either ''a potential customer'' or, as part of a tourist spot's ambiance, ''a potential commodity.'' While Ms. Churchill's rage at greed is familiar from ''Serious Money,'' her stock-exchange comedy, ''Hot Fudge'' resembles ''Top Girls'' when it suddenly shifts its setting from the economic arena to the private world where its money grubbers actually live. The play's fourth scene, set in a living room, exposes the sad people shouldering the pyramid schemes of compulsive mercenary success. As harrowingly acted by Ms. Moore and Mr. Pankow, each in a different state of psychological unravelment, this denouement is a nauseating glimpse into a most contemporary void.
The director, Les Waters, gives both plays a production as jolting as the writing. Annie Smart's distorted sets, as lighted by Stephen Strawbridge, have the imposing colors and stark, unsettling angularity of Alex Katz paintings. The six fine actors make fierce impressions in a total of 23 scurvy roles. One doesn't have to swallow all of Ms. Churchill's at times knee-jerk didacticism to find ''Ice Cream With Hot Fudge'' rich in bracing theatrical bile.

Images of Third-World Dislocation

BYLINE: By ANDY GRUNDBERG

 BODY:
What is called political art has achieved a renewed currency of late, for reasons that are not difficult to grasp. The controversy over Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs and attempts to restrict the latitude of the National Endowment for the Arts have left artists feeling more embattled than usual. The controversies have also raised awareness of the political possibilities of art.
Today the ''deconstructive'' photographic strategies used by post-modernist artists in the 1980's, such as appropriating the images of others, no longer seem entirely sufficient. In their place, one finds a return to Conceptual practices of the late 1960's and early 70's - especially involving installations. Artists like Hans Haacke, Dennis Adams and Christian Boltanski all use photographs, to be sure, but the meanings of their images are determined by the objects and environments that the artists carefully construct to house them.
One of the most promising young practitioners of this sort of polemical installation art is Alfredo Jaar, a 34-year-old Chilean-born artist. His subject is the dislocation suffered by nonindustrialized cultures in the face of Western economics and technology. He addresses his subject by creating room-size environments that are partly sculptural and partly photographic. 
Since 1986, Mr. Jaar's work has been seen at the Venice Biennale, the Sao Paulo Bienal, ''Documenta 8'' in Kassel, West Germany, and the ''Magiciens de la Terre'' exhibition organized by the Pompidou Center in Paris last year. But despite this exhibition record, and a currently traveling retrospective organized by the La Jolla (Calif.) Museum of Contemporary Art, Mr. Jaar still has something of an underground reputation in New York. (The La Jolla retrospective will end its tour here next year at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo.) Mr. Jaar's most recent politically charged installation, ''Geography War,'' is now on view at the Diane Brown Gallery in SoHo, in what is said to be his first one-man gallery show in New York. The work links two nominally distinct issues: the disposal of toxic industrial wastes and the tradition of Western imperialism. Focusing on a well-publicized incident in which barrels of carcinogenic chemical by-products were shipped from Italy to a tiny town in Nigeria, where they contaminated the local populace, the artist has fashioned an evocative and psychologically charged atmosphere that, characteristically, is more poetic than dogmatic.
In the first of the gallery's two darkened rooms, six glowing, freestanding lightboxes are arranged in a slow arc, appearing much like graveyard headstones. On the sides facing the viewer are schematic maps of fragments of the Mediterranean and Atlantic Coasts, on which the route of the tainted barrels has been marked by vivid red dashes. On the opposite sides are color photographs taken by the artist in Nigeria, including images of a freighter at sea, stacked oil drums and children rooting through a vile-looking dump.
Because the lightboxes are arranged close to the wall, only a few of these photographs can be observed directly. The rest are visible only as reflections in small mirrors that Mr. Jaar has mounted behind the lightboxes. The mirrors play several roles: they stand in for the artist, who is trying to convey his concern for the state of the world; they imply that the attitude of industrialized nations toward third-world peoples has a psychological dimension, and, because some of them also reflect whoever is standing in front of them, they implicate the viewer in the tragedy they describe.
All this might remain obscure were it not for the second installation and the presence of a thick notebook, displayed on the gallery's sales counter, filled with newspaper clippings and other journalistic reports on the problem of toxic-waste dumping in Africa. The second installation, which consists of a single lightbox in front of a methodically fractured mirror, includes a single, coherent image of the chemicals' route from Italy to Nigeria and an image of the Nigerian farmer who was paid to store them on his land but was reportedly not told what they contained.
At a time when political art can be drearily doctrinaire, earnestly superficial or burdened by good intentions, Mr. Jaar's complex way of questioning the established order of things is especially welcome. True, to some it may seem too allusive to activate political consciousness, while to others it may seem too much concerned with matters extraneous to the domain of art. But like Mr. Haacke, the artist to whom he might best be compared, Mr. Jaar manages to address thorny social issues in ways that are visually innovative, intriguing and - dare one say it? - entertaining.
The Alfredo Jaar exhibition remains at the Diane Brown Gallery, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, through May 26. Frank Majore Josh Baer Gallery 270 Lafayette Street Through May 26 As one would expect of Frank Majore's work, the seven glossy large-scale color photographs that constitute this show combine elements of several genres: commercial still lifes, nocturnal cityscapes and glamour portraiture. But the emphasis here is less on worldly materialism than it is on a sense of evanescence and abstraction. This shift in Mr. Majore's career can be gauged by comparing ''Interior,'' a picture taken in 1989, with its companions, all of which date from this year.
''Interior'' depicts a glass brick on a coffee table in a luxurious (though patently faked) interior, with a red-orange vista of skyscrapers in the background. The 1990 images, by contrast, feature streaks and pools of light that suggest not only urban reflections, but also Surrealist drawings and experimental European photography of the 1930's. In works like ''Snake Eyes'' and ''Veil of Tears,'' women's faces are embedded in screens of blurry lights, like rain or theatrical scrims. These visages lend the pictures a sense of both depth and deja vu.
''Veil of Tears'' is characteristic of Mr. Majore's new approach. Instead of concentrating on the evocation of deluxe textures and surfaces in artificial, nonperspective space, the artist now seems focused on the boundary between ''pure'' abstraction and the insistent referentiality of photographs. The results are more festive than before and have less of a sense of loss and regret, although they can also seem almost pathologically hyperactive.
 
Hamish Fulton
John Weber Gallery
142 Greene Street
Through May 19
Since the 1970's, Hamish Fulton has made an art of walking, taking unaccompanied treks across France, Spain, Nepal, Japan, Mexico and his native England. These excursions -a kind of environmentally harmless Earth Art - have been rigorously documented by the artist, primarily in the form of black-and-white landscape photographs accompanied by terse, descriptive texts. In this show of recent works, however, only one photograph is on view; the rest consists of wall paintings and drawings on paper.
Mr. Fulton has long had to contend with being mistaken for a photographer, since his landscape photographs can be as gorgeous and well made as anything printed by the likes of Ansel Adams or Paul Caponigro. This may account for his decision to make drawings of the horizon lines he encountered on recent walks and, in the case of one wall painting, to use the outlined profile of Japan's Mount Fuji as the work's centerpiece. In the other large wall work, the words ''dead dogs'' in capital letters dominate, with his usual descriptive text underneath.
But while the drawings are enhanced by brown and gray streaks of soil, giving them an immediate, physical presence much like a Robert Smithson rock or salt sculpture, the paintings are cold and diagrammatic. As for the photo piece, a view of a rocky path that is cryptically labeled ''Magpie Leads the Way,'' it seems best to embody the artist's edgy balance of 19th-century romanticism and 20th-century self-consciousness. If Mr. Fulton's Conceptual concerns are still distance, duration and time, then photographs apparently remain his best means of expression.

Postwar Works
Contemporary artworks by the masters of the postwar period - including Willem de Kooning, Roy Lichtenstein, Francis Bacon, Sam Francis, Jackson Pollock and Jean Dubuffet - are to be offered next week at Sotheby's and Christie's in New York and are expected to bring the highest combined total of prices at such auctions in history.
These sales of Abstract Expressionist, Pop, Minimalist and Color Field art are estimated to total $190 million to $255 million. These figures are more than double last year's combined estimates of $86 million to $114.3 million for sales that actually totaled $139 million. And they are five times the projections of $37 million to $48 million for the May 1988 sales, which totaled $56 million. Over that time the number of lots has also increased, from 574 in 1988 to 893 last year and to 1,044 this year.
Leo Castelli, the SoHo art dealer, says some collectors and dealers are anxious about the prices because of recent international economic troubles, while others are optimistic. ''I think the good paintings will do well,'' Mr. Castelli said in a telephone interview. ''There are a lot of them in both houses. Perhaps less good ones will not do as well on their coattails.'' 
Most of the art styles that have emerged since World War II are represented in Christie's sale of 77 works at 7 P.M. Monday, a session estimated to total $50 million to $71.8 million. The sale continues at 10 A.M. and 1:30 P.M. on Tuesday with 425 additional works. The overall total for the two days is expected to be $66.5 million to $94.9 million.
One of the most important paintings at Christie's is Lichtenstein's ''Kiss II,'' a wordless, larger-than-life cartoon from 1962 in red, white, yellow, blue and black. The classic elements of comic-strip art are all there in the cliche image of a couple embracing, the impact of which is depicted as an explosion against the night sky. Mr. Castelli recalled this week that he sold ''Kiss II'' to a Swiss gallery for $1,000 the year it was painted. The presale estimate is $5 million to $7 million.
''People have offered $5 million for it when it was still in Switzerland, and they were refused,'' Mr. Castelli said. ''If it is to sell, it will probably have to go higher.''
Also in the Christie's sale is Dubuffet's equally colorful 1962 painting from his Paris circus series, a more mysterious study of a crowded street enlivened by nonsensical scatalogical references. The artist's New York dealer, Arnold Glimcher of Pace Galleries, described the painting this week as ''a celebration of the madness of Paris - of the awkward, the grotesque and the clumsy and the resuscitation of values discarded by society.'' The presale estimate is $2.5 million to $3.5 million.
Christie's is to offer two large works by Clyfford Still with titles that include the dates they were completed. ''1949-A No. 1'' is a dynamic study of swirling forms in black, red and white, about 8 feet by 6 1/2 feet. The presale estimate is $3.5 million to $4.5 million. ''1955-D'' is a more serene but intense study in red, about 10 feet by 9 feet. Christie's expects it to sell for $3 million to $5 million.
These estimates far exceed the auction record for a painting by Still, $797,500, which was paid for an untitled 1954 work at Sotheby's in 1985. Martha Baer, Christie's top specialist in contemporary art, explained: ''We haven't experienced a major Still painting in the boom market for contemporary art that began two years ago.''
The sale at Sotheby's at 7 P.M. on Tuesday offers 88 works, valued at $88 million to $114 million. The sale continues Wednesday at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. with 454 additional artworks. The overall total is expected to be $123 million to $160.4 million.
Sotheby's two most important works are Abstract Expressionist paintings by Mr. de Kooning. His ''Woman as Landscape,'' from 1955, is a swirl of pink, red, green and blue that was acquired from the artist by Martha Jackson, a New York dealer, for $6,000 when the paint was still fresh. It is estimated to sell for $9 million to $12 million. Mr. de Kooning's ''Palisade,'' from 1957, one of a series of parkway landscapes depicted in broad strokes of blue, brown, yellow and white, was bought from the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York in 1959 for $14,000. The buyer was Milton A. Gordon, a New York financier and a co-producer of the ''Lassie'' television series in the 1950's. He was 82 years old at his death on Jan. 31. The painting, which is being sold by his estate, is expected to bring $8 million to $10 million.
Two chalk-on-blackboard paintings by Cy Twombly are estimated to bring prices well above $1.7 million, the record for the artist set last fall in a sale at Sotheby's in New York. The smaller and blacker of the two to be sold at Sotheby's is a painting about 5 feet by 7 feet from 1968 that is estimated to sell for $3.5 million to $4.5 million. The larger canvas, from 1971, is huge: about 10 feet by 16 feet. The price expected is $5 million to $6 million.
Lucy Mitchell-Innes, who heads contemporary art sales at Sotheby's, said the presale estimates exceed the record because several of Twombly's paintings recently have been sold privately for higher prices. One, she said, was sold for $3.5 million and another for $5 million.
''Traditionally, his market was based in Europe, but that has changed in the last three years,'' Ms. Mitchell-Innes said. ''The blackboard paintings are what everybody wants when they buy Twombly.''
Among the other major offerings are two portraits by Mr. Bacon, the more important of which is ''Study for a Portrait,'' a popelike image from 1957 shown seated on a throne, fists clenched. The presale estimate is $5 million to $7 million. Mr. Bacon's ''Study of Lucian Freud,'' from 1968, depicts the artist as a tightly swirled figure against broad stripes of lavender, gray and burgundy. The estimate is $2.5 million to $3 million.
Carroll Janis, who heads the Sidney Janis Gallery, said the sales should do well if owners are not greedy in setting reserves, the prices below which the artworks will not be sold by the auction house. ''Postwar art remains stronger than some of the older 20th-century art,'' he said. ''The sales will fare well if the reserve prices are reasonable.''
 
Soviet Art
A specialty sale of Soviet contemporary art, organized by Habsburg, Feldman, a Geneva-based house, is to be held at 3 P.M. tomorrow at the Puck Building in lower Manhattan. The 121 works by 31 Soviet artists are from the Kniga collection, owned by a group of Paris investors who have not been identified. The auction house estimates the sale will bring a total of $2.1 million to $2.8 million.
Acquired in the Soviet Union between 1984 and 1989 by Jose Alvarez, director of Editions du Regard, a Paris art-book publisher, the collection includes Ivan Chuikov's ''Grisaille,'' from 1988. It is a diptych in enamel on Masonite that is expected to bring $80,000 to $120,000. Also in the collection is Ilya Kabakov's ''Alley,'' from 1982, a landscape in enamel paint on cardboard with lines from 19th-century poetry covering part of the image. The presale estimate is $60,000 to $80,000.

Goodbye Without Leaving
By Laurie Colwin
253 pages. Poseidon Press. $18.95.
Geraldine Coleshares, the heroine of Laurie Colwin's new book, is a wife, mother and former backup singer with a rhythm-and-blues band. She describes herself as ''a person who craved the marginal,'' a ''nothing,'' who's ''alone in the middle of the universe,'' ''the harbinger of new life,'' ''the innocent American, making trouble right and left - a microcosm of imperialism.'' 
''I want to know,'' she says, ''how to be what I am.''
Geraldine's husband is her ''Boy Scout from Mars,'' her ''weirdo from Normalsville, who knew how to maneuver in the world,'' ''the golden mean,'' who ''managed to do good and make money at the same time.''
Her best friend, Mary, is her ''moral beacon.''
Her lover, Leo, is ''a school'' who would turn her ''into Hannah Arendt,'' someone who is ''more like a destination than a person.''
When we first meet Geraldine, she has just traded in her identity as a graduate student in English at the University of Chicago to join Ruby Shakely and the Shakettes - a Tina Turner-like group that's touring small towns around the country. Geraldine spends a lot of time on the tour bus ''blowing reefer and playing cards,'' while her friends from school pursue more conventional lives: ''getting married, having babies, being promoted, becoming White House Fellows or junior partners in their law firms.''
Actually, a similarly conventional life is in store for Geraldine. She meets a lawyer named Jonathan, quits the Shakettes, and after much agonizing is married and has a baby. Her family and Jonathan's family get along beautifully, no doubt because they share (like so many earlier Colwin characters) identical tastes and backgrounds. Geraldine's mother is a children's book illustrator and the head of a county art center; Jonathan's mother is on a local library committee and gives an annual cocktail party that ''was as regular an event as the bake sale, the Memorial Day parade or the Volunteer Fire Department chicken fry.''
In time, Geraldine takes a job as a researcher at the Race Music Foundation in Harlem - an obscure organization devoted to preserving the work of early black musicians. She and Jonathan move to a bigger apartment in some unidentified but gentrified neighborhood in Manhattan, and they go to dinner parties where Geraldine attacks the liberal hypocrisies of the other guests.
''They wore snappy clothes and owned small European cars. They worked hard and took interesting vacations in wilderness areas. They were healthy and hale and red-cheeked and they had never spent a minute of their lives worried about the essentials. The essentials had all been taken care of. Instead they had worried about grades, getting into college, law school. They worried when their cars didn't work and when cholera broke out in the some part of the world they had an impulse to go touring in. Later they had children and worried about early childhood development, what schools to send their children to. When they got together they talked about cooking equipment, and skiing, and gossiped about mutual friends. I was a total misfit.''
It doesn't take the reader long to discover that Geraldine isn't a misfit at all; she only thinks she is. Like the people she says she loathes, she leads a privileged existence in which the essentials are happily taken for granted. Her marriage is pleasant and fulfilling. Her child is healthy and bright. She and Jonathan have no economic worries, no worries about their families, their jobs or their futures. Even her love affair with Leo is completely painless, devoid of guilt, conflict or emotional trauma of any sort. While unsatisfactory dinner party conversations are enough to elicit a litany of complaints, Geraldine never seriously assesses her life or her values, never achieves anything even approaching self-knowledge.
Indeed, the reader quickly begins to suspect that Geraldine is one of those people who are constantly inventing things to worry about to pass the time. Although she has wanted to be a rock-and-roll singer all her life, she worries, once she's got a job as a Shakette, that it's not a proper lifetime occupation. Although she's madly in love with Jonathan, she worries that marriage is incompatible with her career. Although she says she loves being a mother, she worries that people will look down on her for not having a high-powered job. It never seems to occur to her that being a wife and mother doesn't preclude being a singer.
To make matters worse, Geraldine is constantly turning her identity crises into annoying little aphorisms: ''To be effortlessly yourself is a blessing, an ambrosia. It is like a few tiny little puffs of opium, which lift you ever so slightly off the hard surface of the world.'' Or: ''I mean, people who really do things have professions, and vocations. Maybe I'm one of those meandering types and being in the music business was a form of meandering.''
When Ms. Colwin steps away from Geraldine and her complacent, yuppified world, she succeeds in putting her eye for sociological detail to better use. Ruby Shakeley and some of Geraldine's other music-business friends are delineated briskly with a couple of lines of description, a couple of phrases of telling dialogue; and the European emigres she later meets in New York are also observantly defined. Unfortunately, these characters are no compensation, in the end, for Geraldine's self-absorption, her cute, self-conscious whining.

HEADLINE: G.M. and Ford Profits Off Sharply for Quarter

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 3

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company, the nation's two biggest auto makers, each posted sharply lower first-quarter profits today.
The declines were attributed to an industrywide production slowdown in January, which was undertaken because of swollen inventories of cars and trucks in the United States. But Ford profits also plunged overseas.
Automotive analysts, having accounted for the production cuts, were not surprised by the size of the declines. G.M.'s shares closed at $45.125, up 37.5 cents, and Ford's shares closed at $45.625, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading today. 
On Tuesday, the Chrysler Corporation also posted lower first-quarter profit.
General Motors' profit fell 54.3 percent on a 9.4 percent drop in revenue. The biggest auto maker earned $710 million, or $1.02 a share, compared with $1.55 billion, or $2.37 a share, in 1989's first quarter. Revenue dropped to $30.1 billion, from $33.2 billion for last year's period.
The company said earnings from overseas operations ''continued at a record level'' but did not elaborate. G.M. does not break out United States earnings, but David Healy, an analyst for Barclays Bank, said he thought the company was unprofitable in the United States for the quarter.
Ford posted a 69.1 percent decline in first-quarter earnings. The second-largest auto maker said net income for the period was $506.2 million, or $1.10 a share, compared with $1.64 billion, or $3.44 a share, a year earlier. First-quarter revenue was off 8.8 percent, to $23.6 billion, from $25.9 billion in the 1989 quarter..
Net income attributable to Ford's worldwide automotive operations dropped 78.9 percent, to $315 million, from $1.5 billion a year ago. United States automotive profits dropped 80 percent, to $160 million from $800 million. And unlike G.M., Ford suffered overseas: Profits fell 78 percent, to $155 million from $696 million. Ford said a strike at an assembly plant in Britain and economic changes in Brazil that have slowed vehicle sales and production depressed first-quarter profit and ''could continue to have a negative effect on Ford's future earnings.''
Net income from financial services, including the Ford Motor Credit Company and other lending activities, rose 35.2 percent, to $191.2 million, from $141.4 million a year earlier.
Retail sales of cars and trucks have been sluggish since last fall, and the auto companies do not expect a rebound from what they regard as a cyclical downturn before the latter part of this year. Because the companies book their profits and revenues when they ship new vehicles to dealers rather than when they are actually sold, the decision in January to reduce inventories by temporarily stopping some production directly affected earnings.
Vehicle sales at the end of last month improved marginally for both companies over results a year earlier, but analysts said the climate for sales remained generally sluggish.
 
General Motors
G.M. said it increased its share of the United States retail vehicle market to 35.2 percent in the first quarter, from 34.5 percent in the previous quarter.
But G.M.'s worldwide factory shipments of cars and trucks fell 13.7 percent, to 1.8 million, from 2.1 million in 1989's first quarter. The drop was caused by a 25.8 percent drop in production in the United States, where G.M. shipped 998,000 cars and trucks during the period, compared with about 1.4 million a year ago.
G.M. managers, in the midst of aggressive cost cutting, said they reduced the company's fixed expenses by $800 million in the period.
The per-share amounts on G.M.'s common stock, which declined 57 percent do not correspond to the $710 million in total consolidated G.M. earnings, which include profit from subsidiaries that have separate classes of stock. In financial results reported Wednesday, G.M.'s Electronic Data Systems posted an increase, and GM Hughes Electronics and the General Motors Acceptance Corporation posted declines.
G.M.'s cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter dropped to $4.65 billion, from $5.35 billion at the end of 1989.
G.M.'s quarterly profit was improved by $75 million, or 12 cents a share, as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions affecting its pension plans. The company said it now assumes an 11 percent yield on pension assets, compared with a previous assumption of 10 percent; G.M. also reduced by two years its assumption on how long its retirees will live. But a spokesman said the actuarial assumptions remain conservative.
G.M. noted that it plans to offer several new or restyled cars and trucks in the coming months. G.M.'s Buick division will offer a four-door version of its Regal and a Park Avenue Ultra luxury car, a restyled Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, and a four-door utility vehicle that will be sold as the S-10 Blazer and GMC Jimmy.
 
Ford Motor
Ford's share of the United States vehicle market dropped half a percentage point in the quarter, to 21.8 percent, from the end of 1989, while its share of the truck market remained stable at 28.8 percent.
Weak sales in the United States forced Ford to offer steep discounts on most of its cars and trucks. In the first quarter cash rebates averaged $1,000 a vehicle, up from $800 a vehicle in the previous quarter. Rebates averaged $400 a vehicle during the first quarter of 1989.
Like G.M., Ford also improved profits by liberalizing its actuarial assumptions on pensions. The company said about $26 million of its quarterly net income was a result of its assuming a greater yield than previously on pension assets. A spokesman said the company now assumes a 9 percent return rather than an 8 percent return.
Ford's capital expenditures in the quarter rose 59.1 percent, to $1.62 billion, from $1 billion a year ago. David McCammon, Ford's treasurer, said the bulk of the outlays were for new product development, notably a new Escort model in Europe and its new Zeta engine, which will be sold worldwide.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Can U.S. Recover In Electronics?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE Japanese Government's reported plan to organize an industrial effort to develop an advanced computer technology known as massively parallel processing, in which the United States now holds a substantial lead, heightens American anxieties. Some Americans already believe that Japan has a master strategy for achieving dominance in all areas of electronics technology and thereby becoming the world's greatest industrial power.
The Japanese strategy, according to Richard J. Elkus Jr., chairman of the Prometrix Corporation, a California-based manufacturer of semiconductor equipment, is based on the concept that products and markets become more and more interrelated during development. ''Every technology becomes the stepping stone for the next,'' he said. ''Every product becomes the basis for another. And the resulting efficiencies of scale are enormous.'' 
The heart of the Japanese strategy, he contends, is that capturing product markets is the key to technological supremacy. ''One often hears how we must improve our technological base,'' Mr. Elkus told a recent conference of the Center for Strategic and Industrial Studies in Williamsburg, Va., adding: ''Technology follows markets, not the other way around. If you own the technology, but lose the market, you will lose the technology.''
That, he said, is what has been happening to the United States electronics industry. Mr. Elkus was part of the team that developed the videocassette recorder at Ampex in the postwar years.
In 1970 Ampex was involved, through a joint venture partner, Toshiba, in discussions with other Japanese companies, including Sony and Matsushita, to develop a VCR standard. But Ampex, lacking adequate financial resources and seeking quicker returns elsewhere, decided not to pursue the VCR market, which was picked up by the Japanese. With that loss, Mr. Elkus said, went not only most of the video recording but also a major share of support technologies, including the design and manufacture of semiconductors.
The story permeates consumer electronics. American companies developed most of the original technology, but the Japanese now dominate or have a strong position in the markets for recorders, cameras, radios and television sets, digital watches, solar-powered calculators and a host of other products, as well as a growing share of the market for personal computers, work stations and laptop computers.
The linkages among all these products are crucial. Mr. Elkus stresses that at the highest levels of Government and industry, the United States must understand the importance of market and product ''infrastructure'' that results from those linkages.
Can the United States turn the tide in its favor? ''Absolutely,'' Mr. Elkus said. ''The U.S. computer industry is still dominant. America's position in mass media, software and transmission services is still solid. These markets can provide a basis for restoring America's competitive position.''
He contends that the United States must try to fight its way back into consumer electronics, display systems, audio and video recording, computer peripherals, components and related technologies. ''Otherwise,'' he said, the combination of developments in high-definition products and those markets America has lost will ''continue to encroach on remaining U.S. positions of strength.''
So, should the United States adopt an industrial policy? Or is the American system simply incompatible with Government efforts to direct or guide industry? As the Canadian economist Sylvia Ostry, former chief economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, observed, the United States, Japan, and Europe rely on three different models in their struggle for competiveness.
The American model ''is strongly consumer and short-term oriented,'' she said. ''Its strength is dynamism and flexibility.'' Business interest groups generate an implicit ''industrial policy'' response from Government in specific fields like military production and agriculture, while most industries insist Government leave them alone, she added.
By contrast, the Japanese model, she said, is a ''corporatist market economy,'' unique in its producer orientation, strategic use of cooperation and competition, and in the close and continuing interface of the state with business. She finds the continental European model, especially the German social-market economy, closer in some respects to Japan than the United States.
A world slump would worsen the conflict in these different national models. But other forces, as Mrs. Ostry suggests, may move them toward a convergent model.
One such force is the globalization of the world economy. Another force is the growing linkage among Japanese, American and European businesses. A third force, increasingly evident in the United States, is recognition of the need for Government support of education, research and development, and of cooperative efforts by businesses to create technologies crucial to all.
The competitiveness struggle can be a creative, not a destructive, force, if accompanied by open exchange among nations and businesses. But it will also involve what the late Prof. Joseph Schumpeter of Harvard called ''creative destruction.''

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Decline, Despite Late April Gain

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 3

 BODY:
Sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks rose 2.4 percent in the last 10 days of April, compared with a year earlier, the auto makers reported today.
But the better late-month results were not enough to offset poor results earlier in the month. Overall, vehicle sales declined 8.7 percent in April, and analysts said the sales climate remained generally sluggish. 
''The last 10 days doesn't mean anything. We're in a holding pattern, where we've been for the last three months,'' said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Co.
 
G.M., Ford Gain
Thomas Webb, an economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, said, ''Personal income grew in April, and consumer confidence was relatively high. Thus, the low level of auto sales implies to me underlying demand for new vehicles remains weak.''
The General Motors Corporation, however, posted a 4.1 percent increase in sales of its cars, which rose to 113,801 units. It was helped by a host of new models that arrived in showrooms in recent weeks. Sales of G.M.'s light trucks increased 7.6 percent, to 56,393 units.
The Ford Motor Company sold 64,851 cars in late April, an increase of 1.6 percent. Ford's light truck sales, aided by a new Explorer utility vehicle, were up 17.3 percent in late April, to 49,315 units.
But the Chrysler Corporation reported a significant decline in car and truck sales, which resulted in a steep loss of market share. Chysler's car sales fell 33.8 percent, to 21,866, units, while sales of its trucks and mini-vans declined 16.5 percent, to 26,114 units.
''Chrysler likes to say that its market share decline partly is deliberate because they phased out the Omni and Horizon and reduced fleet sales,'' said David Healy, automotive analyst for Barclays Bank, ''but I think the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord are eating their lunch.'' He was referring to Chrysler's compact cars, including the Plymouth Acclaim and Dodge Spirit.
Chrysler's combined market share in cars and light trucks fell to 10.7 percent in April, from 14.1 percent a year ago.
Ford's market share in cars declined to 21.9 percent last month, from 23.1 percent a year ago. By contrast, General Motors emerged from April with 36.2 percent of the market for cars, up from 35.7 percent a year ago.
 
Toyota Matches Honda
Toyota, which has been expanding its presence in the American market with increased production, matched Honda in market share. Both auto makers captured about 8.9 percent of the United States market, while the Nissan Motor Company's share declined to 4.4 percent, from 4.6 percent a year ago.
Other importers also registered sales declines for the month.
Eight auto companies operating plants in the United States sold 241,322 cars in late April, roughly equal to the 241,450 cars sold in the same period last year. Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.1 million, an improvement over the pace of 6.8 million for the past 30 days, but lagging behind the annual rate of 7.7 million for the comparable period a year ago.
Dealers sold 138,924 light trucks and mini-vans in late April, up 7.2 percent over last year's sales.
For the month, domestic producers reported a sales decline of 10.6 percent, to 546,750, from 667,444 cars last April.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Sees Slower Growth, but No Slump

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
In a less optimistic assessment than it made in October, the International Monetary Fund projected today that world economic growth would slow to 2 1/4 percent in 1990, but it said that ''no recession is in sight.''
In 1991, growth will rebound to 3 percent, the 1989 pace, the agency reported as officials of the I.M F. and the World Bank gathered here for five days of spring meetings that begin Friday. Last fall, the fund's economic staff projected world output would rise 2.9 percent this year. 
Despite the slower growth, which reflects a general tightening of monetary policy since mid-1988, inflation ''remains a major concern'' for many of the industrialized countries, and interest rates ''are likely to remain relatively high'' unless the United States and other countries with big budget deficits can bring them down, the I.M.F. said.
But even without fresh policy moves, the agency predicted that inflation in industrial countries would ease two-tenths of a point, to 4.2 percent, this year and then drop to 3.6 percent in 1991.
Inflation for developing countries is expected to run at 71 percent this year, down from 104 percent last year but about twice as high as the I.M.F. estimated last fall.
 
Trade Gains Seen
Raising its October estimate by nine-tenths of a point, agency analysts projected that world trade would expand by 6.6 percent this year, compared with 7.2 percent growth in 1989, and expressed some satisfaction that both Japan's trade surplus and the United States trade deficit had fallen to 2 percent of their gross national products.
West Germany's surplus rose to about 4 1/2 percent of G.N.P., but the movement toward German reunification could bring about ''sharp reduction,'' the I.M.F. said.
More broadly, the prospect of economic reforms in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union could bring about ''substantially'' improved performance in the medium term but economic activity is likely to be weak during the initial stages, the analysts declared. But Jacob Frenkel, research chief, stressed that each country needs to be appraised individually.
As for the global impact of the ''peace dividend,'' the agency was quite restrained. The budget savings in defense ''although not insignificant, may not be very large over the short to medium term,'' it said.
The I.M.F. analysts expect the United States economy to grow by only 1.7 percent this year, with consumer inflation at 4.6 percent, unemployment at 5.3 percent and the balance-of-payments deficit turning up, to $113 billion, after two years of decline that carried it down to $106 billion last year.

''We have seen a certain amount of customer business, continuing what has been small amounts of buying all week,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. ''The market has sold off a lot, and people don't want to get caught if the number turns out to be good.''
Despite the steep slide in prices recently, Mr. Capra and others said employment figures that are much stronger than expected could set off a further decline. These participants added that a strong report could possibly provoke the Federal Reserve Board to tighten monetary policy. 
But some traders disagreed. ''The worst possible number is priced into the market right now,'' one bond trader said. ''That means that any number that is even slightly tremendous could really send prices higher.''
In advance of the report, the consensus among most Wall Street economists was that non-farm payroll employment rose by 150,000 jobs last month. That excludes an estimated 230,000 workers hired by the Government to conduct the 1990 census.
''If the overall number comes in at anything under 400,000, the market will take off,'' the trader said.
 
Wage Figure Also Awaited
In addition to the payroll figures, analysts and traders are likely to look closely at the report's hourly wage figures to get an early sense of where inflation was trending as the second quarter began.
''The hourly earnings numbers are likely to be distorted by the increase in the minimum wage,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a primary dealer in Government securities. ''But the Fed governors have to be concerned with how much of a moderation in inflation they can expect to see from the rapid rise in the first quarter.''
Because of the distortions caused by the census workers and the increase in the minimum wage, Mr. Jones said, the Fed is not likely to put as much credence to the employment report as it normally does. Still, ''if payroll employment rose by more than 200,000 excluding the census workers, it would make the Fed take a second look'' at its current policy approach, he added.
Yesterday's price gains recorded in the bond market were the best since early April, but the rise was by no means enormous. By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 95 1/8, up 13/32, to yield 8.97 percent. Late Wednesday the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 9.02 percent.
 
Notes Climb
Prices also improved in the secondary Treasury note market.
In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 98, up 1/4 of a point, to yield 8.98 percent. And the 8 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 29/32, up 1/8, to yield 8.92 percent.
Yields on the securities to be sold at next week's Treasury refunding auctions also fell.
The three-year notes to be sold on Tuesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 9.00 percent late yesterday, down from 9.06 percent late Wednesday. Meanwhile, the 10-year notes to be sold next Wednesday were offered at a price to yield 8.98 percent, down from 9.04 percent late Wednesday. And the 30-year bonds to be auctioned next Thursday were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 8.94 percent late yesterday, down from 9.00 percent on Wednesday.
The sharp run-up in short-term interest rates over the last month was reflected in the results of yesterday's one-year Treasury bill auction. The new bills were sold at an average discount rate of 8.05 percent, up from an average rate of 7.72 percent at the last auction on April 5. It is the highest rate on a one-year bill since the auction of June 2, 1989.
 
Corporate Issues
In the corporate bond market, Mountain States Bell Telephone and Northwestern Bell, two subsidiaries of U S West, priced a total of $98 million worth of deep-discount 40-year bonds under highly unusual circumstances. The bonds were sold publicly, but details of the pricing were withheld at the issuers' request.
Still, market participants said that Mountain Bell sold $55 million worth of 7 3/8 percent 40-year securities at a price of $76.18, to yield 9.749 percent.The $43 million Northwestern Bell offering carries a coupon of 7 3/4 percent, and was priced at $79.94, to yield 9.749 percent.
Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the transaction. Both issues were rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Services and AA-minus by Standard & Poor's.
Traders in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues rose by about 1/4 point. Similar price gains were recorded in the secondary market for tax-exempt bonds, participants said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that the narrowest and broadest measures of the nation's money supply, M-1 and M-3, fell in the week ended April 23. The third measure, M-2, rose by $1.2 billion. The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed, Gold Higher; British Election Is Watched

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed against other primary foreign currencies yesterday as many traders stayed on the sidelines awaiting results from British elections and today's release of employment figures. Gold prices advanced modestly. Britons voted in local elections in the first comprehensive test of the Conservative Party's popularity since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, now in deep political trouble, won a third term in 1987. 
The outcome of the balloting could affect the British pound, which declined yesterday. It fell in New York to $1.6410, from $1.6425 late on Wednesday. Sterling also lost ground in London, dropping to $1.6425, from $1.6435 late on Wednesday.
The traders played it safe while waiting for the results, analysts said.
The market was also cautious before the employment figures are released, especially because of possible changes in the non-farm payroll figures, an indicator of economic strength.
Robert Ryan, the senior trader with the Bank of New York, said the market was looking for a non-farm payroll increase of 150,000 to 200,000. A lower number could set off fears of a recession and send the dollar lower, he said.
Markets in Japan were closed yesterday for a holiday. In London, the dollar traded at 158.10 yen, down from Wednesday's close in Tokyo of 158.55 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 158.045 yen, from late Wednesday's 158.015.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Wednesday, included: 1.6828 West German marks, down from 1.6848; 1.4550 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.6450 French francs, down from 5.6530; 1,233.25 Italian lire, down from 1,234.75, and 1.16625 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16715.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold rose $1.90 an ounce, to $371.40. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $371.30, up $1.60 an ounce.
In London, gold rose to a late bid price of $370.65 an ounce, from $369.25 bid late on Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $370.25 from $368.85.
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.91 to close at a bid $370.07.
On the Comex, silver rose 1 cent an ounce, to $4.998.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Slower Rise In Costs of Commercials

BYLINE: By Randall Rothenberg

 BODY:
THE days of skyrocketing commercial production costs appear to be ending, as lavish song-and-dance ads, high production-company markups and competitive bidding among producers fade from view, according to a new study by the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
In its third annual ''Survey of Television Production Costs,'' the trade organization reported that the average tariff for a nationally broadcast television commercial rose only 8 percent in 1989 from the year before, to $190,000. In 1988, commercial costs rose 12 percent. Some agency executives say production expenses have tripled in the last decade. 
Among other things, the analysis of 2,498 commercials showed that on average commercial production costs for regional and local advertisers declined 6 percent, and the price for actors in national ads remained unchanged. From 1987 to 1988, the cost of creating a regional ad went up 29 percent, and talent costs rose 27 percent.
The advertising association hailed the study as proving ''the definitive end to the era of 'runaway' production costs.'' But independent commercial producers reacted more ambivalently, agreeing that agencies and producers were cooperating more to control costs, but maintaining that many commercial producers were being forced from the business.
''There's a depression in the production industry,'' said Barney Melsky, a founder and director of the Association of Independent Commercial Producers. ''The agencies have squeezed us into an unprofitable situation.''
Richard D. Hall, a past president of the independent producers association, said, ''Several companies have merged; several have gone out of business, and there are many more freelance directors out there.''
Within the advertising industry, production-cost control has been a divisive issue for years. Last year, Philip B. Dusenberry, the head of BBDO, New York, attributed the inflation to high directors' fees and the markup over costs charged by the production houses, which had conventionally been 35 percent. His comments drew widespread agency support, but were vigorously disputed by producers.
The 4A's findings show that the average producers' markup has slipped to 30 percent, a figure that several production representatives verified.
Executives at both agencies and production companies attributed last year's decline in the production inflation rate to a greater cost-consciousness at the ad agencies.
''The line of the year from agencies is, 'I've got a board to show, but I've got a dollar problem,' '' said Jay Kenny, an executive vice president of EUE/Screen Gems Ltd., a production company. (A board is a visual mockup of a commercial.) Mr. Kenny also said agencies were more willing to accept lesser-known and less-expensive directors. ''It used to be the better director always won,'' he said. ''That's not always the case today.''
Another factor apparently contributing to the lower inflation rate is the rise in noncompetitive bidding for production jobs. Conventional wisdom among agencies had it that pitting several production companies against each other would lead to a lower overall cost. But George Bragg, the head of production at Lintas U.S.A. and the chairman of the 4A's broadcast production committee, said that picking a single house, planning the job with it and negotiating the costs up front actually saved time and money.
The 4A's survey also indicated a slight shift in favor of simpler commercials. The total number of song-and-dance commercials declined to 31 last year, from 36 in 1988. Basic monologue spots increased to 259, from 144, and ads featuring consumer interviews or testimonials also increased to 134, from 79 in 1988.
But in the category of packaged-goods commercials - those for detergents, toothpastes and similar household products - production costs rose drastically. An average, nationally broadcast package-goods ad cost $144,000 last year, 13 percent more than in 1988. Advertising people say this reflects the paucity of creativity in the category.
''Package goods as a product category are catching up with the rest of the industry in terms of complexity of concepts,'' Mr. Bragg said. ''The Procter & Gamble commercial of five years ago is not the Procter & Gamble commercial of today.''

HEADLINE: Corporate-Tax Shortfall in Dispute

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
Congress's chief economist testified today that leveraged buyouts and other measures that increased corporate debt were an important factor in the Government's receiving less tax revenue from corporations than had been expected.
But an economist from the Bush Administration disagreed, saying the effect of buyouts was unclear and might have increased tax receipts.
The economists - Robert D. Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, and Harvey S. Rosen, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Analysis - were asked by the Senate Finance Committee to explain why one of the main political selling points of the monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986 had been significantly overstated.
 
'A Mystery'
When the measure was enacted, lawmakers were told that the legislation, the most significant overhaul of the income tax system since World War II, would shift $120 billion in taxes from individuals to corporations in the first five years. 
In the three full years the law has been in effect, there has been a modest increase in corporate tax revenues, but the increase has been $20 billion to $30 billion below expectations. However, the total tax revenue from 1987 through 1989 was about as predicted, because receipts from individuals were higher than expected by approximately the same amount.
Referring to the shortfall in corporate tax payments, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, who heads the Finance Committee, said: ''We've got a mystery on our hands. Well over $100 billion appears to be missing from the Federal Government's revenues, and we need to find out what the culprit is.''
Corporate lobbyists filled every seat in the hearing room today and stood against the walls. Some suggested that Mr. Bentsen was emphasizing the shortfall in corporate tax revenues as a prelude to trying to raise business taxes to meet budget goals this year.
Mr. Bentsen gave no specific indication that was his intention, but he has said it will be difficult to find the $14 billion in new taxes required for the next fiscal year by the budget resolution approved on Wednesday by the Senate Budget Committee.
Mr. Reischauer and Mr. Rosen agreed that the main reason corporations paid less in taxes than had been projected was that their overall profits were below projections. But they disagreed in some respects over why profits lagged.
Mr. Reischauer said that ''an important cause of lower-than-projected profits during the 1987 to 1989 period was further increased reliance by corporations on debt financing, instead of equity financing.''
Interest payments on debt directly reduce taxable profits. On the other hand, dividends are paid to shareholders after taxable profits are calculated.
In leveraged buyouts, the hottest trend on Wall Street in the late 1980's, investors using borrowed money, often raised by issuing high-yield ''junk bonds,'' buy up the stock of a company. In other cases, the managers of companies increased their debt to make their companies less attractive to hostile bidders.
 
'Profits to Bondholders'
Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a research organization sponsored by organized labor, told the senators he agreed with Mr. Reischauer's analysis. ''Corporations are sending their profits to bondholders rather than paying dividends to shareholders and taxes to the Treasury,'' he said.
Mr. Rosen said, however, that leveraged buyouts might actually have increased corporate profits, and thus tax payments, by leading to more efficient management. The data on tax payments collected so far, he said, are ''inadequate to make definitive statements.''
Mr. Reischauer and Mr. Rosen more or less agreed about other circumstances that had reduced corporate profits, including higher than anticipated interest rates and larger than expected increases in wages and salaries, which led to higher individual tax collections.

HEADLINE: Bush Asks Budget Talks With 4 Top Lawmakers

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 3

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he had invited the four top Congressional leaders to the White House on Sunday for discussions on the budget, a move lawmakers view as an effort by the President to regain control of a process on which Congressional Democrats seem to have the upper hand.
Some Democratic lawmakers also expressed the hope that Mr. Bush's move was a signal that he was ready to begin talking about raising taxes.
Mr. Bush, responding to questions at a White House news conference, brushed aside queries on that point, insisting the meeting would focus on the budget process, not its substance. ''I didn't say we're going to talk any substance,'' he said. ''We're not into a negotiation - we're talking process.'' 
Mr. Bush's move, on the heels of a House vote on Tuesday approving a Democratic-sponsored budget, seemed to be an attempt to short-circuit the process by proposing joint talks before the Senate acts on its own budget. If the talks are successful they would get the Republicans back in the game while avoiding a potential deadlock as the House and the Senate tried to resolve differences in their respective plans.
 
Congressional Leaders Named
The leaders in Congress who will attend the White House meeting are George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader; Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader; Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the House Speaker, and Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader.
While Democrats are divided about the wisdom of entering formal budget talks with the Administration, they agreed that the President's move appeared to be an attempt to regain control of a process that has taken on a life of its own in Congress.
''It looks to me like an effort to get a bridle on this horse before it gets out of the barn,'' said Senator James Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee. The panel approved its version of the budget on Wednesday.
Mr. Bush acknowledged that ''nobody was too enthusastic'' about the budget he presented to Congress in January, but he said the budgets approved by the House and by the Senate Budget Committee had not been particularly well-received, either.
 
Budget Seen as Obsolete
After the House adopted a Democratic budget earlier this week Republicans chose not to offer the President's budget as an alternative, conceding that changing economic and political conditions had made it obsolete. That set in motion Mr. Bush's move today.
''What we have to do is start talking process and how we go forward,'' the President said. ''I'm not going to sit here and do nothing.''
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the the House Ways and Means Committee, said he was delighted that the President had initiated the meeting, and hinted that a discussion of ''process'' was merely the prelude to a more serious agenda that would ultimately include taxes.
''I understand that the President says the meeting is about procedure -that's what he's telling you,'' Mr. Rostenkowski said in an interview. ''I hope it's more than procedure.''
Earlier this year he pressed for a budget that called for tax increases. ''I've told the Presidenta big revenue increase won't hurt him politically, and I'd be most enthusiastic if we were talking about a big deal, not a small one,'' Mr. Rostenkowski said.
 
Some Are Wary of a Trap
But other Democrats, wary of a political trap, were clearly less enthusiastic about any immediate budget negotiations with the White House. Tempers flared when the subject came up at a meeting of the House Democratic whip organization this morning, and some members accused their leaders of ceding partisan advantage to the Administration by agreeing to any discussion before Congress had completed its own work on the budget.
Representative Leon E. Panetta, a Democrat from California who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and who has favored early negotiations, said he was encouraged that the Administration seemed to be ready to hasten the discussions. ''If you read all the signals and try to piece together all the quotes, on and off record, the implication is that we're moving in the direction of negotiating on all issues, including taxes,'' he said.
Mr. Panetta and other Democrats also agreed that Mr. Bush's invitation to the Congressional leaders was prompted by White House concern that the Federal deficit may be as much as $20 billion higher in the fiscal year 1991 than the Administration had estimated a few months ago.
This would require deeper spending cuts or larger revenue increases than envisioned in either the President's budget or the Congressional proposals to meet the deficit level set by the budget-balancing law for the next fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1. The President acknowledged today that the Administration had been ''a little off'' on interest rates.

HEADLINE: Panel Urges Huge State Purchases To Save Adirondack Wilderness

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 4

 BODY:
A commission appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to study the future of the Adirondack Park is recommending that New York buy more than 650,000 acres - more than 1,000 square miles - to preserve as wilderness and impose strong rules to limit development elsewhere in the park.
The panel, the Governor's Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century, also plans to call for a one-year moratorium on all new construction on 90 percent of the park's privately held lands, and will urge permanent checks on most lakefront development.
 
A 'Last Clear Chance'
In a report scheduled for release next week, the commission concludes that the park has been overwhelmed by the pace of development, and that the state faces a ''last clear chance'' to preserve vast areas of Adirondack wilderness.
The report appears certain to set off an intense debate over the future of the park, an unusual combination of public and private land that includes some of the largest wilderness areas east of the Mississippi. 
Most of the commission's main proposals - including the moratorium -would require action by the State Legislature. Several lawmakers and other officials here said that for any of the proposals to become law this year, Mr. Cuomo would have to quickly embrace them and make them a priority in the closing months of the legislative session, expected to end in July.
Governor Cuomo said through a spokesman today that he had not read the report and would not comment on it. He created the commission last year after developers bought several tracts that had long been kept forested by logging companies.
The Adirondacks, the Governor said in his charge to the commission, are threatened by ''an era of unbridled land speculation and unwarranted development that may threaten the unique open space and wilderness character of the region.''
Zoning proposals advanced by the commission would sharply reduce the number of condominiums or other dwellings that could be constructed in nearly all of the park's back country, its most remote forest lands. The report said the action was urgently needed to stem pressures that mounted over the last few years as timber companies sold off their forest land to developers. More than 100,000 acres have been sold for subdivision in the last three years alone.
The land purchases sought by the commission would bring the total public ownership to over 50 percent of the park, from the present level of 42 percent. It also backs the purchase of so-called easements or conservation rights on other private lands, which would keep them private but prevent development.
The report even urged an expansion of the park itself, proposing that its ''blue line,'' as the park's boundary is known, be extended slightly at two places in the north.
While the zoning restrictions would head off second-home developments and other encroachment in Adirondack wilderness areas, they seemed likely to set off outrage among some park residents who say that such constraints make it difficult for many Adirondack natives to make a living there.
 
Some Residents Denounce Plan
One 800-member resident group, the Adirondack Fairness Coalition, which said it sought to balance park protection with economic growth, said today that the recommendations of the commission appeared to be ''preposterous in nature and scope.''
The group, which said it had seen a summary of the recommendations in a minority report prepared by one commission member, said the construction moratorium proposed by the commission would ''cripple the already weak economies of the 105 communities in the Adirondacks.''
The commission said that the state's Adirondack Park Agency, which oversees the park, had been overwhelmed by new development in the Adirondacks. The number of lots on subdivision proposals before the agency tripled in the last five years, and projections for 1990 show a 72 percent increase in lot proposals over last year.
The park agency should be replaced by two new agencies with broadly expanded powers to modify or even disapprove construction plans in the park, the commission concluded.
 
Costs of Plan Are Unclear
New York State ''must not let the park be overwhelmed by the short-sighted interests that would destroy the forest industry and treat the park as a mere piece of saleable real estate,'' the commission's chairman, Peter A. A. Berle, said in a letter to the Governor that accompanies the report. Mr. Berle, a former state Assemblyman and Environmental Conservation Commissioner, is president of the National Audubon Society.
The cost of the commission's recommendations will almost certainly be disputed. For instance, the panel projects a present cost of about $200 million for land acquisition, gauging the cost of land at $300 an acre. But the purchases would be spread over several years, and rising land prices could push the ultimate cost to many times that level.
Under the 10-year environmental bond act that is set to go before the voters this fall, the state would have $800 million to spend on land acquisition across the entire state.
It is uncertain how much The attention Albany will devote to the Adirondacks this year. The Governor and legislative leaders are at impasse over the state budget, now more than a month overdue. They are also expected to face revisions of the state's welfare system and a plan for rescuing the state's troubled hospitals.
 
Back Country Called Endangered
The commission said that the Adirondack Park Act, passed in the early 1970's, which was largely designed to counteract an explosion of second-home developments in and around the park's hamlets, had failed to anticipate the dangers to the park's back country.
That act divided the park's private lands into six land-use classes. The largest category, known as resource management, covers about half the park's private lands and includes the most remote areas of the Adirondacks.
Present regulations allow one house or other building for each 42.7 acres of land in that category. But under the zoning laws advocated by the commission, each private owner would be allowed only one building for each plot of land up to 2,000 acres, and one for each 2,000-acre plot after that.
The chief effect of such a rule would be to discourage timber companies from selling land for housing developments, although some critics are likely to argue that the rule could create a new market for construction of huge private estates in the back country that would price out all but the wealthy and still disturb the wilderness.
The report includes a total of 245 recommendations. Among them are creation of an Adirondack community development corporation with limited bonding authority to build affordable housing and water and sewage systems.
Aside from development, the commission attacks other human intrusions in the Adirondack wilderness. It proposes rules that would set noise limits for the first time on snowmobiles, boats and aircraft, and recommends new controls in the park on placement, size and color of commercial and roadway signs.

HEADLINE: Mohawks' Border World Of Violence and Tradition

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y., May 4

 BODY:
On a bluff overlooking the St. Lawrence River, a group of Indian men in jeans and Army fatigues were standing near a charred 20-foot-high mural of the Mohawk Tree of Peace. It was painted on the side of a burned-out building.
They explained that their enemies had lobbed a firebomb into the building last week, and they sounded almost casual. By current standards this qualified as a relatively minor annoyance. 
What impassioned them was a gunfight Tuesday morning that had consumed 1,500 rounds of ammunition, by their count, and left two men dead, by the police's. David George Jr., a beefy 42-year-old bricklayer who is part of a faction opposed to gambling on the reservation, told of a nine-hour siege Monday night at his home 100 yards from the Canadian border. He said his attackers fired from woods on the American side.
''We heard the first shots while we were sitting watching a movie - 'A Man Called Horse,' about some Indian with some kind of trouble,'' he said. ''They were trying to scare us off the reservation with submachine guns, and they probably thought we just had bolt-action rifles. But we fired back all night with our own automatics. When it got light outside, a dozen of us charged up the hill, and those guys ran into the woods.''
''Man,'' said David Francis, a 29-year-old ironworker who was there, ''you would have thought you were in Afghanistan.''
The violence is hardly comparable, and the situation remained calm today as New York and Canadian police patrolled. But the Mohawks' 14,000-acre reservation on the St. Lawrence River does share similarities with the land near the Khyber Pass: a tribal territory where teen-agers carry AK-47 rifles, a border region where smuggling is a routine part of the economy and a place where feuding religious and political factions are united only in their hostility to outside governments.
Matters of law and jurisdiction are fuzzy on the reservation, which straddles the Canadian border. The reservation's casinos, considered illegal by the Federal Government but legal by many of the Mohawks, are the immediate cause of the current tension.
Indians who regard gambling as inimical to their culture set up road-blocks last month to shut down the flow of casino patrons. The roadblocks were attacked by other Indians with guns and bats, and the feuding continued last weekend with arson and bursts of automatic gunfire at night.
More than 500 mourners marched today behind a green hearse carrying the coffin of Matthew (Ty) Pyke, a member of the anti-gambling faction who was shot on the road near Mr. George's house. His allies blamed the killing on the Warrior Society, a group of several hundred men associated with the pro-gambling faction since they set up roadblocks last year to stop the state police from raiding the casinos.
The Warriors have denied any involvement in the killing and accused the anti-gambling faction of starting the recent violence. They also denied accusations that they are financed by casino owners.
''We are neither for nor against gambling,'' Kakwirakeron, a spokesman for the Warriors, said today. ''Our position is that it is up to the community, not outsiders, to decide the gambling issue. We intervened only to protect our sovereignty.''
 
Splits Within Splits
Sovereignty is the perennial grievance among those Mohawks who consider themselves an independent nation, but who have to contend with demands from five bordering national, state and provincial governments. And there was widespread resentment this week when hundreds of police entered the reservation while Canadian military units waited outside.
But the sovereignty issue - whether the Mohawks should recognize the authority of New York State and the Federal Government on their reservation - is complicated by a long-standing dispute over who should govern the reservation.
There are three tribal governments claiming authority on the reservation, where population estimates range from 7,000 to 9,000. Some Mohawks, many of them Christians, favor the two existing Councils of Chiefs - one in Canada, and one in New York - which are chosen by popular vote. Others, who practice the Mohawk Longhouse religion, favor the traditional council of appointed chiefs. These camps are split within themselves on the issue of gambling, which is why staunch traditionalists are found defending institutions like Tony's Vegas International Casino.
The casino's owner, Anthony Laughing, sees the issue in economic terms.
''There are 700 to 800 jobs at the casinos,'' he said. ''My payroll is $100,000 a week, and this controversy has kept the public away for five weeks. Tony Laughing can survive this. But my people need paychecks, and there are no other jobs. What's going to happen to them if we shut the casinos?''
Tony's Vegas casino was attacked last summer by a mob of Indians who wrecked slot machines and caused an estimated $400,000 in damage.
The casino owner, a genial man with four gold rings, said he could understand why some Indians objected to the profits and the ambience of his 24-hour casino, which features a waterfall, chandeliers, 150 blackjack tables, 25 slot machines and other games.
 
'The Finer Things'
''If others want to go back to the traditional way of life, fine,'' he said. ''Let them go off on their own. But let the rest of us have the finer things in modern life. Maybe I'm being materialistic, but as long as I earn the money I don't see anything wrong with it.''
Nor did he have any apologies for the source of the money he said built his casino: an illicit practice known as ''buttlegging.'' American Indians buy Canadian cigarettes, but without having to pay the stiff Canadian taxes, then smuggle them back across the border to be sold at discount prices to non-Indians on another Mohawk reservation south of Montreal. The international border is generally regarded as artificial by reservation residents, many of whom cross it regularly in the course of daily life.
''Some people call it smuggling,'' the casino owner said. ''I say that we just happened to start the free-trade zone before the U.S. and Canada ever got around to it.''
While some of those who oppose gambling have talked of returning to a traditional economy, most take jobs off the reservation, often in construction. They resent the casinos, the cigarette trade, and what they see as an increasing level of drug smuggling as new activities that are corrupting young Indians. They speak of an ''Indian Mafia'' intimidating the reservation.
''They never work a day, and they Mr. George. ''I worked around their houses, and I've seen them bringing garbage bags home full of bills.''
''If you don't do what they say, they'll slash your tires, then they'll shoot at your car, and then go after you,'' said Mr. Francis, the veteran of Tuesday's shoot-out. ''They've got so much money coming in. You see these little creeps driving around brand new cars and trucks, building swimming pools, and it makes you mad.''

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Chief of Air Command Questions Bush Plan to Cut Nuclear Missiles

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
Challenging Administration policy on strategic weapons, the head of the Strategic Air Command expressed doubt today about the feasibility of President Bush's latest proposal to reduce long-range nuclear arms.
The official, Gen. John T. Chain, said he did not think that the Soviet Union would go along with Mr. Bush's proposal to ban land-based missiles with multiple warheads because Moscow relied on such weapons.
At the same time, General Chain questioned whether the United States had the money to carry out the Bush proposal. The President's plan would require the development of new single-warhead Midgetman missiles, and General Chain indicated that he did not think that the Air Force had enough money for such weapons. 
 
Rare Open Discord
It is rare for military officers to openly question policy directions set by the White House and Secretary of Defense. The comments by General Chain and some other recent remarks by senior officers suggest that budget cuts as well as the broad changes in military policy under discussion have produced anxiety in military circles.
General Chain said he did not understand the objection to intercontinental ballistic missiles that carry multiple warheads.
''I don't see where MIRV'ed ICBM's are destabilizing,'' he told reporters at a breakfast meeting, using the acronym for multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles. His position was at variance with those of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, who support Mr. Bush's plan.
 
Emphasizing 'Stealth' Bombers
General Chain was more supportive of Mr. Cheney's plan to put MX missiles on rail cars than he was of the costly Midgetman program. But he indicated that he did not believe the rail-car plan was vital, adding that his top priority was the purchase of the B-2, or Stealth, bombers.
Mr. Cheney said last week that he was cutting production plans for the new bomber from 132 to 75 planes. The general said that he supported that decision but that additional cuts in the B-2 program were unacceptable.
The general said keeping the 10-warhead MX missile ''in a silo does not bother me at all.''
Pentagon officials said General Chain's concerns that the cost of the Midgetman and MX programs would use money needed for new aircraft are broadly shared by Air Force leaders. The Air Force's long-range budget proposals include only limited funds for the two missile programs, enough to continue development of the systems but not enough to deploy the weapons, Pentagon officials say.
Both missile programs have been endorsed by the White House, which says that mobile MX and Midgetman missiles would reduce the vulnerability of American strategic weapons to Soviet attack.
Earlier this week, Vice Adm. Richard M. Dunleavy, assistant chief of naval operations, told Congress that the Navy was basing its aircraft purchase plans on the assumption that it will have 14 carrier battle groups, even though Mr. Cheney has indicated that his preliminary conclusion is that 12 are needed.
Mr. Cheney and the military services are preparing the Pentagon's spending request for 1992. The military services' spending preferences are being expressed as they enter long discussions with Mr. Cheney about what the 1992 budget request should be.
In his wide-ranging comments, General Chain indicated that he had not been consulted about Mr. Bush's proposal to ban land-based missiles with multiple warheads.
 
Second Round of Cuts Proposed
The President secretly proposed the ban in March, as part of a second round of arms reductions that would follow the strategic arms treaty to be signed this year. But President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union complained that Mr. Bush's plan focused exclusively on land-based missiles.
General Chainnoted that the Soviet Union has invested substantial sums in land-based multiple-warhead missiles, including the SS-18 and SS-24, which each carry 10 warheads.
''I can't personally imagine the Soviets giving up SS-18's and SS-24's,'' he said, adding that the weapons are the centerpiece of the Soviets' land-based missile force.
General Chain indicated that he did not see any particular need for the United States to give up multiple-warhead land-based missiles, either.
He complained that the Midgetman missile program to develop a new single warhead land-based missile cost $25 billion for 500 missiles, discounting for the effects of inflation.
 
May Testify Against Treaty
The general said he would testify against Senate approval of the strategic arms treaty if Congress did not approve money for nearly all 75 B-2 bombers sought by the Pentagon. But he added, ''My support of arms control is not contingent on ICBM modernization.''
A civilian Pentagon official said the goal of General Chain's approach seemed to be increasing the number of warheads that the American military would have for an attack on the Soviet Union while reducing spending on mobile attack. Such an approach, this Pentagon official said, would make the United States too dependent on a policy of launching missiles upon notice that an attack was under way, creating the possibility of miscalculation.
Former Defense Secretary Harold Brown proposed in a speech Thursday night that United States and the Soviet Union slash their strategic forces to 3,000 warheads as part of a second treaty that would follow the strategic arms treaty under negotiation.
But General Chain asserted that reductions of that magnitude would be unacceptable. ''I am not a fan of Start-2,'' he said, using a common reference to a second treaty.
Peter Williams, Mr. Cheney's spokesman, expressed reluctance to comment on the general's remarks, saying he had not seen a transcript of his comments. Mr. Williams added: ''If we came unglued every time somebody in the Pentagon expressed their views, we would not be able to function. We have become accustomed to it.''

HEADLINE: Unemployment Rate Rises to 5.4 Percent

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The Labor Department reported today that the unemployment rate rose two-tenths of a point last month, to 5.4 percent, its highest level in more than a year, blunting fears of accelerated inflation and higher interest rates.
The latest data, which provided the first comprehensive view of economic performance in April, followed several recent reports indicating that both the economic pace and the inflation rate had quickened. The general reaction of economic analysts to today's figures was relief that the economy was in no near-term danger of overheating, thereby appearing to rule out any chance of a near-term tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
The bond market soared on what was clearly good news for it, while the stock market posted a modest advance as it weighed the benefit of lower interest rates against the possibility that a slack economy would cause more erosion in corporate profits. 
There were sobering elements in today's report, including a decline in the number of jobs when temporary census workers were excluded and the 12th fall in the number of factory jobs in the last 13 months. But the figures did not revive serious fears of recession.
 
No Sign of a Slump
''I don't see any sign that the economy has slumped,'' declared Richard D. Rippe, a senior economist at Dean Witter Reynolds.
In interpreting the data before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Commissioner of Labor Statistics Janet L. Norwood said that while the job market was weak last month, the rise in the unemployment rate did not signal any fundamental change.
For one thing, she said, ''the April jobless rate follows a down tick in March and remains very close to the rate that has prevailed over the last year and a half.'' For another, she added, ''thus far we can discern no meaningful change in the measures that might signal a deteriorating unemployment situation.''
Dr. Norwood also said there was no rise in either the number of newly unemployed - those out of work for less than five weeks - or the number of people who lost their last jobs.
 
Scant Increase in Jobs
Probably the most startling figure in today's report was the scant rise of 64,000 jobs in nonfarm sectors, far below estimates that centered on about 375,000 and went to well above 400,000.
Those making the projections may have underestimated the degree to which hefty job gains in January and February, when relatively warm weather aided construction, borrowed strength from succeeding months. Construction jobs fell 99,000 last month after seasonal adjustment, showing the effects of a dearth of winter layoffs.
It also appeared that economists had expected too many new jobs from hiring by the Census Bureau.
Dr. Norwood may have caused some confusion when she said last month that more than 200,000 census takers were expected to ''be added in April.'' But she was referring to the cumulative total of monthly hiring of 22,000 in January, 5,000 in February, 90,000 in March and 78,000 in April - a total of 195,000 spread over four months.
 
Factory Jobs Fall Again
Factory jobs fell another 22,000 last month, with the weakness concentrated in durable goods, particularly machinery, the department said. Although output has been maintained, manufacturing remained clearly in the doldrums. Nevertheless, the ranks of production workers in factory jobs showed a small increase last month. Samuel D. Kahan, an economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago, said this implied the cutbacks were in support staff, a further sign that American industry has become leaner and more competitive.
Factory jobs have declined by 280,000 since March 1989, the report showed. Last month 46.5 percent of 141 manufacturing industries added to payrolls, up from 44 percent in March but down from 49.3 percent in February.
Over all, gains in service jobs were modest except in Government, which added about 50,000 positions, not including the 78,000 at the Census Bureau. Health services added 46,000 jobs and retail trade increased by 24,000 jobs. The total of 179,000 new service jobs was partly offset by a decline of 115,000 in goods-producing jobs to achieve the net advance of 64,000.
 
Modest Rise in Payroll Earnings
The length of the average work week in the private sector was unchanged, but the factory work week declined by 12 minutes, to 40.6 hours, and factory overtime fell by the same amount.
There were still other factors in today's report that helped prevent worry about an economic decline. One was an upward revision in jobs for March to a gain of 103,000 instead of the 26,000 increase initially reported.
Another was the disclosure that both hourly and weekly payroll earnings rose a modest three-tenths of 1 percent in April, slightly less than in March, despite a rise in the minimum wage that took effect at the beginning of the month. This was regarded as likely to reassure the Federal Reserve that wages are not producing worrisome inflation pressures that need to be quickly countered.
The survey of households, on which the overall unemployment rate of 6.8 million was based, showed a decline of 218,000 in civilian jobs and a 57,000 rise in the labor force, a combination that raised the ranks of the jobless by 275,000.
At 5.4 percent, the jobless rate is at the highest level since January 1989, and the April increase was the first change of more than one-tenth of a point - enough to be considered statistically significant - since a three-tenths increase, to 5.3 percent, in April 1989.
Nationally, the overall jobless rate. which includes people in the military, also rose two-tenths of a point last month, to 5.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Soviets, Saluting U.S., Harden German Stand

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, May 4

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union today praised Washington's decision not to deploy advanced short-range nuclear weapons in Germany, but he said the move was not enough to make Moscow accept the membership of a united Germany in NATO.
In another indication of a general hardening of the Soviet position, Mr. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d failed to make any progress in three hours of talks toward resolving issues holding up completion of a treaty limiting long-range nuclear weapons.
The two sides had hoped to have such a treaty largely finished in time for the summit meeting on May 30 between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Now they will have just one more chance to overcome their differences when Mr. Baker goes to Moscow on May 16. 
Administration officials said the Soviets, who last month suddenly took back some concessions they had already made at the arms control bargaining table, showed no inclination to soften their positions.
 
Facing a Lot of Issues
On both the German question and arms control, Administration officials described Mr. Shevardnadze as a man who was clearly wrestling with a lot of issues right now, all of which involve some reduction of Soviet power in Europe from what Moscow was used to over the last 40 years. This seems to have paralyzed him and his colleagues in some ways.
Mr. Shevardnadze arrived in Bonn, along with Mr. Baker, to join the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain and East and West Germany in Saturday's first ''two plus four'' negotiations on how a united Germany should be integrated militarily and politically into a new Europe.
While the talks are called two-plus-four, officials say they really will be five against one. The two Germanys and the three victorious World War II Allies are together on one side of the table and the Soviets alone on the other, and the only real question between them is, What will the West pay the Soviets to get their troops out of East Germany expeditiously and to allow a united Germany to join NATO?
On the eve of the talks, the bargaining has already begun. Through a series of bilateral meetings today between Mr. Shevardnadze and members of the five delegations, Germany and its Western allies dangled various economic and security incentives in front of the Soviet Minister. But judging from his arrival statement he intends to drive a hard bargain.
 
Seeks Neutral Status
Mr. Shevardnadze continued in both public and private discussions to refuse to even consider the idea of the united Germany in NATO, insisting instead that it be effectively neutral by becoming a member of both NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
While praising the Bush Administration's decision to halt deployment of new short-range nuclear weapons in Germany, Mr. Shevardnadze said of a united Germany joining NATO: ''For such a giant to belong to one bloc will not create conditions for stability. We think a united Germany should be a factor for peace and stability in Europe.''
For now American and NATO officials are treating this as little more than an opening bargaining position, and insist that because the Soviets have such a weak hand in Europe that they will sooner or later have to reconcile themselves to Germany's being in NATO only.
Indeed, the diplomatic talk of Bonn today was not about Mr. Shevardnadze's public remarks but rather about an article in the daily newspaper Berliner Zeitung written by a military adviser to the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, Maj. Gen. Geli Batenin. General Batenin argued that a stable balance of power in Europe would best be insured by ''the incorporation of a unified Germany in the political organization of NATO.''
 
On Stationing of Forces
The Soviet general said NATO forces should not be extended into the eastern sector of a united Germany and that Soviet forces should remain there until a pan-European security system replaces both alliances.
The NATO position, agreed upon at a meeting of the alliance's Foreign Ministers in Brussels on Thursday, is that if the Soviets cooperate, NATO is prepared to offer Moscow a variety of security guarantees, including advancing the timetable for negotiations on the withdrawal of all American short-range nuclear weapons from Germany, including NATO guarantees not to deploy its forces in East Germany and NATO willingness to allow Soviet troops to remain in East Germany for a three- to five-year transition.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany followed up these military inducements to Moscow by holding out to Mr. Shevardnadze the prospect of a significant expansion in economic ties provided the Soviets cooperate on German unification, Mr. Kohl's spokesman Hans Klein said today.
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany also said in a radio interview that there could be ''versatile economic relations that would not be disadvantageous to the Soviet Union after German unification.''
Nevertheless, if Mr. Gorbachev really tries to hold up the process of unification by refusing to remove his 380,000 troops unless a united Germany remains effectively neutral, American and NATO officials say they will not hesitate to use this to undermine his carefully cultivated image as the most forward-looking statesman in Europe.
This, NATO officials say, is not an inconsiderable threat for Mr. Gorbachev at a time when his program at home has little to show for itself. He has been able to point to his successful transformation of the Soviet image in the world arena as a reason his people should continue supporting him.

HEADLINE: Evolution on Europe;
Bush Sees Revamped NATO As Core of Europe's Power

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STILLWATER, Okla., May 4

 BODY:
After opening the door for a revision of the Atlantic alliance, President Bush today gave a strong defense for using the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as the focus of Europe's security and for keeping the United States as the linchpin of the alliance in ''a new age of freedom.''
In a commencement speech at Oklahoma State University, Mr. Bush reaffirmed his commitment to cutting short-range nuclear missiles in Europe, negotiating larger cuts than currently planned in conventional forces, and moving NATO into a more political role.
But Mr. Bush insisted that American troops, nuclear weapons and political influence must remain on the Continent for the foreseeable future. He defended the need to maintain a unified military structure for the Atlantic alliance, even as the Warsaw Pact appears to be crumbling, by saying that Moscow's intentions remain unclear and that the Soviet Union will long remain a formidable military force in Europe. 
''President Gorbachev has made profound progress in his country, reforms so fundamental that the clock cannot be turned back,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech in which he seemed to be reaching for the vision of Europe's future that his critics have said was lacking from his foreign policy.
''Yet neither can we turn the clock ahead,'' he said, ''to know for sure what kind of country the Soviet Union will be in years to come.''
 
Emphasis on Europe
As he did on Thursday when he made his European arms control proposals, Mr. Bush said today that he wanted to broaden the role of the other, non-economic European group to which the United States belongs: the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes neutral nations and current Warsaw Pact members and has focused primarily on human rights.
''The C.S.C.E. should offer new guidelines for building free societies,'' Mr. Bush said, ''including setting standards for truly free elections, adopting measures to strengthen the rule of law and pointing the way in the needed but painful transition from centralized, command economies to free markets.''
Mr. Bush said he supported proposals to have ''regular consultations among senior representatives of the C.S.C.E. countries'' and said members of the organization should ''consider whether new C.S.C.E. mechanisms can help mediate and settle disputes in Europe.''
 
Gesture Toward Thatcher
Mr. Bush echoed a proposal made by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain that seemed intended as a political gesture toward Mrs. Thatcher when she is suffering politically at home and has lost some battles in the struggle over the future of NATO. Mrs. Thatcher had been a strong advocate of plans to modernize the short-range American nuclear missiles in West Germany; Mr. Bush canceled that program on Thursday.
Mr. Bush also praised Mrs. Thatcher, alone among the allied leaders, as ''one of freedom's greatest champions of the last decade.''
Mr. Bush's comments about the security conference were also a gesture to President Francois Mitterrand of France, who has been looking toward the institution as a new forum for political and security dialogue in Europe.
But Mr. Bush made it clear that he did not want the conference to have a role in military affairs and said the purpose of an expanded security conference would be to ''reinforce'' NATO politically, not replace it.
 
NATO as the Foundation
''My European colleagues want the United States to be a part of Europe's future,'' he said. ''I believe they are right. The United States should remain a European power in the broadest sense, politically, militarily and economically. And as part of our global responsibilities, the foundation for America's engagement in Europe has been, and will continue to be, NATO.''
Mr. Bush's speech was the first in a series of commencement addresses this spring in which he plans to discuss national security. Although he sought to look to the future, Mr. Bush drew his vision today out of the chaos of the post-World War I years, the firestorm of World War II and the superpower confrontation of the cold war.
''Throughout our history,'' he said, ''great upheavals in Europe have forced the American people to respond, to make deep judgments about the part we should play in European affairs,'' he said. ''I believe that, now, we are poised at another such moment, a critical time in our strategic relationship with our neighbors across the Atlantic.''
Acknowledging that the threat of Soviet aggression has faded as a justification for NATO, Mr. Bush said: ''Our enemy today is uncertainty and instability. So the alliance will need to maintain a sound, collective military structure with forces in the field backed by larger forces that can be called upon in a crisis.''
 
'Enduring Compact'
Mr. Bush said that even with major cuts in conventional armed forces and nuclear weapons, ''militarily significant U.S. forces must remain on the other side of the Atlantic for as long as our allies want and need them.''
''These forces demonstrate, as no words can, the enduring political compact that binds America's fate with Europe's democracies,'' he said.
Mr. Bush used slightly cooler language than in recent weeks in talking about Soviet internal politics.
''It will be crucial,'' he said, ''to see whether Moscow chooses coercion or peaceful dialogue in responding to the aspirations of the Lithuanian people and nationalities within the Soviet Union. The only noble answer lies in a dialogue that results in unencumbered self-determination for Lithuania.''
The comments did not signal a change in Mr. Bush's policy of supporting Lithuanian independence in principle, while declining to take sides. The incrementally stronger tone also seemed to lack any political risk, since it followed signs of an emerging compromise between Moscow and Vilnius.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
Views and Luxuries Draw Tourists to Trains

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
This summer, scenic and luxury train travel for comparatively modest prices will be unfurling the richness of the American landscape for thousands of vacationers. Travel agents say there are more choices for these trips than ever before, and more customers, too.
''Some of it is nostalgia, with people wanting to get back to the way things were before,'' said Dorothy Szymaszek, president of New Scotland Travel, a travel agency in Albany. ''Train rides are a very relaxed way to travel.'' 
''The big market is older people who have the time, plus the ones who don't like to fly,'' said Cynthia Newman, president of Waters Travel Service, a Washington travel agency.
It's a way to see the United States from a different perspective, said Clifford Black, a spokesman for Amtrak. ''You go through parts of the country that are virtually inaccessible by other means.''
And it can all be seen in comfort. Some observation cars have seats with large wraparound picture windows and translucent roofs that offer an unobstructed 360-degree view of the land during the day and the stars at night.
 
European Ambience
 Amtrak has a variety of scenic routes. Some travel companies are selling train trips with the ambience of European luxury trains like the Orient Express. Others are offering excursion trains on main lines or special tracks to provide a sense of how travelers moved around before automobiles and airplanes took over. Here are some of the trips being offered.
California Zephyr - This is the most popular of Amtrak's scenic routes. It's a 52-hour trip from Chicago to the San Francisco Bay Area. One-way coach fares are $196 for those who want to sleep in their seats. For more comfortable sleeping-car accommodations, with meals included, there are a variety of possibilities ranging in cost from an additional $280 (for an economy bedroom) to $589 (for a deluxe bedroom).
Coast Starlight - A 35-hour Amtrak ride from Los Angeles to Seattle costs $145 one-way in coach. To ride in a sleeper, add $159 to $330, meals included.
Adirondack - A 10-hour day trip aboard an Amtrak train from New York to Montreal by way of the Hudson River Valley and the shore of Lake Champlain costs $72. To ride in a custom-class car, with accommodations similar to those found in a parlor car, add $8 to the fare.
American-European Express - A new train company that began luxury-only service with a 17-hour run between Washington and Chicago last Nov. 15. A similar daily trip that takes 20 hours started Tuesday between New York and Chicago by way of Philadelphia. One-way fares range from about $500 in a compartment to about $1,500 in a presidential suite.
''We have a club car with a baby grand piano,'' said Barbara Schmidt, a vice president. ''And a paramount part of the trip is the food - a seven-course dinner, brunch, cocktail reception and tea.''
California Sun Express - This is a private rail car service from Los Angeles to Oakland. It was started about a month ago by Princess Railtours, a unit of Princess Cruises, at a cost of $179 one-way for two people. Along with the scenery, meals are a highlight of the 11-hour trip, with a number of seatings for dinner in the cruise-ship pattern.
Instead of using the trip for point-to-point rail transportation, travelers can take a mini-vacation package, stopping at San Luis Obispo, staying at the Inn at Morro Bay and touring the Hearst Castle for a total cost of $399 for two.
In addition to these trips, there are the scores of smaller tourist railroads across the country. They generally provide short trips, use historic equipment and run on small-town branch lines. Some of these trains are pulled by turn-of-the-century steam locomotives and others operate over narrow-gauge tracks.
Luxury train travel in the United States dates back to 1859 when the first Pullman service provided sleeping cars aboard railroads for long-distance travelers. In the early 1900's, trains like the Twentieth Century Limited provided pampered travel between New York and Chicago.
After World War II travelers took planes to speed things up. Passenger service became an albatross to the railroads, whose revenues and profits came from carrying freight, not people. And Americans who wanted to travel on their own schedule turned to the automobile.
 
'History Alive'
 In 1970 Congress created the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, known as Amtrak, to operate all regularly scheduled inter-city passenger train service in the continental United States. Since then its rail schedules and fares have been listed in the airline computer systems used by travel agents. And railroading has again attracted large numbers of travelers.
''More than four million passengers rode aboard historic or scenic trains in 1989,'' said Mark Smith, publisher of Locomotive & Railway Preservation Magazine. ''It's amazing what a chord railroading strikes in people. This is history alive.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Decline; U.S. Report on Jobs Is Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against all major currencies except the Japanese yen after the Government said the United States unemployment rate for April rose to its highest level in more than a year.
The jobless rate rose to 5.4 percent in April from 5.2 percent in March.
''That seemed to be what set it off,'' Mike Ballow, a currency market analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said of the dollar's decline. 
Signs of economic weakness, like higher unemployment, might cause the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates. Lower rates would reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments, compared with those for other currencies.
Traders right now are ''only concentrating on interest rates,'' said Walter Simon, a vice president at Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York.
Also working against the dollar was a rise in bond prices, which sent bond yields lower, Mr. Simon said.
In addition, traders said the dollar's fall was hastened when the price crossed certain technical support levels in relation to other currencies.
Against the West German currency, the dollar fell in New York to 1.6660 marks from 1.6828.
The British pound was also more expensive, costing $1.6635 in New York, up from Thursday's $1.6410. Earlier in the day, the pound had moved higher in London, rising to $1.6595, from $1.6425 late Thursday.
The dollar also fell against the French franc, the Swiss franc, the Italian lira and the Canadian dollar.
Against the Japanese currency, however, the dollar bought 158.30 yen, up from 158.05 yen a day earlier. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday, but earlier in London the dollar also gained, trading at 158.25 yen, up from 158.10 yen late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.4430 Swiss francs, down from 1.4550; 5.5930 French francs, down from 5.6450; 1,221 Italian lire, down from 1,233.25, and 1.1629 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16625.
Gold prices were mixed. Bullion fell 50 cents, to $370.90 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $371.30 an ounce, unchanged from Thursday.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $371.45, from $370.65 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold closed at $371, up from $370.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.69 to close at $372.76 an ounce.
Silver for current delivery rose to $5 an ounce, from $4.998 late Thursday, on the Commodity Exchange. Silver in London had a late bid of $5.05 an ounce, up from $5.04 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Norton's Net Down 36.4%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WORCESTER, Mass., May 4

 BODY:
The Norton Company, which spent many weeks fighting a hostile takeover bid, said today that its first-quarter profits fell 36.4 percent, mainly because of losses stemming from its operations in Brazil, which has been suffering from a recession.
Norton, a leading maker of abrasives and engineering materials, said its net income totaled $19.4 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $30.5 million, or $1.45 a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Revenues totaled $414.4 million, up 6.7 percent from $388.2 million a year earlier.
Last month Norton agreed to be acquired by Compagnie Saint-Gobain of France, one of the world's leading glass makers, for $90 a share, or $1.8 billion. The move staved off a $1.6 billion hostile bid by BTR P.L.C. of Britain.
Norton declined to comment on how the battle against BTR would affect earnings for the year.
Norton's stock was unchanged today at $88.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Interest Rates Fall On Job Data

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Interest rates plunged yesterday, as prices of Treasury securities soared in response to news of an unexpectedly small increase in nonfarm employment in April. Only 64,000 non-farm jobs were added in April, and the unemployment rate rose by two-tenths of 1 percent, to 5.4 percent, its highest level in 15 months.
Those who invest in fixed-income debt viewed the jobs data as precluding any moves by the Federal Reserve to force up interest rates. This latest sign of a weakening economy was also seen as lessening inflationary pressures. Rising interest rates and inflation are the two major fears of investors in fixed-income securities. 
But the bond market's euphoria was tempered by fears that a weaker domestic economy would undermine the dollar, which fell after the employment figures were released. The sharp decline in interest rates also raised concerns that bidders at next week's Treasury auctions of $30.5 billion of notes and bonds might be less enthusiastic than they seemed to be earlier this week.
 
Explosion in Demand
 But yesterday demand for Treasury securities and other fixed-income issues exploded soon after the Government's monthly employment report was released at 8:30 A.M. As prices rose, many dealers and others who had sold Treasuries short earlier rushed to buy out of their positions, before their losses grew.
Despite some afternoon profit taking, late trading found the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.5 percent issue maturing in 2020, being offered at 96 21/32, up 1.5 points on the day, or $15 for each $1,000 of face value. As a result, the long bond's yield tumbled to 8.82 percent from 8.97 percent the day before and from 9.02 percent a week ago.
''Although the long end of the Treasury market posted strong gains, most investors were more interested in the shorter maturities, now that the surprisingly small growth in April jobs has virtually eliminated any possibility of credit tightening by the Fed,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
 
Increase Was Expected
 What stunned many market participants, Mr. Sullivan added, was that ''the consensus in the Street was that the recent hirings of census workers would result in a rise in April nonfarm employment by roughly 400,000 people. Moreover, the data show that non-farm payrolls were actually down by 14,000 or so last month.''
The lessening of fears that the Fed would tighten credit was one major reason for the strong interest in short-term Treasury issues. Any move by the central bank to tighten or loosen credit has an impact most immediately on the short end of the Treasury market.
For example, a week ago, when many expected the Fed to force up interest rates, the spread between 90-day Treasury bills and the long bond was 1.25 percentage points. Late yesterday, the spread had shrunk to one percentage point after the discount rate on the 90-day bills dropped 10 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.76 percent; six-month bills fell 16 basis points, to 7.82 percent, and the one-year bills plunged 22 basis points, to 7.83 percent.
Meanwhile, the yields plunged on the refunding issues, which traded on a when-issued basis. The yield on $10.5 billion of three-year notes, which are to be auctioned on Tuesday, dropped to 8.75 percent from 9 percent, while the outstanding 8 3/8's of 1993 climbed by 17/32, to 99 1/32, for a yield of 8.77 percent.
The $10 billion of 10-year notes slated for sale Wednesday fell to 8.80 percent from 8.98 percent in when-issued trading, while the outstanding 8 1/2's of the year 2000 jumped 1 2/32, to 97 26/32, for a yield of 8.83 percent. The yield on the new 30-year long bonds, which will be auctioned on Thursday, declined to 8.79 percent from 8.94 in when-issued trading, three basis points below the yield of 8.82 percent on the outstanding long bonds.
Mr. Sullivan and other credit market experts were unsure just how much of an impact the decline in Treasury yields would have on next week's pivotal quarterly refunding auctions. All Japanese markets were closed yesterday in observance of Children's Day, a national holiday. ''One thing in the Treasury's favor is that yields on West German and Japanese Government bonds have been falling,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
 
West German Yield Down
 The yield on the West German 10-year bonds dropped 29 basis points yesterday, to 8.51 percent, or 32 basis points below the yield on the Treasury's 10-year notes. The last quoted yield on 10-year Japanese bonds was 7.42 percent.
Another question that may be answered at next week's Treasury refunding, Mr. Sullivan said, was how much damage the April employment data did to the dollar. Many European foreign exchange houses had already closed for the weekend when Washington released the data.
The Fed did not intervene in the money market yesterday, largely because the bedrock cost of credit, the rate that banks charge each other for brief loans, eased slightly, to 8 1/8 percent from 8 3/16 percent. Dealers said the lower funds rate indirectly reflected the smaller-than-expected increase in Treasury balances from tax receipts. When these balances decline, as they invariably do, they tend to drain lendable reserves from the banking system.

HEADLINE: Seidman Vows to Set His Own Exit Date

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
The unusual public negotiations between L. William Seidman and the White House continued today, with the manager of the savings and loan bailout insisting that he would pick the time of his departure.
In his first extensive public comments on the question, Mr. Seidman said that President Bush ''did not ask me to leave'' and ''did not encourage me to leave'' and that the timing ''is truly my decision.''
The remarks, seen as an attempt by Mr. Seidman to maintain his dignity while not defying the President, capped a week in which comments by White House officials and President Bush himself made it clear that the Administration would like Mr. Seidman to leave well before his term ends in October 1991.
Mr. Seidman's comments came after his appearance before a House Banking Committee panel on the savings and loan bailout. As chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, he is also chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created by Congress to administer the bailout and spend at least $50 billion over the next two years. 
The F.D.I.C. chief, who is highly regarded in Congress both for his skill as a banking regulator and his candor about the size of the savings crisis, has frequently clashed with top officials at the Treasury and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff. Industry experts say Mr. Sununu and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady are leading the effort to force Mr. Seidman out.
Mr. Seidman has been a thorn in the side of the Administration for some time. During talks over the bailout legislation, Mr. Seidman broke with the Administration by seeking added powers for his agency. In addition, he persuaded Congress to approve a measure that would prevent the President from arbitrarily removing the head of the F.D.I.C. Mr. Seidman has also been outspoken in saying that the Administration's estimates of the bailout's costs are low and that Treasury officials have intervened excessively in the day-to-day running of the bailout.
On Thursday, President Bush, in an attempt to mute Congressional and industry criticism of the White House's increasing pressure on Mr. Seidman, both praised him and made his departure final by saying that he heartily agreed with Mr. Seidman's recommendation that his successor be the Federal Reserve Board's chief banking regulator, William Taylor. Mr. Taylor is on loan from the Fed to serve as chief executive of the oversight board of the Resolution Trust Corporation.
Mr. Seidman said today that he would remain at least until the end of June, a date he has set to complete a plan by the trust corporation to sell or liquidate 141 ailing institutions at a cost to the public of almost $57 billion. But Mr. Seidman left open the possibility that he might stay longer.
''President Bush did not speed up my decision,'' he said. ''I have been saying for several months that I planned to leave once the R.T.C. is up and running,'' but he added that he would decide when that time is.
Until the so-called June 30 project is completed, he said, ''I will not think about what I am going to do.''
 
Praise From Panel Members
 In Mr. Seidman's appearance before the House panel, which has in the past received him warmly, the tone was somber.
''One of the bright spots in this whole mess has been Mr. Seidman,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat from Brooklyn. ''The Administration should be on its hand and knees begging you to stay.''
Mr. Seidman cautioned the lawmakers against expecting quick results from the savings and loan rescue, saying that even a year from now the end will not be in sight.
''Don't be impatient,'' he told lawmakers with a hint of nostalgia. ''This is a long, hard job. It isn't going to be accomplished anytime soon.''
 
Warning on Interest Rates
 Mr. Seidman pointed to a recent rise in interest rates as a double threat.
First, the increased borrowings by the Treasury that are needed to finance the rescue push up interest rates, putting pressure on consumers and the economy. Then, higher interest rates generally translate into lower real estate values, which increases the bailout's cost to the taxpayer.
''The real pain of what is taking place, on everything from increased Government borrowing to the effect on real estate markets, is still being felt,'' Mr. Seidman said. ''I think it is very important that no one expect by this time next year we'll all feel great.''
As he has in the past, Mr. Seidman stressed that the losses in the savings and loan industry, which are increasing at a rate of $28 million a day, will not be stemmed until all the real estate acquired by Resolution Trust has been sold to the private sector.
 
Price Cutting Is Planned
 To speed up asset sales, the agency has significantly liberalized its sales guidelines to allow considerable markdowns on property that is not selling well.
He reiterated that the bailout was almost certain to cost more than the Bush Administration has predicted. He took exception, however, to the estimates by Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, who last month said the cost of the bailout, plus interest expenses on the borrowings, could be as much as $500 billion during a 30-year period.
''It's like buying a $100,000 house and saying that it really is $300,000 because you are taking out a mortgage on it,'' Mr. Seidman said.
At the hearing, lawmakers lavished praise on the F.D.I.C. chairman, gave cautious support to Mr. Taylor and asked Mr. Seidman what advice he had for Mr. Taylor.
''The first thing I'd say is take a hard look before accepting the job,'' he said. ''And don't expect a lot of praise.''

HEADLINE: Lagging African Economies Perplex Aid Organizations

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 4

 BODY:
Even though aid programs pump $15 billion a year into sub-Saharan Africa, the living standards of the region's 450 million people have declined in the 30-odd years since its independence.
Now the area, whose troubles have been frustrating global economic managers and challenging traditional thinking about development for some time, is competing with Eastern Europe for scarce world capital.
''I often hear Africans express a fear that they will be forgotten, or marginalized: this fear is not unreal,'' warns Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Preliminary sessions of the spring meetings of the fund and the World Bank, the continent's main providers of money, started today. Among the subjects before the formal sessions, which open Monday, is: what to do with Africa. 
To avoid ''marginalization,'' the donors are calling for a much bigger effort by the Africans themselves, increasingly linking the flow of funds both to policy changes by African governments and to more governmental accountability to the governed. Under a proposal that is chiefly the idea of the Bush Administration, which the I.M.F. membership of more than 150 governments is expected to consider, countries that are in arrears - almost half of which are in Africa - risk losing their voting rights in the organization.
Some African leaders join the industrialized nations in supporting the linkage between aid and accountablity. One is President Abdou Diouf of Senegal, who said, ''Africa requires not just less government but better government.''
Along with such countries as the Central African Republic, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea and Mauretania, Senegal has started a comprehensive program of administrative changes. The programs aim at improving the civil service through competitive entrance examinations, regular staff appraisals and selective improvements in the pay structure.
''I fear that many of Africa's leaders have been more concerned about retaining power than about the long-term development interests of their people,'' said Barber B. Conable Jr., the World Bank's president, who criticized the region's autocratic political systems, as well as the ''nepotism'' and ''corruption'' that arise from them.
Conditions in Zaire illustrate the difficulties. Many African experts believe that President Mobutu Sese Seko has worsened Zaire's poverty by diverting well over $5 billion of state money into his personal accounts and assets abroad, including a 16th-century castle in Spain, a 32-room palace in Switzerland and estates in Portugal and Italy.
 
Voice for People Urged
 ''The only way to halt the continued impoverishment of the African people is to give them a voice in making decisions that affect their livelihood,'' said Kofi K. Apraku, a Ghanaian-born professor of economics at the University of North Carolina. Noting that Africans must do more to help themselves, Pierre Beregevoy, the French Finance Minister, said that in the competition for capital it was important to improve conditions for foreign investors. He added that the Africans should start by offering safe and remunerative savings for their own citizens.
Bush Administration officials also see much room for self-help. ''There's been capital flight, lack of performance, an unwillingness to change policies,'' a senior Treasury official said. ''I'm not saying it's all their fault, but theirs is an important part of the deficiency.''
On the list of policy changes sought by the World Bank and the I.M.F. are the phasing out of the more than 3,000 so-called ''parastatal'' or governmental enterprises, most of which lose money and fail to deliver adequate services; the simplification of customs procedures, legal systems and tax regimes; the deregulation of prices, interest rates and foreign exchange, and added scope for market mechanisms and the private sector.
 
Programs Are Criticized
 Many such measures are incorporated in so-called structural adjustment programs being put into effect by some 30 African countries under the guidance of the World Bank and the monetary fund, the two large lending organizations founded 45 years ago at Bretton Woods, N.H. But not all Africans are happy about the situation.
''Many Africans claim that the Bretton Woods institutions today exercise more power over Africa than the colonial authorities could ever have dreamt of during the colonial era,'' said Adebayo Adedeji, a Nigerian who is the executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa.
The proposal to cut off voting rights for countries in arrears illustrates the point. As of last Jan. 31, the monetary fund reported, arrears of more than six months amounted to $3.4 billion, more than $500 million of which was more than three years overdue.
 
Contributions Could Be Sold
 To get their voting rights restored, the governments would have to undertake even more closely supervised economic changes. Should they fail to live up to their obligations, the hard currency or gold that these countries had contributed to the monetary fund when they became members could be sold to satisfy the fund's claims against them.
Five of the 11 countries in arrears are African: Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, the Sudan and Zambia. The other six are Guyana, Honduras, Kampuchea, Panama, Peru and Vietnam.
With a surge in debt in the last two decades, from $6 billion in 1970 to $134 billion in 1988, most experts agree that there is little likelihood that the African debt will be repaid.

BYLINE: By JOAN COOK

 BODY:
Jean Sovatkin Picker, a former United States delegate to the United Nations, died yesterday at her home in Camden, Me., after a long illness. She was 69 years old. 
Mrs. Picker was appointed a delegate by President Johnson in 1968. She was reappointed special senior adviser to the delegations to six subsequent General Assemblies and to eight sessions of the Economic and Social Council under Presidents Nixon and Ford.
Mrs. Picker was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Smith College. She went to work for Life magazine as a researcher and became a member of the editorial board and a correspondent.
Her association with the United Nations began in 1953, when she became a volunteer lecturer with its Office of Public Information.
From 1958 to 1968, she was a member of the Committee of Correspondence, which trained women from poorer countries for leadership roles.
 
Friend of Eleanor Roosevelt
In 1978, Mrs. Picker became director of the United Nations Association of the United States, an independent group founded by Eleanor Roosevelt to educate others about the nature and function of the United Nations.
In 1955, she collaborated with Mrs. Roosevelt to write ''The United Nations: What You Should Know About It.'' The collaboration became a friendship, and in 1973, she wrote ''Eleanor Roosevelt: Her Day.''
In 1988, Mrs. Picker became the first recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Leadership Award for her commitment to international cooperation.
She is survived by her husband, Harvey Picker, dean emeritus of the School of International Affairs at Columbia University, and two daughters, Frances Mrachek of Newton, Mass., and Gale Picker of Falls Church, Va.

HEADLINE: The Talk of Little Italy;
A CHANGING LITTLE ITALY SAYS NO TO A HOTEL

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
Squeezed between Chinatown, SoHo and the tip of the government zone of lower Manhattan, Little Italy has always fought to hold its distinctive head high, acknowledging that parking on its narrow streets is next to impossible but proud that its crime rate is low and that the neighbors still know one another, usually three or four generations back.
But the cultural and economic forces reshaping much of the city are changing Little Italy, too. While tourists still flock to the area for pasta and cappuccino, much of what was once Italian owned has been sold to Chinese investors over the last 15 years; many buildings named for places or families in Italy now bear signs painted in bold red Chinese characters.
In the northwest end of the neighborhood, spreading downtown chic has fostered condominiums and restaurants where pasta is a fashionable option instead of a staple.
Now comes a proposal for a seven-story 156-room hotel and residents are saying, enough. They say that the building would ruin the neighborhood, and that what should rise up instead is affordable housing for people who want to stay where they were born. 
''They should build an apartment house for people,'' said Freddy Landano, a retiree who sat inside Esposito Meats on Mulberry Street during the slow hours of a recent afternoon. ''A lot of people are looking for rooms.''
More than 100 residents showed up for a meeting last month to protest the hotel, said Anne A. Compoccia, who grew up in Little Italy and is the vice president of its Chamber of Commerce, even though she now lives in TriBeCa. ''We don't want it to become a den of iniquities for pimps, prostitutes, whatever,'' she said. ''We believe this hotel will be the destruction of the community, and we don't want it.''

''We don't want it to become a den of inequities for pimps, prostitutes, whatever,'' she said. ''We believe this hotel will be the destruction of the community, and we don't want it.''
The hotel, to be built at the southeast corner of Baxter and Hester Streets, is permitted under area zoning, said Martha Ritter, a spokeswoman for the Department of City Planning. Frank Marino, a spokesman for Chatwal Hotels, the chain that plans to build the hotel, said construction is expected to begin later this year. Chatwal builds mid-range hotels sometimes affiliated with franchises like Days Inns.
''Our aim is to work with the community,'' said Barry S. Mann, the chain's president, who has attended neighborhood meetings about the hotel. ''We want to be part of the community. I told them I would like to give preference on employment to local residents. One gentleman said he doesn't expect anybody in Little Italy to be looking for a job as a maid.''
Some residents said the hotel might be an asset to the area. ''It would probably bring more people around spending money,'' said Dino Forzano, who owns Forzano's Italian Imports, where shoppers can buy manicotti makers, espresso machines, spaghetti-western soundtracks and socks decorated with maps of Italy. ''There are really no hotels around here, except those places on the Bowery.''
Others said they doubted any traveler would want to stay where the hotel is to be built. ''Baxter Street is garbage trucks all night long,'' said Sal Lapolla, a retired former proprieter of a Mulberry Street liquor store. He lives in an apartment that backs up on Baxter Street. ''Two o'clock in the morning they start, then every half-hour after that until 7. They're stationary for 15 minutes - clung-clung, clung-clung -then they race their motors to get the electricity back. It's unbearable.''
Noise will not be a problem, Mr. Mann said. ''We'll have double Thermopane soundproof windows,'' he said, ''similar to those found in airport hotels.''
 
'Really Little China'
 There have been links between China and Italy at least as far back as Marco Polo. But an increase in Chinese immigration and a flow of capital from Hong Kong, China and Taiwan has steadily widened the boundaries of Chinatown - at Little Italy's expense, some say.
''This is really Little China,'' said Anthony Luna, whose family has operated a neighborhood restaurant on Mulberry Street bearing the family name since 1878. ''I don't know why they call it Little Italy.''
Along Mulberry Street, Mr. Luna points out ghosts of former businesses. Outside one storefront, where ''Marconi 118'' is spelled in the sidewalk with what look like marbles, he said: ''This used to be an Italian restaurant. Now it's a Chinese beauty parlor.''
Gennaro's Grocery, on Mott Street, is one of the few Italian-owned businesses left there. ''We always had Chinese here,'' said Virginia Gennarao, the proprieter's wife, but ''not as many as after they lifted the immigration.''
''The Chinese have brought economy to the neighborhood,'' she said. ''That building over there was half empty. Now it's full of factories.'' The Italian neighborhood is getting smaller but it is not about to disappear, said Miss Compoccia, whose parents own a cafe there. ''It's shrinking, but it's coming back with a different face,'' she said. ''The Irish were here before the Italians. It's a process, and it's not such a terrible thing.''
Do the two most recent groups get along? It depends on who is talking. ''I don't think there are two ethnic communities that get along as well as the Chinese and the Italians,'' Miss Compoccia said.
But others express dissatisfaction. ''The Italians don't get nothing here,'' said an Italian woman who would not give her name but who said she had been in New York since 1910. ''We're left out. You know why? Because we don't cry and we don't complain.''
Mr. Luna said that not long ago a Chinese buyer offered his family several million dollars for a 19th century stable its owns in the neighborhood. The family sold to someone else, someone family members knew, he said. ''We stick together,'' Mr. Luna explained. ''We Italians don't want to sell anymore to the Chinese. We want to keep it Little Italy.''
 
Cigar-Smoking Retirees
 A daily arrival of tourists on its doorsteps is what keeps the neighborhood going. They come to sample Neapolitan cuisine, to sip small cups of coffee at sidewalk cafes and to search for the ultimate Italian dessert - sometimes after dining in Chinatown.
On a recent night along Mulberry Street several dozen teen-age girls from Half Hollow Hills East High School on Long Island surged into a restaurant, then a pastry shop. Limousines dropped off people on dates. Two neighborhood women sat on a stoop drinking cappuccino from big porcelain mugs as they kept an eye on a toddler. A Muslim family, the grandmother draped in white, perused menus in search of a prosciutto-free meal. A social club with religious statues in the window spilled cigar-smoking retirees out onto the sidewalk.
Richard Widenes, visiting from the Netherlands, said there were plenty of Italians in his native country but no Little Italy. ''We have a lot of pizzerias,'' he said.
 
Oh, That Al Brown
 It helps to be an insider in Little Italy. A cafe near the north end of Mulberry Street had a sign in the window advertising the place as the ''Shrine to Al Brown.''
Who was Al Brown? ''He's the brother of Jimmy Brown,'' said one of two men sitting inside the cafe one hot afternoon. Then he slammed the door.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
SOVIETS UNYIELDING ON A NEW GERMANY IN WESTERN ORBIT

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, May 5

 BODY:
The major combatants of World War II opened formal talks on German reunification today with the Soviet Union emphasizing that it did not intend to let a united Germany slide easily into the Western orbit.
Moscow stated its disagreement with the West on several aspects of unification, but all participants agreed that German unity must not be hindered.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d seemed to reflect this mood when he said, ''Today we engage in an act of reconciliation, of a people too long separated, of a Continent too long divided.''
 
Meetings Last Seven Hours
The Secretary spoke as he gathered with the foreign ministers of the two Germanys, the Soviet Union, Britain and France for the first full ministerial meeting of what have been dubbed the ''two plus four'' talks. The meetings lasted seven hours and were held at the Foreign Ministry in Bonn. 
From the outset, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union signaled that Moscow, despite the disintegration of its Warsaw Pact and all its internal problems, would bargain hard for its views in the coming months.
Using some of the most categorical language on the issue to date, Mr. Shevardnadze rejected the idea of a single Germany joining the North Atlantic alliance, and he said the full gamut of military and political issues involved in unification had to be resolved before Moscow would sign any agreement.
 
Differences Played Down
At the same time, he seemed to take pains to indicate that Moscow did not intend to hold up the talks or German unity. At the news conference held by the six ministers on the end of their talks, Mr. Shevardnadze acknowledged that some ''serious differences'' had been aired, but he emphasized that these ''need not be dramatized,'' that ''this is usual for the negotiating process.''
''Happily, we have no problem with any sort of allergy to the wishes of the German nation to unity,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said in his opening comments, indirectly scoffing at reports that the notion of German unification was painful to the Soviets.
There was a sense among Western officials that some of Mr. Shevardnadze's tough talk may have been intended at least in part to assuage conservative critics in the Soviet Union, who have chafed at the idea of letting the Germanys unite and join the Western camp after the sacrifices made by the Soviet people in World War II. Mr. Shevardnadze explicitly noted the opposition in his opening statement, when he said German membership in NATO was also unacceptable for internal reasons. ''The population of our country, which sustained such frightening losses in the last war, cannot accept the idea of including Germany in NATO,'' he said.
More broadly, he appealed to the West to understand the difficulty that Soviet politicians faced on an issue that carried an enormous emotional burden. ''We are dealing here with an issue of special importance to Soviet people, to our whole society,'' he said. ''If an attempt is made to push us into a corner on matters touching our security, it will lead to a situation - I will say it candidly -in which our political flexibility would be severely curtailed, because emotions would boil up inside the country, shades of the past would rise to the surface, national complexes with roots in the tragic pages of our history would be revived.''
Mr. Shevardnadze's position confirmed expectations that the negotiations could in effect prove to be ''one plus five,'' with the Soviet Union using one of its last remaining levers in Europe - its victor's rights in Germany - to preserve whatever it could by way of political, military and economic influence on a Continent increasingly facing westward.
 
Balance of Power Stressed
German membership in NATO, Mr. Shevardnadze declared, ''would very concretely affect our security interests, it would mean an acute violation of the balance of power in Europe, it would create for us a dangerous military-strategic situation.''
Moscow has in the past resisted the Western plan to incorporate Germany in NATO. The Western position, expressed in opening comments by Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, is that it is not for the wartime Allies to decree what alliance a sovereign, united Germany could or could not join.
The broader disagreement between Moscow and the West that emerged from the opening statements was the scope of the ''two plus four'' talks. The Western position was that the allies were meeting only, as Mr. Baker put it, ''to arrive at a formula by which we will terminate and transfer all remaining four-power rights and responsibilities to a fully sovereign Germany.''
Other issues, such as the military and security structures in the Germany and the Europe of the future, could be discussed, but on these the ''two plus four'' should act only as a ''steering committee,'' channeling the various issues to appropriate forums or arms talks.
 
'Package Approach' Sought
The position staked out by Mr. Shevardnadze was that the ''two plus four'' must adopt what he described as a ''package approach.'' There would be no agreement, he said, until the participants had resolved all the ramifications of unification - including the military status and the military forces of the united Germany, the presence of foreign forces on German soil, German renunciation of atomic, bacteriological and chemical weapons and renunciation of fascist ideology.
''We believe that it would be in the interests of Germany itself if the termination of four-power rights would be the culminating step in German unification,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said.
Mr. Shevardnadze reiterated the Soviet position that Europe has to move toward broad new European security structures to replace the military blocs. To this end, he proposed the immediate creation of a ''pan-European center for the elimination of the military threat'' in Berlin, based in part on existing Allied institutions.
The center, he said, would serve as a control and observation post for all military activities on German soil, and the ''first block'' in the building of new security structures.
The proposal echoed Mr. Baker's idea of setting up a center for conflict resolution under the auspices of all-European Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. But the Soviet idea of a pan-European agency controlling all troops in Germany was certain to be rejected by the Western powers and Germany as a revival of special treatment for Germany.
 
Agenda Is Formulated
These differences, however, had not been unexpected at the opening session. Officials from all sides stressed that the ministers had found no disagreement on the principle business of the day, the agenda for their talks. This included:
* The borders of a future Germany, which all the participants agreed would be the territory of West Germany, East Germany and Berlin - ''no more, no less.''
* Political-military questions, an area likely to produce the most serious disagreements.
* Ending four-power authority over Berlin.
* Preparing a ''final settlement'' under international law under which the four Allied powers would terminate their rights and responsibilities for Germany. Moscow at one point had indicated it that might hold out for a formal peace treaty - which the Germans resist as a humiliating exercise that would have to involve the many other nations that formally declared war on the Third Reich - but Mr. Shevardnadze signaled that Moscow would settle for a less formal ''final settlement'' with the four allied powers.
 
Poland to Join Later Talks
The six ministers also agreed to allow Poland to take part in the third foreign ministers' meeting, scheduled for July in Paris, when its borders would be discussed. After initial resistance, Bonn agreed this year to let the Poles sit in on discussions of its western border.
Reading a statement agreed to by the ministers, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German Foreign Minister and the host of the first round of ministerial talks, said, ''I can state that the talks have been taking place in a reasonable, constructive and trustful atmosphere and that they were dominated by the will for understanding.''
In his opening comments, however, Mr. Genscher and the East German Foreign Minister, Markus Meckel, cautiously stayed clear of the disagreements between Moscow and the Western powers.
Mr. Genscher did stress that relations with the Soviet Union ''will continue to be of primary importance,'' underscoring what has been an unstated theme of the talks. The sense in Bonn is that one of Moscow's aims in the unification process is to secure guarantees that a united Germany will honor all East German trade obligations, and that Germany will provide economic assistance to the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Life and Death On 129th Street
A special report.;
In Harlem, Death Is an Old and Busy Neighbor

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
Fred Quinn, a butcher when he can find work, has lost three brothers to the Harlem streets before they reached middle age.
The first, who was shooting drugs, died of heart failure when he was 34. ''He took a sip of wine and just dropped dead right on 130th Street.''
His youngest brother was 32 when he was shot twice in the head and dumped in a cemetery. His body lay in the morgue for three weeks, a John Doe tag around his toe. 
The third brother had cirrhosis and cancer; his 42-year-old heart simply gave out. ''Now it's just me and my sister left.''
Fred Quinn is 49 years old, accent on the ''old.''
Death comes early on his block - 129th Street between Park and Madison Avenues - this block of faded row houses and city-owned tenements, of abandoned buildings and vacant lots, of unemployment and dying dreams. Indeed, death comes earlier here in Harlem than anywhere else in New York City. According to a recent study by two doctors from Harlem Hospital, the death rate for blacks under the age of 65 in central Harlem was nearly three times that of American whites; in some of the hardest-hit pockets of the neighborhood, it was almost four times as high. On balance, life is longer in Bangladesh.
Death comes early here - and throughout America's Harlems -in complex ways.
Drugs and guns are common killers, though the leading causes of death in central Harlem are cancer, heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver. The causes can be found in the life of this block: in the unemployed men on the sidewalks, in the crumbling bathroom walls, in the prospering numbers parlors and in a psychology of survival where tomorrow is something to worry about only if it comes.
''The bottom-line problem is poverty,'' said Dr. Harold P. Freeman, a past president of the American Cancer Society and co-author of the study with Dr. Colin McCord. ''People who are intensely poor have other priorities. People think present tense. They don't think future. They think about making it through the day. People are fighting for their lives.''
They are people like Runette Carter, watching over her 6-year-old daughter as she plays on the stoop, and Woodrow Samuels, repairing his hot-dog truck and hoping it will be ready for the summer. They are people like Alana Crawford, heading for the numbers hole to keep her soup-kitchen meal out of the rain, and the sad-faced man over there, who, Mr. Samuels says, ''loves to drink too damn much.''
And they are people like Clarence Andrews, the man on the corner with the Yankees cap pulleddown against the sun. He has been out of work more than a year and spends the day riding a bicycle with a broken handlebar through the neighborhood where he grew up.
''When I was coming up it was old people dying,'' he said. ''It's changed. The oldest person who died that I remember, and she wasn't that old, was in her 40's. She was the only one who died around here who was up in age.''
 
Lots of Crack
Where Life Is Hard And Hope Is Scarce
When Ned O'Gorman, a poet and a teacher, first arrived in the neighborhood 25 years ago to open a small independent school, life was hard on the block, but there was still hope and there was still faith. Today, both are just about gone.
''The thing about this street is, you're never not aware of how difficult life is,'' he said. ''That must do something to the wear and tear on the fabric of your body and your spirit.''
Mr. O'Gorman was one of dozens of people interviewed in the neighborhood in recent weeks. From the steps of his school at No. 57, his thinning white hair tossed by the wind, he looked out over the street and talked about ''ghosts.''
''This used to be a self-contained community,'' he said. ''You never had to leave it. There used to be a fish market, a dry cleaners, a grocery store, a restaurant, a beauty shop, a funeral home. Now only the grocery and the funeral parlor are left.''
There is also the church, 110-year-old All Saints Roman Catholic, looming over the Madison Avenue end of the block, its glistening stained glass a stark contrast to the broken windows in the abandoned building across the street. These days the favorite sermons are about survival and beating the odds here on earth.
''The people don't want to hear any pie-in-the-sky stuff,'' said the priest, the Rev. John Meehan. ''These people want to know how to get through another day, how to get up for the 15th round.''
Father Meehan, a thin man with sandy hair, has lived in Harlem for 25 years, the last five on East 129th Street.
''People just exist here,'' he said. ''A lot of people are unemployed here. You name it and it's here. They're selling crack 24 hours a day.''
On 129th Street they peddle crack as openly as ice cream in Central Park. The price of a vial of crack and a pint of ice cream is similar: about $3.
And when the sun goes down the working people and the mothers and the children head inside and the crack dealers rule. The flames from a trash-can fire send shadows dancing over the faces of a half dozen people lined up on one side of the street. Across the way two more lines have formed, and people are running to join them.
In a few minutes the crack man will be open for business.
Roy Taylor has lived on the block for 20 of his 37 years and never, he says, has life been so hard and hope so scarce. ''I hate them,'' he said of the young crack dealers. ''They're killing my people.''
Mr. Taylor is a former boxer who works as a security guard in midtown Manhattan and, he said, ''when I go downtown, it's like I'm in a different country.''
In a small room in his apartment Mr. Taylor has rigged a heavy punching bag to a door frame. A photograph of him as a young junior featherweight, fists up, future bright, hangs on the wall. Now when he wants to forget the streets he pounds away at the bag, and the door frame shakes with each blow.
Sometimes he brings a couple of neighborhood children into his ''gym'' to hit the bag, ''because there ain't no recreation centers around here.''
''The kids don't have nothing and their parents don't have nothing,'' he said the other day, sitting in a jogging suit on his stoop. ''So they go for it. This drug stuff is about poor people trying to survive. But I get depressed and fed up with it. A friend told me his sister smokes crack with her daughter. What you going to do? All this stress gives people a sense, 'I don't care no more. I'm just going to quit.' ''
A young woman, her face a mask of makeup, walked down the block, a cigarette dangling from her mouth. Every few feet she stopped walking, stared at the sidewalk and weakly stomped her right foot.
''Every time she smokes crack,'' Mr. Taylor explained, ''she thinks she's killing roaches.''
 
Little Health Care
'When God's Ready, You're Gone'
 Preventive health care - regular visits to the doctor, AIDS education, a balanced diet, exercise - is rarely a priority here. Short of money and long on fear, willfully forgetting tomorrow or simply too tired to remember, people in Harlem increasingly rely on overcrowded hospital emergency rooms for their primary health care. Typically, they stay home until they are very sick.
''There ain't no such thing as a private doctor around here,'' said Leonard Woodson, a 58-year-old man in a red baseball jacket. ''I suffer from asthma. But I'm dealing with it myself. By the time you can see a doctor in the emergency room you're half dead.''
Private doctors practice in Harlem, but only half as many as are needed, according to a recent study by the Community Service Society. And while Harlem Hospital is ''a great place if you have a stab wound or a gunshot wound,'' Dr. Freeman explained, ''where we fall down a little bit is prevention. The system is not set up to provide preventive care for poor people. We see them when they're bleeding and in pain.''
Quite a few of the people on the block are employed, but when it comes to health care, they are often worse off than their jobless neighbors who qualify for Medicaid. Like millions of America's working poor, Mr. Taylor and several others on the block have jobs that pay them too much for Medicaid but provide little health insurance, if any.
''When I get sick, I go to the city hospital,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''Whichever doctor they got available, that's my doctor.''
When it comes to health care, denial is undeniable.
''People are simply afraid,'' said Dr. Muriel Petioni, who recently retired after 40 years of practicing medicine in Harlem. ''They don't want to hear about any more problems, so they ignore them for as long as they can.'' The denial is marked by fatalism and faith. A 39-year-old woman sat on the stairs of a row house near Park Avenue, smoking.
''I'm not convinced that cigarettes cause cancer,'' she said. ''Anyway, if I stop smoking, I'll get real fat and die of obesity. I like to smoke. It's one of the few pleasures I got.''
Across the street, Runette Carter, 45, watched over her playing children. She rattled off a list of friends and neighbors who had died in the last few years: her diabetic mother, Lila Carter, 62, ruptured appendix; Bernice Taylor, 57, cancer; a man named Keith, 32, heart attack.
''When God's ready, you're gone, whether you're 5 or 65,'' said Ms. Carter, a stocky woman with thick glasses who works as a school crossing guard. ''And you don't have to be sick a day in your life. The lady next door - we were talking Wednesday, and the next day they were putting her in a bag.''
 
Too Much Poverty
Unemployment, Worn Like a Shroud
 Forty-one percent of the people in the central Harlem health district live below the Federal poverty line. Unemployment shrouds the area.
The Saturday afternoon soup kitchen in the basement of No. 57 is always busy.
Alana Crawford, 27, stood under a porch, waiting for the kitchen to open. It was cold and it was raining and Ms. Crawford's stomach rumbled.
''You'll have to excuse me,'' she said. ''I'm hungry.''
Ms. Crawford said she had been homeless for two years. Relatives around the corner care for her daughter. Ms. Crawford, like her mother, who died of cancer in 1983, is diabetic.
''I'm often sickly because of being out here in all kinds of weather,'' she said. ''You keep a cold.''
At noon the kitchen opened its heavy gate and Ms. Crawford hurried in for a plate of tuna salad. The kitchen does not have room for people to sit down and eat, so plate in hand, Ms. Crawford walked out into the rain.
''I'm going to the numbers hole to eat,'' she said. ''It's warm in there.''
Woodrow Samuels, 55, is a self-employed television repairman, plumber and, if he can fix his gray truck in time, a summer hot-dog vendor. He has lived on the block for 45 years and has seen a lot of neighbors die early.
Standing in the doorway of his truck, Mr. Samuels gestured toward the thin man with the sad face, the man who ''loves to drink too damn much.''
''I think liquor is more dangerous than crack,'' Mr. Samuels said. ''Over all, more people get killed by liquor.''
The sad-faced man said he was 37 and had just been released from the hospital.
''I went and signed myself in,'' he said. ''It's real rough. This is my fourth time doing it. I don't know why I drink so much. Every time I had a problem I started drinking, but the problem would still be there.''
Central Harlem's leading killers - cancer, heart disease and cirrhosis - have roots in America's distilleries and tobacco fields.
''If you really want to address health problems in the black community you really must address the use of tobacco and alcohol,'' said David R. Williams, an assistant professor of sociology at Yale University.
''You also have to address the conditions that create the need in people to use them,'' he said. ''We know that alcohol consumption rises whenever there is an economic downturn and high unemployment.''
But whatever the reasons, black men smoke more than black women, and blacks more than any other racial group in the country. The consequences are clear: blacks have a higher incidence of lung cancer than whites, according to the American Cancer Society. And over all, the five-year cancer survival rate for black Americans is 38 percent, compared to 50 percent for whites.
In an article last year in a cancer society journal, Dr. Freeman wrote that there is ''no known genetic basis to explain the major racial differences in cancer incidence and outcome.'' On the contrary, he said, the causes appear to be largely environmental.
Many of Harlem's young men, though, do not live long enough to develop cancer or heart disease. Homicide, drugs and AIDS kill them first. Homicide is the leading cause of death for New Yorkers between 15 and 24; AIDS is the No. 1 killer for those between 25 and 44. In central Harlem, there were 122.1 AIDS-related deaths for each 100,000 people in 1988, the highest rate in the city after the lower West Side.
The Rev. Derrick Harkins, an assistant minister at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, said that in the last four years he had officiated at dozens of funerals for victims of AIDS, from prominent people to ''junkies whose grandmother's last loving thing they could do for them was to arrange their funerals.''
''I know one or two guys who died of AIDS,'' said Purvis Lucas, 36, leaning against his building near the end of the block. ''One died about two years ago. He was 30, 31. We used to hang out years ago. It was kept quiet when he died. The family didn't say anything to me. When people get AIDS around here, people keep it quiet. The next thing you know they're gone and in the ground.''
 
Too Few Role Models
 
Some Can't Leave, But Others Plan to
 Not all of Harlem is suffering.
 A black middle- and upper-middle class has long thrived in the neighborhood's grand brownstones and modern apartment buildings. New York's Mayor, David N. Dinkins, has lived much of his life in Harlem.
For this well-off slice of Harlem, quality housing - like quality health care and education - is accessible. But for the residents of East 129th Street, these are luxuries most cannot afford.
On the block, most people live in four city-owned tenements, taken over from landlords after years of neglect. The city also owns the four abandoned buildings on the street.
The building in the worst condition is No. 51; Michael Heath and his family live there. Mr. Heath is an organizer for the Hospital and Health Care Employees Union Local 1199. His wife, Audrey, is a hospital billing clerk. They have an 8-year-old daughter who is doing well in school and is eagerly waiting for her father to connect their new computer. They are the kind of family that sociologists point to as crucial role models for the less fortunate neighbors.
But the Heaths want to leave, because even simple everyday tasks like taking a bath are often anything but simple.
Two years ago the wall between their bathroom and kitchen was removed by city workers during renovation. Sheets of rumpled plastic still hang where the wall used to be, and Mr. Heath can reach through the crumbling ceiling and chip away at the rotting joists and studs as water leaks into a green bucket perched atop the toilet.
Outside the apartment in the graffiti-smeared hallways, addicts often smoke crack, leaving a trail of vials and fear.
Rafael Perez and his family live upstairs. Mr. Perez, who is 34, said his son was returning home from the store a couple of weeks ago when two men assaulted him in the hallway. They slapped him and took the family groceries and $10 in cash.
''I'm scared of the crack heads, and I'm scared that my little daughter will put her finger in this,'' Mr. Perez said, holding up an exposed electrical outlet. ''This is no way to live.''
Mr. Perez has few alternatives. He cannot afford to move. Mr. Heath, who can, says he has stayed out of loyalty to his neighbors.
''I could have left before it got this bad,'' Mr. Heath said. ''But I think about the other people who live here and we have to stick together. I was born here. These are my roots.''
Near the end of the block and the thriving drug market is a narrow strip of blacktop -what the city calls a vest-pocket park, with two rusted and bent basketball hoops, a rickety slide and a patchy carpet of broken glass.
''Would that park exist like that on 65th and Park?'' Mr. O'Gorman asked as students burst through the door behind him and ran down the school steps to recess, their laughter echoing after them.
Mr. O'Gorman grabbed a boy and gave him a hug. ''Are you going to come to school every day and not end up a corpse in the street?'' he asked. The child mumbled a ''yes'' and ran off to play.
So far, the teen-age boys flying up and down the basketball court in the playground seem to have avoided the lure of the corner. Instead of fast money and faster cars, their dreams are about being electricians, doctors, actors and ballplayers.
Perhaps this is because they saw what happened to Robert Cole.
Robert Cole was a bright boy with an easy smile who had attended Ned O'Gorman's school for years. But his smile seemed to fade when he began hanging out on the corner, and one night last February, he apparently tried to rob a man with a broken gun. Confronted by a police officer, he refused to drop the weapon and was shot dead. He was 13..
''I don't like it around here at all,'' said Robert's older brother, Elika, who is 16. ''But I don't have no choice but to stay.''
''What's to like?'' said his friend, Earl Hunter. ''This is a super-ghetto.''
''This ain't even a ghetto,'' Elika said. ''It's a danger zone.''
''All I want,'' said 16-year-old Ronald Byas, ''is to live long enough to move off this block.''

HEADLINE: Nurses Get V.I.P. Treatment, Easing Shortage

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 2

 BODY:
Betsey Vernizzi, an orthopedic nurse at St. Anthony Medical Center here, recalled a course she took nearly 20 years ago in nursing school. ''It was called ethics,'' she said. ''I was taught to say 'Yes, sir, no sir.' If a doctor walked into the nurse's station, you gave him your chair. I called them 'Doctor.' They called me Betsey.' '' At St. Anthony now, there is a doctor whose first name is Louis. ''We call him 'Louie,' '' she said.
Nurses have also complained forever of menial chores that take them from their real business of caring for patients. But Margaret Taylor, a nurse-manager in the intensive care unit of one of Humana Inc.'s four hospitals here, can now turn to the ''green people,'' student aides in green smocks. ''They run specimens to the labs,'' she said. ''They run and Xerox things. They get prescriptions from the pharmacy. We pick up the phone, dial H-E-L-P and they're there.''
With many employers' new willingness to accommodate nurses in these and other ways, the worst of the great nursing shortage that arose in the last half of the 1980's may finally be over. The employers' accommodations of nurses, moreover, are likely to presage accommodations they will have to make to people in many other occupations as the 1990's unfold, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. 
 
Demand for Special Skills
For years economists have been warning that the decline of the birth rate since the mid-1960's means the working-age population in the 1990's will grow at half the rate at which it grew in the 70's and 80's. Barring a long recession or a surge in immigration, businesses will be hard put to find all the people they will need.
Worse, workers with special skills will be much harder to find because of a mismatch between employers' expected needs and the ability of school systems to meet them. Those workers, especially, will have the upper hand in bargaining for pay and working conditions.
''Employers are going to market jobs the way you might market a car,'' said Audrey Freedman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, a business research organization in New York. '' 'Come to us. We'll give you what we think you want.' ''
Gene Remoff, vice president for human resources at ARA Services Inc. in Philadelphia, which operates 250 nursing homes, said, ''If you want somebody to take that job, you have to sell it.''
 
An Economic Harbinger
The expected crunch in the national labor market struck nursing hard and early for two reasons: One was the booming demand for health care, and the other was the fact that nursing combines the worst of many occupations: bad hours, difficult conditions, the emotional toll of helping the sick, low wage growth, high stress and the stigma of women's work.
But many people find great personal reward in being a nurse. ''A doctor's not there day by day,'' said Miriam Gravatte, 44, assistant manager in the pediatric intensive care unit at a Humana Hospital. ''He's in and out. We have a relationship with the patient. He has a relationship with a chart.''
Kathi Zanni, a 29-year-old colleague of Ms. Gravatte's, said: ''Nursing is taking care of people. It's a back rub.''
 
Maid Service as Incentive
To recruit such people today, hospitals and employment agencies are packing the help-wanted columns of newspapers with advertisements promising nurses high pay, more of a say in their jobs and in hospital management, bonuses of $3,000 and $4,000 for coming aboard, bonuses for staying, bounties for finding recruits, freedom to set their own schedules and free tuition for advanced courses. Some employers even offer maid service and free housing for those who are willing to shuttle from city to city to relieve demand for medical care.
Nurses in Louisville, as is true of nurses almost everywhere, talk of constant direct mail and telephone appeals from recruiters. ''Headhunters,'' said Pam Hagan, 38, a $42,000-a-year cancer specialist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center here. ''I get calls from around the country. I get them a couple of times a month, but one day last week I got three in one day.''
''Their opening question is, 'I have a position in' and they tell me a region of the country and give a description of the job,'' she said. They usually start by asking if I know anyone who might be interested and then they say, 'Would you be interested in a position like this?' ''
In nursing's hot personnel market, more than 20 multi-city agencies do nothing but find jobs for itinerant nurses, young ones mostly who like to follow the sun. Humana, which has its headquarters here, operates an internal pool of 2,000 itinerants who circulate among the company's 83 hospitals in 19 cities on 13-week assignments. The nurses get a $450 monthly housing allowance, even if they stay with their families or friends, and they keep accruing benefits and seniority rather than start anew each time they take an assignment.
 
Pay of Up to $70,000
In cities like New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles, a nurse can earn $60,000 or $70,000 a year for a full-time job, and an agency in Miami advertises a job that pays $1,000 for working two 12-hour shifts on Saturday and Sunday and taking the rest of the week off. Nationwide, the American Nurse Association says the average starting salary for a registered nurse last year was $25,261, an increase of about $5,000 in just three years.
Nurses have long complained of ''wage compression,'' that a nurse's pay rises far less from one year to the next than is the case in most other professions. By contrast, people who begin their careers as engineers or accountants, for example, can look ahead to top salaries of triple their starting pay, while a nurse can expect her salary to rise by just 40 percent. In addition, said Philip Doyle, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the wages of 87 percent of all registered nurses are concentrated at the lower end of the pay scale.
''The market's starting to take care of that,'' said Kathryn M. Mersohn, senior vice president for nursing at Humana. The American Nursing Association says the 40 percent rise in pay that a nurse can now expect, reaching an average maximum of $35,442, compares with a rise of only 27 percent above starting pay that nurses could expect in 1980.
Where the market is not working, the unions are. Until a few years ago at St. Anthony, said Barbara Aynes, a staff nurse there, nurses could climb only five pay grades, so except for adjustments to take account of inflation, their raises stopped after five years. Under agreement with the union, the Kentucky Nurses' Association, the hospital now provides 18 grades.
Raising nurses' pay poses problems for employers under acute pressure to hold down the rise of health care costs, but the solution many are devising also serves nurses' pleas for relief from tasks unrelated to nursing. In February, Humana, which owns 83 hospitals in 19 states, established schools in Louisville, St. Petersburg, Fla., and San Antonio to train licensed practical nurses, who are paid 30 to 40 percent less than registered nurses. The licensed practical nurses can take on some of the registered nurses' work.
 
Easing of Shortage
The recruiting, the blandishments, the better wages and working conditions have begun to ease the shortage. Enrollments in nursing schools, which plunged 30 percent, have recovered a bit, and more than 80 percent of all people who have been trained to be nurses are actually working as nurses, the highest level in decades.
National statistics have yet to show it, but in Louisville and in many other communities, anecdotal evidence suggests that men, historically just 3 percent of all nurses, are moving into the profession. One is Kevin Boyd, 28, who works the 6:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. shift in the intensive care unit at St. Anthony and two additional shifts of voluntary overtime. He is married without children.
After three semesters at the University of Louisville, Mr. Boyd dropped out and ended up in a job transporting patients at St. Anthony. He then returned to the university to become a nurse. ''Of 80 students in my class,'' he said, ''10 were men.'' As for the stigma of women's work, he said, ''I never looked at that.'' Of the 112 students enrolled so far in Humana's new schools for licensed practical nurses, Ms. Mersohn said, 18 are men.
Because of the explosive growth in health care services, demand for nurses still far exceeds the supply. That means the nurses who are working, especially in hospitals, have to accommodate the demand by working overtime, and many complain of stress and burnout. Ms. Gravatte at Humana said that for one week in April, she recorded the overtime that the 15 nurses in her unit worked.
''We had 197 hours,'' or just about two extra eight-hour shifts per nurse, she said. Depending on the unpredictable numbers of children in her unit, Ms. Gravette said, ''One day you may need two nurses, on another day four. You're constantly on the phone calling in nurses. That alone is a source of stress.'' But even there, hospitals are finding some relief in scores of temporary nurse agencies that have formed in the last few years.
 
Impact of Competition on Pay
Some public institutions have been able to match the accommodations that private institutions are making. The Department of Veterans Affairs, the nation's biggest employer of nurses, with 37,000 in 172 hospitals, is now authorized to adjust its wages in line with that of the competition. But many states and cities struggle with even tighter budgets than the Federal Government's and have not been able to offer such terms.
Patricia Payne, a nurse practitioner in pediatrics at a Jefferson County neighborhood medical center in Louisville, does much of the work of a physician but is paid a little more than $28,000 a year, about $10,000 more than her starting pay 20 years ago. Unlike more and more private institutions, the county provides no career ladders for nurses to climb; nor does it give them a say in developing medical programs.
Turnover in the county medical centers is high. ''We're always training new nurses,'' she said. ''Before, we had a pretty stable work force.'' Ms. Payne said that she expected to stay on because she was close to retirement, but that she was taking charge of a stepped-up campaign by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to organize more nurses at public institutions.

HEADLINE: TriBeCa Yawns Hello to Film Studio

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
Trumpeted as Hollywood on the Hudson and organized by Robert De Niro, a former coffee warehouse in lower Manhattan opened this year as the TriBeCa Film Center, with production centers on seven floors and a stylish restaurant on the ground floor. Yet for all the attention people in the neighborhood are paying to it, it might still be the warehouse.
''He's not the first celebrity in the neighborhood,'' said Dorothea Nicholas, a resident of the Independence Plaza apartment complex across the street.
Across TriBeCa, the area's supposed leap into the limelight is mostly met with an attitude of boredom, occasionally broken by a comment about the economic opportunities of such a change. 
Mr. De Niro, the actor, ''lives in the neighborhood and has for over 10 years,'' said Jane Rosenthal, executive vice president of TriBeCa Productions, the movie company that anchors the center. ''It was really just a matter of being in the neighborhood.''
Requests for a comment from Mr. De Niro were refused.
Residents' early concerns that the center, at 375 Greenwich Street, might harm the neighborhood have largely dwindled to occasional complaints about limousines on the streets and double-parked cars, said Paul L. Goldstein, district manager for Community Board 1. Many people seem grateful that an empty building has what some call a productive use.
 
Headquarters for 2 Films
''They may be customers that rent my things for their films,'' said James Garvey, who owns a metalworking studio on Franklin Street. ''I had a whole thing set up for this week, but they passed on it.''
The film center, set up as a condominium, is the headquarters for two movies this month. One, ''Bonfire of the Vanities,'' based on the novel by Tom Wolfe, is being shot in the Bronx, on Park Avenue and elsewhere around the city.
The other film, ''New Jack City,'' has had much less publicity. Filmed entirely in the city, it highlights rap music, drugs, police officers and other features of urban life.
The other occupants of the center have been less visible. They include casting agencies and development offices in search of material for screenplays. Most were recruited by Mr. De Niro and had worked with him. Last month, a restaurant on the ground floor, the TriBeCa Grill, opened.
 
Scene at the Casting Office
Security is tight. Guards make sure that only people with legitimate reasons for being there go upstairs, where the decor is loftlike, with exposed brick, neutral colors and a skylight. On the upper floors a hushed but preoccupied atmosphere prevails.
The center was the site of some casting for ''Bonfire of the Vanities.'' ''That's what makes it feel like a film center,'' said Jill Kearney, vice president for development at Art Linson Productions, producer of films like ''The Untouchables'' and ''Scrooged.''
Ms. Kearney has an office near the rehearsal room. ''One minute there are 400 little girls, then a lot of older women in beaded jackets,'' she said. ''One day everybody was walking by swearing to themselves for some role.''
Some residents seemed pleased that Greenwich Street is considered a film capital. ''It's nice to get some more fun people in the neighborhood,'' said Sixtina Friedrich, who was wheeling her 6-month-old daughter into Washington Market Park.
 
In the Spirit
A few had complaints. ''I like them to be here, but there are always negative sides, like traffic,'' said Josee Vermette, who lives in Independence Plaza and recently ate at the TriBeCa Grill. ''There are a lot of limousines. I have seen the whole block full of limousines.''
The film motif seems to be sticking. Across the street from the center is the TriBeCa Film Studio Deli. The deli has yet to stock its refrigerator cases but it has painted its name across an awning.
The deli was named after hundreds of other possibilities were exhausted, said an owner, Joe Porco. ''I bought a book of names, you know, 'What to Name Your Baby,' '' he insisted. ''Some companies spend a lot of money trying to find the proper identity. We decided, why not call it Studio Deli?''
The connection, as well as the proximity, to De Niro territory may prove profitable. ''People who come by to see his restaurant but don't go in might stop here,'' Mr. Porco said.
 
'Didn't Believe It Was Him'
At Greenwich Street Video, where Mr. De Niro has a membership and occasionally rents his movies, the management applauded the film center. ''It used to be a bombed-out warehouse,'' said Maria Hogan, who has worked at the store five years. When Mr. De Niro, who lives a block away on Hudson Street, wanted to rent his first videocassette, she added, he did not have to produce two forms of identification and a utility bill like the average customer.
''He just gave us his American Express card,'' Mrs. Hogan said. ''We didn't believe it was him.''
Part of the local indifference to stardom may be that New Yorkers tend to recognize people more readily for their success in something other than show business, Ms. Kearney said. She added: ''In New York, you're much more likely to hear someone say, 'Hey, there's Susan Sontag,' and in L.A. it's, 'There's Danny DeVito.' There's a lot more intellectual celebrity.''
Mrs. Vermette said that she expected paparazzi to start pursuing celebrities into the neighborhood and that fans would probably start showing up too. ''But that's part of New York City,'' she said. ''When you live in New York City, you have to expect these things.''

HEADLINE: With Easing of Soviet Police State, Crime Against Foreigners Is Rising

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 5

 BODY:
Crime against foreigners in the Soviet Union has dramatically increased in the last year, as outsiders, long isolated from Soviet society, find that their new ability to move freely has exposed them to greater danger.
The crimes range from murder to rape to burglary and attempted kidnapping, but the vast majority involve theft. The foreigners are finding that their cars, apartments, offices, hotel rooms and even suitcases are vulnerable to thieves.
''As the shortages in our own shops grow, foreigners unfortunately become a very desirable target for criminals,'' said Vladimir Gorshkov, chief of criminal investigations in the Moscow militia department assigned to crime against foreigners. ''Our current economic problems have created a breeding ground for all kinds of undesirable elements, many of whom prey on foreigners.'' 
 
Muscovites Are Victims, Too
This rise in crime against foreigners has taken place at a time when the overall crime rate has also soared. Foreigners were once insulated from such crime waves by limits on their access to ordinary people and by the close surveillance of the authorities. But with liberalization, Soviet citizens are no longer afraid to mingle with foreigners, and Soviet criminals are no longer afraid to attack them.
Foreigners are often naive about the criminal element in the Soviet Union, Western and Soviet officials here say. Many visitors apparently feel that in a country that was long a police state, they are still safe from such harm.
The number of crimes against foreigners reported in Moscow jumped from 272 in 1988 to 779 last year, according to the city's Interior Ministry. Those crimes accounted for 2 percent of the number of crimes registered, virtually a tenfold increase over the previous two years, ministry officials say.
So although reported crimes against foreigners remain a small percentage of the total, Soviet and Western officials say they believe that the rise is the beginning of a trend that may become more violent, particularly if the Soviet economy continues to founder.
''We're seeing the front end of it,'' said Mark A. Sanna, regional security officer at the United States Embassy. ''I think the police are making an effort, but they lack the manpower and the capability.''
 
Deterrent to Enterpreneurs
A Soviet law-enforcement officer, who asked not to be identified by name, said there was ''alarm and concern among the highest authorities'' over the rise in crime against foreigners.
''The Soviet Union depends very heavily now on the Western businessmen and tourists who come here,'' the official said. ''And if this crime situation continues along its current path, many of these people will start staying home, which will have a very negative effect on our economy.''
There are more than 8,000 foreigners currently accredited to work and live in Moscow, including 6,000 diplomats, nearly 600 journalists and about 1,500 representatives of businesses. In addition, about 27,000 foreign students are studying in Moscow and, last year, 1.5 million tourists traveled to the city.
Officials at Western embassies and businesses in Moscow and directors of tour companies say they have heard a litany of stories from employees, clients and colleagues who have become victims of the crime wave.
 
Threats, and Worse
A Scandinavian airline employee who reported to the police that he had seen airport baggage handlers rifling through luggage found his car badly vandalized and a note advising him to mind his own business or suffer worse consequences.
An American Embassy employee was raped in her apartment in a foreigners' compound in northern Moscow this year, a few months after two American apartments in the same area were burglarized and the Soviet authorities failed to install a security system.
An Italian tourist taking a taxi into Moscow from Sheremetyevo Airport was run off the road by gangsters in cahoots with the driver, robbed of his money, jewelry, suitcases, overcoat and shoes and left by the side of highway, one of hundreds of foreigners victimized by this long-running scam.
The tales go on and on: about side-view mirrors on foreign cars being sawed off, hotel rooms ransacked, tourists mugged inches from hotel doorways, women's purses slashed with razor blades and the contents lifted.
 
Worse Than Reported
Although the statistics show a dramatic rise, officials say the undocumented story is worse yet. The vast majority of crimes against foreigners go unreported, Western and Soviet authorites agree. Most are committed against tourists in town for short stays and many people, including foreigners living here for several years, do not believe that their stolen property will be recovered or that the perpetrators will be caught. So they are loath to tangle with the Soviet bureaucracy.
Tour organizers in the United States and other countries say Soviet tourism officials express concern that the flood of tourists visiting the Soviet Union since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power will slow if the crime rate continues. The State Department has issued a warning to travelers, advising them about the rise in crime.
''The Soviet tourism people tried to reassure us that Soviet authorities were taking measures to control the situation,'' said a New York-based travel agent who would not be identified.
''But frankly the Soviet Union is not a luxury vacation. The accommodations are not first class, the food is bad. It's a rough trip, but the one consolation was always that at least the country was safe for foreign travelers. Our own experience tells us that's simply not true anymore.''
Travel agents said they had not seen a dropoff in interest in travel to the Soviet Union since the State Department advisory was issued, but many said they were advising Moscow-bound tourists to be, as a trip organizer said, ''as alert and aware as if you were visiting New York or Naples.''
 
Embassy Duty Unpopular
Officials at several Western embassies said some of their employees had requested early transfers out of Moscow because of the rise in crime. ''To be uncomfortable and unsafe was not worth it to them,'' said a diplomat at a West European embassy where several employees had asked to leave.
And there is a bonus, of sorts, from the easier association with foreigners. With more Soviet citizens able to travel to the West and to earn foreign currency, more local residents have foreign-made goods. When such items are stolen from foreigners, their new owners are no longer conspicuous.
To deal with the new crime wave, some Moscow-based foreign business people have been hiring bodyguards to accompany their employees around town, to guard their offices and to protect equipment being transported around the city or country.
''We used to think Moscow was the safest city in the world,'' said Oleg Fomin, deputy director of the Defense Service Agency, a new Soviet business that provides guards and burglar alarms. ''But now we know otherwise. And unfortunately for foreigners, they're the people here with the money and the goods that criminals want. Why rob a Muscovite for a few worthless rubles if you can get a foreigner and get some dollars or Deutsche marks?''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Shadow on Arms Talks: Threat of Soviet Turmoil

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, May 5

 BODY:
While NATO ministers meeting in Europe this week have tried to maintain a business-as-usual demeanor toward Moscow, they are privately whispering about the possibilty that the Soviet Union could collapse into political turmoil before new arms-control deals are completed.
At Thursday's meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Brussels, the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, told his colleagues that the situation in the Soviet Union was ''moving rapidly toward a state of confusion.''
''There is a serious possibility that the whole thing will crumble at the Communist Party congress'' scheduled for early July, he said.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was equally sober in his presentation to his fellow North Atlantic Treaty Organization ministers. According to a text of Mr. Baker's remarks, he said at the closed session in Brussels: ''In our view perestroika has entered a critical, even paradoxical stage. On the one hand, Gorbachev's formal power has never been greater as he heads for the party congress this summer. Ascending to the presidency, he is positioned to push through the radical reforms he has so often extolled in the last six months.'' 
 
Uncertain Period Predicted
''The irony,'' Mr. Baker contined, ''is that while Gorbachev may finally be able to push through radical reform, right now he may be reluctant to act, increasingly fearful that real reform could lead to a genuine implosion from below. In light of these Soviet domestic realities, I suspect we are in for an uncertain two months until the Soviet party congress can clarify perestroika's political prospects more definitively.''
The contrast between the mood among the Western allies today and their mood in February 1989, when Secretary Baker made his first tour of NATO capitals, could not be more striking. On that inaugural trip, Mr. Baker was repeatedly asked by the Western Europeans when the Bush Administration would ''engage'' with Mr. Gorbachev.
A few months later, after Washington began doing serious arms-control business with the Soviet leader, Mr. Baker was peppered with the question of when the United States was going to start to help Mr. Gorbachev succeed. At the Malta summit meeting last year, a package of technical and economic assistance programs was offered to the Soviet leader by President Bush.
Today, the only question within the alliance seems to be whether anyone or anything can ''save'' Mr. Gorbachev from being overwhelmed by the internal problems closing in on him. The Soviet leader, who a year ago was seen as a heroic figure in Europe, paving the way for the revolutions of 1989 and overshadowing every other leader on the world stage, is viewed increasingly among NATO officials with pity, as an enormously capable man devoured by the very revolution that he set in motion.
 
An Altered Perception
Joseph S. Nye, an international-affairs expert at Harvard University, said the NATO allies were recognizing that the excitement around the globe engendered by Mr. Gorbachev's initiatives had obscured the degree to which his actions at home were making the situation there steadily worse, and ultimately constricting what he could do abroad.
But the problems are no longer obscured. The upsurge in nationalist tensions, the secession efforts by the Baltic republics, estimates by the C.I.A. that the Soviet economy is in an ''abysmal'' state, and the scenes of Mr. Gorbachev being booed at this year's May Day parade, have altered NATO's perception of the Soviet leader's prospects for success, and altered in some ways NATO's own agenda.
''The key issue for the West today is how do we manage the decline of the Soviet Union in a way that insures that our interests will be protected and advanced,'' Mr. Nye said.
He said the NATO allies have not pressed Mr. Gorbachev on Lithuania and have been trying to make the prospect of German unification and of membership in NATO as politically and militarily palatable to him as possible out of concern that if they push him too far ''you could push him right over a cliff'' before he is able to complete the current round of arms control negotiations.
As the British foreign affairs analyst Lawrence Freedman wrote in the Independent newspaper of London this week: ''There is no doubt that the West wants to help Gorbachev. This is not simply gratitude for what he has allowed to happen, but that he is someone with whom deals can be struck.''
 
Doubt on Arms Issues
After Mr. Baker's three-hour talk in Bonn on Friday with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, American officials were still in doubt about whether the Kremlin would be able to overcome the obstacles in the way of a strategic arms limitation treaty and a conventional arms limitation treaty. The White House was hoping to have both treaties substantially completed by the time of the May 30 summit meeting in Washington between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev.
A State Department official said of Mr. Gorbachev: ''If you are totally preoccupied with problems that you regard as affecting your immediate survival, how equipped are you going to be to face other issues? I mean, look what is on this guy's plate: the economy is falling apart, the Baltics are seceding, he's being booed at a May Day parade, and then someone comes into his office and says, 'What do you think we should do about the range issue on air-launched cruise missiles?' And he probably just says, 'Leave me alone.' ''
A Soviet-American dispute over what range of air-launched cruise missiles should be covered by the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, has been one of the major problems holding up the proposed agreement.
Yet few in NATO would write off Mr. Gorbachev.
''The nature of his problems are now more apparent,'' the State Department official said. ''But anyone who is quick to count him out would be making a big mistake. He is still Gorbachev, with everything that means. There is also no one around with the strength to replace him. I still think he will make the arms control decisions, but the push is going to have to come from us. He has not lost the ability to make decisions, it is just that the number he has to make now tend to crowd out some of those that we are most interested in.''

HEADLINE: Rush for Asian Resources Prompts A Race for Weapons and Security

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, May 2

 BODY:
With the humbling of Vietnam in Cambodia, political and ideological tensions in Southeast Asia have been significantly reduced. But an arms race in the Asian and Pacific region is eating up the potential benefits from peace.
With a growing economic competition for fish, petroleum and gas, all the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines - are seeking ways to extend their power to the outer reaches of their territorial waters and beyond. That includes areas like the Spratly Islands, which are the subject of conflicting claims by China, Taiwan, Malaysia and the Philippines. 
This involves heavy capital investment in ships and planes, and coincides with an expensive modernization of forces after a long period of concentration on fighting rebellions.
The countries of Asean, as well as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, will spend about $40 billion this year on the military. Add China, India and Australia and the figure is $60 billion. By the end of this decade, analysts expect it to reach $130 billion.
The Asean countries have had to deal with leftist insurgencies, but except for the one in the Philippines, these rebellions have been smothered. This created the necessary stability for current economic development, says Kusuma Snitwongse, head of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies at Thailand's Chulalongkorn University, and also allowed a reorganization of armies to deal with external threats.
 
After Cambodia, New Trouble
That trend was accelerated by the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, which brought Vietnamese troops to the Thai border and gave the Soviet Union and China more excuses to involve themselves in the region.
But now that the Vietnamese have largely returned home, Mrs. Kusuma said, ''there is at the same time a demand for better and more modern arms, especially for the air force and the navy.''
Noordin Sopiee, director of Malaysia's Institute of Strategic and International Studies, said that throughout Southeast Asia, ''border concerns'' are being replaced by ''territorial concerns,'' which means an unparalleled push for naval and air power to police sovereign and potentially wealthy offshore waters. ''That's the real arms race going on, and it's not so quiet,'' he said.
The Thai military budget is a good example of what is happening. Despite severe cuts in American arms aid, which has plummeted from $102.3 million in 1985 to $5.2 million now, the Thai arms budget this year will be $2.1 billion, up 16 percent from last year.
The Malaysian military budget has grown along with the economy by 20 percent over the last two years, diplomats say. But it does not reflect a $1.6 billion memorandum of understanding, signed with Britain in September 1988, for the purchase of 8 to 12 Tornado fighters, anti-aircraft missiles, naval corvettes and possibly submarines.
 
A City With an Arsenal
Singapore continues to spend about $1.5 billion a year on arms, 23 percent of its budget and 5.5 percent of its gross national product. While it says it has only deterrence in mind on the model of Switzerland, its advanced weapons, including American F-16's, provides reach far beyond its borders.
Even Brunei is extending its armed forces to insure the security of its oilfields and territorial waters. Brunei is buying patrol boats and the country's first fixed-wing combat aircraft, 16 British Aerospace Hawks. If Vietnam and China start fighting again over the Spratlys, which most diplomats regard as inevitable, then Brunei wants to be sure there is no spillover.
In Indonesia, tight military budgets have slowed planned modernization, especially the purchase of naval patrol vessels and aircraft, to defend some of the most extensive territorial waters in the world.
For that reason, Indonesia, like other Asean countries, wants American forces to retain their bases in the Philippines.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. IS EXPECTING BIG FUND INCREASE

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 5

 BODY:
Finance ministers and central bank governors representing most countries of the world are expected shortly to approve at least a 50 percent increase in the $120 billion resources of the International Monetary Fund.
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the 152-nation agency, said at a news conference today that ''one can be reasonably certain this institution will be consolidated and significantly reinforced.''
He said the increase was ''good news'' for the world economic system.
A senior United States Treasury official confirmed Mr. Camdessus's assessment. ''We're very, very close on all the major elements of a quota increase,'' he said. 
 
Shift by the White House
Until last year, the United States opposed an increase, but the Bush Administration changed its mind in view of the efforts to cut third-world debt and the upheaval in Eastern Europe.
Mr. Camdessus spoke on the eve of the spring membership meeting of his organization and its fellow global lender, the World Bank, which together provide the bulk of economic assistance for third-world countries.
The increase for the I.M.F., which would mark the ninth time in its 45-year history that the fund has tapped members for money, is expected to be approved in the course of the meetings here early next week. The World Bank obtained an increase of nearly 100 percent in its resources last year.
The I.M.F. is seeking the money to help resolve third-world debt problems and to meet new responsibilities in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European nations that are moving from centrally planned autocracies to market-based democracies.
 
Details of the Loans
The I.M.F. makes short- to medium-term loans, chiefly for three to five years, to countries having trouble making ends meet. To qualify, borrowers have to take tough economic measures. The World Bank makes longer-term loans to finance large projects in poorer lands.
During the extensive negotiations over the last three years, the United States has been the least-enthusiastic backer of the increase.
The Bush Administration has now gone along, but Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has refused back an increase well in excess of 50 percent. He will meet with finance ministers from six other leading industrial countries on Sunday to try to wrap up final details of the increase.
Most other countries, with the principal exceptions of Britain and Saudi Arabia, have pressed for increases of two-thirds or more. It is expected that the final figure will be closer to 50 percent than 67 percent.
 
U.S. Share Would Be $12 Billion
Members' quotas are based on their weighted vote in the institution. With a 20 percent vote, the United States' share of a 50 percent increase would be $12 billion.
Because of complex ways in which the monetary fund works, the money does not increase the Federal budget deficit, but the Bush Administration still faces a battle with Congress, where any form of foreign aid is unpopular. The President is unlikely to make the formal request for the money until next year.
Technically, the money represents an exchange of assets. The United States makes the dollars available on call, but increases its own rights to borrow the currencies of other countries as needed.
Not only developing countries borrow from the I.M.F. The United States has tapped the fund's resources on eight occasions, the latest in 1978 when it borrowed $2.3 billion.
 
Difficulties in 1983
But these borrowings did not prevent a major debate in 1983, the last time an Administration asked Congress for money for the I.M.F. Congress finally approved a 47 percent increase, after President Ronald Reagan became deeply involved in lobbying.
To help make the case this time, the Administration has conditioned its approval on the willingness of members to address the problem of nearly $4 billion of overdue I.M.F. loans by 11 impoverished fund members.
Working quietly with other governments since last October, the United States has devised a complicated mechanism for dealing with the arrears issue, requiring a change in the I.M.F. charter.
Under I.M.F. rules, 85 percent of the weighted votes of the members are needed in order to approve an amendment to the articles of agreement. Only two such amendments have gone through in the past. An approval to to seek the charter change is expected this week.
 
Loss of Voting Rights
Under the arrears plan, delinquent countries would lose their voting rights, but special efforts would be undertaken to help them improve their economic position, provided they are willing to impose heavily supervised economic policies.
If the delinquents fail to live up to their obligations, I.M.F. gold would be sold to make good the I.M.F. claims against them.
Another issue that still has to be resolved after months of wrangling is that of the ranking of major industrial nations in the I.M.F. voting hierarchy.
Japan has had the fifth-largest quota and vote in the organization, but insisted as part of the latest increase in money that it be allowed to move up to No. 2, after the United States, reflecting the growth of its economic power. Tokyo already has the No. 2 ranking in the World Bank.
The advance for Japan would displace Britain, but it appears that an agreement is near.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Steps Into Political Firestorm in Kenya

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, May 5

 BODY:
The United States Ambassador has found himself in the middle of a fierce political debate about whether this East African nation and ally of Washington should replace its one-party state with a multiparty system.
Smith Hempstone, the new Ambassador who as a former journalist has shown a more freewheeling style than his predecessors, told a meeting of Kenyan businessmen on Thursday that a strong political tide in Congress favored giving economic aid to countries that ''nourish democratic institutions, defend human rights and practice multiparty politics.''
Mr. Hempstone, touching on Kenya's most sensitive issue, said he was not instructing the Government on what to do but rather relating a fact of life.
But the Kenyan President, Daniel arap Moi, one of the staunchest defenders of the one-party state, took the comment as an unnecessary intrusion. 
''Kenya is a sovereign state and equal to other states and does not require any guidance from outsiders on how to run its affairs,'' Mr. Moi told a political rally on Friday in the western Kenyan city of Kisumu. Anyway, Mr. Moi said, just as ''I cannot understand a foreign society,'' it is impossible for foreigners to understand African ones.
Mr. Moi, who has called Kenyan advocates of the multiparty state ''traitors,'' has long contended that a multiparty system would form along tribal lines. In an interview today, Mr. Hempstone said he was sensitive to Mr. Moi's concerns that political pluralism would emphasize tribalism. But since other African leaders say they are planning to move away from one-party states, Mr. Hempstone said, he wanted Kenya to be ''ahead of the curve.''
The question of converting to a multiparty system, with all its implications of broader freedoms of speech and dissent, has been stewing here since the beginning of the year. The debate exploded when one of the country's most prominent and articulate church officials, the Anglican Bishop, Henry Okullu, advocated a multiparty state 10 days ago and was immediately denounced in Parliament.
In some parts of Africa - the Ivory Coast, Benin, Gabon and Zaire - there have been recent moves by the long-entrenched leaders, under pressure from street demonstrations, to allow other parties to form. Mr. Moi has been resistant, almost defiantly so, to any suggestion of change.
Kenya has long been a one-party state. In 1982, four years after Mr. Moi came to power, the constitution was amended to make the Kenya African National Union the only legal party. Two years ago, the constitution was amended again, abolishing the independence of the judiciary and allowing the police to detain suspects for 14 days without charge. The secret ballot was also abolished in favor of a system in which voters line up behind pictures of candidates in KANU party primaries.
 
'Vested Interests'
The same day that Mr. Hempstone made his remarks, two former Cabinet ministers said Kenya's political, economic and social problems were caused by the single-party system.
It is the ''vested interests'' of those in power that perpetuate the system, the former ministers said.
Kenneth Matiba, a former Minister for Transport and Communications, who recently had his passport confiscated by the Government after a trip to Britain, and Charles Rubia, a former Housing Minister, dismissed the Government's argument that political pluralism would result in a return to tribalism. Rather, they said, the potential for political parties forming along tribal lines was used as an excuse to ''sustain a system that deprives people of their rights and freedoms.''
Mr. Hempstone is the first American ambassador in Africa to express publicly what is an emerging policy in Washington - that African democracies will be favored for aid - and he said that he was only trying to do what was best for Kenya.
Kenya last year received $65 million in economic aid from Washington.
''I will continue to argue for the maintenance and, indeed, for an increase in aid,'' he said. ''But it won't make it any easier for me or for Kenya if Kenya is not ahead of the curve.''

For This Class On Shakespeare, Play's the Thing

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif.

 BODY:
Hugh Richmond gives no midterms or final exams in his ''Shakespeare in the Theater'' class at the University of California at Berkeley. For this English professor's students, all the world's a stage, and his students are the players.
Forty percent of students' grades depend on their comprehension of the play as shown in how they play their roles or perform behind-the-scenes work on makeup, costumes or lighting. Acting ability does not count. 
In three performances in April before small audiences in Wheeler Hall, Professor Richmond's students tackled ''The Famous History of the Life of King Henry VIII.'' The play is considered one of Shakespeare's weakest, and many scholars believe he wrote little of it, attributing the work instead to John Fletcher.
''It may not be 'Romeo and Juliet,' but I think it's a great play,'' said Hilary Ivancovich, a sophomore economics major from Watsonville, Calif., who played the duchess, the king's sister.
 
An Alternative to Lectures
Students are also required to write a five-page essay that shows how the performance increased their understanding of the play. That counts for 50 percent of their grade, according to the course description. The remaining 10 percent depends on class participation.
''Instead of passively being lectured at, you're actually doing things - memorizing the speeches,'' Professor Richmond said. ''If you perform it, your knowledge is enormously enriched.''
Fifty students whose majors range from English to physics are enrolled, the largest number ever, Professor Richmond said. Previously, he said, enrollment was 30 to 40.
Professor Richmond said the play's the thing that has captured the students' attention. ''People who come to see the play come back to take part in a later production,'' he said.
 
A Little Bit of the Ham
Students say the class's popularity has grown by word of mouth, and relies in part on there being a little bit of the ham in everyone. It offers the opportunity to ''act and get credit for it,'' Miss Ivancovich said.
''King Henry VIII,'' a sequel to ''Richard III,'' is Shakespeare's last play, Professor Richmond said, chosen because it is a ''neglected play'' and unfamiliar to his students.
''We are an academic institution,'' he said. ''I think we should do things that commercial theaters cannot do.''
The performances were videotaped under the direction of Paul Shepard, a staff member, who also directed the play. A copy will be placed in Moffitt Library for faculty, staff and student use, Mr. Shepard said.
 
'You Forget You're in a Class'
Because the play is rarely performed, Professor Richmond said, the tape will be a valuable addition to the university's collection. He added that he anticipates other universities will request copies.
Professor Richmond said he has been putting his students on stage and behind the scenes assisting with makeup, lighting, sound and costumes almost every year since 1977, when he produced ''Love's Labor's Lost.'' This year's program budget is $3,000, he said, financed by the university's College of Letters and Science. The class borrowed elaborate costumes from Berkeley's drama department, but there are few props and no sets.
''You forget you're in a class,'' said Robert Fulton, a senior English major from Malibu, Calif., who plays a dancer and a nobleman in ''Henry VIII.''
Miss Ivancovich said her part as the duchess has given her an appreciation of the interchangeability of male and female roles in Shakespeare's works - the subject of her class paper.
Professor Richmond's production of ''King Henry VIII'' changes the role of lord chamberlain to that of the duchess. The switch, Miss Ivancovich said, ''not only adapts well, but works better.''

Ability to Pay Becomes Factor in Admissions

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
Smith College has ended its system of admitting students without regard to their ability to pay.
''It is the first among the most selective liberal arts colleges that we know of to have taken such action,'' said Dallas Martin, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. Mr. Martin noted that while several colleges have publicly re-examined their admissions policies and others are privately discussing them, none had openly abandoned them.
Smith's president, Mary Maples Dunn, said, ''The board of admissions unanimously wished to continue to guarantee the full need to students we admit.'' Other officials said the college could no longer afford the policy. 
Ms. Dunn said the change would primarily hurt students on the lower end of admission ranking who need financial aid. It will become effective in the selection of the class that will enter Smith in the fall of 1991, said Debra Bradley, the news director at the college.
The new policy calls for Smith to distribute a budgeted amount of financial aid, starting with the top-ranked students and proceeding downward through the lower-ranked but still acceptable applicants. Each student admitted will be given the full amount of money she needs. But once the financial aid budget is exhausted, students who remain on the acceptable list but need financial aid will not be admitted.
 
'Totally Outraged'
This new procedure was adopted last February, when the college's board of admissions, following a recommendation from the board of trustees to limit financial aid, voted the change. Students have charged that the college, where tuition, room and board in September will total $20,140, is moving toward elitism, and some demonstrated against the change last month.
''We were totally outraged that a policy such as this could have been implemented without telling the students,'' said an organizer of the rally, Paula Rojas, a sophomore from Houston majoring in government and Latin American studies.
Alison Friedman, a French studies major from Concord, Mass., and co-chairwoman of the Association of Low Income Students, said, ''It's unrealistic to achieve socio-economic diversity with such a policy.''
 
Increased Costs
Another organizer of the rally, Amy Loper, a junior anthropology major from Marion, Iowa, said she thought the new policy would deter students from applying to Smith. ''I know I probably wouldn't have applied if this had been the policy,'' she said. ''The assurance that my family's income wouldn't be taken into consideration was one of my prime factors for applying to this college.''
In 1983, Smith College began admitting students without regard to their financial situation and guaranteeing aid to any student admitted. The college was forced to curtail the practice because of increased costs, said Smith's treasurer, Larry Selgelid. He said that this year, for the first time in a number of years, the college ''will probably come in with a deficit.''
Since the college's admissions policy was established, aid to students has grown at a rate of 20.3 percent a year, the college said. Aid totaled $5.1 million in 1983-84, and climbed to $12.8 million by 1988-89.
The percentage of students receiving financial aid increased to 52.2 percent in 1988-89 from 38 percent in 1983-84. By 1988-89, financial aid costs represented 16.9 percent of the college's total operating expenses, up from 10.1 percent in 1983-84.
 
Spending of Savings a Concern
''The financial aid budget could sink the college budget if left uncontrolled,'' said the board of trustees chairwoman, Phoebe Lewis.
Mr. Selgelid said the college did not want to dig more deeply into the endowment because ''we don't want to spend our savings today so that it won't be there for tomorrow's student.''
Under the new policy, financial aid will continue to grow, but at a slower rate, Mr. Selgelid said. The president's office explained that the college is aiming to stabilize financial aid at 15 percent of the operating budget within four years.
Faced with a similar financial aid squeeze, Tufts University in Medford, Mass., recently discussed changing its admissions policy in the face of a projected shortfall in financial aid for next year of up to $500,000 - a figure that could double if the state reduces money for aid, which has been suggested.
In 1982, Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., announced - but was never forced to enact - a new policy that would have effectively ended admissions without regard to financial need.
The dean of admissions and financial aid at Wesleyan, Karl M. Furstenberg, said a number of factors -including a successful $50 million fund-raising effort of which $10 million was pegged for financial aid -rendered the new policy unnecessary.
Smith College has not yet announced its decision to change the admissions policy and, Ms. Dunn said, ''I don't know that we were really planning on announcing it at all.''
The new policy was not made public until the student newspaper, The Sophian, published an article about it on April 26. ''It was unfortunate that the information came out that way,'' Ms. Dunn said.

EVEN THE MUSIC WAS RECYCLED

BYLINE: By JOHN PARELES

 BODY:
Amid the Earth Day festivities in New York's Central Park, some of the most ingenious recycling took place in the music on stage. Many of the performers made the effort to do something more than flog their latest hits; they gave at least a passing thought to the cause.
Daryl Hall and John Oates had the panache to resurrect Marvin Gaye's ''Mercy, Mercy Me (The Ecology),'' recorded in 1971 and not outdated in its despair over ''radiation underground,'' while Edie Brickell realized that Bob Dylan's ''Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall'' (not coincidentally her most recent recording, for the soundtrack of the film ''Born on the Fourth of July'') was as appropriate to environmental apocalypse as it was to the fears of nuclear war that inspired it in the early 60's. And the rally could almost have commissioned the B-52's, whose latest songs - especially ''Roam,'' about enjoying the wilderness - gamely, campily grin through environmental worries. 
Whatever cleverness the performers showed was amplified by the sheer sense of event. Like the sun's gravity bending a light beam, the rally's size and fervor bent other songs to fit its theme.
With a million-strong audience attuned to messages about the state of the environment, songs whose meanings had long seemed settled were transformed. Love songs no longer seemed like private affairs; Ben E. King's ''Stand by Me'' became an anthem of concern and solidarity, while Hall and Oates's ''I Can't Go for That'' became a protest instead of a romantic gripe. Even the Bee Gees' morosely self-involved ''I Started a Joke,'' sung by the Roches, could be taken as a parable about unthinking consumption and disposal.
Rallies and benefits are good places to hear songs getting reinterpreted. At the series of Farm Aid concerts over the last several years, songs about home and work and land have all seemed pointed and topical; at Amnesty International shows, Sting's ''Set Them Free'' - a song that urges lovers not to be possessive - became anthemic. ''That's What Friends Are For,'' a hunk of sappy sentimentality, gained some gravity when Dionne Warwick turned it into a fund-raiser for AIDS. No harm done; context isn't everything, but it accounts for more of a song's impact than most songwriters foresee. Such flexibility is one of pop's deepest pleasures and easiest corruptions. As gospel and soul singers know, the same song can sound devotional or lusty, give or take a few pronouns and a change of venue from church to club; thus the continuing pilferage through the centuries, as pop steals from religious music and religious music steals pop tricks in return. In the vast majority of pop songs, the flexibility of interpretation makes each lover or dancer an intimate of the singer, who seems, like a fortuneteller or con artist, to know the whole story.
But the same thing that makes pop songs democratic - anybody can have their interpretive fling with a song - makes them promiscuous; they lend themselves to commercials as well as benefits, demagoguery as well as education. Movie and television soundtrack producers can make love songs ominous or political songs complacent. The meanings of songs can be grabbed just as easily by the highest bidder as well as by the most well-meaning (or farfetched) cause.
Heartwarming as the performers' show of concern was at Earth Day, the recording business has its own imperatives that could hardly be called ecological. The large companies are nettled by an organization called Ban the Box. The advocacy group, started by the independent Rykodisc label and directed against the 6-by-12-inch disposable packages called longboxes that are used for CD's in the United States, has been busily publicizing the price (do consumers really want to pay an extra dollar for it?) and wastefulness of the longbox. It would prefer no longboxes or, in a pinch, reusable display boxes designed to prevent shoplifting.
Ban the Box must be having some effect, since the American record business has launched a countercampaign. They want to keep the longbox, because the bigger package has more visual impact on a record-store shelf. As the LP disappears, the record companies want to hang on to some form of packaging that will advertise the product.
Just in time for Earth Day, a group of major and independent labels responded with their own initiative. They noted that many longboxes are now made from recycled paper, which sidesteps the fact that they still cost money to make and are still thrown away by the vast majority of CD buyers.
Even better, the record companies came up with a project that's nothing less than breathtaking in its transparent hypocrisy. To prove their green consciousness, record companies are planning to print ecological suggestions on the longboxes - presumably to be read and taken to heart in the few moments before the package hits the trash. (One prospective hint urges readers to keep car tires properly inflated, which would promote fuel economy while music fans are cruising for burgers. Pretty radical.) This is exactly the kind of gambit that could catch on in a big way. No doubt we can look forward to ecological messages on polystyrene foam containers and aerosol cans and disposable cameras, all in the name of heightened environmental consciousness. Think of it: towering landfills could be devoted exclusively to throwaways that claim good intentions.
As messages go, the ecological suggestions are nothing if not direct; unlike songs, they're supposed to be interpreted in just one way. But give me the volatile, indirect, undependable messages of pop songs any time.

HEADLINE: RECORDINGS;
A New Caribbean Generation Sets Listeners to Swaying

BYLINE: By DAISANN MCLANE; Daisann McLane writes about Caribbean and Latin music for The Village Voice, Rolling Stone and other publications.

 BODY:
Fusion - of rhythms, ethnic groups and cultures - has vitalized Caribbean music for hundreds of years. A generation ago, the musical import-export trade proceeded at a steady but gradual pace. A Haitian group would tour Cuba and return with Latin songs in their set. Cuban records trickled down to Trinidad, influencing the horn arrangements of the calypsos.
Things move much faster these days. Because of improved recording technology, and increased movement of Caribbean people to and from their home countries and northern media centers like New York, London and Paris, a rhythm developed in one end of the region can rip up dance floors a thousand miles away in a matter of months, even weeks. 
A soca record from Trinidad makes a splash in northern Brazil, where a local musician who likes the beat modifies it, then adds it to a popular Bolivian melody. The new sound is a hit in Bahia, where a French record company executive on vacation hears it, buys the rights and takes it to Paris. And everything comes up lambada.
A marketing coup, a pop fad, and a silly one at that. But remember, Freddie and the Dreamers paved the way for the Beatles. And perhaps lambada's hip-loosening action will have a more lasting side effect: to attract a wider audience to the much richer music being produced by a new generation of Caribbean singer-songwriters. Among them are the Dominican Republic's Juan Luis Guerra, who will be performing at Avery Fisher Hall next Sunday and whose latest album is ''Ojala que Llueva Cafe'' (Karen Records KLP-126; LP and cassette), and Joe Arroyo from Colombia, who has recently released ''En Accion'' (Fuentes 201705; LP and cassette).
Performers like these, along with Trinidad's David Rudder and Panama-born Ruben Blades, come from distinctly different places and traditions, but they have one important thing in common: they understand the sound of the Caribbean. Rooted in the abundant rhythmic and folkloric sources of their home cultures, but steeped in the music of other islands, and in Western pop and jazz, these musicians are creating irresistible Caribbean pop music that moves more than bodies. Original and modern, they are leaders of a tropical New Wave. Mr. Guerra stands out in the world of merengue, where the routine pelvic action makes Elvis Presley look arthritic, and where the lyrics would give censors heart attacks if they weren't in heavily accented Dominican Spanish. Tall and a bit nerdy in baggy slacks, with a brown fedora pulled shyly over his bearded face, Mr. Guerra stands seriously at the microphone, and hardly moves.
His songs aren't standard merengue fare either; where other popular merengueros opt for comic, sexy double-entendre and hard-driving horns (sample titles: ''My Waist,'' ''The Black Man Can't Do It''), Mr. Guerra's merengue is university-level; he goes for the delicate metaphor, the deftly told tale and sweet vocal harmony arrangements. The titles of two singles from Mr. Guerra's latest album tell the story best: ''Ojala que Llueva Cafe'' (''May It Rain Coffee'') and ''Visa para un Sueno'' (''Visa for a Dream'').
Mr. Guerra's compositions, which combine a political awareness with more downto-earth concerns like love and romance, reflect the influence of the nueva cancion (modern Latin folk music with a political edge), but Mr. Guerra is also very much in the tradition of North American folk rockers of the 70's, like James Taylor. The difference is that Mr. Guerra uses the powerful rhythms and song forms of his native Dominican Republic, and borrows styles (mainly soca and salsa) from the rest of the Caribbean.
Mr. Guerra may have arty aspirations, but on his home turf he's no cult figure; his music is accessible, and extremely popular. Each of his four albums has produced hit singles. Strong melodies and inventive arrangements keep his work at street level; his best tunes, like ''Si Tu Te Vas'' (''If You Go'') from his 1985 recording ''Mudanza y Acarreo,'' linger in the brain long after first exposure. Unlike other merengue arrangers, Mr. Guerra likes to layer voices instead of horns (Mr. Guerra's band, Grupo 440, includes three other lead singers), so that his previous album often sounds like a dizzy, tropical take on the jazz ensemble Manhattan Transfer.
But on ''Ojala que Llueva Cafe,'' Mr. Guerra has pushed the harmonies to the background and brought his own voice up front. At first listening the choice seems unwise; Mr. Guerra's tenor is earnest but thin and nasal. However, without the distraction of tricky vocal arrangements, the attention is drawn to the songs, and they are among his best, full of nostalgia for a Caribbean past, frustration with the economic and social limitations of the present and hopes for a better future.
There's no better place to look for a tropical New Wave esthetic than Cartagena, the colonial port city that faces the Caribbean from the Spanish Main. And Joe Arroyo is Cartagena's proudest pan-Caribbean export. He started singing there when he was 10 years old to help support his mother, and his first professional gig was in a whorehouse. From there he's gone on to become a national hero. Mr. Arroyo started out as a salsa singer with popular Colombian bands like the Latin Brothers and Fruko - Colombia has for years been a nation of salsa fanatics.
But since forming his own group in the mid-80's, Mr. Arroyo has expanded his music to include elements from all parts of the Caribbean, Colombia and Africa. On his groundbreaking 1988 album, ''Fuego en Mi Mente'' (''Fire in My Brain''), and its strong followup, ''En Accion,'' Mr. Arroyo skips from salsa to merengue to soca, zouk and cumbia, the African-Indian-Spanish music of his homeland. No other Caribbean artist covers so much territory.
Mr. Arroyo is a descendant of slaves imported by the Spaniards to Colombia in the 17th century, and the lyrics of his songs carry the weight of Caribbean history. ''No Le Pega la Negra'' (''Don't Hit the Black Woman'') can stand next to anything Bob Marley or the Mighty Sparrow has written about slavery and its consequences; ''En Barranquilla Me Quedo'' (''I'm Staying in Baranquilla'') is as emotional an evocation of place and home as you will find in any Caribbean singer's repertory.
But it's Mr. Arroyo's amazing voice that has caught the attention of an international audience. A powerful tenor, urgent and full of spirit, Mr. Arroyo would sound quite at home in any black church in the United States singing duets with Al Green. When he sings a capella, as he does in his signature song ''A Mi Dios Todo Le Debo'' (''I Owe Everything to God''), Mr. Arroyo lifts his listeners - quite literally. At his recent Palladium show in Manhattan, Mr. Arroyo's fans responded by tossing each other high into the air.

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
Ballet Theater's Challenge: To Reclaim Its Soul

BYLINE: By ANNA KISSELGOFF

 BODY:
Paradise regained? Anyone who thinks - as many do - that American Ballet Theater misplaced its soul during the decade that Mikhail Baryshnikov was its artistic director will now be closely watching a new regime determined to redefine the company's identity. Tomorrow's opening of the troupe's 50th-anniversary season in New York at the Metropolitan Opera House begins an era in which Jane Hermann and Oliver Smith, the recently named co-directors, promise to restore certain names and policies identified with Ballet Theater's past. They must, of course, go forward without appearing to step backward.
Once again, Ballet Theater finds itself in a state of flux similar to the one that marked its 40th birthday in 1980. At that time, Mr. Baryshnikov succeeded Mr. Smith and Lucia Chase, the company's founding patron. But the issues today are different. Mr. Baryshnikov's policies blurred stylistic distinctions between Ballet Theater and other troupes, and much of the new focus is geared toward reasserting a more familiar profile. Whether modern taste can still accept the early dance-dramas of Antony Tudor, the great choreographer associated with Ballet Theater, as the company's representative symbol is another matter. Moreover, a current financial crisis may well dictate how adventuresome the repertory will be with respect to the box office. 
The company's jubilees tend to be tinged with uncertainty (it was saved from dissolution on its 25th anniversary in 1965 by a grant from the newly established National Endowment for the Arts). Yet, Ballet Theater has survived remarkably, thanks largely to the moments of glorious dancing that have consistently studded its history. Despite tumult and transformations, Ballet Theater inevitably follows a natural tendency to remain itself. It continues to be a classical ballet company distinguished from others by the widest repertory in the world; yes, a gallery of the dance.
This is how Mr. Baryshnikov found the company and that is how he left it. His shift of emphasis was a matter of degree, but it was significant.
The troupe's artistic profile is now poised between two views of what ballet should emphasize: An accent on formal classical style, as promoted by Mr. Baryshnikov, or Ballet Theater's traditional identification with dramatic values and the use of classical technique to express feeling rather than pure form.
An outsider might consider these as intramural details. But in the end, Mr. Baryshnikov's changes (especially in familiar versions of the classics) offended a public that knew its ballet and that was not eager to see Ballet Theater duplicate the artistic policies of other companies.
Mr. Baryshnikov's taste tilted toward ballets by George Balanchine and 19th-century classics derived from versions he had known at the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad. He also favored works by experimental modern-dance choreographers investigating the academic idiom. By contrast, Ms. Hermann and Mr. Smith now guarantee at least two revivals a year from two of Ballet Theater's distinguished founding choregraphers, Agnes de Mille and Tudor, who died in 1987. To those who might not find the dance-dramas within that repertory overly exciting, Ms. Hermann replies, ''Too bad, that's Ballet Theater.''
The golden mean, of course, lies in between, as the company's tentative plans indicate. Dramatically oriented choreographers who will probably turn up at Ballet Theater include Jiri Kylian, Tudor's artistic heir and director of the Netherlands Dance Theater, and Glen Tetley, a company alumnus who has recently created some of his best work at the National Ballet of Canada during his banishment from Ballet Theater in the Baryshnikov years. But that future also includes Twyla Tharp, a Baryshnikov favorite, and any innovative newcomer who emerges from the scores of videotapes that have ''inundated'' Ms. Hermann after Mr. Baryshnikov's premature departure in September. Mr. Baryshnikov, who had planned to leave in July 1990, departed early, following a clash over finances and personnel with Ballet Theater's board and Ms. Hermann.
A major expectation is that the dancers will again feel free to project the individualized stage presence that embodied Ballet Theater's signature through the 1960's.
In the 1970's, however, the company was attracting audiences through sheer dance power. Mr. Baryshnikov took this trend to its logical conclusion. He asked the public to look upon Ballet Theater as an ensemble where what was danced was more important than who was dancing.
At the same time, he narrowed the company's stylistic range. A positive result has been the giant improvement in the company's classical technique and style - achieved in part through increasing the number of ballets that require this technique, namely works by Balanchine and Kirov-derived versions of the 19th-century classics. The programming balance tipped toward plotless ballets and away from more varied fare.
Did Mr. Baryshnikov really try to turn Ballet Theater into a copy of the Kirov or to ''Balanchinize'' the company? If so, he did not get very far. But there is no doubt that he blurred the company's distinctiveness and that this issue is the focus of the new regime.
''A.B.T. should have something of its own to say, with a different profile,'' Ms. Hermann declared in an interview before the season, adding that the troupe should be ''aggressive in pursuing new works - they are what keeps the dancers fresh and alive.''
Mr. Smith, whose beginnings as a theatrical designer included creating the decor for Jerome Robbins's ''Fancy Free'' in 1944, believes that the current emphasis on classical style must be balanced with dramatic values, what he calls ''a subconscious current of understanding in the dancing, a subtext.'' Tudor's genius is above dispute: He was an innovator who introduced a new expressionism into classical ballet, as embodied in his masterpiece ''Dark Elegies.'' But there is a myth-making quality about the company's recent attempt to make him the equivalent of Balanchine in the New York City Ballet.
Richard Pleasant, the architect-turned-administrator who founded Ballet Theater in 1939, created what became the equivalent of a major acting repertory company with a plethora of choreographers. At its worst, this policy led to the manufacturing of disposable works. At its best, it fostered outstanding creative diversity.
Within this context, Ballet Theater is Tudor's company, but it is not a Tudor company. It is as a touchstone of excellence that Ballet Theater should regard his works, not as an esthetic guideline for the company's profile as a whole.
Mr. Baryshnikov was correct in his intuition that Ballet Theater should not identify only with a narrative esthetic developed in the 1930's and 40's. But he swung the other way, introducing formally oriented modern-dance choreographers, such as David Gordon, Karole Armitage, Mark Morris and Ms. Tharp, who regarded ballet technique as an alien language to be mocked or explored, rather than taken for granted.
Ballet Theater's audience, however, is familiar with the academic vocabulary as well as with the standard versions of the 19th-century and early 20th-century classics.
Mr. Baryshnikov's mistake was not that he tried to revise the classics but that his versions were less successful - less coherent, less choreographically rich - than previous Ballet Theater stagings.
Like a producer eliminating everyone's favorite aria from a favorite opera, Mr. Baryshnikov, for instance, took out the male solo traditional to Ballet Theater's staging of Michel Fokine's ''Sylphides.'' In fact, he replaced Fokine's own staging for the company with the Kirov version. One of Ms. Hermann's first acts next season will be to restore the version that has come down from Fokine's Ballet Theater production in 1940. ''It is ironic to see a Kirov version when A.B.T. had a lovely version from Fokine,'' Ms. Hermann says.
Where does Ballet Theater go from here? Mr. Smith's return to his former post as co-director is a symbol of continuity. It is obvious, nonetheless, that fresh ideas will be required.
Since the 50th-anniversary season was planned by Mr. Baryshnikov, it will not be until the 1990-91 season that audiences will have a clearer sense of the sort of repertory that will be offered under the new directors. Both warn that they are nowhere near the negotiating stage with any choreographers except for Mr. Kylian, one of whose successes with the Netherlands Dance Theater, ''Sinfonietta,'' will be danced by Ballet Theater next season. Mr. Kylian has also promised a new work in the next two years.
Mr. Robbins and Eliot Feld don't like their names bandied about as prospective prodigals returning to Ballet Theater, but the door is said to always be open to them. In addition to Mr. Tetley and Ms. Tharp, Ballet Theater would like to contact Maguy Marin, James Kudelka, Alberto Mendez of the National Ballet of Cuba and Laszlo Seregi, Hungary's leading choreographer. Ms. Hermann, impressed with one of Mr. Seregi's children's ballets, is considering asking him to restage a new version of ''Coppelia'' or ''The Nutcracker.''
As for repertory derived from other companies, Mr. Smith urges something new: Ballet Theater's first staging of ''Rouge et Noir,'' one of Massine's famous symphonic ballets of the 1930's. Ms. Hermann would like to see a Paris Opera Ballet staging of the 19th-century French ballet ''Sylvia'' and more works by Frederick Ashton.
Modern-dance choreographers, in Mr. Smith's view, ''are from another world,'' and Ms. Hermann welcomes only those who ''speak to the technique of our dancers.''
What she really wants, she says, is ''a resident choreographer who does not dominate the company but gives it a profile - Tudor was this kind of choreographer, one able to develop his work within the company.''
The difference, of course, is that Ballet Theater has doubled in size since the 1940's and is in the midst of a large-scale financial crisis. Ms. Hermann, engaged originally by Mr. Baryshnikov as Ballet Theater's executive director, clashed with him over cost-cutting when she trimmed the projected $23 million budget for 1989-90 to the present $18 million.
Ms. Hermann's stated determination to pay off current loans is bound to affect future repertory. In New York, Ballet Theater is faced with filling the Met, a 3,800-seat house. Tudor used to recall that he learned to choreograph in the intimate setting of Marie Rambert's tiny Mercury Theater in London. Today's choreographic novices are thrown upon the cavernous space of the Met stage.
It isn't difficult to discern box-office considerations in plans for staging potential crowd-pleasers with fresh versions of ''The Nutcracker'' and ''Coppelia.'' Yet, a Massine revival like ''Rouge et Noir,'' especially if its Matisse decor is properly reproduced, could be a spectacular challenge as well as a spectacular risk.
Ballet Theater will have to balance the safe with the bold. Unfortunately, it may have to follow the audience rather than lead the way in order to survive in the short run.
Ballet Theater also has the flexibility to capitalize on the public's thirst for outstanding personalities at a time when stars are downplayed in other troupes. It is no accident that the May 14 performance of ''Giselle'' with Yekaterina Maksimova and Vladimir Vasiliev, guests from the Bolshoi Ballet, is already sold out. Nor is it startling that the young Julio Bocca, invited by Mr. Baryshnikov into the company in 1987, is already a draw through his virtuosity and artistry.
Having survived largely as a showcase for magnificent dancing, Ballet Theater faces the all-American dilemma: Is it box office or is it art? The two are not mutually exclusive.
 
 
 
PARTY TIME
 American Ballet Theater is having an eight-week birthday party. Its 50th-anniversary season, filled with old works and new, opens tomorrow night with a gala at the Metropolitan Opera House.
On Tuesday evening, New Yorkers will be introduced to ''Brief Fling,'' Twyla Tharp's romp with music by Michel Colombier and Percy Grainger, which delighted audiences during the company's winter tour. Ms. Tharp will also be represented on May 15 by the complete version of ''Nine Sinatra Songs.''
Tuesday's bill concludes with a choreographic birthday cake: the company's first New York performance of ''Birthday Offering,'' which Sir Frederick Ashton devised in 1956 to honor the 25th anniversary of the Sadler's Wells Ballet (the British troupe now known as the Royal Ballet). This elegant divertissement to music of Alexander Glazunov will be led by Susan Jaffe in the role created by Dame Margot Fonteyn.
The Tuesday program also includes the late Antony Tudor's ''Jardin aux Lilas,'' a poignant ballet choreographed in 1936 about a woman who must marry a man she does not love. When staged by Ballet Theater in 1940, it immediately established Tudor as a master of the dramatic ballet. Carla Fracci, the Italian ballerina, will make the second of two guest appearances as the work's heroine. Her first comes at tomorrow's gala.
The eight-week season will also include revivals of two works by Agnes de Mille, another choreographer long associated with the company. ''Rodeo,'' her cowboy comedy that was last seen in 1982, returns to the repertory Wednesday night. ''Fall River Legend,'' a character study inspired by the life of Lizzie Borden, the shy New England spinster accused of murdering her father and stepmother, will be performed on June 8 in what will be the first production of that work since 1980.
The company has always emphasized spectacular dancing as well as eclectic choreography. The charismatic Fernando Bujones is appearing as a guest artist. Other guests, in addition to Miss Fracci, include Yekaterina Maksimova and Vladimir Vasiliev of the Bolshoi Ballet. Faruk Ruzimatov, who comes from the Kirov Ballet, has joined the troupe as a principal dancer. And, of course, the company's own roster is a distinguished one.
The birthday candles are indeed burning brightly.

HEADLINE: Does Affirmative Action Work?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is amazing how people can look at the same data and come away with completely different conclusions. In ''Affirmative Action and Competitiveness'' (April 22), Bennett Harrison and Lucy Gorham conclude that we need stronger affirmative action programs to bring up the level of African-American wages. 
I see the same data and can only conclude that affirmative action programs are not working. We have spent billions on these programs, created equal employment opportunity laws, created minority set-asides, created minority business enterprise regulations and fostered untold numbers of schemes to bring minorities into the work force and raise their level of participation in our economy.
If 20 years and billions of dollars have done little to solve the problem, why do the authors assume that still more laws, regulations and money will solve anything in the future?
Our country should stand for equality of opportunity. We cannot guarantee equality of results.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
For G.M., The Bad News Is Pretty Good

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
When is a 54 percent cut in profits good news? When it's from General Motors.
G.M. stock managed to rise late last week on news of the sharp earnings drop, simply because that decline was less than the one Wall Street expected.
The market reaction after the profit announcement Thursday also reflected Wall Street hopes that the worst was behind the American economy, as growth begins to accelerate after a successful ''soft landing'' earlier this year. 
That happy consensus was thrown into doubt on Friday, however, when the Government stunned the financial markets with a report that far fewer people were working in April than had been expected.
Suddenly, the economic bears were crowing. ''We may be at a critical shifting point, where the markets say a recession is coming,'' said David Bostian, the chief economist of Jesup & Lamont Inc. Treasury bond prices jumped, and, after some hesitation, the stock market decided that the good news of lower rates outweighed recession fears. The Dow Jones industrial average reached 2,710.36, a weekly gain of 65.31 points.
The economic evidence now seems to point to relatively strong manufacturing, as businesses invest in new equipment, combined with a weak consumer sector that could end the party. The optimists think the Federal Reserve will assure that does not happen.
G.M. and the other auto companies were hurt by the consumer slowdown, but it wasn't the profit reports that had Wall Street tongues wagging. It was G.M.'s plan to boost pensions for 3,350 top executives, most notably the retiring chairman, Roger B. Smith, who wants to raise his pension to $1.25 million a year, from $700,000. That's about $600 per hour for each 40-hour week he won't work.
The justification is that G.M. needs higher pensions to attract better executives. Given the company's declining market share and uneven profits under Mr. Smith, a case can be made for such a need, but it is hard to understand just why the incentive is required for an executive about to retire anyway.
One legacy of Mr. Smith's regime is the promise that the company's class E and H shares, issued during the takeovers of Electronic Data Systems and Hughes Aircraft, would rise in price for a number of years. In a bear market, that guarantee could cost the company billions. Perhaps Mr. Smith would like to cut a deal giving him more money if the guarantee works out for G.M. and less if it doesn't.
Whether Mr. Smith gets his money is up to G.M.'s shareholders. They may recall that G.M. was the only one of the Big Three auto makers to pay a dividend each year of the 1980's, and that - assuming annual reinvestment of dividends - G.M. stock has outperformed the market during the Smith era, which began at the end of 1980. A $1,000 investment then in G.M. would be worth about $3,742 now, compared to $3,424 for the Standard & Poor's 500. On the other hand, G.M.'s rivals did much better. A similar investment in Chrysler would be worth $9,431, and a Ford stake $14,227.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Canada's Market Timing Puzzle

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Canada is an opportunity waiting to happen. The opportunities center on commodities stocks, from copper to paper products, which play a major role in the economy and are expected to benefit from both an expected rebound in the Canadian economy and the recent rise in commodities prices.
The problem is deciding when to invest, given uncertainties over interest rates and the Canadian dollar. But some analysts say these may begin to clear up by this summer. 
In the 1980's, Canada was America's second-favorite foreign stock market after Britain. Of total net purchases of foreign stocks, just under 21 percent, or $5.2 billion, went North. And with Canadian interest rates at record levels, well above those in the United States, Americans have been pouring more into the bond market there recently.
But so far, 1990 has not been great to foreign or Canadian investors. The Toronto stock market has slipped sharply this year. It still doesn't compare to the Japanese slide, but the 15 percent dip in Toronto's TSE 300 index ranks it among the world's biggest losers.
Those high interest rates, combined with a slowing, maybe even declining economy, a widening trade deficit and stubborn inflation around 5 percent dragged the market down.
The Bank of Canada muffed its effort to lower interest rates in January. The Canadian dollar fell so quickly after the central bank dropped its key lending rate by one-quarter of 1 percentage point that the bank had to retreat. Interest rates went up again. The prime rate, now at 14.75 percent, is higher than it was in January.
And the looming constitutional crisis that threatens the unity of English and French-speaking Canada forms an uncomfortable backdrop for all the financial markets. June 23 is the deadline for ratification of the Meech Lake Accord, which would resolve the issue, but the outcome is in doubt.
''This is not good for any of our markets,'' said Wilfred J. Hahn of Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in Toronto, who for now is staying away from stocks and bonds.
But soon, the Bank of Canada will be forced to choose between high interest rates, which it used to fight inflation and support the Canadian dollar, and the prospect of a sharp economic decline if rates are not lowered. The economy is expected to win.
The Canadian dollar will then fall. That will be especially tough on the bond market, Mr. Hahn says, which has been propped up by large purchases from Japan and West Germany, as well as the United States. Once this hot money has fled, he said, the lower rates will make both bond and stock prices attractive again.
With the decline in the market this year, many stocks are already at a fair price in relation to earnings, which could help a small rally in the near term.
Eric S. Sprott, president of Sprott Securities in Toronto, is a close watcher of commodities and believes their recent price increases mean there are some opportunites now. ''The Canadian market, notwithstanding Meech Lake, notwithstanding interest rates, will be an extremely interesting market to be invested in,'' he said. A move by the Bank of Canada to lower interest rates has to be ''awfully, awfully near,'' he added.
He is interested in metals companies, like Cominco Ltd. and Inco Ltd., and in forest product companies like the Canfor Corporation, Crestbrook Forest Industries and Malette Inc. But he warns that the uncertainty of pulp paper prices makes paper stocks somewhat risky.
He said the decline in the Canadian dollar will help increase exports by making them cheaper, benefitting companies like Cominco that report earnings in that currency.
Many analysts think the Bank of Canada could move to ease interest rates in the next several months, especially because preliminary figures show the gross domestic product declining in the first two months of the year. But the level of inflation and the mistake the central bank made in January could lead it to hold on longer.
So Mr. Hahn is more sure of the opportunities but less certain about when to take advantage of them. ''We're heading to something that could be pretty dramatic,'' he said. ''I'm just waiting for the last kick of the cat.''

A Soviet Appetite for U.S. Knowhow

BYLINE: By GEORGE CAPSIS; George Capsis, a business consultant, is president of International Market Development Inc.

 BODY:
I have been doing business in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe for more than 20 years. I know the Soviet Union quite well. Last October, when I was in Moscow trying to sell American computer technology to the Soviets, the director of one of the large departments of a ministry chastised me by saying: ''You Americans are late. Two Europeans have already submitted their bids.'' 
I had been brought to this office and to Moscow by a Soviet scientist, Stanislav I. Samolyenko, vice chairman of the Council of Cybernetics of the Soviet Academy of Science, who has been a friend for 20 years. Dr. Samolyenko is the creator of an elegantly simple algorithm that could become a world standard for computer network data entry. For two years, I had been helping him sell his ideas to companies in the United States - and we had had some measure of success. Now he wanted to go further and exchange Soviet theoretical science for American hardware and software.
As I searched for a reply to the director, I realized that - yes - we Americans have been late. We have been late to recognize the need the Soviet people have for practical, workable technology and to recognize that the much-vaunted Soviet science is real.
Americans have also been late to realize something I have come to believe quite strongly: The Soviet people want to live like Americans -not like Japanese or West Germans. They admire what we have created. In my experience, given a choice, Russians would rather do business with Americans than with anyone else.
Our needs and those of the Soviet people converge in a number of areas. For 70 years, the best minds in the Soviet Union have taken refuge from political danger and bureaucratic manipulation in the international fraternity of pure science. The Soviet Academy of Science, founded by Peter the Great in 1724, has 60,000 members, and their abilities when applied gave them a lead in space. One-third of all the world's scientists live in the Soviet Union.
But while they excel in theory, they need our expertise in application. One example among many: On the black market, American personal computers and software sell for 10 times what they do in the United States. Merging Soviet and American scientific and high-technology strengths would give us both enormous rewards.
American and Soviet business and government leaders must look beyond hard currency funding, floating the ruble and weapons reduction. They must focus on something much simpler: How can we fulfill each other's most pressing needs, without further delay?

The Thin-Mint Theory of Forecasting

BYLINE: By ROBERT GOLDMAN; Robert Goldman is manager of creative services at Young & Rubicam Inc. in San Francisco.

 BODY:
The senior vice president rested a hand on my shoulder. ''You sure don't look like a Girl Scout,'' he said. ''We're changing with the times,'' I answered. ''Now, are you going to order or not?''
The senior vice president ordered: one box of Shortbreads, one box of Peanut Butter Patties and two boxes of Thin Mints. It was not my biggest order of the day, but I wasn't discouraged. Whether you are selling door-to-door in the suburbs, or office-suite-to-office-suite in a major, multinational corporation, every sale counts. 
Of course, I am not really a Girl Scout. But I am helping out my daughter - a Brownie - a member in good standing of Troop 668, Tiburon, Calif. I also know what makes the cookie - and the customer - crumble, as you might expect from a 20-year veteran of the marketing wars. As you might not expect, in the course of peddling my wares up and down Mahogany Row, I have discovered a new and powerful economic indicator. I call it ''The Thin Mint Factor.'' Now, I am aware that economic gurus like Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, must have their own indicators. Still, it does seem to me that if you want to know what is really happening in the economic world, you should ask a man who has put his Florsheim in the door of a steely-eyed chief financial officer and asked for the order. What better way to understand what is happening than to study how people spend their discretionary income? What better benchmark than the product trademarked with the words, ''a Great American Tradition.''
The domestic cookie business is in the economic spotlight. If you have ever wondered why Henry Kravis shelled out all those billions of somebody else's money to purchase RJR Nabisco (and these days, I suppose even Mr. Kravis must have his doubts), wrap your mind around the concept of being the first kid on your block to corner the market in Fig Newtons, Lorna Doones and Oreos. Compared to this economic coup, the Hunt brothers look like, well, Boy Scouts.
But enough speculation. You don't get an invitation to hold down a club chair on ''Wall Street Week'' without hard facts at your fingertips. After two days of selling, and 191 boxes sold, here's the economic picture, as I see it:
* Consumer demand is strong. Despite the recession predictions from certain Jonahs, I find that, given the right product, consumers are ready to reach for their wallets and spend, spend, spend. I don't want to point fingers here, but if General Motors could produce a car half as good as a Thin Mint, the Japanese wouldn't stand a chance.
* Consumers today are more conservative. Although this year's Girl Scout portfolio included two newcomers, Caramel deLites and Lemon Pastry Cremes, demand for these entries was weak. Despite the high degree of novelty we Americans supposedly expect in our cars, our blenders and our spouses, traditional Shortbreads and Thin Mints were the sellers. Although many customers expressed initial interest in the new offerings, even those on the leading edge of the adoption curve (measuring how products are accepted) expressed relief when offered the old reliables. ''Just put me down for two boxes of Thin Mints,'' they said. ''Better make that three.''
* Health trends are trending down. Last year saw the introduction of the ''cholesterol-free'' concept to the world of Girl Scout cookies in the form of the Golden Yangle. Despite the fact that Yangles are made with soybean oil, in 1990 they represent only 4 percent of my sales.
* Credit purchases represent an economic time bomb. Although orders from my well-heeled customers were hardly sluggish, the news that payment was not required until delivery invariably fanned the fires. Now that my orders are totaled, I see that the incendiary combination of junk food and easy credit has resulted in the addition of $477.50 to the national debt. When you consider all the dads and moms selling Girl Scout cookies in all the Fortune 500 companies across America, one can quickly see that the potential for triggering an economic crisis is very real indeed.
As for the more detailed economic forecasting, I must leave that to Mr. Greenspan. But Mr. Kravis, I am willing to help. After all, we cookie barons must stick together. I don't expect the fat consulting fees he pays to merger and acquisition mavens like Bruce Wasserstein (who, I am given to understand, never sold more than 50 boxes of Girl Scout cookies in his entire career). All I ask is that, when I knock on Henry's office door next year, he show some real appreciation for my contributions. I'm talking one box of Caramel deLites, one box of Peanut Butter Patties and, naturally, two boxes of Thin Mints.
No doubt there is more to be learned from this year's cookie sales, but order forms must be turned into scout headquarters tomorrow and I really have no time left for further analysis.

HEADLINE: All About/Shipbuilding;
After a Long Slump, World Shipping Is Embarking on a Modest Recovery

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
As owner of one of the world's largest fleets, P. N. Tsakos, the president of a Greek shipping line that bears his name, should be relishing his industry's recovery from a decade-long depression in shipping and shipbuilding. Instead, he frets about whether to place large new orders for ships. If he hesitates, prices may rise and shipyards may be booked for years, keeping him from expanding. But if he buys, he risks taking delivery in two or three years - perhaps just as the boom collapses.
Other shipowners, chastened by the long downturn, are being just as cautious. Now, a modest recovery is crowding the shipyards for the first time in years. Many shipowners are turning to the repair yards to renovatefleets. And even in the United States, where the civilian shipbuilding industry has all but evaporated, some builders hope for a revival. Gutsy investors have already made millions buying and reselling tankers.
 
Revived Demand
A cautious response from shipbuilders 
 As recently as three years ago, many of the world's shipyards stood nearly idle, devastated by a glut in ships and a long slump in demand. Some new ships were towed straight to the scrap yards. But after cutting their capacity by almost 60 percent, the world's shipbuilders are so cautious about expanding that many are likely to be working at their production limits for years to come.
The demand for ships is growing. Oil shipments from the Middle East have increased and in the last nine months, 50 large tankers have been ordered - enough to occupy the world's major yards, in Japan and Korea, for the next two to three years. Customers are paying more for long-term ship leases and buyers are finding it easier to get financing. Some banks that suffered huge losses on ship loans during the slump are again showing interest.
But capacity cannot keep up with the rebound in demand. With employment at the Japanese yards plunging to 34,000 in 1989 from 150,000 in 1975, many of the skilled workers went to other industries. Low wages and hard work make it difficult to attract replacements. The reluctance of many nations to continue subsidizing their shipyards also retards expansion. Despite labor cutbacks and higher ship prices, countries like Japan still must subsidize its yards to make up for losses.
Shipowners like Mr. Tsakos say that producers will take the risk of adding capacity once shippers can accept the risk of placing large new orders.
Eastern Europe, especially Poland, might benefit from renewed demand. But an effort by Barbara Piasecka Johnson, the heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune, to revive the Gdansk shipyard has stalled. In Korean shipyards recently, strikers and riot police have battled with each other.
Shipowners say they will not order ships unless shippers sign long-term contracts to lease them. ''We will not order ships on speculation,'' Mr. Tsakos said at a recent conference sponsored by Cypriot officials. Shipowners are also hesitating until they learn whether Congress will require new tankers to have double hulls to lessen the damage from oil spills.
Some shipowners and builders say their caution will bring the industry more stability. Others call these hopes naive. ''That's shipping. It's always been up and down,'' said Klaus E. Oldendorff, the chairman of a Cypriot shipping company. ''There are those who hope that it will be not as bad a yesterday. Of course it will be as bad as yesterday. The only thing I can hope for is that it will not be as bad again for such along time.''
 
Safety at Risk?
A surging trade in renovations
 As many ships near retirement, some doubt whether idle capacity can be revived fast enough to build replacements. The steep increase in prices of new ships - a large tanker that cost $35 million to $40 million a decade ago now costs close to $100 million - and the reluctance of shipowners to place large bets has led to a surge in overhauls.
Like shipbuilding, profitable renovation depends heavily on low wages. Singapore's inexpensive labor has helped make it the world's ship-repair center, attracting about a quarter of the world's overhauls. But even Singapore's shipyards are seeking to cut costs by moving production offshore. Two of Singapore's major yards, Keppel and Sembawang, are attempting to expand into lower-wage countries like the Philippines.
As more shipowners turn to renovation, some acknowlege that safety and environmental risks will increase. Most large tankers are built to last about 20 years, and bulk cargo ships usually last about 25. Some shipowners believe that with proper maintenance a ship will operate for 30 years. Eric Snow, the principal investigator of the Marine Division of the Candadian Transporation Accident Investigation Safety Board, says that older ships are not necessarily more vulnerable to accidents. ''You can have an 18-year-old ship, which has been well-maintained, in much better shape than a six-year-old ship that has been poorly maintained.''
 
Awash in Woes
No safe harbor for the U.S. industry
 It will take a high tide of shipbuilding to raise up the shipyards in the United States. They have been reduced to depending on the Navy for 85 percent of their building and repair work. But some hope to share in the civilian shipbuilding boom. Shipbuilders say they can convert from military to commercial work more easily than most defense contractors. John Stocker, president of the Shipbuilders Council of America, said the yards have improved their productivity building for the Navy. They will also have surplus capacity as military spending is cut back and capacity at foreign yards is strained.
Shipbuilders already blame the Federal Government for some of their woes. The industry withered after President Reagan eliminated shipbuilding subsidies in 1981. The industry now consists of 69 companies with 72,000 workers, down from some 110 companies employing 112,000 production workers 10 years ago. The number of shipyards has shrunk to 15 from 26.
Some in the industry believe the lack of subsidies has forced the yards to become more efficient. Since the Navy has more demanding standards for its ships than private companies do, Mr. Stocker said, the United States could use its experience to win contracts for ships that need more advanced construction, like passenger ships and specialized vessels for carrying products. Some yards, he said, have already attracted repair work from overseas.
Shipbuilding executives say that for the United States to compete, Japan must be induced to curb subsidies to its yards - as American trade negotiators have asked. But the Japan Maritime Research Institute recently issued a report saying that even if shipbuilding subsidies were ended everywhere, the American industry would not be competitive. The study said that American productivity lags far behind that of Far Eastern and European competitors.
 
 
 
A MAN OF THE WORLD
Klaus E. Oldendorff founded the shipping company that bears his name in West Germany. But it is now based in Cyprus, with ships registered there, in Singapore and in Turkey, with crews of Kiribati Islanders from the western Pacific. It is a odyssey that is becoming increasingly common among shipowners as they leave their native lands to search for cheap tax rates and labor.
At a recent shipping conference in New York, Cypriot officials relied on Mr. Oldendorff to persuade more owners to register ships there. ''I see myself as a Cypriot, not a German,'' he said. He has only two Germans on his staff; most staff members are Cypriot.
Mr. Oldendorff moved his company to Cyprus in 1987 to escape German trade, tonnage and income taxes. The only major tax he pays in Cyprus is on income, and that at a ceiling of just 4.25 percent.
The move ended a transition he began 20 years ago when he first registered some ships outside Germany. He needed to compete with Greeks who also had begun to register their fleets where taxes and other costs were low. He found that foreign crews, some from the Far East, accepted lower wages than German seamen.
He has since discovered an even cheaper source of labor. With eight other shipping companies, he set up a training school on one of the Gilbert Islands in the western Pacific, where the Kiribati have a reputation as good seamen. Communications advances have allowed him to recruit his staff and manage his fleet anywhere. As he said, ''It doesn't matter where you are.''

HEADLINE: A Medical Wonder That Isn't - Yet

BYLINE: By LEAH BETH WARD; Leah Beth Ward, a reporter for the Albuquerque (New Mexico) Journal in Santa Fe, has followed the health-care industry as a Wall Street journalist.

 BODY:
A few years back, investors were flocking to a new medical technology involving microscopic bubbles called liposomes. Composed of molecules of fatty acids, liposomes promised a way to administer drugs that ordinarily are too toxic to take in heavy doses.
Experiments showed that the tiny sac-like bubbles, when injected into the bloodstream, could carry powerful anticancer agents to a tumor, yet leave surrounding normal cells unharmed. Dozens of drugs that cause harrowing side effects when taken as a free substance gained new marketing potential. And liposome technology appeared to be on its way to the pharmaceutical big leagues with predictions of a $4 billion market by 1990.
But 1990 is here and, despite some progress toward commercialization, there is no liposomal drug on the market in the United States. Although some clinical trials are progressing for liposomal formulations of drugs to combat cancer and infections, others have been canceled. 
As a result, the patience of many investors has worn thin. The stocks of the three publicly traded companies developing liposomes in the United States - Liposome Technology Inc., of Menlo Park, Calif.; the Liposome Company, of Princeton, N.J., and Vestar Inc. of San Dimas, Calif. - have been trading lately from $1 to $3 a share, down from highs of $9 to $15 a share in 1987, when enthusiasm for the technology was peaking.
What's more, some major drug houses that swooped into position for the commercial payoff have since walked away from collaborative deals with the half-dozen or so companies, some of them private, which are developing the technology.
The Upjohn Company, for example, which had been working with Liposome Technology to develop liposomal formulations of minoxidil, the baldness drug, now ''has nothing going on in that area,'' a spokeswoman said.
''The technology has been a disappointment in terms of doing all the miraculous things it was supposed to do eight or nine years ago,'' conceded Nicolaos Arvanitidis, chairman of Liposome Technology.
What happened in the budding liposome industry is a classic story of the risks that can plague any attempt to develop an untried technology, a particularly dicey endeavor when it comes to the medical field. In the case of liposomes, the promise of the early years has turned into a combination of research delays, manufacturing glitches, financing difficulties and regulatory restrictions.
But despite all the hitches, not everyone is concluding that the liposome bubble has burst.
Though hardly flush with cash, all three publicly traded liposome companies claim promising early results for a few formulations, said Don Barbeau, president of the Biomega Corporation, a consulting firm in Skokie, Ill., that follows the technology. ''These companies are persistent and they've got good science,'' Mr. Barbeau said.
Indeed, the technology is at a make-or-break point as clinical trials advance, according to David Webber, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons, which serves as the investment banker for Vestar. ''We are at a transition point where we're starting to see some evidence of a product,'' Mr. Webber said.
Some industry executives are contending that the big drug companies that abandoned the technology will soon be sorry. ''Some of the big companies are beginning to realize they were wrong,'' said Dr. Marc Ostro, chief science officer at the Liposome Company, which is working with one pharmaceutical giant, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, to develop a liposome application for an antifungal drug.
Liposomes themselves are hardly new. Fatty globules found inside living cells, they were discovered when powerful microscopes were developed in the 19th century. The membranes enclosing these tiny droplets are made of molecules called phospholipids, which resemble soap molecules in an important way - one end is attracted to water while the other end is repelled by water.
When dispersed in water, pairs of phospholipid molecules spontaneously organize themselves end to end, and then the pairs arrange themselves side by side to form a continuous spherical film. Such hollow spheres can hold small amounts of liquid, which are released when the membrane of the liposome is broken down by various natural chemicals in living organisms.
In recent years, experiments revealed that liposomes could be produced in the laboratory to carry powerful therapeutic cargo to specific parts of the body. Liposomes are transported by the blood until they are grabbed by certain organs - including the liver, spleen, lungs, bone marrow and lymph nodes - that filter out or metabolize this type of body. Upon arrival, they ''unload'' their shipment at an infection site or on a tumor. Because liposomes do not accumulate in the skin and gastrointestinal tract, they show promise in preventing the drugs they carry from causing hair loss, nausea and other side effects.
In many cases, American researchers were so enamored of the liposome's natural targeting capacity that they thought it would be a short hop from laboratory production to commercial-scale manufacturing, said Joseph Jacob, chairman and chief executive of Technology Unlimited in Wooster, Ohio, a privately held company working on liposomes.
Some American companies jumped the gun by developing a manufacturing technology to process large batches of liposomes before perfecting the raw material from which the liposomes would be made, said Biomega's Mr. Barbeau.
These companies soon found that one formulation of a liposomal product did not work with all drugs and that the impact liposomes have in the body depends on both their size and the components of the outer layer of their membranes.
Commercially produced liposomes would also have to be stable and not degrade as they sat on the shelf awaiting use. It turned out, however, that they were unstable.
European and Japanese companies have gone about the problem correctly, said Mr. Barbeau, by first attacking the development of the raw materials. Through a joint venture, for example, one Japanese concern, the Nippon Oil and Fats Company, now supplies the Liposome Company with high-purity lipids, or fatty acids, that make up the cell membranes of the liposomes.
Not only was there no universal formulation for liposomes, but directing the path of the laboratory-produced bubbles once they were inside the body turned out to be trickier than anticipated, said Mr. Jacob of Technology Unlimited.
Regulatory obstacles were also underestimated. Enclosing a drug in a liposome affects its behavior, so much so that the Government views the process as yielding essentially a new product requiring extensive scrutiny.
''It appears to be a relatively full-gauge approval process at the Food and Drug Administration,'' said Anthony Evnin, general partner in Venrock Associates, the venture capital arm of the Rockefeller family, which invested in the Liposome Company in the mid 1980's.
By now, all three publicly held liposome companies - and some of the privately owned ones, as well - claim to have solved many of the problems associated with stability and production. Liposome Technology, for example, has a freeze-dried version of a liposomal antibiotic that it says can be stored at room temperature for two to three years.
But full-scale production capability still eludes some companies, analysts say, at least as much from a dearth of financing as from technological problems that might remain.
What progress these companies have made in commercializing liposomes has come by scaling down their own early hopes for widespread applicability. (See box.) Whether liposome technology will ever develop to the point that these companies can become fully integrated and profitable pharmaceutical concerns is still unclear. They may end up as university-based research houses, some experts say, if they can't raise additional capital or sign new lucrative collaborative agreements with major drug companies.
''I'm positive on the technology, but there's a question about whether the payback will be enough to compensate these companies for their time and effort,'' Mr. Barbeau said.
For their part, liposome executives are weary after nearly a decade in the laboratory. But they are still hopeful.
''I would prefer to be a much richer man after nine years of this,'' said Liposome Technology's Mr. Arvanitidis. ''But I think things are finally going our way.''
 
STILL, THEY FIGHT ON
Buffetted by technical, financial and regulatory problems, liposome companies have dropped or suspended research in a number of areas, ranging from inhalation and ophthalmic products to cardiovascular and anti-asthmatic applications.
But despite lower expectations, including sharply reduced sales estimates of $500 million to $1 billion by 1994 or 1995, the competition to reach the marketplace first is still intense.
All three publicly held liposome companies, for example, are racing to produce a delivery system for amphotericin B, a highly toxic antibiotic developed and marketed by Squibb Inc., now part of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. The drug, which is no longer protected by patent, is used to treat infections in patients with compromised immune systems, including people with AIDS and those undergoing cancer chemotherapy or organ transplants.
Because it has a research and development deal with Squibb, the Liposome Company is thought by some analysts to be the front-runner in the amphotericin derby. What's more, Squibb has built manufacturing capacity for commercial production of the liposomal complex. So far, the Liposome Company's version of the drug is showing encouraging results from clinical trials, said Dr. Marc Ostro, the company's chief science officer.
But competitor Vestar Inc. has already filed for approval in Europe of its own formulation of amphotericin. Its product, called Ambisome, was developed under a joint venture with Lyphomed Inc., a pharmaceutical company based in Rosemont, Ill. Shipments to four European countries started last year under a special license that allows Ambisome to be used in potentially fatal cases.
For its part, Liposome Technology Inc. is set to start a second round of testing this summer for still another formulation of amphotericin B. All three companies are also scrambling to produce liposomal forms of various anticancer drugs. The Liposome Company is enjoying something of an edge in this area as well. That is because both Vestar and Liposome Technology recently announced the cancellation of agreements with large pharmaceutical sponsors for the development of one anticancer agent, doxorubicin.
Meanwhile, Technology Unlimited, one of the privately owned companies working on liposomes, claims ''considerable success'' in developing a liposome that looks like a red blood cell and can therefore bypass the body's immune system, where liposomes naturally congregate. If so, this type of formulation would be effective in treating diseases outside the immune system.

Surprise Figures Shake the Dollar

 BODY:
THE employment numbers for April took the market by surprise on Friday and knocked the dollar lower. The surprise was that the report showed a weaker economy than expected. Rather than declining, the unemployment rate rose two-tenths of a percentage point, to 5.4 percent. After adjusting for an influx of census workers, non-farm payroll jobs declined. Because the employment figures run counter to other recent data showing the economy to be relatively strong, the betting is now likely to change on the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. In recent weeks, as economic reports indicated that inflation was resisting pressure to decline, many analysts had decided that the Fed was on the verge of pushing rates slightly higher.

HEADLINE: Craig McCaw's High-Risk Phone Bet

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

DATELINE: KIRKLAND, Wash.

 BODY:
When Craig McCaw's father died in 1969, the McCaw children and their mother discovered that the elder McCaw had so buried his media business in debt that only a single cable-television system remained when all the creditors had been paid off. John Elroy McCaw had had big dreams about building a media empire and he had taken big risks. In the end, the risks were too great and his family was left to pick up the pieces.
Now, a generation later, Craig McCaw has clearly inherited his father's vision, but also his penchant for debt and risk. From that single surviving cable system in Centralia, Wash., which he took over in 1973 when he was 24 years old, Mr. McCaw has already built McCaw Cellular Communications into the nation's largest cellular telephone company. Intent on realizing his grand vision for a cellular telephone kingdom, the softspoken executive has just taken the biggest gamble of his career: the $3.4 billion purchase of control of Lin Broadcasting, a move that will allow him to enter the lucrative and strategically important urban markets.
Essentially, Craig McCaw is betting that the public will want cellular phones. Today about 1.5 percent of the population uses car phones or portable phones. The hope is that the figure will rise to 14 percent in just a decade. 
In agreeing to buy Lin Broadcasting at a time when his own company is already loaded with debt and has never had positive earnings, Mr. McCaw has submerged his business in a sea of red ink so deep that interest payments will devour all its cash flow for at least the next several years.
More and more, Mr. McCaw's resemblance to his father is startling. The challenge is that Craig McCaw signed a quintessential 1980's deal but must see it through in the tougher environment of the 90's. Mr. McCaw acknowledges that as a result of the merger annual losses could exceed $1 billion in some of the next few years. As bankers jittery about the collapse of the ''junk bond'' market shun highly leveraged deals, the flexibility Mr. McCaw once had to sell assets to raise cash may have diminished. And Wall Street is casting a cold eye on companies - like McCaw - valued on assets rather than earning. The company's stock price has been sinking since the deal was proposed.
''He is dependent on so many 'if's' going right,'' said Martin Hyman, a consultant at Booz Allen & Hamilton who follows the cellular industry. Subscriber growth, competition, regulation and the sale of assets are among the unknowns. ''If he has to sell assets, that can weaken the national business he is trying to build,'' Mr. Hyman said. Mr. McCaw is well aware of the risks. ''The key to having dreams is to make sure they come true. Waking up in a cold sweat is not what you want,'' Mr. McCaw, said during an interview at his lakeside headquarters outside Seattle. ''Debt is clearly not a challenge we want today,'' he added, speaking in tones as earnest as any Boy Scout's.
In the meantime, however, the debt load - about 20 percent is at floating rates - is casting a long shadow over McCaw, which has nearly $800 million in revenues and holdings across the country. With 51 percent ownership of Lin, McCaw now controls 72 million ''pops'' - the number of potential customers in a cellular telephone franchise area. And although McCaw had the most pops in the industry before it bought Lin, that deal cemented its lead, giving it more than twice as many as its nearest rival, Pacific Telesis Group.
 
Taking the Lead
To get that lead, Craig McCaw paid dearly. Had McCaw and Lin been combined last year for example, their combined revenues would have been $730 million. But interest payments alone would have been $695 million. And all the cash generated by the company to pay off that interest expense would have been just $227 million. Even if cash flow soars, Mr. McCaw acknowledges it would still not cover interest payments for the next several years, which may force the company to dip further into its $3 billion credit line.
But the idea of creating a nationwide cellular telephone system run by independent companies was a more powerful image for him than a mountain of debt. And Lin was the missing piece he needed, his ''only chance,'' he said, to buy into a company with extensive urban franchises.
With franchises in many suburban areas and middle-sized cities, Mr. McCaw wanted Lin's impressive urban holdings - franchises in seven major cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Dallas. His envisions a jigsaw-puzzle-like network around the country that will enable customers to call each other without the disconnects, delays and aggravation now so common in the industry.
Equally important to him, the deal kept Lin out of the hands of Bell South, one of the telephone companies Mr. McCaw considers a key rival.
If Craig McCaw is a visionary, his vision is not always easy to understand. He has a penchant for talking in convoluted and often obscure terms and is prone to such statements as: ''Electronic highways are much more efficient than concrete highways and flyways.'' Asked why he bought Lin, he once said: ''The network is smarter than the phone and the intelligent network helps support the individual.''
But for all his arcane theorizing, several industry analysts believe Craig McCaw has a realistic chance of realizing his dream. This is, after all, the man who landed on the cover of Business Week last week as the highest paid chief executive in the country. Exercising McCaw stock options he has owned for some years, he came out with stock and salary worth $53 million last year, Over the long term, Mr. McCaw is betting that his company's cash flow can grow because of the nature of the cellular business. The most powerful potential of the industry is that as franchises mature over a five-year period, pre-tax profit margins can swing quickly from losses to highly profitable businesses. ''The operating costs rise so much more slowly than subscriber growth that when the business finally turns, it turns very fast,'' said Mr. Leibowitz.
 
Rising Revenues
 Lin's cellular operations already have profit margins of 50 percent. Lin's cellular division, for example, had 1986 revenues of $41 million and cash flow before depreciation of $2 million. By 1989, revenues had risen to $180 million and cash flow was $96 million.
Industry executives believe that cellular telephones will become as much a part of the American landscape as computers, cable television and fax machines. Cellular appears to be growing faster than fax machines did in their first five years. Paul Kagan & Associates, a media research firm based in Carmel, Calif., said it took six years for fax machines to reach an analogous position.
Not only have the number of cellular subscribers increased, but the rate at which new subscribers are signing up has accelerated. For example, at McCaw subscribers increased 68 percent from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1989. From the the first quarter of 1988 through the comparable period in 1989, the increase was 62 percent.
 
A Speculative Business
 Barry Kaplan, who follows the cellular telephone industry for Goldman Sachs & Company, said cash flow from a combined McCaw-Lin could potentially cover interest expense by 1993. He expects Lin to be generating a positive cash flow after debt service by then. And though cellular telephone users today represent just about 1.5 percent of the population, Mr. Kaplan says that figure could rise to 8.6 percent by 1995. If so, those figures would generate a cash flow of $1.7 billion for McCaw.
But the cellular business is so new that all projections are highly speculative and serious questions remain about McCaw's debt load .
The rising interest rates expected by some economists could put a tremendous strain on cash flow. ''We don't like that, but hopefully, we have thought things through,'' Mr. McCaw said. ''We were certainly aware of the changing times. You make decisions on long-term planning, not on short-term changes in the environment.''
Analysts point out Mr. McCaw could always sell pops. Indeed, to strengthen his balance sheet before buying Lin, Craig McCaw raised $1.2 billion last February by selling some franchises to Contel, an independent telephone company. He also sold a 20 percent stake in his own company to British Telecommunications P.L.C. last year for $1.5 billion.
 
Cellular Assets
 But how much could he get for his pops? Some analysts argue that the prices of cellular properties are now at their peak, having risen dramatically in the last five years. McCaw, for example, paid a record $350 per pop for Lin. But last week, GTE Corporation agreed to pay about $200 per pop for The Providence Journal's cellular franchises.
To be sure, Steven Rattner, an investment banker at Lazard Freres & Company who represented McCaw in the McCaw-Lin transaction, and others argue that the price discrepancy is not as sharp as it seems; the Journal's franchises were not major urban franchises like Lin's. In a more competitive market, GTE might have been forced to pay more - and the general perception of cellular asset values would have been stronger.
That does not seem to have reassured Wall Street, where concern about selling assets, at any price, is worryng investors, pushing the price of cellular stocks down. McCaw is now trading at about 25, down from its 52-week high of 47 1/4, reached last June. One analyst, who asked not to be named said: ''Leveraged asset value plays are out as a concept. The question really is how much liquidity there will be in the future.''
Emanuel Gerard, a partner at Gerard, Klauer Mattison & Company, an investment firm, said that cellular stocks are down now because there are no earnings and no deals to validate the worth of the assets. As to the next five years, will they pay off? ''Cellular has the promise, and if it turns out to have high rates of penetration, the stocks could be fabulous,'' he said. ''If rates are disappointing, the stocks could be disastrous.''
If the economy soured, would customers treat portable phones as a necessary expense or a disposable indulgence? ''How the business will do in a recession is really the major uncertainty,'' Mr. Rattner said.
 
The Drag of Debt
 Will its debt load jeopardize the company's ability to invest in the future? McCaw does have a $3 billion credit line that could be applied to capital investments. Mr. McCaw maintains that a long-term commitment to the industry requires investment and the company plans to improve the New York business, which it won in the Lin deal.
Down the road, McCaw has other opportunities for growth, which it may or may not be able to afford. The company is committed to buying out the remaining Lin shareholders or seeing that the balance of the company is sold to another buyer. It also has a buy-sell agreement with Pacific Telesis for pops in the San Francisco franchise. And if Mr. McCaw is to realize his dream of a national phone service, it will require a big marketing effort. Unlike cable, which has virtually no competition, the Federal Communicatons Commission granted two licenses in each market: one to a telephone company and one a nontelephone company.
 
A National Network?
 Mr. McCaw's goal is for all the independent companies to promote ''Cellular One'' - the brand name used by many nonwire-line cellular companies - service which promotes the image of a single national celluar service. Such a marketing campaign is particularly aimed at corporate clients with nationwide offices. One advantage of Mr. McCaw's city franchises is that he now controls the markets where corporations are headquartered.
It is clear that it will take years for Craig McCaw to turn many of his dreams into reality. But, like his father, Craig McCaw has long been a dreamer. Mr. McCaw's father seems to have given his son enormous self-confidence for the task at hand. ''He trusted us and he was optimistic,'' Craig McCaw recalled. ''He would give us the keys to the car and tell us to drive it around, but not to wreck it. You come up with an optimism from that. If you challenge people and they are accountable, then they are extraordinary.''
But the son is acutely aware of the father's flaws. After the elder Mr. McCaw's death, Craig McCaw's mother spent eight years paying off debts. ''My father was a visionary who did not hire great people,'' Mr. McCaw recalled. ''The company was too dependent on one person.'' So he has hired strong executives and learned to delegate some of the heavy financial dealings. His managers, he said, keep him grounded in reality. ''If you are going to set out on a voyage, remember the Titanic,'' he said. ''The captain took risks he did not have to take, for ego.''
In the next year, the first indications of how sound his decisions were how great the risk will begin to become apparent.
 
A DEAL IN LIMBO
On Wall Street these days, no news is bad news. That explains in part why McCaw's stock has been so depressed.
McCaw may have completed the deal for Lin Broadcasting, but it has not yet announced financing of its $1.9 billion acquisition of Metromedia's stake in the New York cellular franchise.
Lin and Metromedia have jointly owned the franchise for several years. Last October, Lin agreed to buy Metromedia's stake. Now that McCaw owns Lin, it must negotiate that purchase. The initial deal called for an all-cash buyout.
Several weeks ago, without explanation, McCaw announced it was restructuring the deal. The plan was for Metromedia, the company controlled by the billionaire John Kluge, to take equity worth about $850 million in Lin. The banks would put up the balance, thus reducing McCaw's interest burden.
By choosing to sell equity and reducing his interest expenses, Mr. McCaw is seeking to give himself more flexibility if he should need additional financing. McCaw and Metromedia executives have been huddled in negotiations in Manhattan for several weeks.
It's not a done deal, however, and as the weeks drag on, rumors circulate on Wall Street about how the delay in reaching an agreement might affect the economics of the larger McCaw-Lin deal.
 
 
 
REMEDIES FOR TROUBLE IN THE CELL
Though cellular technology has liberated users from the bonds of the phone cord, the quality of service isn't always ideal.
Cellular telephone calls are transmitted from one telephone to another by radio antennas in each local area, or ''cell.'' The greatest problem for users is simply that sometimes it is difficult to get a line. Problems also arise when a cellular phone owner is trying to receive a call while traveling. The caller must know how to find the traveler via telephone, a process that can involve many different numbers unless the cellular companies involved are linked together.
One simple way to improve service and transmission quality is to invest in more cell sites. Craig McCaw's goal is a ''seamless'' telephone network with individual and corporate clients who can call each other, simply by dialing a single number. His plan includes a move into cities: he will add more cell sites in New York, where they are badly needed. The more franchises McCaw owns, the easier it is to offer smooth service. The greatest advantages come from having franchises that are contiguous. That allows the operator to move the call from cell to cell, through various cities. ''For all of the companies, the goal is to make the cellular telephone as invisible to business practices as land lines are,'' said George Blumenthal, chairman of Cellular Communications Inc., an independent cellular company.

HEADLINE: A Case for Selling N.Y.C.'s Airports

BYLINE: By Ronald S. Lauder; Ronald S. Lauder, former Ambassador to Austria, was a New York City mayoral candidate in 1989.

 BODY:
In its current economic mess, New York City can learn a lesson from the corner bodega owner. He will tell you: ''You need cash? The worst thing to do is raise prices and cut services. The best thing to do is trim inventory.'' The city should heed that advice and sell two major city-owned assets: John F. Kennedy and La Guardia airports.
A tax increase is the last thing New York City needs. The already staggering tax burden has driven out hundreds of businesses and thousands of citizens. It would be comparably self-defeating to cut back on services like police and street repairs. 
Both airports are operated by the Port Authority, which leases the land from the city. The Port Authority built and maintains the terminals, employs the staff and makes all the operating decisions, including those about the prices charged to airlines and concessionaires.
A big-city airport is what business people call a cash cow - at least it could be. In arrivals and departures, Kennedy is one of the nation's leading international airports. La Guardia, which is closer to Manhattan, specializes in short-to-medium-haul service, especially to business travelers. Neither airport generates its true potential revenue - which both could if they were operated as businesses.
How can New York City unlock the airports' full potential? Some might suggest that the city cancel its leases, take the airports back from the Port Authority and operate them itself. This approach would have two big drawbacks. City governments are notoriously poor at running businesses. And under Federal grant regulations, cities cannot take any net revenue from their airports.
But suppose, instead, that New York City were to work out a deal with the Port Authority to sell Kennedy and La Guardia to private enterprise, to be operated as profit-making businesses? Such a deal would directly benefit the city coffers in sev-eral ways.
First, there would be the one-time windfall from the sale of the airports; this profit would have to be split with the Port Authority to compensate for its investments over the years.
One recent estimate, by the Reason Foundation, puts the airports' value at $2.2 billion. The true market value may be a lot more than that. Such a windfall would make a large dent in the city's fiscal problems.
As private enterprises, the airport properties would return to the city's property tax rolls and generate $212 million a year in general fund revenue. Under profit-oriented management, it is likely that the airports' value would grow faster than under Port Authority management -meaning that property tax revenues would also keep growing. The privatization of both airports would benefit New York State. If they continued to generate the level of revenue they have in recent years, the state would receive corporate income tax revenues of $4.4 million per year. (The Federal Government would get $11.4 million per year in new corporate income tax revenues.) Besides fiscal benefits, privatizing the airports would offer improved safety and service to New York air travelers.
Because the Federal Aviation Administration owns and operates the control towers and electronic landing aids, the airports' management cannot make needed improvements.
Under privatization, if the F.A.A. yielded ownership of the control tower, La Guardia could install equipment giving it increased bad-weather landing capability. (Building a new tower at La Guardia is not an F.A.A. priority.) The airport is also short of controllers because the F.A.A. cannot pay enough to attract and keep them in this high-cost part of the U.S.
In England and Scotland, where the major airports were privatized three years ago, the airports own the control towers and invest in the equipment. The same could be true in New York if the airports were turned into investor-owned businesses.
The Port Authority's $3.2 billion modernization of Kennedy is being scaled back by as much as $1 billion, and Kennedy's proposed people-mover system may be eliminated. The result surely will be continued ground congestion and chaos.
By contrast, Heathrow Airport in London, newly privately owned, is building a high-speed rail line, to be operated by the airport company, that will whiz passengers from Heathrow to central London in just 16 minutes. This is the kind of user-friendly investment we should expect from an airport operated as a business.
The British were the first to sell their airports (for $2.5 billion in July 1987). But they aren't the only ones. Denmark has announced that the Copenhagen airport is to be privatized, with the first 25 percent of the shares to be sold this year. New Zealand plans to sell its three international airports, at Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington. And in the U.S., mu- nicipalities from Albany to Peoria to Los Angeles are considering doing likewise.
The F.A.A. and the Department of Transportation are reviewing the issue, and a policy statement is expected this spring.
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner's emerging national policy seemed to endorse airport privatization in principle when it declared that the Government would remove barriers to the private ownership and operation of transportation facilities.
Selling both airports offers New York City a way to recover its capital and use it in other, more urgent investments. The city has been undervaluing assets far too long. It's time we started getting full value from them.

HEADLINE: 'Summit' on Balderdash Mountain

BYLINE: By Ernest F. Hollings; Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, is a member of the Senate Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Today is shaping up to be a witches' sabbath here. The top Congressional leaders will huddle with President Bush and numbers wizard Richard Darman to attempt to spike the budget brew. If past experience is any guide, the objective of this non-summit ''summit'' conference will be to concoct the right mix of lizard's tail and newt's eye to put the American people to sleep until after the election. We must not allow that to happen.
For starters, let's be clear that these bipartisan meetings are not the cure, they're the cancer. 
Republicans and Democrats share an election-year interest in producing a slide-by budget with no new taxes and no painful spending cuts. We have had these bipartisan budget love-ins for three years running now, and each year we end up further from the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction targets.
Last November, an 11th-hour ''summit'' meeting produced a budget that claimed to meet the 1990 deficit target of $100 billion. We gave ourselves the good-government award and went home. But by March, the 1990 deficit was projected at $160 billion. Now, in May, it is running at a $170 billion pace.
The deficit for 1991 is projected at $160 billion. So to reach the 1991 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit target of $64 billion, we are supposed to come up with a deficit-reduction package of $96 billion - all without new taxes. Not even Mr. Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, has enough fairy dust to finesse this $96 billion shortfall, and he's smart enough not to try.
My advice is: Let's keep our eye on the doughnut, not the hole. The ''hole'' - the distraction - is all the Washington chatter about peace dividends, capital gains tax cuts, etc. In the context of a $1.2 trillion budget, these things are airy nothings. The ''doughnut'' - what really matters - is the size of the undisguised budget deficit.
The true deficit for 1990 will be close to $300 billion. This figure is the sum of three components: the $158 billion deficit that the media write and talk about; the $122 billion we are ''borrowing'' (Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan aptly calls it ''thievery'') from the Social Security Trust Fund and other trust funds, plus the $20 billion-plus being spent ''off-budget'' on the savings-and-loan bailout.
This real deficit of $300 billion matters because it is driving up interest rates, paralyzing government and running up the national debt to the point where we now pay $260 billion in interest annually.
Here's a tip for judging today's meeting. You can tell if these fellows are serious if they frankly and honestly acknowledge, first, the true size of the deficit and, second, that the 1991 deficit target of $64 billion cannot realistically be met.
Grown-ups shouldn't tell lies. If we can finally 'fess up to the true size of the deficit, then we can also 'fess up to another dirty little secret: that we are already levying new taxes galore in order to bring down the deficit and that we need to raise taxes even more to finish the job.
President Bush ignored his own lips long enough to propose new revenues totaling $13.9 billion in his projected 1991 budget. They include telephone excise taxes, airline-ticket taxes and increases in stock-transaction taxes.
He ignored his own lips when he let a whopping increase in Social Security payroll taxes take effect Jan. 1. Meanwhile, he has presided over a 1 percent increase in interest rates so far this year - the price exacted by the marketplace for Washington's failure to deal honestly with the deficits and the savings-and-loan bailout.
Can you imagine a more indiscriminate, irresponsible, regressive tax than these rising interest rates? ''Read my lips,'' indeed. Here is one budget sherpa's advice to the ''summiteers'': Admit the true size of the deficit mountain - $300 billion in 1991 - and acknowledge that we can't cut enough in one year to reach the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target. Next, embrace the Senate Budget Committee's goal of reducing the deficit by $43 billion in 1991. Finally, come up with a realistic schedule of honest tax increases and honest budget cuts to liquidate the deficits by 1994. Let's start earning those good-government awards we keep giving ourselves.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
The Pleasures of Poland

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
Later on we'll get to the problems of Poland but for at least a few paragraphs, let's just talk about the pleasures of Poland.
Right off, the first time we set eyes on each other after six years, an old Polish friend announced the great news.
''We are a free country now!'' he exclaimed in the hotel lobby, as if he were the first to carry the word.
He knew that nobody who had lived in captive Poland in the hard, mean years of Soviet-imposed Communism, as I had, could grasp fully the joy of the news until he came to see and taste it. 
Now Poles can write, talk, print, vote, travel, invest, complain, my good friend said. He laughed at the happy shake of my head that this was happening in Poland. ''Anything!''
So, finally, this is the first real Polish springtime. Springtime, after German devastation and decades of struggle against Soviet colonialism, gray decades of uprising and defeat, hope and failure, again and again.
In this country it was not the collapse of Soviet Communism that brought freedom. It was the unrelenting Polish struggle that helped drain the ability of the Communists to rule, here, in Moscow or anywhere. Freedom was not given to the Poles; they took it. In so doing they helped all Communist-ruled nations, including the Soviet Union.
Warsaw will probably never be beautiful again. German troops went from block to block, blowing them up house by house.
But Warsaw looks just wonderful these days - trees in full leaf, students and painters taking over the squares and alleys of the lovingly rebuilt Old City. It is alive with what the Communists hated so much - the bustle and bounce of business and art.
I asked Adam Michnik, editor of Solidarity's daily newspaper and one of those chewy political intellectuals who always have been a particular Polish treasure, whether it was overly romantic to be so hopeful about Poland now.
No, not overly romantic, he said, as long as Poles understood they now had nobody to blame but themselves for any mess they make. So, on to problems. The first was created by courage.
The Government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki acted swiftly and bravely to pull Poland from the economic morass of Communism. That meant slashing many subsidies, letting prices rise while keeping wages down for the time being, creating unemployment by writing off some failing Government enterprises.
So far the Polish people have taken the bitter medicine to cure the economic diseases left by Communism.
But if Poles do not get some economic rewards along with freedom, there could be a second problem - a split between the Solidarity intellectuals now in office and Lech Walesa. He is in a grumpy mood, which he intends to cure by becoming President of Poland.
The unanswered question is whether he will go for the official leadership, which he merits, in alliance with the intellectuals or continue to take cracks at them about the economic situation.
Solidarity supporters in the Government are worried about the possibility that the Walesa inner circle of politicians, union officials and clerics might move him toward the unpleasant Polish right. They think that could lead to a Polish Peronist populism.
But they still count on Mr. Walesa to remember that the partnership between workers and intellectuals created the Solidarity victory and keeps the alliance strong.
Poland is in its own hands now, at last. But the U.S. can do a lot to help the country; help will be welcomed.
Much can be done - more insured investments by American business, forgiveness of crippling loans made to the Communists, moving the creaky communications system into the modern business world, bringing young Poles to the U.S. for training.
The United States can push its European allies to give Poland association with the European Community. This is important to Poland economically and politically. East Germans will get it automatically with German unification, but Poland has been denied.
Bronislaw Geremek, the Solidarity leader in Parliament, said that what Poland needed most from the U.S. was to stay involved with this country, not forgetting.
Poland has suffered as no other nation from the Germans and the Soviet Union. Therefore it would honor the United States to treat it with special attention and care.
Perhaps this time the United States will not walk away from a friend. That is the one thing about their future Poles cannot decide for themselves.

HEADLINE: The Stark Reality That Racial Theorists Miss

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was saddened by your April 20 report on the ill-considered and racist remarks by Michael Levin and Leonard Jeffries Jr., tenured professors at New York City's highly respected City College.
Professor Levin makes the indefensible case that blacks are underrepresented in professional positions in society, not because of society's ''discrimination'' but because of inherent mental inferiority. Professor Jeffries makes the equally indefensible accusation that society has intentionally miseducated blacks to deprive them of any hope of success. 
They both missed the one stark reality that stands out beyond the welter of repugnant claims and charges: we are systematically undereducating blacks and crippling their chances for success in school, at work, as parents and as citizens. Despite the 25-year success of the Head Start enriched preschool program, our society pays for such an indispensable aid to learning for only one out of six impoverished American kids at severe educational risk.
This means that our society denies 84 percent of kids 3, 4 and 5 years old from educationally deprived homes of the basic education skills, nurturing, nutrition and health care that are almost certainly indispensable preconditions to educational success in their elementary and secondary schools, without which these kids are almost doomed to educational failure.
In the face of such systematic un-dereducation of low-income kids, a disproportionately high share of whom are black and Hispanic, how can Professor Levin or anyone else say these kids don't suffer discrimination, prejudice and structured disadvantage at the hands of an insensitive society?
It is a disgrace that the middle-class kids who have least needed the enriched preschool experience have benefited from it the most, while the kids from low-income, educationally and culturally deprived families who have needed it most have benefited from it least, at untold cost to the health, vitality and competitiveness of our society.
Blacks have not been deliberately ''miseducated'' as Professor Jeffries charges, but systematically undereducated. Head Start is only one example. The Reagan Administration decision to replace college minority scholarships and grants with loans is another action that has demonstrably hindered the efforts of the black community to break out of the cycle of poverty and undereducation into educational success and achievement on the job at home, and in the community.
As chairman of the Education and Health Subcommittee of the House Joint Economic Committee, I recently chaired nine days of hearings on how our society can achieve a competitive and competent work force. An impressive series of corporate chief executive officers from the Fortune 500 group testified passionately about the consensus of business leadership in our country that improving the quality of education for all young people and especially provision of a Head Start experience for deprived minority youth is imperative for our society - a moral challenge to our commitment to education equality and a productive, healthy society.
This year, I, Representative Dale Kildee and several colleagues are attempting to break this vicious cycle by sponsoring a bill to provide a Head Start experience to every American child at risk of education failure. This full-funding bill, passed in committee and now part of H.R. 4151, is our best hope to avoid perpetuating our two-tier education and class system, which provides fertile ground for the racist ideas planted by Professors Levin and Jeffries.

HEADLINE: The Maggots in Communism's Decay

 BODY:
A specter of unbridled bigotry haunts the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Ethnic Turks face persecution in Bulgaria. So do gypsies in Hungary; so does Transylvania's Hungarian community in Romania.
Meanwhile, ancient anti-Semitic hatreds flare anew. In January, goons calling themselves Russian nationalists burst into Moscow's Central House of Writers, shouting ''Kill the Yids!'' In Poland, whose prewar Jewish population of 3.3 million has dwindled to 4,400, walls have been defaced with vile graffiti: ''Jews to the ovens, Jews for soap.'' In Budapest, some politicians speak menacingly of ''cosmopolitans,'' meaning Jews. 
A society's moral worth is rightly gauged by how it treats its most defenseless citizens. The fundamental integrity of a democracy depends on its willingness to safeguard the rights of its minorities. Thus, even as the United States applauds the rise of more open systems in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, there is reason to worry about their leaders' tepid response to a malignant legacy.
The maggots of hate cannot be eliminated by simple prohibition. Sunlight is a better weapon than suppression. Those who have pleaded for pluralism in the East cannot easily argue for abridgment of hateful speech. But what leaders say and do matters enormously; bigotry is tacitly legitimized by silence or hints of complicity. Under orthodox Communist rule, bigotry was officially condemned but unofficially tolerated - and sometimes shamelessly encouraged when useful.
It was something of a moral revolution when East Germany's newly elected Government accepted responsibility for Hitler's crimes against the Jews. Having taken the imperative first step, East Germans need now to re-examine schoolbooks and the way the past is depicted in their media. Such sunlight has worked well in West Germany and provides a beacon in other transforming societies, notably the Soviet Union.
Mikhail Gorbachev has condemned ''the spread of anti-Semitism and all the other -isms.'' But the Soviet press, still highly responsive to official guidance, has barely begun to deal openly, factually and forcefully with a surge in bigotry. It is time for Soviet leaders to drive a stake into hoary slanders like the one again making the rounds, that Jews engage in ritual murders or were responsible for the murder of the Czar and his family.
In reacting to all this, Westerners need to be wary of two mistakes. The first is to exaggerate the threat of hate groups that are loud but small; Russian nationalists captured only 10 out of 468 seats in Moscow's City Council. The other mistake is to minimize the significance of resurgent bigotry in societies struggling with failed economies and new political ideas. Unless checked by leaders, maggots can multiply.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Survivability Of Weapons Begins At Home

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
JUST in case Congress had any doubt that cutting billions of dollars from the Pentagon budget might be easier in theory than reality, some imaginative defense contractors left a little reminder at the foot of the Capitol a few weeks ago: a gleaming white aircraft, not quite plane and not quite helicopter, known as the V-22 Osprey.
The stunt was the latest effort to save the Marine Corps's $26 billion V-22 transport, a program that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to kill last year only to have Congress restore research funds. This year it is one of scores of projects that hang in the balance as lawmakers struggle over how to translate the reductions they want in overall military spending into real cuts that mean lost jobs and economic dislocation back home.
''I'm from the Northeast,'' said Representative Barbara Kennelly, a Democrat from Connecticut, where one in every 15 jobs is defense-related. ''We've got a soft economy up here. I have to be careful about recession.'' Mrs. Kennelly's district is home to Pratt & Whitney, which makes engines for F-15 fighters and has a potential stake in the C-17 transport and Advanced Tactical Fighter, two more programs that may not survive. 
''I sent my constituents a survey, and 78 percent of them said cut defense,'' she said. ''I don't think they've made the translation yet.''
There was a time when the Pentagon, the defense industry and their allies in Congress could hope to make a weapons system politically damage-proof by spreading the contracts around the country. The more states or Congressional districts with a piece of the project, the more its supporters could count on the collective weight of parochial interests to overcome any opposition.
But given the amounts Congress is looking to cut from the Pentagon budget, even the most politically artful procurement arrangement is no longer a guarantee of survival for costly weapons programs. The B-2 Stealth bomber is a case in point.
With an original price tag of $75 billion, or even $61 billion, based on Mr. Cheney's latest proposal to buy fewer planes, the B-2 has become a program that many in Congress love to hate. Opposition continues to mount, even though on paper the B-2 looks like a program nearly everybody would love to have.
''The B-2 is an obvious target because of its monstrous cost,'' said an industry official, who asked not to be named. ''You have a $500 million airplane that is going to turn into an $800 million airplane in the course of saving it. You can't damage-proof a system now. The defense pie is smaller, the slices are smaller, and there is more competition. Something's got to give.''
The B-2's three lead contractors, the Northrop Corporation, the Boeing Corporation and the LTV Corporation, have 4,000 subcontractors scattered in 46 states.
One of these is the Itel Rail Corporation, recent purchasers of a tiny company in Newcastle, Pa., that is to build 18 rail cars needed to haul portions of the B-2 frame. ''Cheney's cutback shouldn't hurt us, because as far as we know they will still need all the cars,'' said Ron Giallonardo, vice president of sales and marketing for Itel. Mr. Giallonardo said that thanks to guarantees in its $7.5 million contract with Northrop, Itel expects to ''come out whole'' even if the entire program is canceled. He said Northrop had not notified the company of any need to alter production schedules but had asked him to urge his congressman and senators to support the B-2. Representative Joe Kolter, a Pennsylvania Democrat whose district includes the Newcastle plant, is one of the nearly 200 co-sponsors of a House bill to kill the B-2.
For Fenwal Safety Sytems Inc., a small company in Marlborough, Mass., that makes the electronic temperature-sensing devices used in the B-2, the cutbacks Mr. Cheney announced two weeks ago would mean a loss of several million dollars in future business and probably some layoffs after this year, said Lewis F. Clark Jr., president of the company. Fenwal split the $10 million development costs for the B-2 safety system with Northrop, and while safety systems have strong applications for commercial aviation, some of the equipment the company purchased for B-2 production could not be adapted, Mr. Clark said. ''If the whole program is canceled,'' he said, ''we would lose a great deal of money.'' Other big weapons contracts work much like the B-2. The M-1 tank, also on Mr. Cheney's chopping block, is manufactured in Michigan and Ohio, but in the effort to salvage some production, its manufacturer, General Dynamics, has reminded Congress that more than 7,000 vendors in 48 states and Puerto Rico would be hit.
The Pentagon's own efforts to damage-proof programs are also less effective than they once were. Trying to build Congressional support for a 600-ship Navy back in the early 1980's, Navy Secretary John Lehman came up with a plan for ''strategic home ports'' at 13 sites around the country.
But the number has been scaled back to six, and last week, Mr. Cheney announced that four were under review for possible cancellation, including the Staten Island port. Eleven of New York City's 14 Congressional representatives and Mayor David N. Dinkins have said they are happy to see the Staten Island project go.
Representative David Skaggs, a Democrat from Colorado, said he found the Navy's procurement politics so offensive that last year he attached a provision to the defense spending bill that prohibits use of any contracting funds to make state-by-state or district-by-district analyses of the economic effects of new procurement.
''You have to look at devices that bring out the best in Congress, not the worst,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Come What May, Congress Stays True to the Critters

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IF money is the sole indication, then no animal is more adored by Congress than a cow. Congress authorized $16.2 billion in subsidies over the last 10 years to bring the supply of milk into line with demand. Nor are the rangier, more ornery beef cattle ignored. Congress has taken special care since the mid-1930's to provide them grass and water, at enormous expense to the Treasury. 
Both policies have raised a ruckus among conservative economists and environmentalists, but the reason for such largess is clear to the nation's ranchers and dairy farmers. The value of the 33 million cows, calves and steers slaughtered last year exceeded $30 billion, according to the Agriculture Department. Milk sales reached $20 billion, and cheese, butter and other dairy products would add tens of billions.
Industry executives say that no consumers in the world pay as little for meat and milk as Americans, and the principal reason, they say, is Government subsidies.
''Price supports stabilize the market,'' said James C. Barr, chief executive officer of the National Milk Producers Federation in Arlington, Va. ''If you do away with the whole deal, you have a period of time where there will be short resources and higher prices. That will attract more resources, cause surpluses and lower prices. Cyclical turnover does neither the farmer nor the consumer any good.''
It took billions of dollars and considerable pain to wring instability out of the industry in the 1980's. In 1983, spending on dairy price-support programs, under which the Government sets a minimum price and guarantees it by agreeing to buy up and store surplus dairy products, reached $2.6 billion. In 1986, 14,000 farmers were paid $1.8 billion to slaughter their herds and leave the business for five years to reduce chronic overproduction. Some 1.6 million cows, calves and heifers were sent down the road. Most of the farmers took the opportunity to retire, according to the Agriculture Department.
Cattle ranchers have not been offered the same opportunities, but Congress has been generous. More than 220 million acres of Federal range and forest land in 14 Western states is open for grazing. The fee: $1.81 a month per cow. Calves eat free. The take for the Interior and Agriculture Departments last year was just $29 million.
Four years ago, the Reagan Administration, calculating that the market value for grazing on public lands was $6.40 to $9.50 a month, tried to raise the fee to pay for restoring vast tracts degraded by grazing. A coalition of Republican and Democratic lawmakers easily defeated the proprosal.
''We've been on the range for years and the land is in better shape than it has been in 100 years,'' said Betty Munis, a range expert with the Public Lands Council, a group in Washington that represents cattle and sheep ranchers. ''Cattlemen are responsible stewards.''
Environmental groups say the fees charged the ranchers do not even pay for the manpower needed to manage the grazing programs in the Interior and Agriculture Departments. ''They are not paying their fair share,'' said Johanna Wald, a senior attorney in San Francisco for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national environmental group. ''While some cattlemen are good stewards of the land, many of them are not. The fact is vast acreage of public lands is in unsatsifactory condition and will remain in that condition until higher fees are charged.''

HEADLINE: NAVIGATING THE FUTURE;
A New Europe Comes Into Focus For George Bush

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LIKE a man running to catch a train that is accelerating out of the station, President Bush keeps falling behind the breathtaking pace of events in Europe. To catch up, he has had to keep altering his ideas on the future of that continent, and the role the United States can play there in the decades to come.
Yet little by little, in reacting to changes sweeping the continent in hopes of shaping them, the President is developing a plan for Europe - dare one call it a vision? - that would have been unthinkable for an American president of any partisan or ideological persuasion only a year or two ago. Last week, he called upon the leaders of the other 15 North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations to meet him in London this summer to rethink strategy.
If Mr. Bush has his way, the new Europe will have two salient features: a unified Germany with full membership in a transformed NATO that is as much political as military - something that will require revolutionary thinking about the alliance - and a continuing American presence, rooted in a significant residue of American military forces and nuclear weapons. 
After dragging his heels for months, the President agreed last week that there might soon be no land-based nuclear weapons left, but he clings to the idea that there must be airborne nuclear missiles in the new Europe, with some of them based in Germany.
''There are few lessons so clear in history as this,'' Mr. Bush said on Friday at Oklahoma State University. ''Only the combination of conventional forces and nuclear forces have insured this long peace in Europe.''
''Everything depends on keeping NATO,'' said the Ambassador of a major Western European country. ''You can change it, make it more political, do what you like. But it has to have Germany in it, and it has to have the United States in it. We can't afford to let either one slip into isolation.''
To achieve what they want, the Administration and its allies have already made some concessions and will probably have to make more - to Congress, to the Soviet Union and to Germany. By abandoning a new short-range nuclear missile to replace the aging, land-based Lance, Mr. Bush removed a major source of dissent in NATO, and he is said to be ready to negotiate the elimination of the Lance itself as well as nuclear artillery shells from Germany. Bonn has agreed that no NATO forces will be deployed on what is now East German territory.
But even such major decisions as those have not been sufficient to resolve the central question, the security arrangements for a united Germany, which provided the focus for the first session of the ''two plus four'' negotiations in Bonn on Saturday, involving Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union and the two Germanys.
The most obvious problem is the Soviet Union, which originally wanted a neutral Germany and now insists upon a Germany that belongs both to NATO and to the rapidly disintegrating Warsaw Pact, pending the creation of a pan-European security system to replace the two alliances.
There are a few signs of yet another softening in the Soviet position, including an article by a Soviet general in an East German newspaper arguing the case for Germany within NATO. But President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is being asked to institutionalize a vast erosion of Soviet power in central Europe, and the NATO allies are working on ways to make it easier for him.
The West Germans, for example, are suggesting a number of economic sweeteners, like helping to pay for Soviet troops remaining in East Germany. They and the French also favor a much-enlarged role for the 35-member Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to which the Soviet Union belongs, and a slightly reduced role for NATO. Washington and London are less enthusiastic about C.S.C.E., seeing in it a way for France, which is not a full participant in NATO, and for Germany, which could eventually choose not to be, to coax the old alliance toward oblivion.
For similar reasons, the Americans and the British are determined to introduce into Germany new, small tactical nuclear weapons carried by aircraft - so that, in the words of a ranking United States official, ''the front-line country in NATO, which is Germany, continues to be involved in nuclear deterrence after the land-based missiles have all been pulled out.'' It would also please Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to see some of the missiles at a French air base.
Even if all or most of this works - and there have been ample indications lately, for those seeking them, that Mr. Gorbachev's flexibility may be coming to an end - it appears certain that the United States will have to find a whole new basis for its role in Europe as the continent moves toward closer economic and political integration.
Although Mr. Bush has set a floor of 225,000 for American troops there, reductions in short-range weapons, as well as Congressional pressures, will inevitably drive that figure lower soon.
With the Eastern European countries transformed almost overnight from adversaries into friends, and the Soviet Union no longer nearly as menacing, in terms of either armaments or intent, as it was for four decades, much of the rationale for the strategy of the United States and NATO is withering. But there is not, as yet, any very clear delineation of what a new NATO, focused increasingly on political and even economic questions, might look like.
 
For many reasons, the
United States is fearful of losing influence in Europe, and President Bush has been saying almost since he took office that the United States intended to remain a European power.
 
He does not want to see
American products and services blocked out of European markets by a strengthened European Community, he does not want to leave a heavily armed and still autocratic Soviet Union without a sufficient counterweight in Europe, at least in the short term, and he does not want to abandon the American role in guaranteeing that a reunited Germany will remain trustworthy.
The last item is not mentioned much publicly, either in Washington or in other European capitals, because of a reluctance to offend the Germans. But it counts for a lot; a French official said not long ago that it would be ''a catastrophe not to have the United States here to balance the Germans.''
In a sense, then, NATO is being asked to do three things at once: provide a continuing deterrent or response to any attack from a weakened Soviet Union, whether under Mr. Gorbachev or someone else; prevent Germany from rebounding for the third time this century from defeat into renewed militarism; and begin transforming itself into a different sort of entity that could provide the political and economic linkage between the new Europe and the United States.
It is a large order, and the United States may have to fight to keep NATO stronger than the European Community or some new version of C.S.C.E. that might be thought to offer a safeguard against a resurgent Soviet Union by bringing it and the newly democratic Eastern European states into Europe instead of holding them at a distance for a while more.
Many European experts, and more than a few American skeptics, suspect that NATO will not be able to adapt successfully. Even if it does, they argue, it will be rendered irrelevant or redundant within a few years as the military threat recedes further and other organizations deal with non-security questions.
''We have a difficult wire to walk,'' an American strategist said. ''The easy, dramatic part is over. Now the really hard, dangerous stuff starts.''

Cost of Cab Ride Up 30 Percent In Chicago
Chicago, which used to be one of the least expensive cities in the country for taxi riders, has joined the mainstream. The reason: after nearly a decade of no change in fares, the City Council recently approved a series of increases averaging 30 percent. The increases, which took effect in March, will affect travelers' costs in deciding which Chicago airport to use.
Travelers will pay more no matter how long or short their trip in a cab. Under the new fare structure, they are paying a base rate - the so-called flag pull or drop - of $1.20, up from $1. And they are paying $1.20 to travel a mile, up from 90 cents. 
A three-mile trip from the residential Near North Side to the Loop costs $4.60, up from $3.60. A five-mile trip - say, from the Near North Side to the McCormick Place convention center - now costs $7, up from $5.40.
Because it has always been much more expensive to ride to O'Hare Airport from downtown than to Midway Airport, the 30 percent fare translates into a greater increase in the cost of a trip to O'Hare. Whereas there used to be a $6 difference between the cost of traveling to the two airports ($18 vs. $12), there can now be an $8 difference, depending on traffic ($24 vs. $16). Moreover, now that the cost of a cab to O'Hare, including tip, exceeds $25, many business travelers will for the first time be required to keep receipts in order to be reimbursed by their employers. Many companies do not require employees to produce receipts for expenses under $25.
The one comforting piece of news is that Chicago taxis are still relatively inexpensive. Of 13 cities surveyed by Chicago officials, Chicago ranked eighth in terms of cab costs after the new fares went into effect. Leading the list was Los Angeles, where a three-mile trip costs $6.30. The cost of such a ride in Chicago is now $4.60. The cheapest cabs found in the survey were in Denver, where a three-mile ride is $4.05.
 
Watching Yen While in Japan
One way to cut costs in Japan, according to Japanese tourist officials, is to look for restaurants in department stores, office buildings or near public transportation where inexpensive prices are posted. The best buys are often at noontime when the daily special (teishoku) costs about 700 yen, or $4.50 (based on 158 yen to $1) and includes rice, miso soup, salad, meat or fish entree and dessert.
Eating out is among topics in a free color brochure, Economical Travel in Japan, available from the Japan National Tourist Organization (630 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10111). It says that kaiten sushi restaurants serve sushi at low cost by saving on labor costs. The sushi chef places slices of raw fish and rice on a conveyor belt for customers to pick up. Don't tip in Japan, the booklet adds: it's not the custom. Other advice for saving money: buy a rail pass for unlimited rail travel; study tour-operator packages for group and independent bargains and consider staying in inns (ryokan), family-run guesthouses (minshuku) or pensions.
The average cost of a night at a ryokan, without meals, is $25 a person; at a minshuku, the rate, with two meals, is generally about $32.
The 14-page brochure includes maps, tips for taking a bath and sketches, including one showing Japanese bedding, which is laid directly on a soft matted floor.
The booklet also recommends taking the limousine bus from Narita Airport to downtown Tokyo for about $17. A taxi would cost around $125.
 
Rome Protects Marcus Aurelius
After nine years of exile in Rome's Central Institute of Restoration, the statue of Marcus Aurelius, symbol of the Eternal City's ancient civilization, has made a triumphant comeback to public domain on Capitoline Hill.
The 1,800-year-old gilded equestrian masterpiece has not returned, however, to its original pedestal at the center of the Piazza del Campidoglio, which Michelangelo designed in the 16th century. It now stands in the adjacent Capitoline Museum, sheltered from smog and acid rain.
While experts continue to debate whether to replace the twice lifesize bronze statue of the emperor-philosopher with a copy, the original pedestal stands empty at the center of the square, a symbol itself, not of past glory but of the threat of traffic pollution.
The Capitoline Museum in the Palazzo Nuovo on the Piazza del Campidoglio is open every day but Monday from 9 A.M. to 1:30 P.M. and, on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday from 5 to 8 P.M. It is also open on Saturday from 5 to 11 P.M. from April to September. The entry fee of about $3.60 covers a visit to the museum's collection of ancient Roman sculptures.
 
Hawaii Plans 3 Boat Races
 
HONOLULU
Three interisland races mark the kayak, outrigger canoe and sailing canoe racing season in Hawaii this year. Men and women paddlers, including international Olympic champions, compete across the Kaiwi Channel, one of the world's most treacherous.
The 32-mile Kayak Challenge takes place May 20. This 14th annual single-person kayak-surf ski race starts from the beach at Papohaku Roadstead in front of the Kaluakoi Resort on Molokai Island at 10 A.M. and finishes shortly after noon at the Koko Marina ocean promenade in Hawaii Kai on Oahu. Free parking is available at the adjacent shopping center.
The 75-mile Maui-to-Oahu Ho'omana'o Challenge on May 27 is a six-man outrigger sailing canoe race. It begins at Whaler's Village, Kaanapali, on Maui at 6:30 A.M. and finishes in front of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel area of Waikiki Beach, Oahu, between 1 and 3 P.M. It is a test of strength; no midwater crew changes are allowed. Ho'omana'o means ''cause to remember.'' The race, first held last year, revives the tradition of ancient Hawaiian outrigger sailing canoes.
The 40.8-mile Molokai Hoe, the classic of interisland open ocean paddling, will be Oct. 7. The 40th annual six-man outrigger canoe event, from Molokai to Oahu, begins at 6 A.M. with the rigging of the outriggers at Hale O Lono, a barge harbor reached by dirt road seven miles east of Molokai's west end. In-the-water start is at 7:30 A.M. There will be entertainment at the finish line at approximately 12:30 P.M., at Fort DeRussy Beach, Waikiki.
The Na Wahine O Ke Kai, the women's version of the Molokai Hoe, takes place on Sept. 30, starting from Hale O Lono on Molokai at 7:30 A.M. and finishing at Duke Kahanamoku Beach in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel in Waikiki at about 1 P.M. MOANA TREGASKIS
 
Delays on I-75
Travelers arriving at Greater Cincinnati International Airport in Boone County, Ky., can expect some delays getting into town this summer due to road construction. Work along the Cincinnati stretch of Interstate 75 is scheduled to continue through October.
An alternative route to the airport, either I-471 or I-275, is advisable. For updated traffic conditions call: 513-852-5000.

HEADLINE: Crumbling Cuba Still Loves to Rumba

BYLINE: By MATTHEW ROBBINS; MATTHEW ROBBINS is a writer and director who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
RECENTLY I found myself fondling a dollar bill of such limp antiquity that it called the entire concept of cash into question. This tattered, pale greenback had been in circulation since the late 60's, but were it not for its privileged isolation on the island of Cuba, it would long ago have been incinerated. Its edges were thin, its corners rounded, and George Washington had faded to near anonymity. Yet here it was, in a Havana diplotienda - a shop open only to foreigners - being passed from hand to hand and enjoying the esteem of its bearers.
Also enjoying esteem throughout the island was another American symbol, the tailfin. Cars made in Detroit, like dollars minted up north, were ubiquitous but similarly ancient. For someone like me, who grew up knowing every car make and model from 1949 to 1959, a simple drive to town was a visit to an automotive past, where half-forgotten De Sotos and Kaisers trundled by on tall, balding tires. They felt like old friends, these cars, so touching in their two-tone postwar assertiveness. I was shocked to learn that some of them have undergone transplants and are powered by Russian engines. 
It was strange to be one of the few Americans in Havana, where decaying cars, dollars and hotels stood so eloquently for the vanished American presence. (An embargo by the Treasury Department generally rules out visits by American tourists.) I met only three other gringos during my two-week stay in Cuba last October, as a teacher in a screenwriting workshop organized by Robert Redford's Sundance Institute and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's International School of Film and TV. But I found the culture, 30 years after the revolution, still touched by the United States (although there is a peculiar Russian veneer as well.) As a visiting assessor, I was housed in a two-bedroom flat with kitchen and bath, part of the student dormitory of the film school an hour southwest of Havana. The town was called San Antonio de los Banos. Here, nationwide food shortages, combined with old-fashioned institutional cooking, made the cafeteria meals a dreadful prospect. I wound up shopping for food at the diplotienda, the most visible sign of the dual economy.
There were several of these shops for foreigners around Havana; this one resembled a miniature, slightly threadbare May Company. The thoroughly unremarkable merchandise was made special by its unavailability elsewhere on the island. And who were these whey-faced customers fingering Lapidus shirts and Edwin jeans? Why, they were Russians, and their wallets are bulging with greenbacks! I asked an elegant Cuban saleswoman if she spoke any English. ''No, senor,'' she answered, ''Hungar.''
Sure enough, there were Hungarians, Romanians and Czechoslovaks snapping up watches, radios, gold chains and other vital necessities. I located the food section and laid in a good supply of Italian pasta, Romanian tomato sauce and cheese of unknown origin. Visa cards? Only if yours was issued by a non-American bank, so it was cash for everything. I donated some fresh dollar bills to the island economy. Within a matter of days, I acquired three new addictions: rum (Cuban and Nicaraguan), cigars (Havana puros, of course) and thick, sweet Cuban coffee. It is not uncommon for mainlanders to drop their inhibitions when visiting Caribbean islands, but I was startled by the eagerness with which I took to these vices. With a nervous system assaulted by alcohol, nicotine and caffeine, I set out to see something of Cuban life.
I drove a Lada, a sort of extra-tinny Fiat, made in the Soviet Union. Here, surrounded by real Detroit iron, the poor thing reeked of Soviet ersatz modernity. No matter which Lada I used (the film school has a dozen), the windows didn't work and the wipers were always intermittent. I lusted for a ride in one of the big Buicks that swept by.
THE roads themselves were in rather good shape, better in many cases than the pavement in West Marin County, where I've done a lot of driving. During heavy rain, sections of the highways resembled lap pools, but I kept my eyes on the spectacular clouds overhead, especially at sunset, when silhouetted palm trees create postcard vistas.
My newfound interest in rum and cigars could be traced to the parties that kept springing up. Even the most intellectually forbidding faculty would jump up and start executing crazy salsa steps, as if it were midnight on New Year's Eve. I too got dragged onto the dance floor, even though, officially, I don't dance. No one cared - they were too busy living it up until dawn.
Everybody, it seemed, loved to dance. One day a Colombian film maker took us to a neighborhood courtyard where hundreds of onlookers gathered every week to watch a demonstration of the rumba, a dance of the past. The dancers, dressed in white, were all past 70 years of age, and comported themselves with a gracious dignity, keepers of the flame. This was a Cuban affair, with hardly a tourist in sight. It was also an occasion for folk dancing, heavily influenced by the African music and religions that were brought to the Caribbean by slaves. The racially mixed audience was intent, thoroughly involved with every moment, and generous with laughter and applause. They were proud of their dancers, and this self-regard, I discovered, applied to the other arts as well.
At a brightly lighted serigraph workshop near old Havana, dozens of art students cranked out beautiful prints by Mendive, one of the city's best-known artists. These kids had been at it all day, and, with evening aproaching, they were munching sandwiches and downing beers, clearly intending to work all night in preparation for an exhibition and festival that would begin the next day. Although I had walked in with no warning, I was received as a special guest, handed a glass of rum and given a grand tour. The art work emerging under the serigraph frames was a lively mix of surrealism and symbolism. On the walls, other artists were on view, in styles ranging from hard edge to abstract expressionism. I spotted a Rauschenberg; he had been here a year ago. In a country struggling with government censorship (with a nervous Communist Party disallowing certain Soviet publications) the visual arts, on display in all public spaces, were bold and often abstract. No socialist realism in sight.
In New York, where anyone can buy a can of paint, the once-ubiqiutous subway graffiti became a visual symbol for the city as a whole. In Havana, where there is no paint to buy, the buildings are literally flaking and peeling away. If you rarely think about something as mundane as paint, its complete absence comes as a shock, just like the graffiti. I heard somebody say that the only paint available is made in East Germany and it's no good. So the once stately Beaux-Arts homes, now surrounded by wild, uncut grass, are slowly falling into ruin.
IF the Cubans are unable to pay the upkeep on much of the splendor that was pre-revolutonary Havana, there are, nevertheless, a few symbols, like the cars, that are not allowed to die. The Tropicana cabaret, another monument to the 50's, rolls on with unchecked flamboyance. At this socialist nightclub under the stars, where hundreds of carefully matched cafe-au-lait showgirls and boys put on a Vegas revue for goggle-eyed visitors, many of them from Eastern Europe. The Tropicana was created in 1939, and the show I saw celebrated five decades of kitsch. Maybe someone in the Government decided that the cabaret is art and thus worthy of preservation. It's certainly a source of hard currency. As dozens of girls teetered around under chandelier headdresses that actually lighted up on cue, a marimba player appeared. His blurring mallets took me back to the Ed Sullivan show. The men juggled torches, the band blared and sequins never had it this good. After an hour the acts showed no sign of abating; I needed a break. The lobby was jammed with tourists buying cigars and rum. In the men's room, a dozen bleary-eyed Russians queued up for the pissoir.
On a Sunday, in search of white sand and blue water, I wedged myself into one of the Ladas, along with a group of students, and set off for Varadero, Cuba's most famous beach resort. I'd been assured by everyone that it was no more than an hour's drive. But as we headed east out of the city, the road signs abruptly ended. We were lost in no time, something that I found quite agreeable here among citrus groves, small villages and backroads. Every few miles we encountered soldiers in personnel carriers, dragging Soviet tanks around the countryside. Maneuvers. This kept the memory of invasion fresh, I supposed, but it must be a huge drain on the scanty national resources.
The soldiers we met were all courteous and offered precise directions, but none of them ever agreed on the proper route. We drove in a large, scenic circle, arriving at Varadero in just under four hours. The beach was of the classic white sand variety, with a few very pink Germans laid out under thatched umbrellas. Most of the tourists were said to be Canadians, longing for that hot Caribbean sun. On this day, however, they must all have been home in Toronto, for the shore was almost deserted. Varadero, with its stunning lack of development, is often cited as a potential tourist mecca, Cuba's most available quick fix for a moribund economy. Yes indeed, the tourists will come, but the price will be high - the mind's eye dots the landscape with boutiques, skate and scooter rental shops, real estate offices. Just like Waikiki. Some day the American embargo will be lifted, and trade will resume. It is easy to imagine the quaint streets of Cuban cities filling quickly with all the familiar American franchises. It is easy, too, to wince at the thought of the probable success of this impending invasion (with its ironic contrast to the Bay of Pigs). But the Cubans have been forced to be ingenious; they know what it means to recycle. They are not distracted by merchandise, not the way we are: they look to their culture as a source of vitality. It is peculiar, and even a bit condescending for a comfortable American to envy an impoverished and struggling people, but in some ways, I do.
 
Rules on travel
 
Who May Go
There are four reasons why Americans are permitted to visit Cuba and none involves tourism. Under the Trading With the Enemies Act, it is illegal for Americans to visit Cuba without either a general or a specific license issued by the Treasury Department, which regulates travel to the island. The ban applies even if an American citizen arrives in Cuba from a third country that permits travel to Cuba. This ban has applied since 1962, although it was lifted from 1977 to 1982.
A violation of the ban carries a fine of up to $50,000 and a prison sentence of up to 10 years. These penalties also apply to those who arrange any such trips.
With few exceptions, the six chartered planes that leave Miami for Havana each week take Government officials on business, journalists, researchers who have a specific need to be in Cuba and people visiting close relatives. They have a general license to travel to the island and do not need a piece of paper from the Government to allow the trip. But in an interview with customs agents before leaving the country they must provide proof that they qualify. Last year 8,500 American citizens visited Cuba under the general license, most to reunite with family members, said Larry Batdorf, a spokesman for the Treasury Department. All others wishing to visit Cuba must apply to the Treasury Department for a specific licence. About 50 were granted last year. In 1984 the Reagan Administration began an investigation of some 2,000 trips to Cuba by American scholars, journalists, lawyers and others that it said may have violated the regulations by offering opportunities for tourist visits under the guise of research or attendance at meetings. Marazul Tours, which is licensed by the Treasury Department, had its records subpoenaed. The subpoena was withdrawn and no charges were brought. Bob Guild, manager of Marazul, said the investigation had a chilling effect on legitimate travel to Cuba. Marazul arranges trips for about 3,500 Americans a year.
Last month a Texas fisherman was sentenced to 90 days in jail for organizing a trip to Cuba in 1987 in violation of the act.

HEADLINE: Walking on the Trail of Lord Byron

BYLINE: By ELISE MACLAY; ELISE MACLAY is the author of ''Green Winter: Celebrations of Later Life,'' which is being published in a new edition by Henry Holt this month.

 BODY:
FROM childhood, I have loved walking and reading, ideally in close conjunction. A loaf of bread, a jug of wine? For me, a book and a backpack are enough. Especially if I can walk in the footsteps of one of my favorite authors.
Last spring I did just that, roughly approximating the itinerary of the poet George Noel Gordon Byron on his initial foray from Prevesa on the Ionian coast to the interior of northwest Greece. Lord Byron was on his way to the courts of the infamous tyrant Ali Pasha, in Albanian Tepelene. Our trek kept a prudent 10- to 15-mile distance from the Albanian border. But the territory we passed through was the same, as little known and as beautiful.
We are two Americans (a lawyer and a writer who like to hike and read history and English literature) who joined a British walking group (four Britons, two Scots, two Irish and a Yorkshireman guide). Under the auspices of Sherpa Expeditions, based in London, we were on a two-week walking tour of the Zagorian villages - a Greece so different from sun-drenched, whitewashed islands as to seem another country altogether. 
In the Pindus Mountains in the region known as Zagoria, 48 exquisitely matched yet distinctive villages are composed entirely of gray local stone - gray stone houses with gray slate roofs, gray cobbled streets with gray stone curbs. Between these villages, and above and below them, lie forests and pastures inhabited only by shepherds, wolves, wild boar and an occasional lynx. It is rugged country, but the wild scenery - awesome gorges, snow-capped peaks, tumbling trout streams, plunging waterfalls - is gentled in spring with fields of wildflowers including (I was delighted to learn) a variety that is called in Greek Wild Virgin Lily.
It is the only place on earth, Lord Byron says, that he was ever content. Like him, we left problems at home and all thought of them faded like the mist in the valleys as we climbed through groves of oak, birch and juniper, up, up to Vradeto, a village that can be reached only on foot. Here, especially in winter when the snow often blocks the windows and the mule track is impassable, life is lived very much as it was 100 years ago.
We picnicked in the town square and bought drinks from the tiny taverna fronting it. The proprietor showed us photographs of winter snows reaching to the rooftops. Both taverna and square were deserted, but before we had unpacked tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and feta cheese and bread from our knapsacks and composed our communal Greek salad (a daily ritual) an old woman in black dress and shawl arrived. A man followed, then another, and soon seven or eight villagers had gathered around us. They spoke no English and our Greek was sketchy, but the old woman made us understand that we were welcome, that she was born in Vradeto and that until she was 7 years old the Turks ruled the town. She said she had a son and daughter in Athens, but lived alone here ''because it is more beautiful.'' Flowering fruit trees and neat vegetable gardens in stone-walled courtyards argued her point.
Although the ruggedness of the Pindus range has successfully turned back conquering armies and busloads of sightseeing tourists, it is not necessary to be a mountaineer or a rock climber to explore it on foot. Trails ranging from narrow footpaths to wide, cobbled mule tracks lead to all the important sights. Chief among these is Vikos Gorge, the Grand Canyon of Greece. Its towering 1,000- to 1,500-foot limestone walls stretch eight miles to the village of Papingo - our first night's stop. To walk from one village to the next takes from three to six hours and, although there are steep places and occasionally loose rocks underfoot, it should not be beyond anyone used to a good weekend's hike. The Greek Alpine club marks and maintains many of these trails and has provided for hikers an alpine hut on the saddle between Mount Astrakas (7,900 feet) and Gamila (8,320 feet).
Our climb from Papingo to the mountain hut was the most demanding part of our trip. It took about four hours, and for the first time we had to carry our food and cook it rather than dining in tavernas. In these remote parts, villages predate automobiles and so they are almost always a day's walk apart. And in every village, no matter how small, there is - as Byron says - a taverna where the traveler could be sure of food and wine and welcome.
Accommodations on the trip were a mixture, but always modest: mostly in small rooms either in the local taverna or in guesthouses. Typically there would be a shared bath or shower down the hall. The places we stayed in were, without exception, scrupulously clean. The trip leader brought the makings of breakfast, because we would usually have an early start. We often ate out in the courtyard, with coffee made on a sterno stove, fruit and bread.
However, if you believe Hobhouse, Byron's companion (and in my opinion a big complainer) Zagorian cuisine must have improved mightily since the poet's day. In village after village, we had no complaint. Our chicken was roasted to perfection. Hobhouse says theirs was ''Done to rags.'' Our tomatoes were red-ripe and flavorful. Stuffed eggplant (which our English companions called aubergine) was delicious. Meals usually consisted of bread (no butter except at breakfast), Greek salad, soup, lamb or chicken grilled or roasted or stewed with vegetables; sometimes moussaka, sometimes stuffed tomatoes or eggplant, sometimes an omelet. We almost never had dessert. Everything we ate was fresh and unadulterated. What we did not have was variety, lavishness, opulence. This is a lean and frugal land, no place for fripperies.
David, my husband, and I booked our trip through Himalayan Travel, with offices in Greenwich, Conn., because a small ad in one of the many wildlife magazines we subscribe to said they offered trips to Greece. Inquiry revealed the fact that one of their offerings was Sherpa Expeditions walking trip, its itinerary approximating Byron's.
IT was not economical for us to join the group in London and depart with them on a charter flight to Prevesa, where we might have gazed at the Bay of Actium, where Augustus defeated Anthony and Cleopatra. As it was, we got to see the bay later and our inexpensive flight from New York to Athens rewarded us with an Acropolis not yet overrun with summer visitors.
From Athens we flew to Ionnina, which our travel agent had never heard of even after I learned to pronounce it (YAH-nee-nah, with the first syllable decisively accented). In the Grande Bretagne Hotel in Athens, a porter, his eyes glazed with boredom, sprang to attention when I mentioned Ionnina. ''If you say Ionnina like that,'' he said, ''you must love Greece.'' He was right, of course.
I suspect that Ionnina today is harder to love than it was in Byron's time. Modern buildings and industrial development, traffic jams and dust deflect the visitor from the city's treasures - a mosque, a palace, the ancient Turkish quarter, historic sites including the very house - or merely the site of the house, depending on which professor you believe - where Byron lived.
Modern Ionnina also obscures its ultimate charm, its lakeside setting. Take a taxi to the quay as we did, and Lake Pamvotis suddenly appears like a magical mirage. Shallow, dark as polished onyx, reflecting minarets and towers, Pamvotis has a dreamlike quality, unruffled by scullers in training, fishermen in long narrow boats and the purposeful little launch that took us to the small wooded island called Nissi Ioanninon. Here we were to meet our fellow hikers, and we did, but they did not arrive until evening, so we explored the island on our own.
Surrounded by reeds and marshes where water fowl nest, sheltered by huge plane trees, Nissi is a pleasant place and interesting historically and artistically. With the aid of a guideboook we bought in Ionnina we viewed the 16th-century monastery of Panteleimon, the house where Ali Pasha took refuge in 1822, the ceiling through which he was shot dead by the Turks, and the jeweled dress of his young wife Vasiliki, who may or may not have betrayed him. From the 16th-century frescoes in the 11th-century monastery of Stratigopoulos we learned some of the more exotic tortures Christians endured, contemplated a portrait of Thucydides and laughed with delight at an exuberant Adam and Eve in an animal-filled painted paradise.
Toward evening the Sherpa group arrived and got acquainted at dinner. Lake Pamvotis teems with eels, trout, crayfish and frogs and every taverna on Nisi displays a tank of live seafood. We were invited to choose what we wanted the chef to cook.
The group members ranged in age from 18 to 65. Everyone was easily able to go the daily distance. It was just a matter of pace and even that tended to average out. Where the wildflowers were lush, the youngsters dawdled and the oldsters caught up. The strongest walker, a crackerjack skier, took it easy on the downhill, sparing a bad knee. I was both tortoise and hare. More agile than strong, I toiled up steep grades and bounded gleefully down. Angus, a Scot, and David, who although American is of Scottish ancestry, were soul mates, attacking every difficulty with ferocious determination. Arthur, young and Irish, jogged around the village each evening while the rest of us collapsed in the first taverna we encountered.
David and I have taken three walking trips with English groups, and it may be that our experience is unique, but it seems to us that while our British cousins are less friendly (I can't imagine their waiters bounding up to the table to announce ''Hi, I'm Kevin'') they are also more polite - a trait highly to be desired where other amenities may be in short supply. We traveled the next day by launch to Ionnina and then by taxi to the trailhead where our trek officially began. The first day is always a little tough and the Vicos gorge trail is challenging, but we all arrived at the village of Papingo in time and with enough energy to look around.
Papingo and its twin village, Mega Papingo, are traditional but not entirely typical, for they are restored villages. Crafts have been revived, houses rebuilt in the ancient style (some serve as guest houses) and families lured back after working abroad.
The next day we made the ascent to the Astraka hut, where we spent two full days. The hut, a two-story stone building, is furnished with double-decker beds, trestle tables, wooden benches and a wood-burning stove. Except in an emergency, it is part of the hikers' code to arrive with wood and kindling to add to the hut's supply. Most hikers carry sleeping bags, though we did not, but there are 20 or 30 heavy woolen blankets stored in wooden bins for visitors to use. There is electricity and water but no indoor toilet. As evening falls and the wind roars through the pass, the hut is immensely cozy with a pot of stew bubbling on the stove and hikers speaking different languages and communicating with simple offerings - a wedge of cheese (Dutch), pistachio nuts (Greek), a Hershey bar (American).
IN the morning, we explored a landscape that was almost lunar - great fields of boulders, breathtaking views and immense silence. We walked to the Drakalimmi of Gamila, a fascinating and magical green lake, stopping along the way to photograph a great snowfield with hundreds of crocuses poking through. To descend, we took a different route, across limestone uplands, past shepherd's huts where feta cheese is made. We drank at crystal springs, where we always found a cup or glass or pitcher set close by in the name of hospitality. Toward evening we reached Tsepelovon, where Alexis Gouris, who speaks English, was our host for two days.
Alexis has a fine two-story house with an external staircase and large comfortable bedrooms with fireplaces and balconies. From this luxury we set out each day to visit another Zagorian village. Every walk is at once the same and different. Much of the difference involves weather. Mountain weather is always changeable, but in the Pindus it was as if the gods drank ouzo and began throwing the elements around - sun, mist, black clouds, rain, the bluest sky in the world - all in half a day.
One day our group went farther afield and, in order to reach Tsepelevon in time for dinner, we decided to rejoin the paved road and take a 4 o'clock bus back. (When you have climbed Gamila, you feel entitled to take it easy - and Alexis had promised us hot water if we arrived before 6:30 P.M.) But delaying 5 minutes here, 10 minutes there, to take a photo or identify a wildflower (Greece is said to support over 6,000 species) we missed the bus. There was nothing for it but to walk. No problem. After the rough trails of the day, it was pleasant to stride along a smooth road.
The sun had faded and wisps of mist floated like chiffon scarfs among the limestone crags. The day, even after 4, was warm and windless. Suddenly, as if the mountains were cracking open, there was a tremendous clap of thunder. I remembered that Byron, having lost his way enroute to Zitsa, had encountered a violent thunderstorm that terrified his English valet.
THE sky blackened and, to our astonishment, we were pelted with gigantic hailstones. Perhaps these mountains are magic, for our group, tired and hungry, was seized with laughter. We scooped up handfuls of hailstones - no easy task as they skittered and bounced on the asphalt. We threw them in the air, at each other, off the cliff. Finally, we got our ponchos out, put them on and headed for town. When a bread truck stopped to give us a lift we got in a little reluctantly. Although we didn't wish to emulate the poet to the extent of getting influenza, we were somehow loath to return to the simplicity of village life.
By the time we reached Alexis' house, we were happy enough to shower, dress and eat egg-lemon soup, lamb chops, green beans and potatoes with a bottle of local white wine we had picked up at the taverna on the village square. Alexis owns the taverna. He owns the general store. He told me that he has land on the edge of the village where he said he will build a 55-room hotel.
His eyes shone at the idea. I was almost beguiled by the picture he painted. Comfortable beds. Hot water. Window boxes with flowers. But I wondered. If people come, Tsepelovon will change, the mule tracks will be paved, new buildings will rise, and although Alexis thinks that is what he wants, he cannot know what it may mean. For now, he is his own man, a big man in a small beautiful town, a man with a taverna, a general store, a house, a wife, a daughter, a garden, a pickup truck and a dream.
The Greek Government values the Zagorian villages and, in recognition of their proud and ancient past, has designated many of them as historic preservation areas. Much of the mountainous beauty around them now comprises the Vikos-Aoos National Park. But, in the last analysis, what will protect his magical place is what always has -the wildness of the terrain and the fiercely independent spirit of its people.
From Tsepelovon we went to Parga for a few days of indolence on the beach. As we were leaving, I asked Alexis about a ruined house on the outskirts of town. The roof had fallen in, wind and rain had rotted posts and beams, wild honeysuckle climbed over the crumbling walls. Was it abandoned? No, the owner had gone away. To America, perhaps. But he would be back. Or his son would or his grandson. ''And so will you,'' Alexis added, smiling. ''How do you know?'' I asked. ''I think,'' he said, ''that when people walk, they remember.'' I think he is right.

HEADLINE: Travel Watch

 BODY:
To the Editor: I've found your Travel Watch section a useful guide for the business traveler, but I would like to point out an error in the $1 Equals . . . section.
Since the new year began, you've been listing the year-ago Brazilian currency exchange rate as being in cruzados. This should be given in new cruzados, a monetary unit that the Brazilian Government introduced in January (1,000 cruzados equal 1 new cruzado) as an aid to help stem the country's 2,000-plus percent per annum inflation rate. 
The Brazilian-bound traveler should be aware that three types of bank notes are in general circulation: 1. Cruziero notes, which have been printed over in black ink with a thousand-fold devaluation number that turned them into cruzado notes (a result of the December 1986 Currency Devaluation Act). 2. Cruzado notes, which have been printed over in black ink with a thousand-fold devaluation number that turned them into New Cruzado notes (a result of the January 1989 Currency Devaluation Act). 3. New cruzado bank notes.
As a precaution, when changing money, the traveler should closely examine the bank notes being received so as to avoid costly conversion errors.

Eliane Freitas, director of the Brazil Tourism Office in the United States and Canada, adds: As of March 15, a number of changes in the Brazilian monetary system were enacted. Among those changes, a new currency, the cruzeiro, was created in substitution of the former new cruzado without any devaluation. Another measure was an 18-month freeze on investment accounts. As a result, there was a shortage of legal tender for a limited time following the announcement. The shortage was due to the fact that most Brazilians, who used to keep their assets in investment accounts accompanying inflation, were temporarily prevented from accessing part of them. Some tourists who were in Brazil at the time were exposed to the shortage when trying to exchange money. Because of the unavailability of cruzeios, the United States dollar rate went down to about half of its value before March 15. In some cases, transactions were made in foreign currencies. By March 30, gradual injections of Brazilian currency into the market brought the U.S. dollar back to approximately 90 percent of its value prior to the plan.

HEADLINE: GIFTED CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS: A MATTER OF CLASS

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Stone; Elizabeth Stone teaches journalism at the Fordham University College at Lincoln Center. She is working on a book about the Hunter College Campus Schools.

 BODY:
RECENTLY, A CLASS OF kindergartners and first graders at Hunter College Elementary School for the gifted in Manhattan were discussing with their teacher what Mayor David N. Dinkins might do for the city's 5- and 6-year-olds.
''Well,'' said Allegra, ''he can spend some of the money getting kids more education. He could build new schools. Many are very, very broken down.''
''He could use the money to buy teachers that are very smart and that could teach very well,'' said Josh. ''And another thing - some kids might not feel comfortable in their schools, and he could reassure them to be comfortable.'' 
''What happens to kids,'' wondered the teacher, Darlene Freeman, ''when they don't feel comfortable in school?''
Molly raised her hand. ''They wind up not wanting to go, and then the Japanese would get ahead,'' she said.
Molly isn't the only one thinking about the Japanese. Legislators, industrialists and educators are too, and about the unpleasant possibility of America falling permanently behind as a world power. And the same awful scenario goes through their minds when they consider the prospect of Europe pooling its resources in 1992. Meanwhile, despite a decade of educational reform, each new study of American schoolchildren offers more bad news. A recent report from the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that, among other things, American schoolchildren possess the capacity to absorb information but falter when it comes to using that information to reason effectively.
As a result, attention is once again being focused on ''gifted and talented'' students - in practice, the 3 to 5 percent of the elementary-school and high-school population with the highest standardized-test scores. Twenty-six states require that gifted children be identified; some also require that they be served. Others have discretionary programs.
Even the Federal Government is watching these children - as it did in the 1950's, post-Sputnik, and again in the early 70's, following a heavy emphasis on disadvantaged children - sizing them up as a national resource to be cultivated. The clearest sign of this interest is the passage of the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 1988, championed by Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey.
Under the bill, money has been appropriated to subsidize 28 educational pilot projects (many of which focus on economically disadvantaged students, who account for a disproportionately small percent of those currently identified as gifted), to establish a research center on the gifted and to re-establish an Office of Gifted and Talented Education in Washington. The bill defines gifted children as those ''who give evidence of high-performance capability in areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic or leadership capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to develop such capabilities.''
No one would argue with the idea that some children are smarter than others. Smart is smart, but ''gifted'' is a word with an agenda. To decide who gets into ''gifted'' programs, which may start as early as the nursery level, schools have traditionally relied on the I.Q. test. The children who do best on these tests, say educators, are those who've had the most ''mediated'' experience - been read to, talked to, listened to, taken on car trips and had every last cow pointed out. In short, the middle-class child.
In a culture uneasy at admitting that it has a class structure, ''gifted'' can become a code word for middle class, and especially white middle class, adding a fantasy patina of merit to what is merely money, and tacitly reinforcing the most unsavory racial stereotypes. Programs for the gifted are largely a phenomenon of public education. In urban areas, gifted education at the elementary level often seems little more than a lifeboat for white middle-class children on the sinking ship of public education.
Not that there aren't occasional innovative efforts to find minority children's incipient strengths and serve them: the Program of Assessment, Diagnosis and Instruction, in Montgomery County, Md., looks for and nurtures bright minority children, a quarter of whom later come to be identified as ''gifted''; an innovative program using creative means of finding bright minority children is just beginning in Austin, Tex.; another program, in District 18 in East Flatbush, Brooklyn,(Continued on Page 68) will use a $900,000 Javits grant to identify and develop ''multiple intelligences'' in minority kindergartners over a three-year period. And Hunter College's graduate program in education has recently put an emphasis on disadvantaged gifted children, says Prof. Rena F. Subotnik. But these efforts, while promising, can hardly be called indicative of the field's general orientation.
Despite more than 70 years of educational interest in bright children, there is no consistent research that demonstrates in general how gifted children should be identified, or what or how they should be taught. (Interest in the gifted began around 1920 in the United States, thus introducing educational tiers just at the time mass education was promising educational equality.) What is clear is that those identified as gifted are not necessarily the ones who have gone on to make the most stellar contributions in life.
''It's my opinion that most gifted programs turn their backs on most of the people that history comes to designate as gifted,'' says Joseph S. Renzulli, professor of educational psychology at the University of Connecticut at Storrs and director of the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented. He cites Woody Allen, Charles Schulz and Steven Spielberg among those overlooked as talented students.
So it's no wonder the renewed interest in gifted children has stirred up controversy. That interest is not welcomed by Deborah Meier, recipient of a MacArthur Foundation grant who established several well-regarded public-school programs in East Harlem. ''Are we saying gifted children are more valuable to society?'' she asks. ''A society which picks out some children as more valuable than others is sending a terrible message. Any time people talk about what the gifted need - problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, creative thinking - they're describing what every child needs. In fact, other children may need it even more.''
Jerome Bruner, research professor of psychology at New York University, takes a different view. ''Goodness gracious,'' he says, ''when the world's leading industrial producer has become the world's leading debtor, I would think we need as much as we can get by way of thoughtful people. If you don't have high aspirations for your gifted, you don't have them for anyone. Why does 'gifted' produce such shudders?''
THE SHUDDERS BEGIN within the field of gifted education - a collection of several thousand teachers, parents, administrators and education professors in curriculum development or research. ''We're a practice without a theory,'' says Prof. James H. Borland of Columbia University Teachers College. ''We don't have a research base, we don't have a knowledge base, we don't have a theoretical base.''
Curriculum comes in for criticism, too. ''We spend a lot of time thinking about how to get kids and less time on what to do once we get them - on content areas and program planning,'' says Patricia O'Connell Ross, new director of the Federal Government's Office of Gifted and Talented Education. She was speaking to the 2,000 conventioneers of the National Association for Gifted Children, an advocacy group made up of teachers, administrators and parents, who gathered for a breakfast meeting in Cincinnati last October.
Robert J. Sternberg, a Yale psychologist and author of ''The Triarchic Mind: A New Theory of Human Intelligence,'' says what bothers him most is that ''a lot of what passes for gifted instruction is a little on the mindless side. I see some kids doing idiot work on worksheets.''
In elementary schools, there are two common approaches to education for the gifted. The first - more common because it costs less - is instituting ''pullout'' sections, where a small group of children are taken out of their regular classroom for an hour or so of special-education goodies, usually several times a week. At an elementary school in Hazlet, N.J., last fall, bright fourth graders met for special work in literature and creative writing, oceanography, social studies and problem-solving. That meant, says one unenthusiastic parent, that four times a week her child missed her regular science and social-studies classes and was required to make up the work and get the assignments on her own.
The second approach is the ''self-contained classroom,'' putting all the smart children together for the entire school day. Children who hang out with smart children tend to turn out smarter, which is why the practice is in disrepute. Besides, it's incompatible with the newest education trend favoring ''cooperative learning'' and frowning on ''ability grouping.''
Ability grouping excludes. Abraham J. Tannenbaum, emeritus professor of education and psychology at Teachers College, is one who favors an inclusive approach. You offer every child the opportunity to write haiku, or play the clarinet, or work on the class mural, says Tannenbaum. Next you look at what they actually produce - not potential but performance. Only then might you make decisions about sifting. This is how the Westinghouse Talent Search, which can claim a few Nobel Prize winners among its alumni, proceeds. This seems to make more sense than designating children as gifted before they've even started school, as Hunter Elementary does.
Whatever the class structure, the field's ideal these days is ''differentiated'' curriculum, rather than ''acceleration'' (which may, however, be favored at the high-school level, especially in advanced-placement courses). If a bright child learns quickly, say the curriculum developers, don't just race the child through the standard curriculum. Instead, offer the same material in a more textured way. In practice, curriculum adapted to bright children often boils down to ''mots and plops,'' says Arthur I. Pober, principal of Hunter College Elementary School.
''Mots'' is More of the Same, ''and it's often followed by More of the Same Times 2,'' says Pober. ''Twice as many math problems, twice as many spelling words, twice as many book reports.'' ''Plops'' is what may happen when the curriculum is enriched. ''So you take a kid to the museum and you plop him down,'' Pober says. ''It has nothing to do with what the kid's been studying or will be studying.''
Others in the field find the abundant criticisms unfair, and point out that teachers of gifted children are among the first to pick up on innovations that later become standard. For a while now in programs for the gifted, the focus has been on reasoning ability, for which the buzzwords may be ''critical thinking,'' or ''problem solving,'' or ''higher-level thinking skills.'' Just recently, Darlene Freeman adapted her class's unit on ''health'' (required by the state) to give it appropriate depth for her kindergarten children and first graders; her differentiation included a variety of problem-solving skills.
Her focus was on how much sugar the children were eating, and it was a critical thinker's heaven. Students identified various sugars - molasses, brown sugar, honey, corn syrup or dextrose. They brought in cereal boxes and analyzed the contents. Then they classified the cereals as heavy in sugar or not. Guilty boxes - Cap'n Crunch and Fruit-e-O's - were pilloried on the wall.
Next the children collected data on their own sugar intake for a week, sorting the results as high, low or average. Then they repeated their survey, and compared and contrasted the two sets of results: sugar intake was down. The children speculated as to the cause, concluding: ''This happened because we're learning that too much sugar is not good for you.''
SOON HUNTER ELEMENTARY School will celebrate its 50th anniversary as a school for the ''gifted.'' It's harder to get into than Harvard, with 1,500 applicants applying for 48 spots in nursery and kindergarten classes. At stake is an education - at the public's expense - that feels good and is good, with excellent teachers, an interesting curriculum, and a nice bunch of children, racially mixed to reflect the city's diversity and in accord with the school's explicit policy. Hunter has tried to find qualified children who are not middle-class, but, even with its change to the Stanford-Binet 4, a less culturally biased I.Q. test than most, the school has not succeeded. An informal 1988 survey among families whose children qualified for Hunter suggested the average income was $60,000.
The process of identifying a child as gifted is a complicated and stressful one for parents, as Terry Mattei, a secretary at Hunter Elementary, well knows. It is Mattei who fields all the phone calls and sends out all the applications. Although school systems in Texas, Virginia, Maine, Iowa and elsewhere are increasingly considering ''student portfolios'' among their criteria for entrance into gifted programs, Hunter discourages it. ''We tried it one year,'' says Nancy Goldman, an educational consultant at Hunter. ''Little Jimmy sent in his tape and little Betty sent in her picture, but we couldn't figure out any way to quantify it, so we dismissed it.''
Hunter does require parent evaluations, even though such evaluations favor the middle-class applicant. Parents squinch their handwriting into the tiniest size possible to fill Hunter's one-page questionnaire with examples of their child's abstract reasoning powers and analytic ability, curiosity and self-motivation, persistence and love of learning, memory and self-direction. Eventually, some even get to take their child to Hunter's ''second round,'' to a classroom whose window is covered over with paper so no one can see in. There, testers meet groups of six or seven children at a time, and carefully plumb each child's depths for signs of problem-solving ability, verbal ability, mathematical ability, creativity and leadership, says Evelyn J. Rich, associate dean of the Hunter College Campus Schools, which, in addition to Hunter College Elementary, includes Hunter College High School.
But nobody's cramped handwriting will be read and no child will be invited to the room with the paper-covered windows unless the child first scores at or above the required percentile on the Stanford-Binet 4. (Last year, Hunter Elementary required an I.Q. score at the 98th percentile, and the year before that at the 97th.) The Stanford-Binet, first used in 1916, for years heavily emphasized verbal ability and knowledge of certain kinds of verbal information. Although the argument has been made for 40 years that such skills are indicative of cultural privilege rather than intelligence, use of the I.Q. test continues to be widespread. Even in its current less ''biased'' form, it remains controversial. Dismissing it as a ''hegemonic instrument,'' Jerome Bruner says, ''We know perfectly well it paints certain kinds of kids right out of the room - poor kids, late starters.''
Dr. Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, agrees: ''As long as we end up using the wrong yardstick, we're going to be doing mischievously dangerous things to children. These instruments tend to screen out potential rather than to define it.''
Nevertheless, the I.Q. test still has the weight of the CAT scan. Forty states recommend or require its use in identifying a gifted child, and estimates are that it governs acceptance in close to 90 percent of all gifted programs in public schools.
JOSEPH RENZULLI WAS among the first to say the field's exclusive emphasis on high I.Q. was misguided. He suggests instead that the combination of ''well above average'' ability (translated as 120 I.Q.), creativity and persistence would yield more.
As for minorities, he says, ''We've kind of been at the lip-service level for a long time.'' At the recent convention of the National Association for Gifted Children, seminars held on ''Special Populations'' focused as much on the Learning Disabled Gifted, the Underachieving Gifted, the Rurally Isolated Gifted as on the Minority Gifted. (''Severely Gifted'' or ''Chronically Gifted,'' terms people use with a straight face, refer to those who are very, very bright.) Renzulli's approach is used in all 50 states and in every major city. His is the official approach of the Gifted and Talented Unit of the New York City Board of Education. His model, the Renzulli Enrichment Triad, is based on a step-by-step approach not unlike Tannenbaum's initial come-one-come-all approach. Type I activities expose children to new realms (say urban planning) through field trips or visits from experts. Type II activities teach students skills pertinent to the area (surveying or rudimentary map making). And Type III activities are individual or group projects (doing a study to determine the best site for a second neighborhood candy store).
The appeal of Renzulli's work is that it is easily accessible and inexpensive to implement. With his emphasis on development of specific ''gifted behaviors'' rather than on a general state of ''being gifted,'' he has offered the field a way to refute charges of ''elitism.''
Nonetheless, inequities continue. State financing for the gifted has long been largest in the South. In 1987, Florida led the nation in funding its gifted programs with $68 million and Georgia was second, with $23 million. ''Florida, Georgia and North Carolina have had mandates to serve the gifted since the early 1960's,'' says Valerie Terry Seaberg, president of the Council of State Directors of Programs for the Gifted. Asked why, she paused. ''Well, you think about why.'' Many in the field privately say the money was to perpetuate segregated classrooms, with white students filling the gifted classes.
Gifted programs have made a heavy reappearance in northern cities in the last decade. Gary Timmons, a legislative specialist for the National Education Association, speculates that in a burdened educational system, middle-class parents who might never have thought of identifying their children as gifted now hurry to do so. ''It's the politics of pressure groups,'' he explains. ''You've got to have a cause. You can't just come in and say, 'My kid isn't being served.' You've got to say, 'My gifted kid isn't being served.' '' Virtually all of New York City's school districts have gifted programs. On Manhattan's Upper West Side, in Community School District 3, seven new programs for gifted children have been instituted over the last eight years.
The district's school enrollment is currently 88 percent minority. The white enrollment is heavily concentrated in classes for the gifted and in P.S. 87, the district's most middle-class school, which uses the Renzulli Triad. One school, P.S. 9, has two gifted programs. One of them, the Anderson Program, originally requiring an I.Q. at the 99th percentile, was instituted after a campaign by parents who felt the district's gifted program - requiring an I.Q. at the 95th percentile - was ''watered down.''
It is commonplace within the field to act as if the cupboard were financially bare, but a peek into the cupboard suggests otherwise. Nationally, state financing specifically tagged for gifted children added up to $297 million in 1987, according to the most recent report of the Council of State Directors of Programs for the Gifted. Sometimes the money for gifted programs comes from dipping into resources meant for desegregation - through the Magnet School Assistance Program - thanks to a loophole in Federal legislation. Eleven of the 54 grantees for 1989-91 - including urban schools in California, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Wisconsin - stipulated that a gifted program would be included as a part of their overall desegregation plan.
P.S. 163, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, is one of several schools in District 3 to receive a share of $3.25 million in Federal Magnet School Assistance funds during 1989-91. These funds were designed to ''reduce minority group isolation'' by bringing in white students. These schools also qualify for special city and state financing for the gifted. Sheri Lynn Behr, who teaches a first-grade gifted class, says her class takes more trips and has more creative and advanced math programs than other first-grade classes. In the same school, the children in the gifted program have a music teacher while others do not, because the parents raised the money. In District 18 in Brooklyn, teachers of the gifted receive more instruction on how to teach than teachers in other programs. The Hunter Campus Schools cost the public $7 million to $8 million annually.
Even though some of the financing is designed to reduce ''minority group isolation,'' minority children do not have to be represented in these classes in proportion to their presence in the school community. On the national level, black children account for 16.2 percent of all school children, but only 8 percent of those are identified as gifted.
IF THE I.Q. TEST GOES the way of phrenology, how are we to find, nourish and cultivate the gifts and talents in our children? Once, when I was pressing Dean Rich of the Hunter Campus Schools about the elementary school's continued use of the I.Q. test, the dean got exasperated. ''Look,'' she said, ''do you know the work of Howard Gardner? Do you know his book 'Frames of Mind'? We're interested in his work. And do you know the work of Robert Sternberg, the Yale psychologist? Him, too.'' She held the names up as if she were brandishing a cross to ward off demons.
Today, these are indeed the names to brandish, along with Renzulli's. ''I was considered to be the screaming liberal of the business,'' Renzulli says. ''And then when people like Gardner and Sternberg started to say the same things I was saying, the fabled I.Q. guard in the field softened up, and I started to get more respect.'' Whether the regard for this triad of academics is sincere or cynical, they have been pushed to the head of the parade for offering a broader, more inclusive definition of intelligence - and hence giftedness.
Howard Gardner, a developmental psychologist and professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, has become well known for his view, which first grew out of his research with children and stroke victims, that there are distinct and autonomous intelligences. Gardner calls these ''multiple intelligences'' and identifies them as logical-mathematical, linguistic, musical, spatial, bodily kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal.
These days, Gardner is assured a place on every scholarly bibliography, a seat on any educational dias he chooses and a citation on every grant application. ''If we're talking about gifted,'' says a source close to the Javits bill, ''Gardner and Sternberg are the coins of the realm in the cutting-edge conversations.''
''I don't have a specific interest in giftedness,'' says Gardner. ''My theory has sort of become a buzz-thing, like 'right brain-left brain.' '' Does he believe that those who buzz it understand it? ''I think it's unrealistic to think that one administrator in one school system reading one book will fully understand the theory. But,'' he adds, ''it's not something I worry about very much. I can't afford to lose too much sleep over the uses people might make of my ideas.''
Robert Sternberg says, ''I just go where my interests lead me.'' In recent years, they've led him to his ''triarchic'' theory of intelligence. Essentially, Sternberg wants to look, first, at the ''components'' of intelligence and how they function; second, at intelligence in relation to experience, as in how quickly a novel task can become automatic, and third, at intelligence in relation to everyday life - not just how smart people are in a vacuum but how well they succeed in finding a match between their strengths and the slice of the world they inhabit.
Both men are already affecting how children are identified as gifted. One successful Javits grant applicant cited Gardner (and, for good measure, Renzulli) for a project devoted to selecting children with talent in dance and music. They have asked for $930,000 over a three-year period.
Meanwhile, a few tendrils that grow out of Sternberg's theory have already found their way into Hunter Elementary's testing. One is Sternberg's interest in context. ''Vocabulary,'' he has written, ''is such a good measure of intelligence because it measures, albeit indirectly, children's ability to acquire information in context.'' Now Hunter's test, designed by Nancy Goldman, an educational consultant, may include telling children a story with selected ''nonsense'' words in place of real words and asking them to suggest what sensible words might be substituted.
One year, Goldman treated the children to a concrete variation of a problem devised by Sternberg, an ''insight'' problem involving mathematical thinking, but not computational skill. In Sternberg's words, the question is: ''If you have black socks and brown socks in your drawer, mixed in the ratio of 4 to 5, how many socks will you have to take out to make sure of having a pair of the same color?''
In adapting this problem, Nancy Goldman got three pairs of socks - each pair respectively adorned with the face of Goofy, Donald and Mickey - and put them in a paper bag. After making sure that the children being tested understood ''pairs,'' she asked them how many dips into the bag (without looking) it would take before they could be sure of having two socks that made a matched pair.
''I can solve that easy,'' one child told Goldman. Then he took the bag and dumped all the socks out. ''Here's a matching pair'' he said. Goldman thought the child had aced the question and so, too, when he was told, did Sternberg. Some people might feel that the child had simply disregarded the rules of the question, but for Sternberg real-life creativity involves innovation, even changing the nature of the question.
Would that one could as easily ace questions about bright children. For what is the point of broadening the definition of ''giftedness'' if in the end finances are not available to nurture all these gifts? All that will happen is that there will be an increased number of children competing for a fixed amount of money. All children have strengths in need of nurture, but - with all due respect to the Congress and the ''Education President,'' George Bush - a Federal budget that allocates to primary and secondary education less than 1 percent of its resources isn't putting its money where its mouth is.
Still, Robert Sternberg is a practical man, all for reaching into the drawer while it's open. ''Interest in gifted children comes in cycles,'' he says, ''and I'll take my opportunities as they come. We're living in a time of chaotic problems. We're starting to lose the ozone layer. Where is the future of business, new products, science, technology, new computers? I really do think it's with the children we might call gifted.''
And if their parents don't sort their socks before they put them in the drawer, by the way, the children will have to pull out no more than three socks to get a matched pair. Two, if they keep their eyes open.

HEADLINE: CASEY AT THE MIKE

BYLINE: By Susan Orlean: Susan Orlean is the author of ''Saturday Night,'' published this month.

 BODY:
A FEW FACTS ABOUT Kemal Amen Kasem: As the voice behind the pop music countdown radio show ''Casey's Top Forty,'' he may be the most-listened-to person on radio except for the commentator Paul Harvey. He is of Lebanese Druse parentage, the son of a grocer, born and raised in Detroit. His first radio job was playing Scoop Ryan, Cub Reporter. He subsequently had roles on ''The Lone Ranger'' and ''Sergeant Preston of the Yukon.'' He was a disk jockey in Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, Oakland and Los Angeles. He was the voice of Robin on the ''Superfriends'' cartoon series, Shaggy on ''Scooby Doo,'' Waldo on ''Mr. Magoo'' and various letters of the alphabet on ''Sesame Street.'' He has been heard, he says, on some 10,000 television and radio commercials. He was the exclusive promo announcer for NBC-TV from 1977 to 1981.
He is a hard-core vegetarian, a reformed heavy smoker, an anti-nuclear activist, and an advocate of animal rights, homeless rights, Palestinian rights, reincarnation, topsoil and peace. He went through Werner Erhard's est training in 1979. Four days a week he devotes to political and humanitarian causes; one day a week he tapes ''Casey's Top Forty.'' 
He and his wife, Jean Kasem, who played Loretta on ''Cheers,'' were married by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. For four years the couple lived in a big, plush suite in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. They moved recently, and anticipate the birth in July of their first child, whom they plan to name Justice if it's a boy, and Liberty if it's a girl. He has three teen-age children from his first marriage.
Though Kasem did fail to achieve his early goal of being a major-league baseball player, and his acting career plateaued after his appearance in ''The Incredible Two-Headed Transplant,'' his life has otherwise taken the form of one of those triumphant tales he likes to impart on his radio show.
Kasem started the show in 1970, a curious time to start a show about Top 40 mainstream pop, because the format had just been pronounced dead and progressive album-oriented radio was on the rise. He infused the show with corny reverence for conventional American values exactly when cynicism had become the more fashionable posture. He even gave it an old-fashioned, square name. Being someone who is uninclined toward self-doubt, he disregarded all these inauspicious signs. And not only was the show a success, it ultimately proved that radio, long considered too regional and homemade to have stars or economic clout on a par with network television, could indeed have both.
During the ensuing 20 years, singles sales collapsed, radio has gotten increasingly narrow-cast and specific, and music has gone in a million directions. But Kasem's appeal has transcended all of that, and his success has virtually launched an industry, inspiring a score of other nationally syndicated radio shows, including numerous countdown programs, with grosses totaling tens of millions of dollars. Last year, when his contract with Capital Cities/ABC was up for renewal and the network offered him what he considered an unsatisfactory sum to renew, there was speculation that the 58-year-old Kasem might be counting down for the last time. Instead, he upended those expectations and signed a reported five-year, $20-million-dollar-plus contract - a heftier deal than the one Dan Rather is said to have with CBS News - with Westwood One Radio Networks.
''Casey's Top Forty,'' like ''American Top Forty,'' is a four-hour-long program in which the 40 most popular songs of the week are played in order. Between songs, Kasem, in his sunny, crackly tenor, recounts oddball statistics about the musicians, tells tales of their triumph over pain and adversity and shyness and financial ruin on their way to the Top 40, and reads letters sent to him by listeners - as he has been doing since 1970. ''Casey's Top Forty'' made its debut on Jan. 21, 1989, on more than 400 stations across the country, more than any other syndicated show had ever begun with. It's also heard in 27 other countries around the world, with a total audience estimated at eight million.
''Garbage,'' Kasem says, speculating on his extraordinary appeal. ''It's a natural quality of huskiness in the midrange of my voice that I call 'garbage.' It's not a clear-toned announcer's voice. It's more like the voice of the guy next door.'' He clears his throat and says: ''Hear that? In the midrange?
''But I really don't think it's that I have a God-given voice that's so special. I just found a showcase that made good use of my particular voice. It's all storytelling. It's an ancient form. Even when I do commercials, I try to tell a story about the product. With music, I try to tell the story of the person's struggle for success. And I believe every word I say. I never read anything on the air I don't believe in. I think people sense that about me, and they respond to it.''
ON A RECENT THURSDAY MORNING, KASEM IS sitting in his Mercedes in the driveway of the Beverly Wilshire drinking a cup of coffee substitute, preparing to drive with me to the studio where he tapes ''America's Top Ten.'' He'll do a taping blitz, starting at 6 A.M. with his television show and ending many hours later, when the radio program is completed. ''The TV taping gives my voice a chance to warm up for the radio show,'' he says. ''Doing both in one day also satisfies the dream I always had to find a way to work just one day a week.''
The television show, an abbreviated version of his radio program, has been broadcast for 10 years. This morning, he is wearing one of his trademark richly colored patterned sweaters - this one is a pullover with red and yellow blobs that look like melted 45's, shiny black slacks and reptile-skin shoes with Cuban heels. Kasem drives with the radio off. He doesn't listen to music anymore. When he tapes his show, he listens to special cassettes of the first and last 20 seconds of the songs, so he can get in the right mood. ''If I were doing a real rock show, slapping the phone book in time to the music, grooving with the songs, then it would matter to know how I felt about what I was playing,'' he explains. ''You can't fake it in that situation. But I'm just counting them down as they appear on the chart, 1 through 40. What really matters is what I say between the songs.''
Kasem looks about a decade younger than he is, but without the usual Hollywood preserved-in-amber look that implies tanning salons and plastic surgery. He credits his boyishness to his recently adopted vegetarian diet (no animal products at all). He is 5 feet 6 1/2 inches tall, trim, high-waisted, wiry haired, and has a big forehead, dark eyes, a downturned smile, and a relaxed, dreamy aspect. His voice, in person, sounds like his voice on the radio - reedy, with a light coarseness - although in person he doesn't dip and swoop and pause, as he does on the radio. Self-deprecating humor is a Kasem standard; but in a group of people, he will often be the quietest one.
Kasem's on-air style dates from his days as a disk jockey in Oakland, when the station manager told him to replace the frenetic comedy routines he was deploying between songs with something more low-key. That night, using a book he found in the studio wastebasket with statistics and information about musicians, he started his ''teaser and bio'' technique: before a commercial, he would hint at his next song with an obscure fact about the singer (''Coming up - a song by a musician who credits his success to a rocker named Mick and a barber named Melvin!'') and then, after the break, give the listener the biographical payoff.
''I was drawing on the Arabic tradition of storytelling one-upmanship,'' Kasem says. ''When I was a kid, men would gather in my parents' living room and tell tales and try to outdo each other. I couldn't understand the language, but I was fascinated. And I was way ahead of 'Trivial Pursuit' with my trivia - I was doing trivia before anyone was doing trivia.''
Within months, his show hit No. 1 in Oakland. He still hoped to break into acting, however, so he soon left for KRLA in Los Angeles, to get closer to Hollywood. Again, his show led the market. Soon after, he and Don Bustany, an acquaintance from his Detroit days, approached an upstart broadcasting company called Watermark and proposed that they combine Kasem's teaser-bios with a revamp of the 1940's radio standard ''Your Hit Parade.'' Kasem also proposed a business plan: give the show to radio stations in exchange for a percentage of the commercial time. Thus, all stations could afford to run it, and Watermark could amass a ''network'' of commercial time that could attract national advertisers who are normally reluctant to buy piecemeal radio spots across the country. (This system of ''bartering'' shows has since become the standard in the industry, and accounts for the growth of syndicated radio in the last two decades.) On July 4, 1970, ''American Top Forty'' made its debut on seven stations. ''It's still interesting to me that I came up with an old idea and even language that was archaic, but I believed the idea of the countdown and the appeal of the stories would never die,'' Kasem says. ''It was also a time when everyone was out protesting about Vietnam, and I came along with these tales about the great American possibility of making it. I just felt it was my job to show that there is no easy way to success, and that anyone who gets even just one Top 40 hit deserves their moment in the sun. I accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative. That is the timeless thing.''
What has proved less timeless is Top 40 itself. Top 40 developed in the 1950's and 60's as a term for the most popular pop singles (many radio stations kept 40 songs in their playing rotation). It still exists on the charts, but has given rise to categories for audiences in every demographic bulge: Adult Contemporary (mainstream pop, with heavy metal taken out and crooners like Neil Diamond thrown in); Urban Contemporary (a blending of Top 40 and black acts); Dance Crossover (more dance music, no metal); Rock 40 (more Motley Crue, no Paula Abdul); Oldies (former mainstream hits and occasional new songs); and Album Rock (cuts from albums, some of which may have been released as singles).
In 1967, the enormous success of ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' from which no singles were released, heralded the coming dominance of LP's. By 1987, singles sales appeared to be bottoming out - with few regrets on the part of the record industry, which generally profits on albums only - so the singles charts tracked an ever smaller segment of record buyers, especially compared to the album charts or, with the advent of MTV, video charts. That trend has finally turned: people are once again buying singles, in the form of cassettes, introduced in 1987, and compact-disk singles, introduced a year later. ''Casey's Top Forty,'' using playlists made up by local program directors from all over the country, is played on the whole range of post-Top 40 formatted stations. His 40 songs overlap but rarely ever match any one station's playlist anymore.
Drawing on his years in the business and building on his recent success, Kasem last month started a new daily show. Called ''Casey's Biggest Hits,'' it runs five minutes and features a single hit song from anywhere in the the last 20 years. Before and after the song, Kasem, in his patented style, gives the inside story behind the hit.
THE TAPING OF THE television show goes smoothly, except for one interlude when Kasem begins to fade; the director hollers: ''Come on, Casey, real friendly now! Give me the Dr. Feelgood we all know and love!'' From there, we drive to the Westwood One studios in Culver City. Now one of the largest radio networks in the country (ABC is the biggest), Westwood One provides news, sports, talk and entertainment programming to some 6,000 radio stations. The ''Larry King Show'' and the ''Dr. Demento Show'' are two other popular Westwood One programs.
The terms that got Kasem to Westwood were, obviously, generous. Not surprisingly, the people at ABC consider them insanely generous. Tom Cuddy, until recently ABC Radio Networks vice president of entertainment programming, says some ''American Top Forty'' affiliates have dropped out in the last few years because the show's sound didn't fit with the harder, younger style of many stations. ''They used my show to get stations into their network,'' Kasem says. ''I made them millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars. When they made me an offer to renew, we weren't even in the same ball park.''
When Kasem announced his new show, some radio stations followed him; others decided to stay put and see what would happen. ABC has hired Shadoe Stevens, a tan, handsome former disk jockey and Hollywood Square, to take over ''American Top Forty.'' Both shows now have about the same number of affiliates (over 400) and annual revenue (probably $8 million to $10 million dollars, although the exact figures are not released). The parting of the ways, however disparate the versions of it may be, was gentlemanly. Happily, that is - because when Watermark was bought by ABC in 1982, Kasem received a ''profit participation'' for the lifetime of ''American Top Forty,'' whether he is its host or not. ''I could retire on what I still make from 'American Top Forty,' '' Kasem adds, ''but I wanted to continue on the air. The split with ABC was handled very politely. Shadoe and I won't cancel each other out. We're just a couple of guys working.'' The Westwood One studios do not have the lavish presence one might expect from such a remunerative enterprise. The building is unmarked and drab. Inside, it is functional-looking but crowded. Kasem's two writers, Merrill Shindler and Leonard Pitts Jr., share a narrow office decorated with pictures and letters that have been sent in. (A third writer, Brian Carroll, has recently joined the show.) One letter has been written on a flattened McDonald's french-fries box. Seven or eight cents are also taped up on the wall, income from fans who think they have to pay to get their letter read on the air.
As we walk in, Shindler, Pitts and Kasem's producer, a bearded, excitable radio veteran named Bert Kleinman, are passing out copies of this week's script. It is 85 pages long, has one music-history story (the jukebox's hundredth birthday); four artist stories (why the guitarist for Starship took accordion lessons, why the B-52's are called the B-52's, how the guitarist Vernon Reid was inspired by his barber, and how Janet Jackson used to hide under the bed rather than watch her videos); two listener letters; the trademark introduction (''Hello again, everybody!''); the classic sign-off (''Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars!''), and songs by such acts as Belinda Carlisle, Billy Joel, Kix, Warrant, Roxette, Dino, Soul Sister and Milli Vanilli.
''Did we fix that B-52's story?'' Pitts asks Kleinman. ''I just realized that the B-52 wasn't a World War II bomber.'' Each of the stories - there is an inventory of dozens, ready and waiting for the artist to hit the charts - is edited by Kasem, who has specific rules about what he'll read.
''Songs always move up 'notches,' not 'spots' or 'places,' '' Pitts says to me. ''Songs 'leap' or 'jump' or 'move' up the chart, and they 'fall' or 'drop' or 'slide' down. (''I say 'notch' because I can envision it,'' Kasem once explained. ''I can't see a 'place' or a 'spot.' And I don't want to say a song 'plummets' because that's very negative. It's like saying, This lousy song, which I'm about to play and hope you'll listen to. . . .'') Shindler, who is also an alumnus of ''American Top Forty,'' says: ''In the stories, we emphasize the Horatio Alger aspect - the pluck and luck, the uplifting tales. Casey can sense when a story isn't going to work for him. He talks about himself in third person - he'll say, 'That's not a story Casey would tell.' He has a very strong concept of who this character is that he's spent so many years creating.''
Kasem has settled in the announcer's booth, put on his reading glasses and perused the script. He has said that he doesn't feel old when he's on the radio, and doesn't see the gap between his age and the age of the Top 40 audience as an issue. His contract with Westwood is for five years. He says he would like to be on the radio for 10 or 20 more.
''Ready, Casey?'' Kleinman asks. Kasem nods, and a technician plays the opening jingle - a swell of delicate voices in crowded harmony singing, ''Caaaasey's . . . Top . . . Fooorty!''
''Hello again, everybody, and welcome to 'Casey's Top Forty!' I'm Casey Kasem, and I'm all set to count down the 40 most popular songs in the U.S.A.'' During the taping he is in almost constant motion, using his hands and body for emphasis. He does a low-key lead-in for a pounding rock song, then retapes the lead-in with more appropriate verve. He whips through the second hour of the show, then works for 10 minutes to get the proper emotional reading for a letter from a pregnant girlfriend about her drug-dealing boyfriend.
''Radio is very intimate,'' Kleinman whispers to me as Kasem is reading. ''It's very one-on-one. The most one-on-one this show gets is when Casey reads the letters. It creates the same kind of 'click' that occurs when people relate to great art.''
Soon we are up to No. 1 - Janet Jackson's ''Miss You Much.'' The writers are desperate for Jackson to fall off the charts. Anymore, she rarely gives interviews, so their inventory of Janet stories is perilously low.
When he gets to the story about how she used to hide under her bed, Kasem holds up his hand and says, ''Wait a minute - what is this? This is Mickey Mouse stuff. This doesn't mean a damn thing.'' ''It's about how she overcame her shyness, Casey,'' Kleinman says. ''It's good. I think you should try it again.'' ''O.K., O.K., maybe I'm not giving it the right feel,'' Kasem says, apologetically. He reads it several times to himself, and then tries it a few more times. On the third take, the story has ceased meaning anything and has just become the comfortable buzz of his voice. With that, and his signature sign-off, the session is over. The tapes will be edited, timed, pressed into albums, and shipped overnight to the affiliates.
IT HAS BEEN A LONG week. On Monday, Kasem was the guest host of a local radio talk show. That was the first time we'd met; as I walked into the announcer's booth, he was saying, in that familiar voice, something that interests him more these days than which band has had three No. 1 singles in April: ''O.K., coming up at noon, we'll be talking about the C.I.A. and how it has contributed to deaths all around the world.'' Wouldn't it be tempting for him to lead his own, ''Top 40,'' audiences into some of these muddy waters? ''I don't choose to bring up those issues on the music show,'' he says. ''Simple reason - if it ever looked like I was using the show for other purposes, I would compromise any credibility I have.''
For today, his Top 40 life is attended to, and he wants to get home quickly, because he is setting up a conflict-resolution workshop in Detroit for Arabs and Jews, similiar to the ones he is involved with in Los Angeles. He also has a meeting in a few days of the Cousins Club, an Arab-Jew discussion group that he helped establish. Last weekend, he and Jean and a planeload of other celebrities flew to Washington to participate in a march for the homeless. The Kasems worked on the march for months; their suite in the Beverly Wilshire became the staging site for mailings and volunteer powwows. Kasem calls it ''a great, great experience - my priority these days.'' (When asked about a recent Los Angeles Times article that referred to him and Jean as trendy ''Penthouse Progressives,'' he says: ''I thought it was a nice, tongue-in-cheek thing. I'm glad she wrote about our fund-raiser. And it's good to have a little humor.'') Occasionally, the two parts of his life overlap. When Kasem asked Jesse Jackson to marry him and Jean, Jackson's children warned him that they would disown him if he didn't accept the offer to marry Mr. Radio. Kasem is impressed by Jackson's communication skills. Kasem is, after all, someone who appreciates the art of getting a point across.
Before I leave, he loads me up with a few things he wants me to have: a copy of ''The TV Arab,'' the book that got him thinking about negative Arab stereotypes in the media; a reading list from John Stockwell, a critic of the Central Intelligence Agency; a book about vegetarianism; a can of coffee substitute. I demur; he is amiably and unavoidably insistent.
Just then, the phone rings. Someone is canceling for the Detroit workshop. This is not a positive thing, so Kasem turns on the appeal that gets eight million people listening to him each week. ''I think you should reconsider,'' he says into the phone. ''I think the Detroit thing will be very powerful. We're on the verge of something happening.'' By the time I reach the door, the person on the phone has obviously given in.
At that moment, Casey Kasem looks absolutely pleased. He communicated.

THE POLICE MYSTIQUE
An Insider's Look at Cops, Crime,
and the Criminal Justice System.
By Anthony V. Bouza.
299 pp. New York:
Plenum Press. $23.50. 
''It is better to know nothing,'' the 19th-century humorist Josh Billings used to claim, ''than to know what ain't so.'' Here are two experts on law enforcement who say politicians and the news media are feeding us illusions about crime that not only ain't so but are tearing the country apart. These two fine studies of the crime problem argue that what we think we know about crime is wrong, that the law-and-order approach to crime control is not working and that today's war on crime will produce higher crime rates tomorrow along with ever more intrusive legal scrutiny of our daily lives.
Diana R. Gordon and Anthony V. Bouza draw on their different experiences - Ms. Gordon teaches political science at City College and has worked at the National Council on Crime and Delinquency; Mr. Bouza served in the New York City Police Department for 24 years, ending as commander of the Bronx division, before running the Minneapolis Police Department for nine years - to argue convincingly that the conditions that produce our exceptionally high levels of crime are not, and cannot be, significantly remedied by the machinery of surveillance, apprehension and punishment.
Ms. Gordon's book, ''The Justice Juggernaut,'' based on a staggering amount of research into the current state of law enforcement, tells how the country has come to rely on increasingly comprehensive surveillance to deter crime and to supervise convicts who can no longer be housed in prisons, despite the surge in cell construction (and while the country invests billions building prisons, it cuts off Government support for housing). This surveillance is advertised as a logical response to crime, but the connection, Ms. Gordon maintains, is symbolic. (Her explanation of the symbolism of crime and punishment is fascinating, exhibiting a sound and confident grasp of Durkheim's sociological theory.) When this surveillance fails to reduce crime, as it must, the justice juggernaut's managers claim that the surveillance has not been comprehensive enough, that the next infusion of money, equipment and manpower will do the trick. The result: ''Just as much crime, much more control.''
This reliance on escalating investments in weaponry and manpower creates an analogy to Vietnam that is not lost on Mr. Bouza, whose book, ''The Police Mystique,'' combines a practical guide to police administration with reflections on a lifetime in law enforcement: ''We paid a fearful price for our silences and hypocrisies during the Vietnam war. . . . Our generals should have warned us; instead, they asked for more time, more funding, and more of our children. Our urban generals, even as they bail furiously against an overwhelming tide, should be crying out an alarm warning of the holocaust they clearly see coming.''
In Vietnam, the American military could finally pull out and leave its failures behind. And as the war on crime bogs down hopelessly, Mr. Bouza's ''overclass'' removes itself from American cities. This country's de facto solution to the crime problem is to abandon its cities to criminals and those willing to live with them, or unable to leave. But a civilization is its cities, and the United States' refusal to face the facts about crime has put the country on the verge of having no cities at all.
The film ''Roger and Me'' showed unforgettable scenes of jails rising out of the rubble of General Motors' auto plants, as the prison system replaced the car industry as the biggest employer in Flint, Mich. ''The Justice Juggernaut'' could serve as a commentary on that disturbing documentary, a demonstration of how ''U.S. economic development in recent decades has taken directions that rend community bonds and accentuate economic divisions, looking more like the patterns of 'disruptive development' characteristic of third world countries than like the growth of other advanced industrial societies.'' Both authors argue that in those vast sections of this country from which industry has fled, the poor have gathered and crime has flourished. Society will have to be reconstructed before crime subsides; but, as one of Ms. Gordon's authorities sarcastically observes, ''the system of criminal justice provides a very narrow base from which to launch movements of fundamental social reconstruction.''
These two intellectually stimulating books paint a bleak picture. Ms. Gordon asks: ''What else can be done? Are we doomed to present levels of criminality for the foreseeable future?'' Her answers: ''very little'' and ''probably.'' ''To make major inroads into the crime problem in the United States,'' she says, ''would require changes in both general ideology and political economy that run counter to current trends.''
But waiting for changes in ''general ideology and political economy'' assumes (falsely, I think) that community and a commitment to social justice are impossible within the cultural and economic order the United States has evolved over centuries and which will probably persist in familiar forms far into the future.
Mr. Bouza's outlook is more optimistic and more realistic. He blames the selfish attitudes of the overclass for America's crime-generating social conditions: ''As the underclass has grown and its conditions have worsened, the overclass's fate has been increased prosperity, heightened indifference, and induction into the ranks of the neoconservatives. . . . Increased mobility, anonymity, alienation, and concern for self have ensured that those in a position to remedy society's flaws are too self-absorbed to bother.'' Like the classic English conservatives, Mr. Bouza believes that ''the overclass sets the tone and establishes the moral climate. . . . A nation full of zest and vigor, growing under values that emphasize 'us' rather than 'me,' altruism over hedonism, sacrifice over pleasure, and service over self, will provide for a much safer society than the one we have today, which is fast sinking into dissolution in the pursuit of happiness.''
What is needed, Mr. Bouza says, is enlightened leadership, ''a muse of fire that would touch the public conscience . . . and awaken the nation to the danger of neglecting the fateful problems of its cities.'' The country's police chiefs, he feels, if they would tell the public what they know, could furnish that leadership.
The ritual of crime and punishment - in newspaper headlines and on television screens - has become America's great reality-avoidance mechanism, its all-sufficient substitute for knowledge and thought: let a scapegoat be found, let a culprit be punished, and the public relaxes, confident that the crisis has been surmounted. These two well-informed and intelligent books argue that while newspapers and television bemuse us with police chases and courtroom dramas, the real conditions that make our society unlivable are surging to explosive force beneath our very feet.

AMERICA'S ECONOMIC RESURGENCE
A Bold New Strategy.
By Richard Rosecrance.
230 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $22.50.
A terrible paradox complicates the recent triumph of capitalism. As Richard Rosecrance observes, the American camp has won the cold war but America's own economic performance lags behind most major nations save the Soviet Union. The United States, champion of the free market system, is no economic role model. ''Still,'' writes Mr. Rosecrance, ''international capitalist success gives the United States a breathing space to strengthen its foreign influence by improving its economic and social functioning at home.'' 
How to accomplish this? There are two basic schools of thought. The first, dominated by professional economists, emphasizes macroeconomic factors - improve America's abysmal savings rates, restore fiscal discipline, fight protectionism and let the free market do the rest. The second school, more eclectic, emphasizes a range of messy structural issues - everything from adversarial labor-management relations to managers' short-term perspectives to the American habit of conceiving national security as military rather than economic. For the latter school, the solutions are far more varied, complex and interventionist.
Mr. Rosecrance, a political scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a member of the State Department Policy Planning Council under Lyndon B. Johnson, is emphatically in the second camp. His 1986 book, ''The Rise of the Trading State,'' is an elegant history of how nations that emphasized commercial rather than territorial expansion since the 15th century thrived at the expense of their militarist neighbors. Mr. Rosecrance argues that the new international detente only intensifies the primacy of economics over imperial politics. The United States, he contends, needs to share global political leadership with other nations, then take advantage of the respite to clean up its own economic act - and not just by pursuing budget and trade balance. ''Many poor nations, like Bangladesh, have favorable balances of trade,'' he writes. ''What is important is to achieve a balance in which the United States continues to export highly valued products and the dollar retains enough purchasing power to buy the expensive goods of other nations.''
Mr. Rosecrance worries that America will fail to seize the moment, but he rejects prophecies of irreversible decline. Unlike fallen great powers of earlier times, he writes, ''the United States retains unmatched historic strengths. No hegemonic state in other periods of history remained far ahead of its competitors'' in production or research in pure science, and none ''had almost unlimited investment funds available to it through the contributions of other nations.'' Moreover, he suggests, the current global situation is unique in that no single military successor is waiting in the wings to challenge American primacy. Rather, we fortuitously face the prospect of genuine pluralism. The trick will be adjusting to the opportunity.
In his discussion of the coming era of global pluralism, Mr. Rosecrance examines possible roles for post-Communist Russia and explores at great length the imperative of close collaboration between the United States and Japan. He persuasively argues that Japan's role as free rider on the global economic system imposes serious costs on the United States. His Japan chapter is richly detailed, and full of good insights. However, he all but ignores the other emerging great economic power - the European Community.
Mr. Rosecrance offers two possible prospects for the next decade. In the first, the United States continues to emphasize a defense-oriented foreign policy and fails to think like a trading state or achieve fundamental economic change; a decade or so from now, we wake up to find that we have become a Japanese economic protectorate, with declining living standards and dwindling global influence. In the second, both the United States and Japan accept drastic change. Japan truly internationalizes, assumes global responsibilities and becomes a more open, consumer-oriented society. The United States adjusts to a peacetime world order, sheds military burdens and shifts gears to reclaim its economic standing.
This is a very useful framework for understanding the crossroads we now face. Mr. Rosecrance is on strongest ground when he builds on ''The Rise of the Trading State,'' which remains the more powerful book. Unfortunately, the present book has two major weaknesses. Mr. Rosecrance is better at exploring the dynamics of the American situation in the world than at making fresh contributions to the debate about what we need to do at home. He would like us to cut military spending, revise the tax code to stimulate long-term investment, reward thrift, encourage more reciprocal relations between workers and managers, improve education, cut bureaucracy, discourage hostile corporate takeovers and so on. Much of this is familiar, and abbreviated. In this part of his book, Mr. Rosecrance leans heavily on other recent works.
The second weakness is uneven and occasionally redundant writing. Though Mr. Rosecrance covers a lot of ground in a brief book, the nice sense of a carefully worked essay isn't consistently sustained. At his best, he offers the reader the impression of a lively mind that has inquired widely, gleaned and distilled. At his worst, his prose reads like a first draft. In its concluding section, the book virtually peters out into three rather skimpy chapters that veer back and forth between optimism and despair.
Still, if the details are patchy and the writing is uneven, the framework is exactly right and the argument worth reading. Mr. Rosecrance is a good antidote to Paul Kennedy's best seller, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers.'' As he points out, states have often recovered from seemingly terminal decline, and victors in great wars have sometimes done just fine, if they were able to manage timely shifts from garrison economies to commercial ones. As a student of social structure, international relations and economic history, Mr. Rosecrance is also a good corrective to the simplistic school that sees America's economic woes as merely macroeconomic. On his basic point, there is little doubt that the 1990's will be remembered as a time when the United States either rose to the occasion and took advantage of its great economic resilience - or struggled anachronistically to play Atlas and sank into long-term decline.
 
STASHING IT
 Edwin Green, the archivist of Britain's Midland Bank, does an exhaustive job of summarizing the development of banking over the centuries in BANKING: An Illustrated History (Rizzoli, $40). But his style is that of an encyclopedist rather than that of a storyteller. The saga plods on and on, providing lots of information but generally failing to give a sense of the drama behind the facts. It devotes about one sentence, for example, to the collapse and the Government's rescue of Chicago's Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in 1984: how some of America's most powerful and arrogant bankers bought more than $1 billion in wildcatter loans from the tiny Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City, and how they were seduced into making those purchases by a Penn Square officer who entertained them by tossing food across restaurants and drinking beer out of boots. Those loans, of course, went bad, causing Continental's collapse and threatening the soundness of the American banking system. But Mr. Green gives us no feeling for the human element that was part of that and every banking story. Such lapses might be expected in most histories of banking. But the dullness of this account is heightened by contrast with the book's rich and colorful illustrations. These range from elegant prints of the baroque banking halls of Europe to a 1916 cartoon by Olaf Guldbransson of J. Pierpont Morgan's ''mountain of gold.'' ''Banking: An Illustrated History'' is more successful as a glossy coffeetable book than as a history of banking.

SCALE AND SCOPE
The Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism.
By Alfred D. Chandler Jr.
860 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
The Belknap Press/
Harvard University Press. $35.
Why does industrial capitalism produce sufficient physical goods readily, when the 20th century's major alternative, industrial socialism of the Soviet variety, cannot? Because of the existence of private property and the way modern capitalist industrial companies are organized - and that organization resulted from a certain historical process, which is the subject of Alfred D. Chandler Jr.'s new book. Serious students of the worldwide industrialization that occurred in the century between the 1870's and the 1970's are indebted to Mr. Chandler, a historian of business at Harvard University, for a lifetime of determined effort to find order and predictable processes in industrial history. 
His previous books, ''Giant Enterprise,'' ''Strategy and Structure'' and ''The Visible Hand'' are justly celebrated. And his work has inspired similar work internationally; he has changed our understanding of the ''second industrial revolution'' in the past century.
This achievement is now augmented by ''Scale and Scope.'' Here Mr. Chandler turns to the history of (essentially) the top 200 manufacturing companies in the United States, Britain and Germany during roughly the half-century after 1880, when modern capitalism, centered on giant industrial companies of international scope, entered world history. The lessons of this experience are finally applied (briefly) as an analytical outline to developments during and after World War II.
For Mr. Chandler, modern industry's most vital element is its management organization. To some this may be a truism, but it has not been so for many, because of a certain historical bias American scholars commonly have: a deep prejudice against big business, its founders, its leaders and all its works. The prejudice came mainly from the antibusiness populism of the late 19th century, nourished and augmented by 20th-century leftish intellectual fashions. Leaders of very large businesses (''malefactor[s] of great wealth,'' as President Theodore Roosevelt labeled the railroad magnate Edward Harriman) in this view have been enemies of the people, economic royalists, environmental pirates - almost a criminal class.
Furthermore, large companies were and are considered antisocial because of their tendencies to create monopolistic organization of markets. Academic economists, who should understand these extraordinary business organisms within the wider economy, have considered them to be largely irrelevant. The prevailing neoclassical analytical model views individual businesses solely as production functions, without history, character or social utility. Individual businesses really don't matter in that abstract world.
An alternative view is that entrepreneurship is a necessary ingredient in a dynamic economy and profits are socially desirable. The ways our big companies have grown, located themselves and developed have necessarily suited the wishes of their customers (and ultimate rulers), the American people. The great companies, by absorbing the costs of doing business, have made possible a productive economy that could not otherwise exist. The American economy could not be made up of mom-and-pop businesses.
Mr. Chandler's work has strengthened support for this alternative view, but that achievement is incidental. He has rarely concentrated on the ideological ferment that surrounds his special interest, big businesses and their techniques of internal governance. He has been satisfied to discover the structures and evolution of the great businesses. It has been an exercise in inductive scientific technique -powerful and, in its sphere, definitive.
In ''Scale and Scope'' he moves into international comparisons. His findings may be simplified in the following way. Technological advances (especially the revolutions in transportation and communications) by the 1870's made it possible for a new phenomenon, the giant corporation, to appear. It tended to be (but was not always) vertically integrated; it developed a tightly organized professional management; and its vitality was fed by continuous expansion, either by economies of large-scale production or by diversification, which spread out the costs of the large and capital-intensive organization. In 1865, railroads apart, such enterprises were unknown. By 1900 they dominated the industrial world.
The growth of such companies was based on a certain pattern of investment strategy that Mr. Chandler calls ''three-pronged'': first, the construction of capital-intensive production facilities on a large scale; then the development of ''product specific'' marketing, distribution and purchasing; and finally, establishment of an integrated professional management team capable of controlling and continuing the company's life. The initial acts - perception of opportunity and creation of the physical production plant - always required entrepreneurship. Cost-reducing economies of scale and scope have been so pervasive that up to our own time most of the original giants in the manufacturing industries remain among the leaders. To illustrate the validity of his generalizations, Mr. Chandler supplies counterexamples, including a particularly lucid description of United States Steel, where failure of management squandered an initial market advantage produced by its great entrepreneurs, Andrew Carnegie and J. Pierpont Morgan.
Depending on historical conditions, which Mr. Chandler carefully spells out (including such policy variables as the American antitrust laws), the great companies at first expanded by vertical or horizontal integration. By internal organization or by external alliances (deals) management guaranteed a flow of supplies and sufficient markets to justify high enough production to achieve low unit costs (traditionally, economists concentrated on output, but Mr. Chandler insisted on accounting for the entire cycle, which he calls ''throughput''). Monopoly organization of markets tended to give way to oligopolies that tried to control markets though linkages backward to all the resources used in production and forward to all the elements that go into marketing the product. Companies continued their growth by diversification, overseas investment, research and development of new products, or by mergers, depending upon a number of critical variables Mr. Chandler spells out for each kind of industry in each country. These are verified and tested by the specific histories of 600 giant companies he examines (this analysis is a compelling empirical achievement).
Creation of professional management to plan and execute such endeavors usually separated ownership from control, removing the descendants of the original founders from operating authority, with some notable exceptions. In Britain there were a few huge companies, but the economy was dominated mainly by a host of small ones, and owners tended to maintain control. American companies rarely used direct banker participation in management; German companies more often did. Germans concentrated on specialization in heavy machinery and tools; Americans excelled in both capital and consumer goods, and the British were heavily concentrated in consumer goods. The famous (and much-debated) relative decline of industrial Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was due, in Mr. Chandler's opinion, to the British failure to install modern management techniques, largely for reasons peculiar to the British social system. This is not a new idea, but Mr. Chandler's research makes it much less contestable than it recently has been.
By the 1970's about half of all the giant companies in the world were still of American origin. It is incidental, but useful, that Mr. Chandler's analysis helps to explain the new industrial giants - Japanese, Taiwanese and Korean - and their participation in the American economy both by trade and investment. They are doing now what we, the British and the Germans did earlier. These new players are now leaders in the continuing world industrialization. Successful industrialization in the capitalist West, which grew and developed in the patterns Mr. Chandler has revealed, illuminates the relative failure of Soviet-style industrialization. Although Mr. Chandler does not himself discuss this comparison, it is clear enough that Soviet manufacturing companies could not have made the ''three-pronged'' investment in their centrally planned economy. Whatever they were to achieve, they would not be like Du Pont in America, Lever Brothers in Britain or Siemens in Germany.
Mr. Chandler neatly explains the influence of the American antitrust laws on the growth patterns of American companies, and of the European laws that allowed companies to freely integrate and form cartels. He does not discuss extensively the nearly simultaneous rise of the nemesis and counterpart of big business, the huge expansion of Government economic activity, in the European countries, where by now around half of all expenditure is public, either by transfer payments or net purchases.
The conflicts that produced the modern welfare state (and works like Karl Polanyi's ''Great Transformation'' to explain it) and the drive for ''social justice'' have not been Mr. Chandler's major interests. That is for other hands. Mr. Chandler started out years ago to make sense out of the transformation of capitalist enterprise caused by the growth of giant industrial companies, a history that long had been almost exclusively the province of muckrakers, social reformers, revolutionaries, propagandists, apologists and ideologists of all stripes. He has succeeded with a power and authority that will not soon be matched.

HEADLINE: CARS;
Comeback of Sorts Emerging at VW

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
You have seen the word: Fahrvergnugen.
It is pronounced far-fair-GNU-gen, and Volkswagen says it means ''pleasurable driving experience.'' The word is the major focus of an advertising campaign and it also means the start of Volkswagen's effort to come back in the United States.
True, the company has never really been away. But it is no secret that the name once synonymous with ''import'' has fallen on hard times. 
Twenty years ago VW was selling almost 600,000 cars in this country, and it was the first foreign automaker to open a plant on these shores. Today, the plant in Westmoreland, Pa., is closed and Volkswagen sales have dropped about 70 percent.
There are a number of reasons for that, and not all of them can be laid at the feet of the Japanese.
For a very long time, Volkswagen had everything its own way. The Beetle was golden and the Rabbit was a worthy successor. Then came a series of uninspired and ever-more-expensive Dashers, Quantums and Sciroccos. And the dealers, who had become fat and arrogant, contributed to the problem.
All the same, the West German company and its subsidiaries, Audi and Seat, remain the fourth-largest producer in the world, behind General Motors, Ford and Toyota. And its executives are raring to renew the effort here - as well as in Eastern Europe, which most manufacturers regard as newly fertile ground.
Peter Fischer, Volkswagen of America's executive director of marketing, had a lot to say about both pursuits when he was in New York recently with his company's lineup for 1990.
The cars were arrayed on the terrace at Tavern on the Green in Central Park, making a palette of sparkling reds, yellows and teals. The high points were the new and very fast Corrado sports coupe and the roomy Passat sedan, and Fischer said VW is going back to its roots by keeping prices comfortable.
Regarding Eastern Europe, Fischer said, the rush toward democracy and free-market economies has captured corporate attention in a big way because developments have greatly increased the potential for growth, and he noted that VW is particularly well placed.
''Since the end of World War II,'' he said, ''Volkswagen headquarters in Wolfsburg, West Germany, has been at the far eastern edge of Western Europe, just five miles from the Iron Curtain. Now, suddenly, our world headquarters has been relocated to the center of Europe.''
In all of Eastern Europe, Fischer said, years of Communist rule have produced an average of only one new-car sale each year for every 10 in the United States.
Here, that has added up to nearly 500 cars for every 1,000 people. In Eastern Europe, on the other hand, the ratio has ranged from a low of 43 cars per thousand people in Romania to a high of 216 cars per thousand in East Germany.
Excluding Russia, Fischer said, there are 113 million people in Eastern European countries, nearly half as many as in the European Community. And if the demand in Russia increased to just 100 units per 1,000 population, it would mean another 12 million sales a year.
Only a few months ago, Fischer said, people who wanted to buy a Trablant - a small car that has become a gray symbol of lackluster East Germany - had to wait 16 years to take delivery.
''Now,'' he said, ''virtually no one in East Germany wants a Trablant because they would rather buy a used car from the West. So, in a matter of weeks, the waiting period in East Germany has gone from 16 years to zero.''
Western Europe and Asia have overtaken America as the centers of automotive production, Fischer said, and the European Community will become the world's largest market when trade barriers are dropped at the end of 1992, as planned.
''After 1992,'' he said, ''the 12 member-nations of the European Community will be the largest free-trading bloc in the industrialized world, with an estimated 325 million consumers, compared with 246 million in the United States and 122 million in Japan.
''We expect to see good growth in Asia and in Eastern Europe, which raises a provocative question: If the VW group has so much going for it in Europe, why should it care what happens to Volkswagen and Audi in the United States?''
The answer, he said, is simple. No matter what happens elsewhere, Americans love cars. The United States remains the world's richest and most competitive market. It is an important place for Fahrvergnugen.

Do-It-Yourselfers as General Contractors

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
A SOPHISTICATED breed of householder who can oversee the building of a home without general contractors or architects is evolving through a fusion of do-it-yourself, building materials supermarkets and a tightened economy.
More of them than ever before are expected in the 90's, according to Allan Brophy, a coordinator at the North Haven store of Home Depot, an expanding chain of building-supply supermarkets.
''Wealthy people will always hire architects and general contractors,'' he said, ''but the middle class is getting very adventurous about doing without them.''
Consider Janice and John Contessa, who bought a 3-acre site on Currituck Road in Newtown last year for $110,000 cash and took bids on mail-order plans for a 3-bedroom, 2-bath home. When estimates came in at $200,000 to $250,000, minus finished floors, tile, sunroom and, in some cases, septic system and well, they decided to be their own contractors and part-time laborers. 
They cleared the land last summer, began construction in October and in March moved into their new 4 1/2-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath house with a 42-foot-long living-room, a septic system, well and custom-made windows. Materials were better than those in the estimates, which included the contractor's profit and a 20 percent cushion. They spent $140,000, within 2 percent of their budget, and got more house for considerably less than contractors would have charged.
Spending weekends installing insulation, tarring foundations and sweeping out rainwater, and appearing weekdays at 7 A.M., noon and 5 P.M. to clean up after the workmen, run errands and discuss problems was exhausting, said Mrs. Contessa.
''It's a source of immense satisfaction to see what you've accomplished,'' she said, adding, ''I would not recommend it to anyone with a shaky marriage.''
Neither Mr. Contessa, an education director for the Society of Plastics Engineers in Brookfield, nor his wife, an accountant with the Duracell Company in Bethel, had building experience, but ''we are very organized planners,'' they said.
After studying more than 100 estimates and holding countless interviews, they hired 20 subcontractors. Their 2-inch-thick project notebook is subdivided into banks, phone numbers, plumbing, garage doors, sheetrock, foundation, framing, heating, stairs, building codes, kitchen, materials and so on.
''Everyone is a specialist,'' said Mrs. Contessa. ''The framing carpenters don't do stairs. It took five trades to install the garage doors.''
Because their land was in an approved subdivision they did not need zoning approval, but they checked with an architect before applying for a building permit. ''He told us we didn't need him,'' said Mr. Contessa, who made the drawings for the basement following the architect's free advice.
''On new individual houses, people doing their own contracting run at about 50 percent,'' said Richard Hornibrook, the town's assistant building inspector. ''They can do electrical work, plumbing, foundations without a license, as long as they pass building code inspections, but insurance companies frown on it.''
The Contessas used electricians, plumbers, framers, sheetrock installers and foundation contractors who called for town inspections at appropriate times. An inspection of the septic line was missed and the buried pipes had to be exposed in frigid weather before a use permit could be obtained. A state building codes book is available for $45 through local building departments.
Having to establish credit with multiple suppliers was bypassed by dealing with the Home Depot in North Haven, where the Contessas bought 80 percent of their materials. New to the Northeast, the 10-year-old chain of building materials supermarkets based in Atlanta did $2.8 billion in net sales last year in its 100 stores across the nation. The company hires former building trades professionals who can teach customers how to fix, install or construct anything for the home and garden - and who make free house calls.
JAMES ZANTOS, who worked with the Contessas, said: ''Their plans were for cement block construction rather than frame lumber. The rafter sizes were wrong, there was no basement, no attic space for heating ducts and no materials list, required for a building permit.''
Mr. Contessa said that Mr. Zantos, a former builder, ''drew up the list, and on his own time he sat with us for hours in restaurants going over the plans, giving us information and listening to our ideas.'' Several times, he said, Mr. Zantos drove the 40-odd miles to Newtown to provide on-site assistance.
The 105,000-square-foot North Haven store opened in 1989 with 170 employees. Another store opened in Berlin in January, a third will open in Fairfield in October and 75 more are planned in the Northeast by 1995.
Among 40,000 items carried are appliances, bathrooms, carpeting, cement block, fencing, flooring, furnaces, hardware, kitchens, lighting fixtures, machine tools, pool accessories, roofing, siding, tractors, trees, water heaters and windows.
''We don't recommend contractors but they can post their business cards on our bulletin board,'' said David Foster, the North Haven manager. There is a book section for construction plans and a computer-generated kitchen design section where customers get a free printout of their plan worked out to room measurements, plus a materials list and cost estimate.
The Contessas took their 10.5 percent construction loan from Center Bank of Waterbury. ''We had no trouble qualifying because we owned the land,'' said Mrs. Contessa, ''but if we defaulted the bank could take the property.''
Periodic interest payments were made as the 4-month construction period proceeded, and inspections of each phase were required before additional funds were released. The loan will now be converted to a conventional mortgage at a lower rate.
''Most banks will give construction loans only to general contractors or building trades people putting up their own homes,'' said Brenda Corbo, a Center Bank loan officer, ''but more and more people are doing it themselves and we make exceptions when a customer has been a homeowner, has collateral and is able to handle cost overruns. The maximum we will lend is 70 percent of the combined value of land and house.''

HEADLINE: Buying a Home May Still Beat Renting

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
CARL COCHRANE was introduced to the hard realities of today's sagging real estate market when he decided to sell his town house in Edison, N.J., and take a new job in Dallas.
Mr. Cochrane had paid $142,700 for the house three years ago, at the very peak of the housing price boom. Early last fall, when he moved, the price of similar houses had dropped at least $5,000; he tried to sell to get back his purchase price, but nobody even came to look.
So, looking back, it might seem that Mr. Cochrane would have been better off renting in Edison and postponing a house purchase until prices eased. Such a thought, seditious as it may seem in a culture where home ownership comes right after life and liberty in the scale of values, resurfaces as a new idea every time there is a market slump: Don't buy; rent. 
But despite the slack market that seemed to put Mr. Cochrane at the short end of his housing investment, there is broad agreement among financial analysts, university economists and the corner real estate broker that housing still remains the average person's soundest financial investment. And that advice holds true, the experts say, even in a time like the present, when residential properties have stopped appreciating or are falling in value.
Unless someone has a sharply below-market rental property, such as a rent-regulated apartment in New York City, the tax advantages of ownership for a middle-income family outweigh the return one could get by investing a down payment in securities and renting instead. Only buying a house for a short term in a highly cyclical, single-industry market - like energy-dependent Houston or Denver - could produce serious net losses to homeowners, the experts say.
The notion that the whole country may be facing such a long-term decline in housing values got a lot of attention lately because of a paper delivered last December by a Harvard economist, N. Gregory Mankiw, and one of his graduate students, David N. Weil. It forecast a 3 percent annual decline in value for America's housing over the next decade because of the aging of the baby boomers and the relative scarcity of new home-buying families coming along behind them.
The Mankiw/Weil paper came just as the impact of a softening real estate market was shattering the rosy - some say greedy - expectations of endlessly rising values in the Boston and New York metropolitan regions, the hottest East Coast markets. Stagnant or even slightly falling prices there seemed to many to have found their gloomy explanation in the Harvard paper, which was widely cited in news reports while drawing storms of protest and counter-arguments from the home-building and home-selling industries, as well as more tempered criticism from the researchers' academic colleagues and from Wall Street analysts.
These critics argue that the country's housing market has more parts in its growth motor than just birth rates and age distributions. Land prices, regional differences, inventories of unsold homes and the home-buying habits of the middle-aged and elderly are just as important in divining the future of the market, they say. And, they add, the tax advantages of homeownership, not to mention the psychological attachment people have to owning a home and the simple value of having a place to live, similarly influence market decisions by buyers.
''People are pretty adaptive,'' said William C. Apgar Jr., associate professor of government at Harvard and assistant director of that university's Joint Center on Housing Studies. ''They have this goal of home ownership in mind, and if they have to two-step their way toward it, they will.''
It was by two-stepping that Mr. Cochrane got to the happy ending - or at least to a happy middle - of his story. Unable to sell his Edison property, he rented it. The $1,100 rent is less than the mortgage payment, but it is $300 more than the carrying charges for his new town house in Dallas, which - at today's Texas bargain rates for houses - cost only $50,000, about half its price when new a decade ago.
''SO in spite of everything, it made sense for me to buy it,'' Mr. Cochrane said of his Edison town house. ''I may be losing two or three hundred a month on a cash basis, but what I'm making on the rent is paying my living expenses here. And because it's a rental, I can convert any loss on the sale to a business loss for tax purposes.''
If Mr. Cochrane has so far finessed the bad hops a housing market can take, the man he bought from in Texas should probably have stayed away; Mr. Cochrane was told the seller had to bring $20,000 extra to the closing table to pay off the mortgage when Mr. Cochrane bought the house.
Mr. Cochrane had the benefit of having had the down payment for a second house while his first one was unsold, as well as of moving to a cheaper housing market. And he was disappointed in not being able to buy the big house he wanted in Dallas because of the remaining equity tied up in the Edison property.
The final act in his drama will not be played out until next spring, when he plans to put the Edison town house on the market again. ''That's when we will find out if I should have bought it in the first place,'' he said.
If the town house sells, Mr. Cochrane will put the money into the 3,000-square-foot, four-bedroom house he wants and put the Dallas condominium on the rental market. He picked its location, across the street from Southern Methodist University campus, with the future rental market in mind.
Mr. Cochrane's experience underscores the point that real estate experts always get around to when the buy/don't buy question is put to them: The decision is basically a matter of market analysis, and the better the analyst, the better the investment.
''If an individual is real good at picking the market, I would advise him to hold off buying until about 20 minutes before the next boom,'' Professor Apgar remarked. ''But people don't tend to adjust house-buying the way they buy stocks, so you're left with the fact that the people who have done best are the people who have owned all along, because in the long run a house holds its value, it makes a decent return and in the meantime you can live in it.''
A STUDY by the National Association of Home Builders shows how housing has held its value compared to stock market investments. It found that the market value of median-priced homes in America rose by just over 300 percent in the 70's and 80's, while the Dow Jones industrial average, a common indicator of stock market performance, climbed just under 250 percent. Moreover, houses outperformed the Dow's basket of industrial stocks every year in those two decades.
Professor Apgar said that the elements that will drive the housing market of the future have diversified over the last few decades. Americans are breaking out of old house-owning patterns that saw couples buy early, trade up in lock-step with others of their generation when the kids came along, then sell the house after retirement to have income for their later years.
''Generational changes have become much more tapered,'' Professor Apgar said. ''Go to a 25th college reunion and look at where the people are in their marriage and life cycle these days. You've got people with babies by their second wives or husbands, and you've got people with high school kids. It's much more diffuse.''
Moreover, he said, the middle-aged graduate's parents are not behaving as they once did, mainly because of the increased wealth of the elderly, a wealth derived in part from the high value of their paid-for houses.
''There's a lot of kick left in the elderly house-buyers,'' he said. ''They're still buying, their ownership rates are still climbing. The tradition was that they would give up their house to the next buyer, but they are not doing that. They are either hanging on to their house or they're moving into a fairly expensive new one, maybe in a resort community, because they are not constrained to downscale and they don't have to sell out to maintain their income security.''
But if middle-aged trade-up buyers and their aged parents are still able to drive their sectors of the market, demographics do argue for caution in the housing industry's sick ward, the entry-level condominium town house and its country cousin, the mobile home. These have lately become typical starter homes for first-time buyers on the populous East and West Coasts.
People aged 18 to 24 are usually the main customers for the least expensive housing, and as their numbers decline - as the Mankiw/Weil study notes - demand for such housing is also likely to decline relative to the explosive condominium market that developed after the 1983 recession.
These units were also the most heavily overbuilt, particularly the condominium town houses, several experts pointed out. Their prices will fall, or they will become rental units, as Mr. Cochrane's town house has, until prices reach a level affordable to the lower-middle-class home-seeker who has so far been unable to buy.
''When prices started to double, every lawyer became a developer,'' said Karl E. Case, professor of economics at Wellesley College and a Visiting Scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, where he does research on housing economics.
''I mean, I can't tell you how many people I knew who were in some other business until the boom came along, and who then decided to start building condos,'' he said. ''Because the feeling was, the only thing dumber than not owning a house was not owning two houses.''
Many of those condominium developers are now in trouble, and developers behave differently from individual homeowners, said Professor Apgar, picking up the thread of the analysis.
''Developers will slash their prices when they get into trouble, just to sell out,'' he said. ''But your basic homeowner will just sit tight and ride it out.''
SINCE condominium town houses of a certain price range tend to be alike, a hard downward action on prices by a desperate developer, even one in the next development or the next town, will undermine the value of a privately held unit, he said. This argues for caution in buying into the overbuilt condominium market, unless the discount is so great - like the 50 percent off the original price that Mr. Cochrane paid for his new Dallas home - that the price is close to replacement cost.
Some areas are more overbuilt than others, for the real estate broker's dictum that location is everything applies on a national level, too. Barbara Allen, vice president and housing analyst of the Kidder, Peabody & Company brokerage house, put it succinctly in a recent housing market analysis: ''Any house costs more in California than in Kansas.''
Developers and brokers have long charged that the antigrowth movements that swept some of the country's most booming regions, and particularly California and New England, in recent years have had the effect, perhaps intended by antigrowth forces, of protecting the value of homes already in place and of making land for development scarce and expensive.
Thus, Professor Case explained, while Boston and Houston both went into their respective booms with about a million housing units each, Boston developers managed to add only about 75,000 new units during the 1982-87 boom years, a 7 percent increase in supply, while Houston's wide-open zoning allowed developers to put up 250,000 new units in about the same number of years, an increase of 25 percent in the total stock.
Moreover, many New York City residents have a different reason to keep renting instead of buying - rent regulation.
''If you have an extraordinary rental situation, because of rent controls or the type of economic environment you have in Houston where they give you a year's free rent to sign the lease, you might want to sit tight and wait a while before you buy,'' said Ms. Allen.
THAT describes the situation of Helen Downey, head of the Helen Downey Company, a Manhattan real estate brokerage. She could have bought her three-bedroom East 78th Street penthouse when the building went co-op a few years back, she said, but her regulated rent was $1,200 a month and the maintenance alone for the co-op would have been $3,000.
''Why should I buy it?'' Mrs. Downey asked. ''It just didn't make sense.''
But other tenants in that kind of conversion situation might have viewed it differently. Tax deductions for mortgage interest and real estate taxes substantially cut the monthly maintenance charges on co-op apartments, bringing them closer to regulated rents. And buying their apartments at an insider's price, inanany cases 30 to 40 percent below market value, offers tenants the opportunity to make a big gain on a subsequent sale.
For most would-be buyers, the choice is clearly on the side of ownership even in a flat market because of the deductibility of mortgage interest and real estate taxes, Professor Case said. That argument was reinforced by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated many tax shelters but left the deductibility of housing taxes and mortgage interest payments.
''I don't think people should just think of their house as an investment, although the way the market has been going, a lot of people certainly do that,'' said Ms. Allen, the financial analyst. ''But if they do see it only that way, they should consider the tax advantages of ownership. After I read the tax reform law - and I am a fairly tax-conscious person - I knew that the best thing for me to do was to buy the biggest house I could feel financially comfortable with, and then when my husband and I get ahead a little bit, to buy another one for vacations.''
Pinpointing the 20 minutes before prices start taking off again - if ever - prompts Professor Case to make a case for realism in price expectations for the next few years.
To the extent that the decline in the number of young first-time buyers will have an impact, he said, their decline comes during a down cycle in the housing industry, a result of overbuilding and a slowing in local economies, particularly in new job creation. This combination prompts Professor Case to predict a slow real estate market in the Northeast through 1992.
''But there are some things that make you more optimistic about this region in the long term,'' he said. ''For one thing, our economies are a lot more diversified than 15 years ago, when New York was broke and Boston was too. Nowadays we look a lot more like the rest of the nation, so it's hard to believe that we will do a lot worse than the rest of the country.''
 
HOW TAX BENEFITS HELP BUYERS
CALL your house a shelter and you are saying a mouthful, because following the Tax Reform Act of 1986, personal dwellings - including vacation homes - constitute by far the largest category of income tax shelters available to Americans. Income is sheltered when people buy their houses, as they pay for them, and when they sell them. It is these tax benefits that give owning a home an edge over renting one for most American families.
At the time of purchase, the tax code treats the mortgage loan origination fees or points paid to the bank as a mortgage cost and they are thus deductible from taxable income. The mortgage interest itself is the biggest tax shelter, especially in the early years of the mortgage because the interest tends to be front-loaded on a loan, meaning that deductions of about 90 percent of mortgage payments can be made during early years of ownership.
So even in a market with no year-to-year rise in housing values, a mortgage deduction can produce handsome returns. A $1,000 monthly mortgage payment will produce about $10,800 in deductions from income duringthe early years. For a family of four with a $50,000 annual income that deduction alone reduces the tax burden from $7,744 to $4,720, a savings of $3,024. Add to that the deductibility of local real estate taxes and the tax benefits of ownership increase still more.
Finally, the tax code allows owners to roll over capital gains on a home so long as they buy a new primary residence within 24 months of the sale of their previous home and the new one costs as much or more than the old one.
Homeowners thus typically roll over their housing capital gains until they pass the age of 55. At that point, the Government allows them a once-in-a-lifetime exclusion of $125,000 on the gains. This exclusion allows many families to escape taxes on capital gains entirely. Others use the exclusion to substantially reduce their gains tax liability. If a home is sold at a loss, however, the loss is not deductible. - IVER PETERSON

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: 182 Manhattan Units;
Housing The Poor

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
Three new construction projects that will use $15 million in state funds to build 182 apartments in Manhattan have been approved by the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal as part of its $128 million program for fast-track housing for low-income and homeless people. The program was started last year as an effort to cut red tape and accelerate the development of new apartment projects in areas lacking affordable housing. Some of the units are earmarked for the elderly and the disabled.
Richard L. Higgins, Commissioner of the housing agemcy, said: ''Our aim has been to expedite construction, and indeed of the 11 awards made a year ago seven are already being built, while construction of three others will start within the month.''
The program, the Turnkey/Enhanced Housing Trust Fund, was started in 1988 as a means of providing 1,300 apartments as fast as possible. Projects are transferred to nonprofit corporations after construction. The projects in Manhattan are at 111 East 117th Street near Park Avenue, 202 West 146th Street at Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 258 East Fourth Street near Avenue B.

BURR SISTERS
Forty paintings by a pair of unknown 19th-century artists from Monroe are on exhibition to June 10 at the New Britain Museum of American Art. The show, ''The Burr Sisters,'' was assembled by Helen Fusscas of the Connecticut Gallery in Marlborough, which has acquired a substantial portion of the sisters' 700 works. The remainder is in private collections.
''The family called us about paintings in their attic,'' said Ms. Fusscas, ''and I thought they were enchanting.'' Executed from 1870 to the turn of the century, ''they tell a story about women artists of the period who had better opportunities for studying and exhibiting than we thought,'' she said. 
Fannie and Jennie Burr attended the Yale Art School, where most of the students were women before it offered a baccalaureate degree and attracted men. They studied at the Art Students League in Manhattan, where most of their fellow students were also women, and they exhibited at the American Watercolor Society, the Art Club of New York, both in Manhattan, and the Brooklyn Art Association.
Neither of them married. The fruit farm they inherited from their father flourished under their stewardship, and they they profited immensely from it and from a series of shrewd investments. ''They had the talent to become well-known artists,'' said Ms. Fusscas, ''but they were busy managing the farm and the money.''
The exhibition includes landscapes, still lifes and portraits in oils, watercolors and charcoal. ''The technique is quite contemporary and realistic with a light palette,'' she said. Prices, through the Connecticut Gallery, are $800 to $5,000. Museum hours in New Britain are 1 to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Sunday. Call 229-0257 for more information.
 
HOUSE TOUR
''By Design,'' the University of Hartford Art School Auxiliary's annual house tour, focuses on homes owned by eight interior designers living and working in the Hartford area. The tour, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. on Saturday, includes tea and a student art show on the Bloomfield Avenue campus.
A large Colonial owned by Sharyn Haymond was built 75 years ago by the architect Walter Crabtree, modeled after George Washington's home at Mount Vernon in Virgina. Margot MacDermid's English country house has a whitewashed stone facade, an interior that carries out the theme in English chintz and a big family kitchen with a fireplace.
A tiny 19th-century cottage owned by Kathleen Marr is decorated in eclectic style with Chinese art objects, while Susan Perl's traditional family home is a Dutch Colonial. One of two contemporary houses belongs to Marjorie Aronson, who added a curved glass entrance. The other is a classic ranch on which Athena Economou has lavished her interest in fabric.
James Healy made some of the furniture for his Cape Cod and painted faux marble fireplaces and crown moldings in some of the rooms. The final house is a Georgian Colonial owned by Betsey Cotter. Tickets are $12.50 in advance or $15 on tour day. Call 243-4393.
 
DEATH WITH DIGNITY
Walter Russell, probate judge from Windsor, will talk at 10 A.M. Saturday on conservatorship and issues relating to the elderly and infirm at an open meeting of The Connecticut Hemlock Society. The year-old chapter of the nonprofit national organization based in Eugene, Ore., has a membership of 300 Connecticut households.
The society's philosophy centers on death with dignity, and its purpose is to provide information about living wills and powers of attorney and to explore the options for active and passive euthanasia.
The meeting will be held in the Farmington Public Library, 6 Monteith Drive. Admission is free and more information is available by calling 325-1869 or 673-6695.
 
HORSES AND RIDERS
A total of $130,000 in prize money will be awarded in various events at the Annual Children's Services Horse Show and Country Fair at the Polo Grounds in Farmington. More than 1,000 horses and riders will compete from Tuesday to next Sunday in events ranging from the $2,500 Jumper Futurity Class to the $35,000 Grand Prix. A $7,500 Grand Slam of Show Jumping Award will go to two horse-and-rider teams accumulating the most points during the show.
Among the riders will be Barney Ward of Brewster, N.Y., two-time champion at the National Horse Show in Manhattan; Katie Monahan Prudent of Virginia, winner of the 1989 Children's Services Grand Prix and Grand Slam; George Lindemann Jr. of Greenwich, winner of the 1989 Grand Prix in Devon, Pa., and Leslie Lenehan of Westport, Grand Prix Rider of the Year in 1983 and World Cup winner in Sweden in 1986. In addition, Greg Best, Joe Fargis, Lisa Jacquin and Anne Kursinski, members of the United States 1988 Olympic silver medal equestrian team, will demonstrate their skills.
This year's expanded Country Fair, opening Thursday and continuing to Sunday, features midway rides, children's theater, pony rides, a petting zoo, clowns, and vendors of food and merchandise. Ebony Horsewomen, the only all-black female equestrian group in the country, will perform as it has in previous years, along with the Litchfield Hunt, the First Company Governor's Horse Guard and a series of dressage demonstrations.
Ring activity begins at 8 A.M. Tuesday to Thursday and 7:30 A.M. Friday to Sunday. Events wind up between 5 P.M. and 7 P.M. daily. Tickets are $4 in advance, $6 at the gate. Call 236-4511 for more information and advance ticket locations.
 
SNUFF BOXES
An indispensable accessory for men and women of the 18th and 19th centuries was the snuff box, and the Yale Center for British Art has 300 of them on view as works of art and objects of social history. ''Powder Celestial: Snuff Boxes, 1700-1880'' may be seen to June 24, complemented by humorous prints of the period depicting the attitudes of those who used snuff.
The boxes were made of tortoise shell, silver, wood, papier-mache, agate, ivory, coquilla nut and other materials, depending upon the status of the owner. Undertakers sometimes had them made in the shape of tiny coffins; prisoners made them out of bones left from their meals. Some were enameled with landscape scenes, others were painted with portraits of royalty and not always complementary.
The center is at 1080 Chapel Street in New Haven, open free from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday to Saturday and 2 to 5 P.M. Sunday. Call 432-2850 for more information. $90ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Fiscal Woes Cut Into Tourism Advertising

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
WHILE Connecticut's faltering economy will mean that less state money will be made available to promote tourism this summer, an official says that that will not necessarily translate to a flat year for tourism.
The state will spend about $200,000 for print advertising to attract tourists from surrounding states, much less than the $600,000 peak it spent two years ago and a fraction of the estimated $50 million that all other Northeastern states spend to attract the tourist dollar.
Because of the state's fiscal difficulties, there is no money for television and radio advertisements, the Deputy Commissioner of the State Department of Economic Development, Andrew A. Brecher, said last week. 
 
Optimistic Outlook
Despite the decline in state money to promote tourism, Mr. Brecher said he was optimistic that it could be a good summer for Connecticut's tourist attractions. Last year, tourists spent about $2.1 billion in Connecticut, according to state figures.
''The slowdown in the economy will work with us, not against us,'' Mr. Brecher said, ''because more people will be looking for recreational activities closer to home.''
He said he hoped that special events this summer, like the Volvo International Tennis Tournament in New Haven, as well as such traditional tourism favorites as Mystic Seaport and the Mystic Marine Life Aquarium would attract numerous visitors.
 
Summer Attractions
The Volvo Tennis Tournament, which this year will be played in New Haven, in August, ''will cause a major infusion of new tourism spending in the state,'' Mr. Brecher said. He said the state was expecting the tournament to attract 100,000 people. Many of those people will come from outside Connecticut, he said, meaning they will stay in area hotels, eat in local restaurants, attend plays and visit museums and other attractions.
Mystic Marine Life Aquarium attracted more than 770,000 visitors in 1989 and expects about a 3 percent increase this year, said Bernadette Bode, an aquarium spokeswoman.
About 450,000 tourists visited Mystic Seaport in 1989 and the seaport expects a 25 percent increase because of new evening hours seven days a week, said Liz Gwillam, a seaport spokeswoman. Lake Compounce Festival Park, on the Bristol-Southington line, and Yale University are also major attractions.
 
Changing Tastes
Mr. Brecher said that just as difficult as estimating how many tourists will visit the state this year is predicting what they will do when they do come.
''Tastes do change,'' he said. ''The hot thing to do one year won't be the same the next. People want to do something else.''
In addition, every season seems to bring a particular problem that changes tourism patterns, he said. ''In any summer season, there is some hysteria over something,'' Mr. Brecher said. ''Last year it was Lyme disease. The previous year it was medical waste. The year before that, it was the heat.''

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND INTERVIEW: WILLIAM DOWDELL DENSON;
Nuremberg Prosecutor Reflects on History's Judgment of Evil

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
WHEN he was appointed in 1945 to be chief prosecutor and chief of counsel for the United States Government in war crime trials involving the operators of the Dachau concentration camp, it fell to William Dowdell Denson to prove to the court, and to the world, that nearly unimaginable atrocities were committed by people who called evil their duty.
First, Mr. Denson said in a recent interview, he had to prove to himself the truth of stories so horrible he could hardly credit them. He knew they were true, he said, when he heard the same stories over and over from victims who survived to bear witness.
Then he went on to win convictions against 40 operators of Dachau, and scores more in trials that followed in 1946 and 1947 for the operators of Mauthausen, Flossenberg and Buchenwald. As a result of his efforts, 97 were hanged. 
Mr. Denson, a graduate of West Point and Harvard Law School, thinks still of Ilse Koch, the wife of the commandant of Buchenwald, who denied all and was spared death, he said, because she was pregnant at the trial. What he knew of what she did, Mr. Denson said, was more than he cared to tell.
Born and raised in Birmingham, Ala., Mr. Denson, 76 years old, moved to Long Island in 1958 after a postwar tour as chief of litigation for the Atomic Energy Commission and several years of private law practice in Washington. He is currently senior litigator for the Mineola law firm of Meltzer, Lippe, Goldstein & Wolf. He is married with three children and five grandchildren, and resides in Lawrence.
Q. As you reflect on those days you spent prosecuting some of the worst monsters in history, what stands out most strongly in your memory?
A. It was incredible. The events that had occurred were so sadistic and so gruesome that they were almost absolutely unbelievable. And when I first started questioning potential witnesses, I'll be perfectly candid with you, I thought here were some people who had been mistreated in the concentration camps and they were seeking revenge, and that they were really doing a job drawing on fantasy rather than reality.
Q. You believed they were embellishing?
A. Absolutely. And when I questioned a number of witnesses, and they related substantially the same things, then I knew the events had occurred. Because these witnesses didn't have a chance to get together ahead of time and fabricate their stories. And I began to believe and now would believe anything.
Q. These things were not known to the world then, even in 1945?
A. Of course it was revealed first when the camps were liberated. Until then the world knew there were concentration camps, and the people in Germany knew that there were concentration camps as places to be avoided. But what went on was no more known there that what you know about what goes on in Attica [State Prison], for example. You don't know what goes on there nor do you know what goes on down in Pilgrim [State Hospital in Brentwood].
Q. Are you suggesting these kind of things are happening all the time?
A. I don't know. But not on the scale that they happened in Germany.
Q. Did you find that the people running the camps and on the staffs seemed to be predisposed to act as they did?
A. That's the thing that's disturbing. Some of those people had just as normal a background as you or I. But once they started being exposed to violence and mistreatment it was like a snowball rolling down a hill. As long as they stayed there and were exposed to it the bigger the snowball and the more unconscionable these people became.
Q. And the guards?
A. Most of the guards were men that had been recruited off the streets, the unemployed from Berlin, Frankfort, Hamburg, Munich. They were thugs picked up off the streets. They became the Death's Head units of the SS.
The Jews came after the pogroms started in 1936, 1937. In 1938, when the Nazis took over Austria, in order to get rid of opposition, they took all the leaders and carted them off to one of the concentration camps. First there was Dachau, then Mauthausen.
From 1938 on, they were just working the tails off the prisoners and they didn't feed them hardly anything. There was starvation and hard work under living conditions that prevented them from getting the rest at night to do a hard day's work the next day. All of that was calculated to destroy them physically. Then there were floggings and wrist hangings and that sort of thing.
Then, as the staff grew, they drew on units of the SS.
Q. When they were tried, did they remain totally inured to what they had done?
A. They had no remorse, none that I saw. There were some that the shock was such when they were sentenced to death that they fainted. Basically they were tough. But they died just like dogs. The highest-ranking man that I prosecuted was August Eigruber, the gauleiter of Lower Danubia, a part of Austria. That scoundrel, he had a concentration camp that he put people in of his own whim and caprice. The last thing Eigruber said when the noose was put around his neck was ''Heil Hitler.''
Q. How could it be that the brutal Ilse Koch was not executed when so many others were?
A. I tried these people for the violation of the rules of land warfare. You get the foundation for that from the Hague Convention of 1907 and the Geneva Convention of 1929. What I did was try them for participating, aiding and abetting a common design to subject allied nationals to beatings, torture, starvation and killing and for doing the same thing to prisoners of war. I tried Ilse Koch for aiding and abetting this common design. I did not try her specifically for making lampshades out of human skin. She was very fond of such objects.
When prisoners were sent around the commandant's house, if they were Jewish or Poles or Russians, those who were not supposed to be really human, when those prisoners were around there, if she saw one looking at her she would take down his number and report him and he would then be flogged. He would be given 25 lashes. And that sort of flogging to those prisoners, who were almost starved to death, was a shock the nervous system which often did result in death. And she would parade herself around in tight-fitting clothing before those poor devils.
Q. What was her demeanor during the trial?
A. That this was a big bunch of lies and that she was not guilty of any misconduct. I put on enough witnesses to make out a case to justify a sentence of death. The court sentenced her to life imprisonment because she was pregnant at the time.
And then General [Lucius D.] Clay reduced her sentence to four years. The reason given was that there was insufficient credible evidence to justify a sentence of that severity. Well the whole point was, the very nature of these camps was that what took place there was incredible.
The biggest job I had was trying to get the court to believe the witnesses that I put on the stand. She was later tried by the German people for crimes against Germans and she was again sentenced to life imprisonment and she committed suicide in prison.
Q. You were trained as a soldier and a lawyer. You tried soldiers for violations of international law, but they said they were doing their duty as soldiers trained to follow orders.
A. The point is, when an order is illegal on its face, you don't have to obey it. This business that they would be shot if they didn't obey was for the birds. We had evidence of some of the doctors who declined to participate in some of the activities. They were not taken out and shot, they were just transferred to another outfit.
Q. Were there orders that American soldiers in Vietnam should have disobeyed ?
A. I don't know what the conditions were in Vietnam. I do know that in the concentration camp cases these people were seeing assaults and batteries occurring and every kind of invasion of human rights that you can imagine. And this went on over the course of a period of time. It was nothing instantaneous, where it occurred on the spur of the moment and they had to make a decision. They had a chance for reflection and everything else. So I can't answer your Vietnam question because I don't know the circumstances.
Q. You saw from close range the depravity of a nation. As that nation moves now to reunite again, are you fearful?
A. Not at all. Justice demands that there be some sort of separation of those who voluntarily participated in these wrongful acts and that large group of the impassive and unorganized that did not participate. You cannot visit the sins of the fathers upon the sons or the children. The conditions that existed in Germany that gave rise to Hitler are certainly not present in Germany today.
Q. You are not one who believes that in Germany a propensity remains.
A. Oh no, not at all. This is 45 years later. That's two generations.
Q. What should be remembered first and foremost about the Holocaust?
A. There's got to be a recognition that everybody, everybody has got to have a concept of the importance of human rights. And if there is a recognition of the meaning of human rights, then you will never have any more holocausts.

HEADLINE: Needed: A Longer School Year

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. PASCRELL Jr.; Assemblyman William J. Pascrell Jr., Democrat of Paterson, is chairman of the Assembly Higher Education Committee and vice chairman of the Education Committee.

 BODY:
AMERICANS are now working longer and harder than at perhaps any time in this century. We have to in order to compete with Asians and Europeans in the new global economy.
But while our work force is making great changes to meet the challenges of the worldwide competition, our school system is still largely mired in the ways of the past. The result is that American students are, for the most part, faring poorly in learning competition with Asian, Russian and European counterparts. 
Unless American education improves, the economic-driven life style that we have enjoyed will continue to decline. America will lose stature in the world as a desirable place to live, and multinational corporations will desert us for areas where skilled workers are more readily available.
The link between a better educational system and better economic conditions for our country is undeniable. We need a more literate, clear-thinking and trainable population if we are to continue to enjoy one of the world's highest standards of living.
All evidence, however, shows that the people graduating from our school system and entering the work force are ill prepared to handle job requirements. A recent survey of business owners conducted by Arthur Andersen & Company shows that employers have great concern about finding qualified help.
When it comes to hiring technical workers, 47 percent of the companies in New Jersey that responded to the survey said it was extremely difficult to find qualified people, while 36 percent nationwide responded similarly.
The survey also indicated that it was not much easier for employers to find semiskilled workers. In New Jersey, one of the most industrialized states in the nation, the illiteracy rate is astounding. It is estimated that there may be as many as 800,000 adults who lack basic reading skills. It is no wonder that our state's job growth prospects are dimming.
Also noted in the survey was a great deal of dissatisfaction by corporations with the New Jersey school system; only 12 percent said it was good and 52 percent said it was poor. To make up for the gaps in public education, companies are spending more and more money on remedial training for workers. Resources that should be going into research, new products and new markets are being siphoned off to pay for the job that public education should be doing.
Historically speaking, this is an ominous change in American life. Perhaps never before have we asked so much of our education system. The American way of life that we cherish so much was born in the Industrial Revolution of the mid-19th century. It was during that time, historians tell us, that America's economic efficiency was a direct result of our nation's commitment to education. It was during that time that literacy in the United States became more widespread than in Europe.
Not coincidentally, it was also at that time that the indomitable American spirit of innovation led to new inventions and new processes that would make the American work force the best in the world.
In ''The Battle Cry of Freedom,'' a book on the Civil War, the historian James M. McPherson said that New England led the world in education facilities and literacy in the mid-19th century. More than 95 percent of New England adults could read and write in 1850. Three-fourths of the children 5 to 19 years old were enrolled in school. Nearly four-fifths of the American population was literate in the 1850's, compared with just two-thirds in Britain and northwest Europe and one-fourth in southern and eastern Europe.
Without counting slaves, the literacy rate in the United States at the time reached 90 percent - equaled only by Sweden and Denmark. It was no wonder that America became the mecca for industrialization.
Americans in the mid-19th century recognized the value of education and committed themselves to it. Now, we still value education, but we don't seem to want to commit ourselves to insure that we excel at it.
In New Jersey and throughout most of America, the school day and year are relics of our agricultural roots. Children are educated now, in the post-industrial era, as if they were still needed to do summer planting and other chores on the farm.
The school year in New Jersey is still just 180 days, a far smaller number than in Japan, where the average student attends school 240 days a year. Undoubtedly there is far more for students to learn now than 50 or 60 years ago. But the education hierarchy is not providing students with more time needed to master more information.
The average child in New Jersey spends 5 hours 29 minutes a day in elementary school and that increases to only 5 hours 55 minutes in high school, when undoubtedly the students could easily handle more learning time.
Innovation is the key to our state's and nation's economic future. If we cannot solve today's problems, we will slip and America will become an also-ran in the world economy. Once prized for its success and innovation, the American school system has slipped dramatically; innovation has been replaced by huge education bureaucracies that are resistant to change.
Since becoming a New Jersey Assemblyman, I have offered numerous pieces of legislation affecting education, but none, I think, is more important than my proposal for the Local Elementary Assistance Program, or LEAP.
LEAP is simply a challenge to school districts to develop innovative and courageous plans to upgrade education at the elementary school level. I want to see teachers and administrators stretch themselves and their students to their full potential, and to see if, for once, we can get the education bureaucracy to stop worrying about teacher contracts and start devoting energy to developing programs that will challenge students to learn faster.
At the recent New Jersey School Boards convention in Atlantic City, I laid before that group a challenge to start improving education by coming up with a workable plan to extend the school year by just 20 days. That's all.
Combined with the other guidelines of the LEAP legislation, a longer school year will, I believe, produce a bold shock wave of reform throughout the educational system in New Jersey and, it is hoped, throughout the nation.

HEADLINE: Cape May Journal;
Facing the Tourist Season With Mixed Feelings

BYLINE: By MARIA EFTIMIADES

DATELINE: CAPE MAY

 BODY:
FOR now, life in Cape May is redolent of that in a small town, not a tourist haven. Streets aren't clogged with cars, and parking is as easy to find as solitude on an oceanfront jog. Best sellers still sit on shelves at the library, and there's no waiting anywhere, not at the Ugly Mug bar and restaurant, not at the Lobster House in Cape May Harbor.
But that will end with all the grace of a mudslide in less than three weeks - the start of the Memorial Day weekend.
It isn't that Cape May residents dread that weekend, when some 50,000 tourists are expected to pour into their tiny enclave at the southernmost tip of the Jersey Shore. Indeed, many say they long for the excitement of the summer, the new faces and late night activities they bring. 
It's just that life in Cape May is so pleasant in the off-season, they say. The lazy dinners at the neighbors' and gatherings in watering holes where it's easy to find a seat are friendly and familiar and very Cape May. Sometimes, they add, that's hard to give up.
But they do, and already the pace has quickened. Sounds of refurbishing echo along roads lined with stately Victorian bed and breakfasts as windows are replaced, and fresh paint - pinks and greens, yellows and blues - is readied for visitors.
Residents hover a bit longer at Keltie News on Washington Street, where everybody, it seems, shows up each morning to buy newspapers and lottery tickets and exchange gossip with John Claypool, the manager. Come June, many residents, eager to elude the crowds, will appear just once a week, stocking up on whatever they need.
''Around here in the summer, you do what you have to do before 10 A.M.,'' said Mr. Claypool, a Cape May native. ''After that you get the tour buses, the traffic, the tourists.''
 
Tours, Boutiques and Fudge
The fulcrum of activity is right outside his door - at the tourist office at the start of the Washington Street Mall, four blocks from the beach. From there, bus and walking tours to the Victorian houses operate daily. Along the cobblestone street, clothing boutiques, art galleries, the fudge shop and the drugstore are busy all day. As Memorial Day weekend approaches, many ''closed for the season'' signs on shops have come down.
Not too soon for Jennifer Wallace, who says she has never looked forward to summer more. She grew up here, and as a teen-ager she never thought she would stay. ''I was going to be out of here,'' she said. ''It just gets too quiet for me in the winter.'' But falling in love with Jerry Wallace, a title abstractor for the Title Company of New Jersey, changed her plans. So Mrs. Wallace passes the off-season months taking care of their 1 1/2-year-old daughter, Caitlin, going to Atlantic City occasionally and working as a part-time waitresss at the Ugly Mug.
She said she enjoyed the job, but added that she was unusual; many of the young people here, she said, don't work in the off-season. ''They sit back,'' she said. ''People are screaming for help in the restaurants and shops, but they do nothing until summer. Then they come alive again. It's work hard for the summer, live off unemployment all winter.''
Not if one is an innkeeper. When Patricia Stevens, two years ago, realized a decade-old dream to own a bed and breakfast place in Cape May, she also discovered it was hard work the year round. These days she is busy sprucing up the exterior of her seven-room Colonial revival, the Fairthorne. She is tending the flowers and scrubbing the pink furniture on the wraparound veranda, which faces the ocean. ''Now's the time,'' she said. It's also the time for Sam Jordan, owner of Creative Painting and Restoration, who said he had been working seven days a week lately, along with his six employees, to get houses ready for the season.
For Frank Vogel, a front-desk attendant at the Marquis de Lafayette, a sprawling 73-room hotel facing the ocean, living in Cape May is like living in two different towns. ''The off-season, that's when we get our town back - it's quiet and relaxed,'' he said. ''Then, like the flowers coming up in spring, it's one thing you can be sure of - the vacationers will come back.''
The hotel, where he has worked for 12 years, attracts mostly families and retired couples in the winter, running at about 40 percent capacity. In the summer, it's usually close to 90 percent filled.
''You get people looking for a quick escape, or else they come down here to secure summer rentals and reservations,'' said Buddy Eager, who mans the front desk with Mr. Vogel. ''People aren't in a hurry to do much of anything this time of the year.''
Such was the mood recently at the Ugly Mug, which many young people say is an integral part of the Cape May escape. It's the place the local residents go, except in the summer when ''the yups come and ruin it,'' said Tony Oreo, a commercial fisherman.
Here, hundreds of beer mugs emblazoned with initials of sailors and Cape May residents hang from the walls. The legend, printed on every menu, says that the sailors who drank at the Ugly Mug years ago used their own mugs when returning from sea. For sailors known to be dead, the management turns their mugs backward, facing the ocean.
But mostly the Ugly Mug is renowned for its ''froth blowing contest'' every August. The rules are simple: whoever blows his or her beer froth farthest wins.
Taking a pull from his beer, Donald Swan, a chef, said the tourist season was a chance for local people to ''get a break from each other.'' In the off-season, he said, this close-knit community can go too far. ''I go to the Mug and later someone will say, 'Did you hear Swanny was at the Mug, yeah? Yeah, he was there,' '' he said. ''We all end up stepping on each other - it gets real small. Then in the summer, we're looking for each other.''
Agreeing was his friend Bettyanne Ruwell, a waitress at Water's Edge, a seafood restaurant. ''You can't lose five pounds without someone knowing it,'' she said. ''If you're pregnant, it's around before you even know, because someone works for the doctor and they got the results first.''
Mr. Swan, who was a chef at a Cape May restaurant, recently moved to Devon, Pa., but expects to make the two-hour drive to Cape May often to visit friends. On this trip, he headed straight for the Ugly Mug.
What happens to the Mug in the summer is ''unspeakable,'' said Karen Frank, a training specialist for the Frank Company, a family-owned business that runs dozens of movie theaters on the Jersey Shore. That's when the ''shoobes'' emerge. ''They're the ones who come down and disturb us,'' said Ms. Frank, who lives in nearby Margate.
The term ''shoobe,'' Cape May people say, derives from Philadelphians who come to Jersey Shore towns with everything they need - sunglasses, swimsuit, suntan lotion - fitting into a shoebox.
Ever captain of her good sense, Ms. Frank knows that the shoobes are pretty important to Cape May, especially in her business.
Indeed, at the Cape May movie theater recently, there were a few tense moments by the entrance. The off-season policy requires five tickets be sold in order to show a movie. On this evening, with five minutes to go, there were just three - and not a shoobe in sight.
A couple, arm in arm, arrived in time. The fivesome took in ''Driving Miss Daisy.''
Stopping off recently in Cape May for a night were Heinz and Bette Lenz, who were on their way home to Annapolis, Md., where Mr. Lenz is a professor of physical education for the Naval Academy. They said they paid less than $40 a night for a big room with an ocean view, plus breakfast.
''Our friends wonder why we go to the Carribean in June and places like Cape May in winter,'' Mrs. Lenz said. ''They don't understand. No crowds, no hassles, and it's cheaper.''
 
Advantages of an Uncrowded Beach
Besides, the Lenzes have a special interest in off-season resorts -they met in one. It was 20 years ago on a beach in Grenada. ''If the beach had been crowded, we never would have found each other,'' Mr. Lenz said. ''I guess that's why we like the off-season.''
At the Cape May Library, summer is ''double duty or triple duty,'' said the librarian, Linda Smith, a former teacher and Cape May resident since 1973. Several hundred visitors a day drop in, often to pore over books on Cape May's history and architecture. Local people appear less frequently. ''They come in and say, 'I guess all the good books are gone,' '' Miss Smith said.
But one stalwart can't be driven away, not even by shoobes. Summer or winter, Rusty, a marmalade-colored cat, is usually sleeping on reference books or observing the checkout process. Rusty, Miss Smith said, looks forward to summer. ''That's what he loves best, next to food,'' she said. ''People.''

HEADLINE: Jobs Program for Students Is Lagging

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
A JOBS program that was supposed to place 10,000 urban high school graduates into upwardly mobile positions by 1992 is falling far short of its goal, prompting state officials to re-examine the program to see if it can be structured more effectively.
Although the program will continue at least through the next fiscal year, plans to expand it have been shelved, and many school districts are worried that they will no longer be able to participate.
When ''10,000 Graduates . . . 10,000 Jobs'' was first announced in 1987, it was seen as an innovative approach to increasing the supply of entry-level employees while providing a strong incentive for students to complete high school. But overly ambitious projections on participation, restrictive eligibility guidelines and a lackluster response from business and industry have made it all but impossible for the state to meet its goal. Still, state officials are hopeful that they can salvage the program. ''One of the options would be to discontinue the program, but I don't believe that's a viable one at this point,'' said Dr. Lloyd J. Newbaker Jr., an assistant commissioner with the State Department of Education, which is sponsoring the program in cooperation with the State Department of Labor. ''There's a lot of promise to the project.'' 
The program's lack of success is a setback to the urban education platform of Thomas H. Kean, the former Governor, who once described the initiative as the first step to ''a lifetime of successful employment'' for many students. Guidelines called for 1,000 seniors to be placed in full-time jobs upon graduation last year, with 2,000 more students receiving jobs this spring, 3,000 next year and 4,000 in 1992.
But of the 1,500 students to sign up for the program last year, only 534 completed the requirements and received jobs. This year 1,206 seniors have enrolled in the program, with about 800 expected to get jobs.
Although the program was originally conceived for seniors who were neither college-bound nor enrolled in a vocational or cooperative program, it was expanded this year to include students in lower grades in high school and some seniors with marginal academic records who say they intend to continue their education.
To qualify for a job, students must have completed all requirements for high school graduation, including passing the High School Proficiency Test. They must also maintain a minimum 92 percent attendance record, demonstrate good citizenship and complete a 40-hour training course to learn good work habits.
The $10 million program includes a coordinator in each of the 27 participating high schools and ''private sector coordinators'' throughout the state who find jobs for students completing the program. The Department of Education has asked schools to come up with a minimum of 50 placements each year, resulting in a placement cost of roughly $1,000 a student.
But the restrictive eligibility requirements have left a small pool of students to draw from. Last year, none of the 21 participating schools except for those in Elizabeth were able to recruit 50 students, and in some of the smaller districts, making 50 placements is a virtual impossibility.
Of the 129 seniors enrolled at New Brunswick High School this year, for example, all but 25 are excluded from the program because they are either college-bound or enrolled in vocational programs.
''I made it known that there is no way I can come up with 50 students,'' said Peggy Dulin, the program coordinator for the New Brunswick school system, who is worried that her school will be dropped from the program.
For the nearly $28,000 the state paid to cover Ms. Dulin's salary and expenses last year, five New Brunswick seniors completed the program requirements, of whom two decided to go to college and one moved out of state. One of Ms. Dulin's two students to be placed in a job has already been dismissed.
Part of the poor turnout statewide is attributed to the decision by some of New Jersey's largest school districts, including Newark, not to participate in the program because of financial reasons. State subsidies of as much as $50,000 a year for individual schools are to be eliminated over time, leaving the district to pick up the expense of operating the program.
The program's attendance requirement has been an obstacle for students and businesses alike.
''We have a hard time selling 92 percent to business and industry, to be honest,'' said Russell Betz, who runs the program at Snyder High School in Jersey City, where 30 of the school's 104 seniors to enroll in the course this year have dropped out, mostly because they have missed too many days of school. ''If you're present only 92 percent of the time on your job, you're not going to last long.''
 
Details of Finding a Job
Much of the 40-hour training course is taken up with the details of finding and maintaining a job, from learning how to write a resume to coping with criticism from supervisors and co-workers.
''For the most part, students do very well academically, but it's the social end of working - being dependable, getting to work on time or calling in when they're not going to show, or handling constructive criticism or employee conflict - that they need help on,'' said Nedra Clark, coordinator of the program for Montclair schools.
But businesses have also criticized the program's lack of technical training, and more vocational education will probably be included in the curriculum in the future.
''We've got to do a better job equipping these general students with a more vocational-type program,'' Dr. Newbaker said. ''At least that is what employers have been telling us.''
Another problem has been the inherent conflict between a lengthy in-school training program and typical hiring practices.
''The business community has been reluctant to commit jobs long term before the job opening occurs, because their need is usually more immediate,'' said Robert Guadagnino, director of the Department of Labor's Division of Employment and Training. ''This was something that might not have been identified before the program was developed.''
As a result, the Department of Labor has recommended the incorporation of an apprenticeship program into the jobs program where students could gradually make the transition from school to the workplace. The department also wants the 40 hours of training to be substantially expanded.
 
Poor Timing Cited
State officials believe that the timing of the program's announcement was in large part to blame for its slow start. Shortly after the program was announced, the Department of Education's Division of Vocational Education, which administers the program, was rocked with a scandal involving charges of misuse of state and Federal funds, leaving the division in chaos and many programs unattended. Plans are under way to enlist business and industry in the department's future efforts to market the jobs program.
The economic climate has also changed since the program was first announced. In 1987, the economy was robust, and an increasing number of unfilled openings were anticipated, but the recent downturn has meant fewer jobs and greater competition.
''When you're dealing with an expanding economy, the job opportunities are greater, but with the leveling off of the economy here in New Jersey, the preparation of those students should be more intensive so they are competitive,'' Mr. Guadagnino said. ''That's where the difficulty is and focus has to be.''
 
Not 'Just Flipping Hamburgers'
In describing the jobs graduates of the program would receive, the Commissioner of Education, Dr. Saul Cooperman, stressed that they would be upwardly mobile and not ''just flipping hamburgers.'' But some state officials are privately expressing disappointment over the quality of the jobs students have received. Sales, clerical and blue-collar positions constituted 76 percent of the jobs last year, with an average wage of $5.84 an hour.
In Holmdel, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company hired 10 students for summer internships last year, mostly in clerical positions. None were hired to a permanent position because of a hiring freeze.
''We're talking low-level positions,'' said Cynthia Prescott, A.T. & T.'s staff manager for college recruiting. ''They would need much more training to move out of those slots. They were not jobs with permanent full-time potential.''
A lack of coordination between the Departments of Education and Labor has compounded the program's difficulties. Last year, for example, the Department of Labor hired a private-sector coordinator for Jersey City schools who did not have a car or find any jobs for students by graduation day. Over the summer, school officials scrambled to find suitable employment for the students.
 
Overcoming a Poor Start
Despite the paucity of students and businesses participating in the program, state officials believe that it has value and will grow in popularity once it is better established. They point to the disappointing start of similar programs in Baltimore and Boston, which have now been revamped to include more involvement from business and have begun to turn in more promising results.
For many coordinators, the most unfortunate aspect of the program is its name.
''The worst thing they could have done was to put a number on it,'' Mr. Betz said. ''For one thing, it signifies a beginning and an end. What do you do when you reach 10,000? Do you disband it? And if you don't make it by 1992, they'll turn around and call it a failure.''
There have been reports that the program's name will be changed, but Dr. Newbaker has played down that possibility.
''I don't think renaming the project is going to make it stronger or significantly alter it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
U.S. Trying Lease-Purchases on Its New Buildings

BYLINE: By CHERYL KENT

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
An office building under construction here is the first of a dozen Federal projects throughout the United States that will use a development method that involves long-term leases rather than outright purchases of new buildings the Government commissions for its own occupancy.
A proposal for a new Federal building is approved by Congress and the Treasury issues bonds to pay for it; the lease system - sometimes called ''lease-purchase agreements'' - also needs Congressional approval.
Private developers who compete for these projects may, depending on the circumstances, do everything from assembling the site and arranging financing to managing the completed building. The Government rents the entire building for the life of a 30-year lease with its total rent calculated to pay for the building's purchase and its construction financing. At the end of the lease, the Government gains title to the property. 
Critics say the system is more expensive than the usual technique and disguises Government property purchases.
Stein & Company, a 19-year-old Chicago concern, won the Federal office project in December 1988 and is now putting up the building, which is scheduled for completion in mid-1991. Its $153 million bid included assemblage, design, project financing, construction costs and managing the property. Stein also has developed parking garages, suburban office complexes and, more recently, the 60-story A.T. & T. Building and several other downtown Chicago office towers.
The agreement was the first of its kind signed by a developer and the Government, but others are being negotiated. Lease-purchase agreements are being used most aggressively by the General Services Administration, the Government's real estate and procurement agency, which owns about 10 percent of all Federal buildings and about 40 percent of its office space. Other Federal agencies own the rest.
Congress has approved the use of lease-purchase agreements for 10 G.S.A. buildings at sites across the country. Besides the Chicago project, these include two buildings for Foley Square in New York City, amounting to a gross area of 1.6 million square feet; one building in Atlanta and two in Chamblee, Ga.; one each in San Francisco and Oakland, Calif.; one in Tacoma, Wash., and one in the District of Columbia.
The method is being taken up by other agencies as well. Lease-purchase has been adopted by the Office of the Architect of the Capital to build a new judiciary building in Washington, and the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, a small agency created during the Kennedy Administration, is using it to develop the International Culture and Trade Center there.
''No one has a greater penchant for developing a cookie-cutter approach than the Federal Government,'' says Patrick Keogh, program director for Lease Construction, a two-year-old department within the G.S.A. that manages lease-purchase projects. ''But we have learned something different from each one and a standard could be stifling.''
In Chicago, developers proposed the site as part of the package. For the lease-purchase office project in Oakland, the site has already been chosen by the G.S.A. The selected developer will help execute the contract for the property. In the future it is unlikely that lease-purchase agreements will combine financing and building costs, as was the case in Chicago. Instead, developers will submit those costs separately.
Whether lease-purchase goes any further than the approved projects is uncertain. Lease-purchase agreements are causing a furor at the Office of Management and Budget, where there are questions about how the property acquisition should be accounted for and suspicions that the agreements are dodges to conceal acquisitions and rental payments.
Last summer, that office and the G.S.A. came to an agreement permitting the latter to proceed on an experimental basis with lease-purchase. But recent testimony by the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, William Diefenderfer, before a subcommittee of the Senate Committe on the Environment and Public Works, suggests that the agency has had second thoughts.
''These accounting gimmicks join the dozens of others in masking the true size of the Federal deficit, thus understating our future financial obligations,'' Mr. Diefenderfer told the subcommittee on March 20.
He said the interest rate the Government would have to pay on Treasury bonds was 8 to 10 percent less than financing rates available to developers in the public sector. But supporters of lease-purchase say the technique will prove more economical in the end.
The hope is that it will produce buildings faster and more efficiently than Government-managed procedures allow, said J. David Hood, director of the planning staff at the G.S.A. offices in Chicago. ''The theory is that the sequence of construction can be collapsed using lease-purchase,'' he said. ''The developer won't have the design executed down to the last gnat's eyelash - the way we would have to - before putting a project out for bid.''
The agency is also counting on winning bidders to complete them in less time and for less money than Government agencies would. ''The potential advantage of a developer is that he will be creative and more in touch with the industry than we can be,'' Mr. Hood said. ''As a bureaucratic organization, it's hard for us to be on the leading edge, it's hard for us to reward risk-taking.''
Using either Treasury bonds or the private market to finance construction is less expensive than short-term leasing of office space at market rates. According to the Office of Management and Budget, leasing costs 83 percent more than using direct funding.
Among the instances in which lease-purchase developers may enjoy an advantage is in the buying of property. The Government cannot get bargain prices because, to compensate for the power of eminent domain, its opening bid has to be the fair-market value as assessed by an independent appraiser.
In Chicago, Continental Bank, the former owner of Stein's one-third-block site, initially asked $32 million. After negotiations, Stein was able to buy it for $22 million.
''Public projects are not notorious for being on time and on budget,'' said Mr. Keogh of the G.S.A.. But in Chicago, he said, ''the Federal office project is going along very well'' and is ''on schedule and on budget.''
Now 35 percent complete, the 27-story building is going up on the southeast corner of Jackson and Clark Streets. It will expand the Federal Center complex just across Jackson where there are two office towers and a post office built between 1964 and 1975. The complex was designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Mies students head the Chicago firm of Fujikawa Johnson and Associates, which designed the new building to be compatible with the original ones.
The new building will add about 600,000 square feet of office space to the complex's 1.6 million. All told, the Government has six million square feet in Chicago - two-thirds owned, the rest rented.
Originally, the new building was meant to accommodate all of the Environmental Protection Agency's local offices. Now, the agency will occupy roughly 60 percent of the space while retaining 15,000 to 25,000 square feet of its current offices across the street. Other tenants will be the Departments of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development and the Social Security Administration.
Profit margins for Stein & Company are less than they would be for a fully leased speculative office building, but so is the risk. Lease-purchase offers developers the certainty of a fully leased building in an office market that is becoming increasingly competitive nationwide. Its investment is repaid in rent over the life of a 30-year lease.
''Our only profit is if we build for less than we bid,'' says Bernard Freibaum, a senior vice president and chief financial officer for Stein & Company.

HEADLINE: Purchase Campus Plays Host to Broadway Stars

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
Since the middle of March, the State University of New York at Purchase has been astir with the sounds of a big, splashy musical. That was when rehearsals began for ''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' and now the well-known theatrical names connected with the show have become familiar figures on the campus here.
Among them are the director, Harold Prince; the composer and lyricist team of John Kander and Fred Ebb; the playwright Terrence McNally, and the actor John Rubinstein.
The public performances began last Tuesday at the Performing Arts Center on the campus and are to continue through June 24. Its residency begins a projected four-year alliance between the university and a newly formed commercial producing organization called New Musicals. Three additional musicals have been scheduled for this first season, which will continue in the fall at the Performing Arts Center. 
 
Laboratory for New Work
''A college campus that has a conservatory of the arts is a sound and appropriate place - a laboratory - to test new work,'' said Christopher Beach, who took over in October as director of the Performing Arts Center. Traditional theater terms like tryouts, workshops, previews and opening nights are being avoided by the producing organization, which maintains that the question of whether ''Spider Woman'' is Broadway bound is not an issue.
''This is not, strictly speaking, a Broadway-oriented show, though it should provide the transfusion Broadway needs,'' said Mr. Prince, whose career spans ''The Pajama Game'' (as co-producer in 1954) and ''Phantom of the Opera'' (as director). ''Here is a place to work as I've always worked. It's ironic how that place used to be Broadway, but the economic pressures imposed by astronomical production and operating costs are such that we all cave in.''
Sheldon N. Grebstein, the college's president, described how he hoped the arrangement would benefit the school and its neighbors: ''This connects us to the creative process and gives us a new cultural and intellectual resource for the region. That should put SUNY Purchase more vividly and emphatically on the cultural map. There are still people who drive by here but don't visit us. We'd like to change that. We've never had anything like this before.'' A community interest in musical theater came to Mr. Beach's attention during ''coffees'' that he instituted last October. These are informal post-dinner meetings in various homes in the county. They are set up by the Prompters, the Performing Arts Center's volunteer organization and attended once a week by Mr. Beach, Rachel Thompson, the Performing Arts Center's marketing director, and Carol Saltzman, the coordinator of volunteers.
New Musicals has been in the works for five years, said its producing director, Martin J. Bell. He described it as a plan to reinvigorate the American musical theater by developing new works in proximity to Manhattan, but at a remove from the city's pressures and labor costs.
The search for a suitable theater site included visits to Astoria, Queens; Stamford and Morristown, N.J., Mr. Bell said, adding that those places were rejected, respectively, because of union problems, inadequate stage space and limited parking space. There was interest in the Purchase campus three years ago, Mr. Bell said, but it was thwarted by scheduling conflicts at the Performing Arts Center concerts and by what he felt was the university's lack of interest in ''outside groups.''
But as ''Spider Woman'' began to materialize, Mr. Bell returned in October, this time with Mr. Prince, who recalled saying, ''This is exactly what we've been wanting to build and it's here already. How can we interest them? We're not not-for-profit.''
The arts center's new director, Mr. Beach, ''found a way to work with us and schedule around events,'' Mr. Bell said. New Musicals is paying $600,000 a year for the Performing Arts Center spaces, which include newly converted offices for the staff members of the organization, which also has offices in Manhattan.
''We're providing them with a home,'' Mr. Beach said, ''but we said that we've got to tie everything into the academic environment - to our undergraduate music, dance and theater programs. And they said, 'Great.' '' Mr. Beach cited as examples the possibility of seminars, master classes and student internships, as well as open rehearsals so that the university's students could follow the developmental process.
Even though ''Spider Woman'' settled in here after mid-semester, Mr. Prince has already conducted classes in musical theater direction and certain groups attended various dress rehearsals of the musical. Next semester, the educational aspect of New Musicals will be more structured,'' Mr. Beach said.
 
A $10 Million Budget
Mr. Prince said: ''We're going to make ourselves accessible to the campus and take students through the process. That's how I learned, by observing first-hand people exercising their craft. This will be good for everybody. We're doing our damnedest to resuscitate the musical theater. I want to go back to when it was terrific.''
New Musicals is financed by investors, including four corporations: Capital Cities/ABC, Columbia Artists Management, Jujamcyn Theaters and NAC Productions. The investors have provided $2.5 million of the first season's $10 million budget; ticket sales from the four shows are expected to generate $6.4 million. Other corporate sponsorships, merchandising and concession sales are expected to make up the remainder.
''They convinced me this is not a get-rich-quick venture out to make quick bucks,'' Mr. Beach said. ''but that it's to develop new works and give them a chance to grow.
Mr. Grebstein added: ''We are not producing New Musicals; we are hosting it. They're coming in self-contained and paying their own way. We just hope we can sustain this. How are we going to deal with it? We don't know how it's going to feel, but we think we know how it's going to work.''
Anne F. Zimmerman, general manager of New Musicals, said: ''Our concern was how to develop a show and not spend $7 million. We were able to make deals for reduced costs for the SUNY engagement.'' These included, she said, arrangements with suppliers like Show/Tech of Norwalk for scenery and Pro Mix of New Rochelle for sound, as well as with local musicians and stagehands.
''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' in the 1,372-seat Theater A, is based on the 1979 novel by Manuel Puig that became a film in 1985. It concerns two men incarcerated in the early 1970's in Buenos Aires: a homosexual window dresser convicted on a morals charge (played by Mr. Rubinstein) and a revolutionary who has incited factory workers (Kevin Gray).
Mr. Kander and Mr. Ebb, perhaps best known for ''Cabaret,'' which Mr. Prince directed, wrote the score. Mr. McNally (''The Lisbon Traviata,'' ''Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune'') adapted the book. Mr. Prince described the show as ''a surreal musical with political overtones, but it's also about people reaching out over a vast distance.''
The season's other shows are to be ''The Secret Garden'' (Oct. 23 through Dec. 23); ''My Favorite Year'' (Jan. 8 through March 2) and ''Fanny Hackabout Jones'' (March 19 through May 18). ''Spider Woman'' is budgeted at $1.5 million. The other shows ''are in the neighborhood of $750,000 to $900,000,'' Ms. Zimmerman estimated.
''We're hoping a show will find itself and an audience here,'' she said. ''This is our opportunity to make mistakes and corrections, and then have an afterlife. And that way we can recover costs.'' For ticket information, call 1-800-669-1619.

Lease-purchase has been adopted by the Office of the Architect of the Capital to build a new judiciary building in Washington, and the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, a small agency created during the Kennedy Administration, is using it to develop the International Culture and Trade Center there.
''No one has a greater penchant for developing a cookie-cutter approach than the Federal Government,'' says Patrick Keogh, program director for Lease Construction, a two-year-old department within the G.S.A. that manages lease-purchase projects. ''But we have learned something different from each one and a standard could be stifling.'' In Chicago, developers proposed the site as part of the package. For the lease-purchase office project in Oakland, the site has already been chosen by the G.S.A. The selected developer will help execute the contract for the property. In the future it is unlikely that lease-purchase agreements will combine financing and building costs, as was the case in Chicago. Instead, developers will submit those costs separately.
Whether lease-purchase goes any further than the approved projects is uncertain. Lease-purchase agreements are causing a furor at the Office of Management and Budget, where there are questions about how the property acquisition should be accounted for and suspicions that the agreements are dodges to conceal acquisitions and rental payments.
Last summer, that office and the G.S.A. came to an agreement permitting the latter to proceed on an experimental basis with lease-purchase. But recent testimony by the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, William Diefenderfer, before a subcommittee of the Senate Committe on the Environment and Public Works, suggests that the agency has had second thoughts.
''These accounting gimmicks join the dozens of others in masking the true size of the Federal deficit, thus understating our future financial obligations,'' Mr. Diefenderfer told the subcommittee on March 20.
He said the interest rate the Government would have to pay on Treasury bonds was 8 to 10 percent less than financing rates available to developers in the public sector. But supporters of lease-purchase say the technique will prove more economical in the end.
The hope is that it will produce buildings faster and more efficiently than Government-managed procedures allow, said J. David Hood, director of the planning staff at the G.S.A. offices in Chicago. ''The theory is that the sequence of construction can be collapsed using lease-purchase,'' he said. ''The developer won't have the design executed down to the last gnat's eyelash - the way we would have to - before putting a project out for bid.''
The agency is also counting on winning bidders to complete them in less time and for less money than Government agencies would. ''The potential advantage of a developer is that he will be creative and more in touch with the industry than we can be,'' Mr. Hood said. ''As a bureaucratic organization, it's hard for us to be on the leading edge, it's hard for us to reward risk-taking.''
Using either Treasury bonds or the private market to finance construction is less expensive than short-term leasing of office space at market rates. According to the Office of Management and Budget, leasing costs 83 percent more than using direct funding.
Among the instances in which lease-purchase developers may enjoy an advantage is in the buying of property. The Government cannot get bargain prices because, to compensate for the power of eminent domain, its opening bid has to be the fair-market value as assessed by an independent appraiser.
In Chicago, Continental Bank, the former owner of Stein's one-third-block site, initially asked $32 million. After negotiations, Stein was able to buy it for $22 million.
''Public projects are not notorious for being on time and on budget,'' said Mr. Keogh of the G.S.A.. But in Chicago, he said, ''the Federal office project is going along very well'' and is ''on schedule and on budget.''
Now 35 percent complete, the 27-story building is going up on the southeast corner of Jackson and Clark Streets. It will expand the Federal Center complex just across Jackson where there are two office towers and a post office built between 1964 and 1975. The complex was designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Mies students head the Chicago firm of Fujikawa Johnson and Associates, which designed the new building to be compatible with the original ones. The new building will add about 600,000 square feet of office space to the complex's 1.6 million. All told, the Government has six million square feet in Chicago - two-thirds owned, the rest rented.
Originally, the new building was meant to accommodate all of the Environmental Protection Agency's local offices. Now, the agency will occupy roughly 60 percent of the space while retaining 15,000 to 25,000 square feet of its current offices across the street. Other tenants will be the Departments of Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development and the Social Security Administration.
Profit margins for Stein & Company are less than they would be for a fully leased speculative office building, but so is the risk. Lease-purchase offers developers the certainty of a fully leased building in an office market that is becoming increasingly competitive nationwide. Its investment is repaid in rent over the life of a 30-year lease.
''Our only profit is if we build for less than we bid,'' says Bernard Freibaum, a senior vice president and chief financial officer for Stein & Company.

HEADLINE: Builders Trim Bids on Public Projects

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHEN the State Department of Transportation sought bids earlier this year for repairs to the Saugatuck River bridge on Route 1 in Westport, officials expected to pay $11.8 million for the work. But the low bid, from the George A. Tomasso Construction Corporation in New Britain, was 24 percent lower than that, $8.9 million, said Susan Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the department.
State and municipal agencies are reaping many similar savings from Connecticut's construction slowdown. As other work dries up, contractors are scrambling for public works projects. 
''Within the last year when we had any kind of construction project, we've been getting 10 to 15 bids,'' said Danbury's purchasing agent, Warren W. Platz. ''Before, we considered ourselves lucky when we got two or three.''
''We're actually getting calls from contractors who want to know if we're putting anything out to bid,'' Mr. Platz said.
Public works projects, said Richard F. Piotrowski, Deputy Commissioner of the State Department of Public Works, ''are really the backbone of construction in Connecticut right now.''
He said that his office had expected to pay $12 million to $13 million to build 300-bed prison dormitories in Niantic and Enfield but that the bids came in at $8 million. The estimate for putting in fire-protection equipment at the State Armory in Hartford was $700,000, he said, but the bid was less than half that, $339,000.
''Those are extreme examples,'' Mr. Piotrowski said. ''But we're getting bids that are routinely 10 to 30 percent below our estimates.''
While millions of dollars are being saved on state and local capital projects, the savings will not help resolve the budget deficits that state and municipal officials have been struggling to close. Capital projects are paid for with bonds, over 20 years. Thus, while the lower capital costs will mean lower interest payments in coming years, they will have no immediate effect on budget balancing.
 
As Much Work as Possible
But because the price is right now, Mr. Piotrowski of the State Public Works Department said, his agency is putting more work out to bid. Last year, he said, his department sought bids for $85 million worth of work. In the first nine months of this fiscal year, he said, it had put $129 million worth of work out to bid.
''We want to get as much work out this year as we can,'' Mr. Piotrowski said. ''First, to keep these contractors in business, to help the economy, and second, because we're getting such good prices right now.''
Henry Fusillo, the estimates manager for Tomasso Construction, the company that is rebuilding the Saugatuck River bridge, said contractors are cutting things close to win work.
''Any company would, of course, like to get more money for a project,'' Mr. Fusillo said. ''But with 15 or 20 bidders on each job, you have to go as low as you can possibly go and hope to get through until things get better.''
Mr. Fusillo said that while contractors' bids have shrunk, ''costs never go down.''
''You just have to find more efficient ways to do the work,'' he said. ''That's the only way to survive in this market.''
One measure of Connecticut's sluggish construction market is the number of housing permits issued. For March, only 391 new housing units were authorized, a drop of more than 33 percent from last year to the lowest March level in 10 years, State Housing Department figures show.
Commercial real estate development has also ground to a halt, a result in part of financial problems at banks in the state which have largely curtailed lending.
Mr. Platz said a contract for a waste-water treatment plant in Danbury was let earlier this year for $59 million, about $2 million less than expected.
''That doesn't sound like a big savings,'' he said. ''But it wasn't too long ago that all projects were coming in over estimate. It takes so long to get a bid package together, by the time you put it out to bid, the estimates are usually low because of inflation.''
Mr. Platz said that on a contract put out last month, for a water-and-sewer project in Bethel, engineers had estimated the cost at $1.2 million, but the town received 12 bids and paid 20 percent less.
 
Bids 'From Everywhere'
State Transportation Commissioner J. William Burns said the construction slowdown could not have come at a better time for the state's 10-year, $5.5 billion repair program for roads and bridges, which began in 1984.
The program's early years were spent planning and designing hundreds of road and bridge improvements. Construction is now starting on many of them, just in time to take advantage of the savings.
''Contractors are coming from everywhere - Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey,'' Mr. Burns said. ''One of the companies that will do the Charter Oak Bridge in Hartford is from the Midwest, and they've never even tried to get work in Connecticut.''
Mr. Burns said the replacement of the Baldwin Bridge over the Connecticut River on Interstate 95, connecting Old Saybrook and Old Lyme, had been expected to cost $99 million. The low bid was $93 million, he said, and all the bids came in under the estimate. ''These firms are capable, technically and financially, to carry out the projects,'' he said.
Mr. Burns said the slowdown in the construction trades also means more workers are available for state projects. Consequently, some projects are being finished ahead of schedule, which keeps drivers happy, he said.
''We've got the time and the money to get more projects done during the program,'' Mr. Burns said. ''The timing has been just great.''
So far, 19 bridge-repair projects have been added to the infrastructure program.
Mr. Fusillo said that as a contractor, he was concerned that the sudden competition for Connecticut projects could cause companies in the state to lose work to competitors from New York and Massachusetts.
''But the amount of work that's out to bid in Connecticut is sufficient so that all these companies can get a share,'' Mr. Fusillo said.
And Mr. Piotrowski said he has his staff going over each bid to make sure there are no problems that might crop up later.
''You always run the risk, when the price is so low, that you'll have problems when you get into construction,'' he said. ''But we haven't run into it so far. And with some caution, we shouldn't.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Soviets' Price On Germany

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, May 6

 BODY:
If the opening session of the ''two plus four'' talks made one thing clear, it was that the real bargaining would be not between the victors and losers of World War II, but between a fairly unified West - now including both a prosperous West Germany and a democratized East Germany - and a battered, weakened and troubled Soviet Union using one of its last levers of power in Europe to exact the highest possible price for its final exit from the scene.
That was clear in the blend of carrots and sticks offered by Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who staked out a tough posture in his formal comments, which were made available only to Tass and the East German press agency, and assumed a conciliatory stance at a subsequent news conference.
But it was probably more evident in the extent to which he went in his remarks to the closed gathering of foreign ministers. In his speech, he took pains to convince the other participants that the unification of Germany had a significance for the Soviet Union beyond the technical and logistical problems that the ministers had come to Bonn to discuss. 
''We are not talking about Germany alone,'' he said at one point. ''We are not resolving only German problems. What we are talking about is the final termination of the division of Europe.''
''We are dealing here with an issue of special importance to Soviet people, to our whole society,'' Mr. Shevardnadze declared later, invoking the 20 million Soviet dead in World War II. ''Neither this nor any other Soviet leadership could disregard public opinion. The Soviet people must see that the line under the past is being drawn in a just and worthy manner.''
There was almost a plaintive character to these assertions, as if Mr. Shevardnadze wanted to impress on the West how difficult and fateful was the endorsement that Moscow was being asked to give.
 
A Bargaining Session
The venue was the opening session of the two-plus-four talks between the two Germanys and the four victorious powers of World War II - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France - on clearing away remaining obstacles to German unification.
The process was initially intended as a way for the victorious powers to arrange for the return of a chastened and reunited Germany into the family of nations. Instead, it has evolved into bargaining over the price for Moscow's withdrawal from the scene.
It was this dimension that Mr. Shevardnadze seemed to underscore. In being asked to sign off on German unity, he seemed to say, Moscow was in effect being asked to sign off on the vast influence, power and prestige it had won through the war and maintained by military power for four decades.
In the end, the core issue, as one tired Soviet journalist put it after a long day of speeches and news conferences, was, ''What do we get for getting out?''
The price was certain to be the object of hard bargaining in coming months, involving not only the Soviets and the Germans, but all the Western powers as well. At stake were ''reliable guarantees for the stability and security for decades to come,'' as Mr. Shevardnadze put it.
 
Looming Over the Summit
The issues were likely to loom large over Mr. Gorbachev's summit meeting with President Bush beginning on May 30 and over continuing arms negotiations, most notably the Vienna talks on conventional arms and the Geneva talks on strategic weapons.
Diplomats say Moscow's concerns are of three sorts.
One is the political problem outlined by Mr. Shevardnadze: that the Soviet Union, and in particular its army, could not countenance the surrender of territory won through such sacrifice unless the Kremlin could show that it had received something worthwhile in return.
Mr. Shevardnadze's invocation of this problem, however, was not entirely guileless. Most Western diplomats discerned a thinly veiled threat that unless the West came through, the liberal forces now in power could be replaced by something considerably less favorable to Western interests.
The second area of Soviet demands is deemed to be economic. Specifically, Moscow wanted assurances from West Germany that it would provide concrete assistance to the Soviet economy.
Before the two-plus-four talks, Mr. Shevardnadze met with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and one area reportedly under discussion was that a united Germany would fulfill the long-term contracts between the Soviet Union and East Germany. East Germany supplies 40 percent of all farm machinery to the Soviet Union, 40 percent of its cosmetics and medicine, 30 percent of imported clothing and an untold amount of military equipment.
Moscow would also like West Germany to increase scientific and technological cooperation. The Kremlin presumably would also want a united Germany to assume at least a large part of the expense of keeping whatever Soviet troops remain in Germany for a transitional period.
The third area of concern is probably the most problematic. The evaporation of the Soviet bloc has roused anew the historic Russian fear of being excluded from Europe, and in seeking a new ''security order,'' Moscow will be certain to demand a role for itself.
That is where East and West are most likely to clash, and where the Germans will come under the sharpest pressure.
The United States and other major NATO countries have made it clear that they would like a united Germany to remain in NATO. Mr. Shevardnadze made it clear today that the Soviet Union finds this intolerable, and he proposed instead a center in Berlin to control all forces in Germany.
Further on, the Soviets have spoken of a new ''European security order'' based on the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which joins 33 European states, the United States and Canada.The West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, has expressed similar proposals, but other Western leaders have been reluctant to consider any immediate attempts to supplant NATO.
The bottom line in all this is whether the Soviet Union has any real bargaining power left.
Moscow's only real weapon, diplomats believe, is to try to delay the process of unification. Mr. Shevardnadze, however, seemed to take pains to reassure the Germans that even if there were ''serious differences,'' these ''need not be dramatized.''
At the same time, he declared that the Soviet Union would agree only to a ''package approach,'' adding, ''Nothing is agreed unless all aspects of unification are agreed on.''
 
Hand Is Not a Strong One
By most accounts, Moscow's hand is not a strong one. So far, the West has found an unusual degree of solidarity on the issue of unification, and a confident Chancellor Kohl did not seem likely to panic.
But there was also the sense at the talks that nobody wanted the Soviet Union to leave humiliated. That could not only affect Mr. Gorbachev's domestic position, with unknown consequences for security and stability elsewhere, but it could also derail the broader process of disarmament and liberalization.
In any case, it was clear to everyone at the talks that the process of German unity was under way. Perhaps it could be slowed a bit, but it could not be stopped.

HEADLINE: Bolivian Chief to Ask Bush for More Aid on Drugs

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, May 6

 BODY:
President Jaime Paz Zamora plans to appeal to President Bush in Washington this week for a major increase in financial aid to help Bolivia get out of the cocaine business.
At the same time, he is expected to resist demands from the Bush Administration to use the armed forces to help halt drug trafficking. A 600-man drug police force, advised by agents of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, now conducts the drug fight in Bolivia.
The Bolivian armed forces have been on the political sidelines for nearly a decade now and there is concern across the political spectrum that the financial aid and power that a role in the drug fight would bring them might tempt them to eventually stage another coup. 
Although he has not yet disclosed his decision on the armed forces, the Bolivian leader is reported by aides to have plans to tell Mr. Bush when he visits Washington on Tuesday that the more important thing is to find the financing and investment to replace the ''cocaine economy.''
Bolivian and American experts say this is the most opportune moment they have seen for reorienting the Bolivian economy because the drug crackdown in Colombia and the raids on laboratories in Bolivia have driven peasants to look for crops to replace the coca leaf.
Bolivia is the world's second leading source of coca leaf, the raw material of cocaine, and is increasingly important as a source of processed cocaine as well. Drug experts say Peru, the leading source of the leaf, produces little finished cocaine, a role filled primarily by Colombia until recently.
Officials and experts dealing with the cocaine issue here have long said that priority must be given to finding substitute crops or jobs for the tens of thousands of families that make their living by growing coca in the Chapare, the tropical rain forest east of the town of Cochabamba.
Since Mr. Paz Zamora took office last August, however, his Government has broadened that position to include the need to deal with the importance of coca and cocaine in Bolivia's overall economic picture.
''Without doubt, coca provides Bolivia's principal export,'' said Samuel Doria Medina, an economic adviser to the President. ''This is not an agricultural problem. What interests Bolivia is the substitution of jobs, income and exports.''
A report by Mr. Doria affirms that coca generates some $1.4 billion a year in economic activity in Bolivia and that it leaves $600 million in the country in balance of payment terms - about the equal of all legal exports.
Mr. Doria estimated that $627 million would be needed for crop substitution and rural development over five years, plus sums to cover the lost value of the destroyed crops and balance of payments support. This fiscal year, the United States is providing $78 million in development aid and economic support in addition to financing the operations of the drug police and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The United States Ambassador, Robert Gelbard, said that while the Bush Administration was willing to give more development aid to Bolivia, any increase would have to be based on more concrete plans than the Paz Zamora Government had yet provided.
Mr. Gelbard and other Americans challenge Mr. Doria's figures on the importance of coca to the economy.
A State Department official who asked not to be identified said a reason for the doubts is uncertainty about how much leaf is produced per hectare and the conversion rate from coca paste to cocaine base, an intermediate stage in the production of cocaine. He also said many coca growers had food crops mixed in among the coca bushes.
''The United States also believes that much of the big money from the traffickers doesn't come into Bolivia,'' he said, ''but involves only bank-to-bank transfers in places like Panama or the Cayman Islands.''
Such money, he argued, even though transferred into the offshore bank account of a Bolivian, would have little effect on the Bolivian economy aside from the payments for the relatively modest growing and production costs.

HEADLINE: From Bolivia, Good News on Drugs

 BODY:
President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia arrives in Washington this week with startling information: The market for raw coca leaves in his country has collapsed. He considers that a powerful reason for the U.S. to speed up economic aid to help Bolivia's antidrug campaign, and he's right.
Last year, after Colombia began fighting its big drug cartels, President Bush pledged much more military and economic aid for Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. But most of the aid package did not take final shape until the ''drug summit'' meeting in January. And $230 million in military aid, only now beginning to flow, came first. 
Events in the Andes moved faster. By late last year the Colombian campaign had managed to disrupt the channels by which coca leaves were gathered in Peru and Bolivia, then transported to Colombia for final processing. As a result, coca growers suddenly found their crops hard to sell. The price for 100 pounds of raw leaves, more than $60 last summer, fell below $20, considerably less than the cost of production.
It has been hard to exploit that decline in Peru, where Maoist guerrillas control most of the coca growing territory. But in Bolivia, the decline presents a rare opportunity. The U.S. already helps the Bolivian Government with a rudimentary crop substitution program. Farmers are paid $2,000 per hectare to tear up coca and plant other crops like oranges. As long as the coca price held up, the program languished. But with the price down, many farmers now are rushing to sign up. The number of coca hectares destroyed this year already exceeds 3,000, more than in all of last year.
Surprised and pleased, Bolivia needs more money to expand the substitution program. Yet while Bolivia will receive $34 million in new military aid, economic aid remains at last year's level.
Washington urges patience: new economic aid is due with the second phase of the Andean strategy, next fiscal year. But this could be the wrong time for patience. There's powerful reason to get as much coca land as possible into other profitable crops now. The coca price could rise again if, for instance, enforcement flags in Colombia.
In any case, economic aid for Bolivia would help ease anxieties stirred by military aid. As an article on today's Op-Ed page suggests, supporters of democracy and human rights remain wary of U.S. alliances with Latin generals.
Washington professes to recognize that the Andean strategy depends on both military and economic aid. The collapse of coca prices in Bolivia vindicates that approach, and sooner than experts had dared to hope. Granting Mr. Paz Zamora's request for new economic aid now would help him seize the moment, and give reassurance that U.S. intentions in the Andes remain honorable.

HEADLINE: Defined Pension Plan Lets Worker Worry

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Prof. Eli Schwarz's paean to defined-contributon pension plans (letter, April 13) is the truth, but not the whole truth.
''Most of all,'' he states in a sentence that leaves a hole so large you could drive a truck through it, ''there is no possible imputed liability or financial risk for the sponsoring corporation, private agency or governmental unit.'' 
Unfortunately for the toiling employees, a defined contribution plan does not make this financial risk disappear. Rather, this risk is, as the physicists would say, conserved. It is transferred from the institutions to the backs of the workers. They can diligently sock away their defined contribution savings for decades. But if, at retirement, there happens to be a bear market or a major inflation, then tough beans. It is the individual worker's pension that takes a brutal kick in the teeth.
The laudable motivation of defined-benefit pension plans is to transfer (insure) some of this inescapable risk from relatively undiversified individuals to relatively diversfied institutions. If the Senators Howard M. Metzenbaum and Nancy Kassebaum of this world are serious about protecing workers and retirees (letter, April 13), let them reverse some of the recent cumulation of legislative and regulatory excesses that have hassled thousands of employers to terminate their defined-benefit pension plans.

Make Saving Pay

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Yes, Americans will have to save more if they want their industries to be more competitive (''Blame Japan? No. Save Ourselves,'' editorial, April 24).
The way to get Americans to save more is to make it worth their while. Editorials appealing for people to save are very helpful, but structuring taxes, so people will have an incentive to save, and suppressing inflation, so that what they do save is worth saving, are also important. Until Americans find it profitable to save, they won't.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
L.B.J.'s Great Society

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
''This country,'' President Lyndon Johnson once said, ''is rich enough to do anything it has the guts to do and the vision to do and the will to do.'' You'd never catch Ronald Reagan or George Bush expressing that kind of confidence in America, despite the patriotism they so fulsomely extol.
L.B.J. not only believed it, he acted on it - so enthusiastically that his ''Great Society'' program is widely considered today to have been grandiose, extravagant and a failure.
That's certainly what the Mssrs. Reagan and Bush, plus all too many contemporary Democrats, would have you believe - mostly in order to avoid domestic spending that might run up the deficit that dominates their politics. But was the Great Society really a costly failure? 
Not in the predictable but plausible view of Joseph A. Califano, a former Johnson lieutenant who was a principal architect of the program. At a symposium observing the 25th anniversary of Mr. Johnson's inauguration in 1965, he contended that the Great Society was alive and well, ''in Medicare and Medicaid, in the air we breathe and the water we drink, in the rivers and lakes we swim in; in the colleges our students attend; in the medical miracles from the National Institutes of Health; in mass transportation and equal opportunity.''
Sargent Shriver, who directed the Johnson ''war on poverty,'' concurred. Before an enthusiastic crowd at the L.B.J. Library, he listed a number of Great Society successes ''all still in existence, all helping millions of Americans today'' - Head Start, the Job Corps, community action grants, Foster Grandparents (which Nancy Reagan once proclaimed her favorite program), Upward Bound, community health centers, legal services for the poor, Vista, college work-study programs.
Mr. Califano and Mr. Shriver, as well as other Johnson Administration veterans - Bill Moyers, Jack Valenti, Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, Douglass Cater, Lee White, Charles Haar - pointed out that Mr. Johnson was the first President to take steps to enhance the environment, and that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (proposed by President Kennedy) and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were the high points of the civil rights movement.
''Did we legislate too much?'' Mr. Califano was willing to ask. Were mistakes made? ''Plenty of them.'' He cited inefficient payment systems for medical care, too many narrow categorical grant programs, lack of trust in the states and the middle class, too much faith in regulation, the failure ''to recognize that government could not do it all.''
But even the mistakes, he said, ''were . . . fueled by the frustration of seeing so much poverty, ignorance and illness amidst such wealth.'' Quoting Mr. Johnson, he said such mistakes were part of asking 'not how much, but how good; not only how to create wealth, but how to use it.' ''
The economist James K. Galbraith argued that Mr. Johnson had been right that the U.S. could afford whatever it willed itself to do. For all the cost of the Great Society, he pointed out, real per capita gross national product is 60 percent greater today than in 1965; and ''publicly held national debt'' is 41 percent of G.N.P. now, 39 in 1965, ''essentially the same.'' Thus, ''we are not poor, and not broke . . . we can attempt the possible, without fear of ruin.''
Nor has experience, Mr. Galbraith insisted, borne out the arguments that ''social and environmental regulation wastes resources'' or that welfare causes the poor not to work -''to the contrary, welfare clients . . . must supplement their meager benefits with work . . . in order to survive.'' Even some conservatives, he said, now acknowledge that the evidence suggests ''better welfare, not less welfare.''
A conclave of old L.B.J. hands, most stepping gingerly around the war in Vietnam (''I wasn't involved in that''), is not the place, of course, for a final judgment on the Great Society, or on Lyndon Johnson. But the gathering here did restore a useful perspective - a number of great achievements, some lasting, were registered; many Americans were given hope, help and a chance they would not otherwise have had; government was made to function powerfully and well until a divisive war shattered the Johnson ''consensus.''
It's too bad George Bush did not sit in on the Austin symposium. He might have learned something about vision and aspiration, confidence and compassion, the capacity of a President to lead, and how constricting ''prudence'' can be if that's all there is.

HEADLINE: Tax Rise 'on the Table' in Talks on Federal Budget

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Top Congressional leaders and President Bush reached partial agreement today on holding formal budget talks that would include negotiations on spending and on raising taxes.
Participants at the 90-minute meeting confirmed that tax increases - which President Bush has repeatedly ruled out in ''read my lips'' responses harking back to his 1988 Presidential campaign pledge - would be discussed.
''The assumption is that everything is on the table,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington.
The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, echoed that view. ''I don't know you can have discussions otherwise,'' he said. Asked specifically whether that meant taxes were on the discussion table, he said, ''Everything, everything.'' 
A spokesman for an Administration official who was at the meeting, held in Mr. Bush's private White House quarters, said Mr. Foley's and Mr. Dole's remarks accurately reflected the Administration views on the discussions.
 
Another Session to Come
''We didn't discuss any specific ingredients for a budget package but how to go about future talks,'' Mr. Foley said, adding that the lawmakers would meet again with the President early this week after consulting with their colleagues on Capitol Hill.
A key concern for Democrats about formal budget negotiations has been the President's willingness to make tax increases a subject of discussion.
Before the meeting, the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, sought to play down expectations of any breakthrough. ''We're not doing anything,'' he said.
The rare Sunday session involved Mr. Bush and Mr. Foley; the House Republican leader, Robert M. Michel of Illinois; the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and Mr. Dole from Congress. In addition to Mr. Bush, those attending for the Administration were Budget Director Richard G. Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Mr. Sununu.
While Democratic leaders have said repeatedly that discussions with the Administration will be essential at some point, the party is split over whether formal bargaining should come now or later in the year, after Congress has completed work on its own version of the budget and the spending bills that flow from it.
 
Wary of Political Trap
At least part of the President's motive in summoning the Congressional leaders was concern that a weaker economy and higher interest rates than the Administration predicted in January have rendered earlier White House budget calculations obsolete.
But Democrats, wary of a political trap, also see Mr. Bush's eagerness for immediate talks as an effort to short-circuit the Congressional budget process before lawmakers adopt plans that conflict sharply with his priorities.
Last week, the full House of Representatives and the Senate Budget Committee approved budget measures for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 that seek military spending cuts far deeper than those proposed in the budget Mr. Bush sent to Congress in January. The Congressional measures, which do not require the President's signature, serve as guidelines for the spending and tax legislation that Congress must produce before the 1991 fiscal year.
Both the House budget and the one adopted by the Senate panel were approved with virtually no Republican support, and House Republicans said the President's budget was so obsolete that it was pointless to even offer it on the floor. Democrats who oppose immediate negotiations regard Mr. Bush's invitation to their leaders as an attempt to regain some control over the budget process when their party appears to have the upper hand.
 
Looking Back in Anger
As Mr. Foley and other Democrats made clear last week, one reason they remain wary of making deals with the White House at this stage is the bitter memory of last year's attempt at budget conferences between the White House and Congressional leaders. The 1989 negotiations, conducted before Congress began its own budget work, produced only a modest reduction in the deficit and led to a protracted partisan fight over Mr. Bush's proposal to cut the capital-gains tax rate.
Nonetheless, some Democrats believe that today's meeting was a signal that the President was willing to discuss tax increases as part of a larger budget deal. Representative Leon Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, said last week that negotiations were futile unless Mr. Bush was willing to put all issues, including taxes, on the table.
Despite his campaign pledge, Mr. Bush called for about $20 billion in new revenues in his January budget, with a chunk of that money coming from ''user fees'' on everything from camping in national parks to certain stock transactions and Federal meat inspections. The two Democratic budget resolutions call for the same $13.9 billion in revenue increases and $6 billion in ''user fees'' proposed by Mr. Bush, even though a number of lawmakers in both parties believe much larger tax increases are necessary. An Even Higher Deficit? Quite apart from any political maneuvering, both Congress and the Administration increasingly think the deficit for fiscal 1991 may be as much as $20 billion higher than the White House anticipated in January. That would require deeper spending cuts, larger tax increases, or both, in order to reach the $64 billion deficit level for 1991 imposed by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law.
If Congress and the Administration cannot agree on how to close the deficit gap, the law imposes automatic spending reductions that would be equally split between domestic and military programs. Just a few months ago, the Administration seemed willing to accept the automatic spending cuts on the theory that the reductions would fall more heavily on domestic programs favored by Democrats because the military budget was declining anyway.
But if the 1991 deficit is as large as many now fear, the cuts required in military spending would reduce the Pentagon budget by far more than the Administration could accept.

HEADLINE: Black-Korean Who-Pushed-Whom Festers

BYLINE: By M. A. FARBER

 BODY:
It started over some plantains and peppers, and maybe some limes.
On the afternoon of Jan. 18, Giselaine Fetissainte, a Haitian immigrant, strolled into the Red Apple, a Korean-American-owned grocery and produce store in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, in search of those items.
When she left minutes later in an ambulance, a deep-seated dispute over civility and color and economic power - a dispute that had previously damaged relations between Koreans and blacks in the city - had erupted anew. It has led to picket lines, boycotts, epithets and, without much success, the intervention of a half-dozen public agencies, including the Police Department and the Office of the Mayor. 
''Bloodsuckers!'' demonstrators chant daily through bullhorns outside the Red Apple at 1823 Church Avenue, now virtually empty of customers. ''Don't buy! Don't buy! Don't buy!'' The immediate question was what happened to Mrs. Fetissainte at the Red Apple, which is not part of the food store chain of that name, but one of a number of Korean stores on a busy commercial strip catering mostly to the Caribbean people who have recently settled in Flatbush. Was she, as she said, pummeled by store employees without provocation? Or was she, as the Koreans said, merely restrained after refusing to pay for goods and starting an argument? The larger issue is an apparently growing antagonism between Korean food merchants and black shoppers, an issue that has led to boycotts of a half-dozen Korean stores in Harlem; Jamaica, Queens, and the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn since 1984. In some instances stores have been forced out of business. In others they have survived after losing of hundreds of thousands of dollars in expected income.
Every day all over the city, blacks shop without incident at the great majority of 1,500 Korean produce stores and 500 fish markets. But in instances like the Red Apple confrontation the start-up elements are familiar: a slight or a fight, a suspicion of shoplifting, mutual indignation, cultural and language differences, demands for respect and justice - and the entry of an organized protest group. Robert (Sonny) Carson, a black community organizer who was once convicted of kidnapping, has been active in several boycotts.
Clean resolutions to these disputes have never been easy, with truces falling apart and black or Korean representatives challenging the legitimacy of others on their own side to negotiate or deliver on agreements. On Wednesday lawyers for the Red Apple obtained a court order to temporarily restrain pickets outside that store and another Korean grocery across the street. The order is being appealed, and the demonstrations continue. A hearing on the appeal is scheduled for this morning. A Special Test for Dinkins? Korean business leaders have portrayed the Red Apple case as a special test for Mayor Dinkins, who had taken part in efforts to resolve other clashes between blacks and Koreans and who campaigned last fall on a theme of uniting the city's disparate groups - what Mr. Dinkins called the city's ''gorgeous mosaic.''
''You are looked upon by many New Yorkers as a healer,'' Bo Young Jung, president of the Korean Produce Association, wrote the Mayor on March 1. ''It was under this premise that you were elected to lead our great city. What better opportunity to show your strength and ability.''
Mrs. Fetissainte's lawyer, Colin A. Moore, described her as a 46-year-old home attendant for a private agency who ''basically speaks Creole.'' She had shopped previously at the Red Apple store, said Mr. Moore. He offered this account of the incident on Jan. 18:
Around 5:30 P.M. Mrs. Fetissainte arrived at the store carrying a shopping bag that contained meat purchased elsewhere. She placed some plantains and peppers in one of the store's portable baskets, but seeing a line at the cash register, put the basket down and started to leave. Near the door she was stopped by Bong Ok Jang, the manager, who said he wanted to look in her shopping bag. Mrs. Fetissainte said he would first have to call the police. Mr. Jang then grabbed her by the back of the neck and slapped her several times on the face before she fell to the floor.
 
Very Different Accounts
Someone called the police and Mrs. Fetissainte was taken by ambulance to nearby Caledonian Hospital, where she was treated and released. Mr. Moore said his client had suffered ''trauma of the head, neck, abdomen, some contusions and now has a limp.''
Korean merchant leaders, confronted with rumors that Mrs. Fetissainte had been comatose and, as the Amsterdam News reported, ''savagely beaten,'' say her injuries amounted to a scratch on the face.
Mr. Moore's account differs from that provided by Korean groups. In their account, Mrs. Fetissainte went to the cash register with her merchandise, possibly including some limes, was told the cost was $3 and turned over $2.
Mrs. Fetissainte responded to the request for another dollar by hurling peppers at the cashier, who threw them back at her ''like a Ping-Pong game,'' said E. Michael Kang, the executive director of the Korean Produce Association. Mr. Kang said Mrs. Fetissainte spat at the cashier and began messing up register displays. Then, he said, Mr. Jang, the manager, put his hands on her shoulders to restrain her and asked her to leave. She then dropped to the floor, screaming.
As the police arrived, Mr. Kang said, the owner of the store, Bong Ok Jang's brother, Bong Jae Jang, returned from getting a haircut. Mrs. Fetissainte accused the owner of attacking her and, after being frisked and handcuffed briefly, he was given a summons to appear in Criminal Court. No date has been set.
 
'Carson's Storm Troopers'
Mr. Carson, who has been active in black community affairs, especially in Brooklyn, for more than two decades, said he was invited to help organize the Red Apple boycott by Flatbush residents.
The boycott started almost immediately and was directed at not only Red Apple but also a Korean-owned store across the street, Church Fruits. Some of the demonstrators - ''Carson's storm troopers,'' Mr. Kang calls them - say there is a business relationship between the two stores, which the owners of both stores deny. But when the incident occurred on Jan. 18, a Red Apple employee who had missed a ride home at the close of the evening was frightened and ran into Church Fruits, Mr. Kang said. For having given ''refuge,'' he said, Church Fruits was being punished.
Both Red Apple and Church Fruits have been owned by their current proprietors for two years and together employ more than 20 people. Ordinarily, Red Apple grosses $2,000 a day and Church Fruits, $7,000, the owners say. For the last three and a half months, they say, daily receipts have been $10 to $30.
At Red Apple the other day, employees stayed near the back of the narrow store, staring at the wooden floor while one worker washed the front window. ''Do a good job,'' a stalwart demonstrator, Aton Ruh, taunted from behind a police sawhorse. ''I see a little spot.''
 
'Don't Even Think About It'
Mr. Ruh turned his attention to a woman who approached the door of Red Apple. ''You know better than that, ma'am,'' he said. ''Don't even think about it.'' She walked on.
Mr. Ruh, who was born in the Bahamas and brought to Brooklyn as an infant, put down his bullhorn long enough to say that he was associated with the Flatbush Frontline Collective, ''which started this boycott,'' not with another group that, he lamented, is wrongly given credit for it. He said there could be no resolution of the Red Apple case until employees of the store were arrested and prosecuted for assault and both Red Apple and Church Fruits were shut down.
''People say the Koreans work hard,'' Mr. Carson said, ''but they don't have a monopoly on working hard in America. Nobody's worked harder than the blacks, and we didn't get paid for it.
''We are not going to tolerate continued assaults by people who don't live in our community, don't employ people in our community, don't spend in our community and don't have our best interests at heart.'' he said. ''In the future there'll be funerals, not boycotts.''
 
Store Owner Sold Out
Closings or transfers of ownership have followed most previous boycotts of Korean stores by blacks in the city -a fact not lost on the Korean leaders in the Red Apple case. ''As first-generation immigrants, we cannot be told to pull up stakes and leave whenever altercation takes place without a fair hearing,'' Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean-American Small Business Service Center, wrote Mr. Dinkins in late January.
The first organized boycott, Mr. Kang said, began against several stores on West 125th Street in 1984 and lasted more than a year. Efforts to negotiate a settlement were made by Mr. Dinkins, then City Clerk, and Lloyd A. Williams, president of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce. The Korean store owners eventually moved elsewhere and Korean leaders rejected a proposal for a $52,000 public relations campaign by a black company headed by Mr. Williams.
Mr. Williams, in an interview last week, stressed that the vast number of Korean stores in the city have never been boycotted. He said that cultural exchanges in Harlem had helped bring Koreans and blacks together but that many Korean store owners exhibited an attitude of misplaced ''superiority'' and that when trouble arose at a store, the response of the Korean community was merely to put up a united front and wait the situation out.
A second boycott, of a Korean fish store in Jamaica, Queens, in 1986, Mr. Kang said, was settled ''within the neighborhood.''
 
'A Life of Its Own'
In 1988, Tropic Fruits on Fulton Street in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant section was boycotted for more than four months following an altercation with a customer. A settlement was reached, but the store owner, who now drives a taxicab, sold his business. It is not clear whether the settlement, which called for printed apologies by the Koreans, Korean deposits in black-controlled banks, Korean donations to community organizations and sensitivity training, has been carried out.
Within a week of the Red Apple boycott, Brooklyn police commanders arranged a meeting of community leaders. It went nowhere, as did similar efforts by Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President; Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, and others.
The Mayor's office has been particularly involved since mid-April, after Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch met with a group of Korean leaders and, during a visit to the Red Apple site, was shouted down. The Dinkins administration is believed to be opposed to any solution that would force the closing of Red Apple and Church Fruits but is uncertain who, if anyone, deserves criminal prosecution.
Mr. Lynch said this week that the protesters had rejected a moratorium and that the boycott ''seems to have taken on a life of its own.'' He said the Mayor's office, having formed a ''fact-finding'' committee of Koreans and blacks, was still engaged in ''quiet negotiations.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Send Connecticut Budget to Governor

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 5

 BODY:
Democrats in the House gave final passage today to a revenue plan that takes money from two reserve funds and changes state tax laws to raise $339 million to erase this year's budget deficit and balance next year's budget without a tax increase.
The revenue plan passed on an 84-to-65 vote and now goes to Gov. William A. O'Neill, who is expected to sign it into law. Four Democrats joined the Republican minority in voting against the budget, while a lone Republican, Representative Eugene A. Migliaro Jr. of Wolcott, voted for the budget. 
The spending portion of the state's $7.05 billion budget, a separate bill under state law, received final approval in the Senate on Friday.
Total state spending will increase by 6.1 percent over this year. It is the smallest percentage increase during the O'Neill administration's nine years.
 
'It's Fiscal Insanity'
''It's difficult times, folks,'' said the House majority leader, Robert F. Frankel, a Stratford Democrat. ''But we're delivering services, and we're doing it with the smallest growth in state spending in recent history. And with no new taxes.'' During nearly five hours of debate today, House Republicans repeatedly criticized the Democrats for relying on $300 million in one-time revenue to erase this year's budget deficit and balance next year's budget.
''We're running, as an individual would, to the bank, and hitting the cash advance,'' said Representative Robert A. Maddox Jr., a Bethlehem Republican. ''It's fiscal insanity.''
To erase this year's deficit of $246 million, the Democrats will empty two reserve funds, taking $52 million from the property tax relief fund and $102 million from the budget reserve fund.
By leaving the books from the current fiscal year open into August, the plan credits $25 million in corporation tax receipts to the current fiscal year.
With other minor tax changes raising another $9 million in the current fiscal year, the state will carry a deficit of $58 million into the fiscal year beginning July 1.
In the fiscal year 1990-91 the Democrats will increase revenues by $99 million, mostly by extending the capital gains tax to out-of-state residents selling property in Connecticut to raise $10 million, accelerating payments on corporation taxes to raise $45 million and accelerating inheritance tax payments to raise $30 million.
The plan came under criticism from some Democrats, who faulted it for not overhauling the state's tax system.
The chief author of the package, Representative William J. Cibes, a Democrat of New London, also found fault with the program. ''It meets the needs of the people of the state for this year,'' said Mr. Cibes, the House chairman of the Finance Committee. ''Our real problem is not the one-shot revenues, but our over-reliance on a static tax base that does not grow, our overreliance on the sales tax, our over-reliance on a hodgepodge of other taxes.''
In addition to criticizing the reliance on one-time revenues, the Republicans have maintained that the economic assumptions behind the budget are too optimistic.

HEADLINE: Long Honeymoon for Chicago Mayor

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 6

 BODY:
In a city known for bare-knuckles relations between politicians and the press, Mayor Richard M. Daley spent his first months in office getting the kind of reviews ordinarily reserved for four-star restaurants.
The favorable press attention inspired a spoof in a local political cartoon, which showed a brilliant sun ascending in the sky behind the Mayor while a gaggle of reporters warbled in unison, ''Thank you, Mayor Daley.''
More recently, there have been a few brush fires, but press coverage has been overwhelmingly positive. The Mayor, who just completed his first year in office, has offered an explanation for the good press: ''We're doing a lot of good things.''
Another explanation was put forth by Alderman Danny K. Davis: ''Rich Daley and his Administration have done an outstanding job of managing the media, getting by with rhetoric and symbols rather than substance.'' 
 
Fight Over School Board
Mr. Davis and others appeared at three protests at City Hall last week over the Mayor's delay in appointing a new school board. The issue could represent Mr. Daley's most serious test.
In the past, school board appointments have provided fodder for racially charged political battles. It was Mayor Jane Byrne's appointment of two white members to the board a decade ago that sowed the seeds for a revolt among black voters, culminating in the 1983 election of Harold Washington, the city's first black mayor.
But for the most part, even Mayor Daley's critics agree that he has considerable strength and is a strong favorite to win re-election next year.
The Mayor continues to benefit from the disunity that has characterized his opposition, which rests chiefly with the black electorate. After Mr. Washington's death in 1987, black voters were divided between the two black politicians who sought to claim his legacy, and those fissures have not healed.
 
All the Familiar Problems
For Mr. Daley, the most daunting challenges are governmental, not political. Not so distant from the gleaming skyscrapers that etch the sky over Chicago's Loop, many neighborhoods are struggling. With the exception of a handful of prosperous areas being gentrified near the business district and along the North Shore of Lake Michigan, many neighborhoods suffer from poverty, inferior schools and crime.
Two decades ago, many of these areas offered good-paying, unionized jobs, which provided the fruits of the American dream for working-class families. But in Chicago today, as in many other cities, relatively few good jobs remain for those without a skill or a college education. In Chicago, where half of all students drop out of high school, that means a huge number of people eligible for little more than welfare or minimum-wage work.
In recent years, the number of black people in Chicago has surpassed the white population. But the city's fastest-growing group is Hispanic, and many Hispanic people are poor and unable to speak English. At the same time, middle-class families of all colors flee to the suburbs.
 
Stressing Better Schools
''We have got to figure out a way to get families to stay in the city,'' said Mr. Daley, sitting in the same office that was occupied by his father, Richard J. Daley, from 1955 to 1976. ''The families won't stay if the schools are not good.''
In his election campaign, Mr. Daley made education a priority. He supported the movement for changing the local school system to shift power from a centralized bureaucracy to local schools and parent councils. And he appointed a vice mayor for education, Lourdes Monteagudo.
But Ms. Monteagudo came under fire after it was revealed that her daughter was attending a private school in the suburbs because Ms. Monteagudo deemed the public schools inadequate.
And the Mayor's critics say he has not done enough to promote control by parents and local school councils. About 50 demonstrators at City Hall on Wednesday clashed with the police in a protest aimed at forcing Mr. Daley to appoint 10 blacks to a new 15-member school board.
 
Five Are Arrested
Five people were arrested, and three black reporters complained that they were roughed up by the police. The reporters said they would file charges with the Office of Professional Standards, which investigates charges of police brutality.
Mr. Daley defended the police department. ''The police department isn't out there to conduct any brutality,'' he said. ''People who want to get arrested want the publicity; people who violate the law will get arrested.''
Mr. Daley has explained his delay in appointing school board members by saying the appointments are so important that they should not be rushed.
Political foes of Mr. Daley said the clash between demonstrators and the police will help unite black political factions against the Mayor. ''He's acting cowardly and dastardly,'' said Alderman Robert Shaw. ''Many blacks feel he is trying to manipulate the board so he can control it. He certainly does not have the best interests of school children in mind.''
But other political observers said they doubted Mr. Daley would suffer. ''These were people that would be against Daley if he were reincarnated as St. Francis of Assisi,'' said Paul Green, who has written several books on Chicago politics. ''And most people in Chicago are aware of that.'' Horizon Without Vision? Mr. Daley has said that his administration is concentrating on improving the schools, but that the social and economic problems that produce inferior schools are not easily solved.
''Chicago isn't any different than other cities,'' he said, ''and I don't have a crystal ball that I can look at to find the answers.''
While conceding that Mr. Daley faces gigantic challenges, some governmental and political experts say the Mayor should use more of his political capital addressing serious urban woes.
''Maybe it's too early to judge,'' said Gary Orfield, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, ''but nothing has emerged on the horizon yet to suggest that this is going to be an administration of big vision.''
Aside from his florid face, his flashes of temper, and his occasionally creative grammar, Mr. Daley's stewardship offers a dramatic contrast from his father's. But he does share with his father an impatience with criticism. ''What ideas do they have?'' he asks of his critics.
 
Mayor but Not Kingmaker
The fabled Democratic machine that Richard J. Daley bossed for nearly 20 years was largely disassembled years ago. Court rulings long ago abolished patronage in most city jobs, which provided the machine's muscle.
Far from being a kingmaker on the national political scene, as his father was often regarded, Mayor Daley seldom makes endorsements. Unlike his father, he is not the chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party.
The younger Mr. Daley has even discounted the importance of being a Democrat or Republican, a notion that would have brought fire into the eyes of his father, a Democrat's Democrat.
''Our generation is a lot different than our parents, who came out of the Depression, and were shaped by it,'' he said. ''We don't necessarily identify with political parties or institutions.''
 
Lists Programs He Backed
Mr. Orfield and others commend Mayor Daley for appointments that demonstrate a desire to form a racially diverse government, but they urge him to speak more directly to feelings of racial hostility.
Mr. Daley bristles at such criticism. He pointed out that he sponsored an affirmative action program for city contractors. He has backed a program in which the city would sell vacant land for $1 to developers who promise to build houses for those with moderate incomes. He has ordered stepped-up attacks on rodents in poor neighborhoods.
Mr. Daley succeeded where Mayor Washington had failed and pushed through the City Council a revision of the city's housing code, long resisted by Chicago's powerful trade unions, that would allow use of plastic pipes, rather than copper, in some new construction and thus lower the cost of housing.
Mr. Daley also argues that he has demonstrated his courage by advancing plans for a new airport on the city's Southeast Side. The airport would require the demolition of hundreds of homes and has triggered an uproar among residents of the area, a mostly white section that strongly supported Mr. Daley in the mayoral race.
''It wasn't popular,'' Mr. Daley said of the plan, ''but it's the only way that area will survive. Isn't that vision? Isn't that a long-range goal?''

HEADLINE: France Regains Economic Strength

DATELINE: PARIS, May 5

 BODY:
Although German reunification worries many Frenchmen, its approach has been welcome news for the Paris Bourse and for France's economy in general.
Unification is expected to bring brisker economic growth to West Germany as it rushes to rebuild East Germany, and this will give France, the Federal Republic's largest trading partner, a powerful tug forward.
At the same time, fears that the unification process will mean higher inflation in Germany have caused many investors to flee the Frankfurt stock market in favor of the Paris Bourse. As a result, French share prices moved steadily upward in April, reaching a record high April 20, before sliding slightly. 
 
Sudden Stability
But worries about Germany were not the only reason that April in Paris became the slogan for many globe-trotting investors. Inflation worries persist in the United States, the stock market has gone haywire in Japan and a staggering attack of stagflation has mired Britain.
''Suddenly, France looks the most stable of the major industrial countries,'' said Warren Oliver, an economist with UBS Phillips & Drew, a London brokerage.
It is a vastly different picture from that of three years ago when France was dubbed ''the slow man of Europe'' because of a protracted economic malaise characterized by a subpar growth rate of less than 2 percent, unemployment of more than 10 percent and a yawning trade deficit.
France, which is Europe's second-largest economy after West Germany, owes its turnaround to some tough policies pursued by the Socialist and conservative governments in the 1980's. These policies have included clamping down on wages and tightening credit to bring inflation under control, reducing corporate taxes and deregulating financial markets.
''The greatest success of the current Government is bringing inflation down from 12 percent in 1982 to about 3 percent at present,'' said Didier Paquot, an economist with DRI Europe, an economics consulting firm.
 
Higher Growth Estimates
As the recovery in France started to flag, German unification provided a surprise push, causing many economists to raise their forecasts. UBS Phillips & Drew predicts that France's economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 percent this year, compared with a forecast of 3.7 percent for West Germany, 2 percent for the United States and nine-tenths of a percent for Britain.
As Bonn spends tens of billions of dollars to rebuild East Germany, its spending will not only spur West Germany's economy, but will also mean that the Germans will look to France for products ranging from glass to computers. What is more, as East Germans start to climb the economic ladder, thanks in part to the exchange of West German marks for East German marks, they are more likely to buy French-made Renaults and Peugeots than the more-expensive BMW's and Mercedes made in West Germany.
At the same time, France seems to be better able to capitalize on the German opportunity now than it has been for years. Economists say the seeds of France's economic resurgence were sown several years ago. Many Socialist officials now concede that the Government fueled inflation, hurt industrial competitiveness and swelled the trade deficit in the early 1980's when it allowed wages to climb and engaged in vigorous pump priming to help overcome the effects of the 1970's oil crisis.
In 1983, the Socialists sharply changed tack. They adopted a far tighter monetary policy and made a pact with labor to hold down wages. The Government's main goal was to bring France's inflation rate down to the level of West Germany's.
 
'Finally Reaping Its Fruits'
Now French officials feel like breaking out the champagne because many economists predict that later this year France's inflation rate will fall below West Germany's for the first time in decades.
''A decade-long policy of economic reform is finally reaping its fruits,'' said Mr. Oliver, the UBS Phillips & Drew economist.
After years of being ridiculed as a soft currency, the French franc is increasingly being viewed as a hard one. Not only that, as the West German mark has sunk to its lowest point in two years against the French franc, French authorities, in a reversal of roles, are talking about intervening in the money markets to defend the once-almighty mark.
For years, whenever the Bundesbank raised its interest rates to hold down inflation, the Bank of France scurried to increase its rates to keep the franc from falling against the German mark. Recently, however, France has asserted its independence.
On April 26, the Bank of France, confident about the franc's stability, lowered its key interest rate to 9.5 percent, its second quarter-point reduction in three weeks. The franc hardly budged after the announcement.
 
Moving Money to France
The cost of rebuilding East Germany and of swapping West German marks for East German marks have made the German currency look softer and the franc harder. This outlook has encouraged many bond buyers to move their money from Germany to France. As a result, the real interest rates on French long-term Government bonds, which were 2 percentage points above those of German Government bonds late last year, are now just eight-tenths of a percentage point higher.
''This is the most tangible evidence of a new optimism about the French economy,'' said Christopher Kwiecinski, an economist with Banque Indosuez.
The drop in rates is expected to help stimulate business investment in France, which many economists were already predicting would rise by more than 10 percent this year.
French investment has boomed for several years as companies scramble to prepare for the European Community's barrier-free market at the end of 1992. Once-provincial French companies are aggressively seeking business, not only on a European scale, but also worldwide.
 
Trade Deficit Narrows
Recently, France also got some good trade news: its March trade deficit was $151 million, less than a third of what some economists had forecast. This is causing some economists to predict a far lower trade deficit than last year's $9 billion. Despite the upbeat news, there are plenty of worries in France, mainly the stubbornly high unemployment rate.
There are also fears that the trade deficit could again get out of hand. The Government is encouraging people to save more, which would help hold down interest rates and would mean the French would consume -and import - less.
And as the franc gets stronger on the currency exchange markets, it increases France's competitiveness problems by making French exports more expensive. Perversely, this newfound strength could end up making France's trade deficit worse.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Pact On Fund Rise And Voting

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 6

 BODY:
Finance ministers of the leading industrial countries agreed today on the difficult question of rankings in the voting hierarchy of the International Monetary Fund, clearing away one of the last main obstacles to an increase in the fund's $120 billion of resources.
They also decided that the increase would be 50 percent, representing a victory for the United States, which had refused to go above that figure. Most other countries had wanted an increase of at least 67 percent. The fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, had originally called for a doubling of the capital. Before the increase takes effect, approval will be needed from the parliaments of the member nations of the I.M.F. and its sister lending organization, the World Bank. 
The meeting was held in a room in the Senate wing of the United States Capitol, the first time that has been the site of a Group of Seven gathering. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, anxious to show the ministers where American laws are made, took them on a sight-seeing tour before the meeting began.
The officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations gathered there to thrash out global economic problems on the eve of a meeting of the 152 Governments that belong to the I.M.F. and the World Bank. The Group of Seven consists of finance ministers and central bank governors from the United States, Japan, West Germany. France, Britain, Italy and Canada. Under the agreement, Japan and West Germany will share the No. 2 ranking at the agency. According to an agreement in principle also reached today, Britain and France will share the next position, but certain technical details still remain to be worked out.
The I.M.F., like the World Bank, decides policy on the basis of a weighted vote of the membership. The rankings are determined by each country's contribution, which in turn is linked to relative economic strength.
The United States, with about 20 percent of the capital in both institutions, has the largest vote. Japan, with its stunning economic growth, rose from No. 5 to No. 2 at the World Bank and had been seeking a similar jump at the I.M.F. But the situation was complicated at the fund because of Britain's longtime reluctance to cede the No. 2 spot for reasons of national prestige.
Britain's Lord Keynes provided most of the intellectual energy for the I.M.F.'s creation during the waning days of World War II.
The Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decided to yield earlier this year, but then could not agree with France on which should be No. 4 after the United States, Japan and West Germany.
''We have done this to assure that the quota increase goes through,'' said an aide to John Major, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer.
There has been broad speculation that part of the arrangement between Britain and France involves a concession by France to allow the headquarters of the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to be situated in London. This bank, which will make loans to spur the economic revival of Eastern Europe, was the brainchild of President Francois Mitterand of France, who wanted the headquarters in Paris.
 
German Reunification Discussed
The Group of Seven ministers also discussed the economic implications of German reunification. They agreed that there were likely to be considerable long-term benefits for the world economy.
According to a communique released tonight, the ministers said the process of German monetary union ''would contribute to noninflationary global growth and to a reduction of external imbalances.''
The ministers also said the process would ''contribute to positive economic developments in Eastern Europe, which at the same time are supported by the international community.''
There has been anxiety about the short-term inflationary impact of the union, but the West German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, and the Bundesbank president, Karl Otto Pohl, told the other ministers today that those fears were exaggerated.
East German citizens will be able to swap most of their marks for West German marks on a one-for-one basis when a German monetary union occurs July 2.
The Group of Seven ministers held a similar meeting in Paris on April 7. At that time the concern was the falling Japanese yen, which makes Japanese goods less expensive abroad.
Although the yen has subsequently stabilized, the ministers repeated their assertion in Paris that the yen's fall ''may have undesirable consequences,'' an indication of continued anxiety.

Argentina's Zest For Privatization

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
PRIVATIZATION, the process of turning a state enterprise into a private one, is all the rage in Eastern Europe. But perhaps nowhere in the world is it more popular than in Argentina, where the rush to sell off state companies is producing bargain-basement deals to lure reluctant foreign buyers.
The Argentine labor movement, fearing mass layoffs, had successfully resisted earlier efforts at privatization. But the spectacular failures of state enterprises in Eastern Europe have helped to produce a sea change in Argentine public opinion, one recorded in numerous polls. 
''People have jumped from thinking that state ownership is the solution for the nation's economic woes to the view that the private sector, particularly foreign companies, will somehow solve everything,'' said Juan Luis Bour, chief economist at the Foundation for Latin American Economic Studies, an Argentine research group financed by corporations.
Even the unions that represent state workers are soft-pedaling their opposition. And in this atmosphere, Congress has authorized President Carlos Saul Menem to privatize more than 30 state operations, mostly by selling them to foreign companies or granting concessions to foreigners. The biggest projects, selling the national telephone company and the state's international airline, are to be completed by the end of the year.
With the Argentine economy in disastrous shape, foreigners have shunned investment here. The gross national product is the same $2,200 per capita that it was in 1960, and the Government budget deficit is a hugely inflationary 10 percent of G.N.P. (compared with less than 2 percent in the United States). President Menem has cut public spending sharply in recent months, and this cutback has reduced both the deficit and the inflation rate. The austral, the Argentine currency, has even strengthened. But the price of less Government spending has been a severe recession.
The hope is that privatization will come to the rescue, attracting new investment to a poor but finally stable economy. The reality is that the country's stability is only two months old, a rather short track record, and foreign companies are participating in the privatization mainly because American banks have sweetened the investment pot.
The sweetener is cancellation of at least $5 billion in foreign debt as principal payment for the phone system and the airline. The $5 billion represents 10 percent of the money that Argentina owes to foreign commercial banks, and one or two banks could become part owners of the companies.
''Privatization is the healthy way to convert debt to equity, and the banks are behind the process,'' said Manuel R. Sacerdote, head of the Bank of Boston operation here. Besides, many banks believe Argentine debt is not very collectible, so why not use it for investments that might earn profits.
The phone company, called Entel, illustrates the arrangement. Entel hired Morgan Stanley & Company as its investment banker, and the offer that was finally drafted would sell 60 percent of the company for $214 million in cash and at least $450 million worth of canceled debt. The face value of that amount of debt must be a minimum of $3.5 billion in the phone company deal (and $1.5 billion in the airline deal), but if American banks were to sell $3.5 billion of the debt on Wall Street today, they would get only 13 cents for each dollar of debt, or $450 million.
Six foreign companies qualified last week as final bidders. The bidding rules conveniently prohibit them from paying more than $214 million in cash, restricting the bidding to the cancellation of additional debt, instead. The hope is that the winning bidder will go as high as $7 billion in canceled debt, or $910 million if this much debt were sold on the Wall Street market. That would be a combined cash and debt outlay of $1.12 billion to control a company whose assets were valued by Deloitte Haskins & Sells, the American accounting firm, at more than $4 billion.
The six bidders include three in partnership with banks: Bell Atlantic with Manufacturers Hanover; the Spanish national phone company with Citibank, and Italy's national phone company with the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. The winner among them is also required to invest $500 million a year in new phone lines and equipment to satisfy pent-up demand.
Phones now take years to obtain, but the winner does not have to bring in any of the $500 million from abroad. The goal is to earn this amount within Argentina and then reinvest it. The Menem Government is allowing leeway on rate increases to help achieve this goal. But in the event of a shortfall, the penalty is only the loss of monopoly status, essentially a slap on the wrist. Competitors would not be likely to show up quickly, leaving the privatized phone company a de facto monopoly.
The foreign company would still be free to operate the company or sell to another company, or perhaps sell back to the Government. That is what the British owners of Argentina's railroads did in the late 1940's, rather than invest in modernization. The buyer then was Juan Domingo Peron, and the purchase created the nation's first huge state enterprise. Citicorpd (Citibank) Morgan, J. P.d (Morgan Guaranty Trust)

GERMAN OFFICIALS SEE REUNIFICATION AS ECONOMIC BOON

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
German reunification will spur economic growth in Europe and the world, and contrary to widespread expectations, should not set off more world inflation and higher interest rates, West German officials said at a global monetary conference here today. ''The stability of the D-Mark and the soundness of public finances remain safeguarded,'' Theo Waigel, the West German Finance Minister, said at the policy-making Interim Committee meeting of the 152-nation International Monetary Fund.
When the currency union goes into effect on July 2, most East German marks will be swapped for West German marks on a one-for-one basis. The initial announcement of the union provoked a rise in long-term bond rates in West Germany, an indication that the investors in the financial markets expected inflation to rise as well. 
 
Fear About U.S. Rates
With Japanese interest rates increasing at the same time, there were fears of an upward spiral that would pull up rates in the United States.
West German officials were at pains today to assert that the expectations on inflation in Germany have been vastly overstated. Government officials of other nations are coming around to that view, as are some private economists.
Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, said in an interview that the increase in money supply resulting from the currency union would be about 10 percent, more or less matching the added production potential of East Germany. Prices generally rise when a nation's supply of money grows faster than the total amount of goods it produces.
He also noted that it was unrealistic to assume that everyone in East Germany receiving West German marks would immediately spend them, causing a huge demand for goods, feeding inflation.
''On balance, it is realistic to assume that this will not lead to unreasonable inflation pressures,'' the central bank chief declared.
 
Little Borrowing
And Mr. Waigel, noting that West German public-sector borrowing has been running at the lowest level in 20 years, said the remaking of the East German economy should not put too much strain on the capital markets.
The German discussion came as the members of the monetary fund debated the arrangements that will lead to a $60 billion increase in the amount the fund has available to lend to poor countries.
In the debate on the quotas, third world countries expressed unhappiness that the rise would not be greater.
They are worried that the West's new focus on Eastern Europe and the huge demands on I.M.F. credits from countries weakened by years of central planning will hurt third world development.
The seven leading industrial powers, the principal donors to the monetary fund, agreed Sunday among themselves on the $60 billion level, and there was little likelihood that this figure will change, despite complaints from the third world.
Officials of other countries were also coming around to the view that German currency union would not lift inflation. A senior French official interviewed today said the Germans were developing a sound and reasonable monetary process, and ''our opinion is that it will be on the safe side.''
 
Longer-Term Benefits
A senior American Treasury official who also spoke on condition of anonymity projected considerable benefits for the longer term, including faster economic growth and prospective improvement in American trade accounts.
He noted that German trade surpluses with the United States should decline as more German output is absorbed by domestic demand and less is sold on export markets.
The short-term adjustment ''will be reasonably well contained,'' he said. ''One can depend on responsible authorities in Germany.''
Private economists were divided on the inflationary impact. Gary C. Hufbauer, professor of international finance at Georgetown University, said the earlier fear of inflation was ''really a fear of the unknown.'' He added, ''When I did my own back of the envelope calculations, I couldn't see that big a stimulus.''
Professor Hufbauer also suggested that the Bundesbank itself might have spurred the earlier fears as part of bargaining tactics. Initially, the central bank wanted to exchange two East German marks for one West German mark, warning that more generous terms could be inflationary.
 
'A New Realism'
''Now it's a done deal,'' Professor Hufbauer said, ''and what we've got now is a new realism.''
He also noted that although long-term bond yields had increased, they have been moving down for the last two weeks, an indication that market operators feel the inflation fears have been exaggerated.
But C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based policy-research group, said he still believed the inflation threat was very real.
Mr. Bergsten, a former senior American Treasury official, noted that it would take some time before the East Germans would be able to match their increased income with new production and that this timing difference could mean more inflation.
In addition, he pointed out that the German economy was already at full capacity and that any new demands on it could result in price increases.
Reacting to the quota agreement, Bernard Chidzero, Finance Minister of Zimbabwe, said, ''I hope the international community will be wiser and realize that siphoning off resources in Eastern Europe will create a very dangerous situation - explosive.''
 
No Diversion Seen
Both the I.M.F. and the World Bank insist there will be no diversion of resources by these organizations, which are the principal third world lenders,

HEADLINE: BUSH EASES STAND, SAYING NEW TAXES CAN BE DISCUSSED

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
The White House committed itself today to discuss new taxes in budget negotiations with Congress but stopped short of saying that President Bush is now prepared to accept higher taxes to reduce the deficit.
Instead of repeating Mr. Bush's ''no new taxes'' pledge, the White House shifted its stance for the first time, saying it would impose ''no preconditions'' on budget discussions. The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the President wanted ''an open debate that is unfettered with conclusions about positions taken in the past.''
 
Merely 'a Goal'
Although the White House has always been vague on the issue of how long Mr. Bush's campaign pledge against taxes would hold, Bush aides said today that the President really only intended the pledge to last for his first year in office. After that, a senior adviser said, it would be merely ''a goal.'' 
''His interest is in stimulating the economy and keeping strong, job-oriented growth on track,'' the adviser said. ''And he approaches that goal with the idea that taxation is not helpful in the process.''
The White House was clearly trying to walk a fine line today. Despite the offer to hold discussions without preconditions, Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Bush was not simply abandoning his oft-repeated campaign pledge against new taxes, but merely widening his options. In any event, most recent speculation about new taxes, on Capitol Hill as well as within the Administration, has focused not on higher income taxes but on other revenue sources.
 
Democrats Are Wary
Democratic Congressional leaders indicated that they would proceed with the budget talks, but they were clearly wary. A number of Democrats said they were not interested in going into budget talks that would conclude with the public impression that the Democrats proposed new taxes that Mr. Bush reluctantly accepted. ''We have absolutely no interest in asking for taxes and having a reluctant-bride President,'' a Democratic aide said.
Mr. Bush's position on taxes has softened at least partly because of growing fears that a weaker economy and higher interest rates than the Administration predicted in January have overtaken earlier deficit projections.
In January, the Administration calculated that $36 billion would have to be cut from the budget for the fiscal year 1991 to meet the $64 billion deficit target mandated by law, and it offered recommendations that it said would accomplish that reduction. But because of the changing economic expectations, Administration officials say, a greater deficit reduction -perhaps an additional $10 billion or $20 billion - will be needed to reach the goal.
Democratic lawmakers suggest that rather than the $36 billion originally envisioned by the Administration, as much as $60 billion will have to be cut, or raised in new revenues.
 
Democrats to Meet
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, and the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, said today that they would meet with fellow Democrats on Tuesday to explore the President's invitation, extended Sunday night, to open discussions that would lead to a budget summit.
Mr. Foley said, ''I think we have to realize there is a process here that involves the President, there is the necessity of coming to some kind of agreement with the Administration.''
The President was scheduled to meet with Republican Congressional leaders on Tuesday to discuss the prospect of budget negotiations.
Although both parties have been careful to avoid taking the lead in proposing new taxes, most discussion has centered on increasing what the Administration likes to call ''user fees,'' like the Federal gasoline tax, rather than raising income tax rates.
 
Nothing in, Nothing Out
Asked if the White House would revive the gasoline-tax idea, which was proposed last October by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, and rejected by the White House, an adviser said that ''all the ideas are old, and all have been rejected.''
''We're not ruling anything in or anything out,'' said the adviser.
Mr. Foley and Mr. Mitchell met late this afternoon with 15 other Democratic leaders from both chambers to discuss the meeting with the President on Sunday evening. The uncommon Sunday session, initiated by the President, included Mr. Foley, Representative Bob Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole. On the Administration side, participants included the President; his chief of staff. John H. Sununu; Budget Director Richard G. Darman, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
Immediately after the meeting Sunday, Mr. Michel said: ''I don't know how you make these figures match without doing something on revenues. I don't think we're going to be talking about a small package of doings.'' Going On Separate Tracks? Mr. Foley and Mr. Mitchell said they were not ready to respond to Mr. Bush's proposal for formal budget talks until after conferring with the rest of the Democratic membership on Tueday.
One Democratic lawmaker, who asked not to be identified, said the leadership appeared to be heading toward a situation in which talks with the Administration would proceed on one track while Congress continued with its own budget work on another. ''The truth is you can't say no when the President asks you to sit down and talk,'' the Democrat said.''
The House has already approved a $1.2 trillion budget that would cut military spending to nearly $24 billion below the level recommended by Mr. Bush in January, and that would increase domestic spending above the levels sought by the President.
The Senate Budget Committee has completed its version of the budget, which also seeks deep Pentagon cuts. That measure is now ready for consideration by the full Senate if Mr. Mitchell brings it to the floor.
If the Congressional budget process were to proceed, the House and Senate would have to work out the differences in their two budget measures in a conference. The final plan, which does not require the President's signature, would then become the blueprint for individual spending and tax bills produced by other committees.
As Democrats tried today to decode the carefully crafted White House message, the strains in their own party were clear. Mr. Foley, who has been more receptive than Mr. Mitchell to the notion of a budget summit, faces opposition from House liberals who fear that negotiations at this point can only mean one thing - more money for the Pentagon than was envisioned in the budget resolution adopted by the House last week.
 
'Out of the Process'
''When the President asks our leadership to talk, they have no choice, but I'm worried that the defense number will be jacked up too high,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who serves on the House Budget Committee. ''The reason Bush is coming to the table is because he's been out of the process for a while and because he thinks our defense number is too low.''
Mr. Mitchell, who declined today to say whether he was prepared to recommend that his colleagues enter into negotiations, faces opposition from some of his key committee chairmen, notably Jim Sasser of Tennessee, who heads the Senate Budget Committee. Mr. Sasser has argued that the budget resolution adopted by his panel last week would slash the 1991 deficit by $43 billion without resorting to accounting gimmicks or requiring tax increases beyond those proposed in the budget Mr. Bush sent to Congress in January.
Mr. Fitzwater said today the two sides were motivated to put everything back on the table by ''the anxiety over a deficit that is fighting every reduction attempt that we can come up with.''
The savings and loan bailout is also putting pressure on the deficit. A current plan involving more than 141 ailing institutions could increase the deficit for the current fiscal year by more than $50 billion. But a measure before the Senate would exempt a large amount of the money needed in the future to close sick institutions from deficit calculations under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget balancing law.
 
Holding to a Philosophy
Mr. Fitzwater said the President agreed to Mr. Mitchell's proposal that no preconditions be set for the talks, but he did not specifically talk about the tax issue because ''his philosophy on this issue is quite well known.''
''What they did agree to was that they would not get involved in discussions about taxation or specific issues but rather to stick to the phrase of 'no preconditions' and begin an open debate that is unfettered with conclusions about positions taken in the past,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.
In an effort to develop a budget that reflects the changing priorities in defense and domestic spending, the President and the Congressional leadership have agreed to three basic operating principles, the spokesman said.
The first is that ''anyone can bring up an issue for discussion and debate.'' The second is that they keep their negotiations private ''so that we'll try to keep a little mystery in the marriage,'' Mr. Fitzwater said, and the third is that ''they will continue the process as long as they believe that it has a chance of being productive.''

HEADLINE: Japan Builds East Asia Links, Gaining Labor and Markets

SERIES: Japan's Turn to Asia; Surging Trade and Investment 0 First of two articles.

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 7

 BODY:
After having built its economic miracle on strong links with the industrialized West, Japan is now increasing its trade and investment in the buoyant economies of East Asia, creating a highly efficient manufacturing bloc in this vital region.
The shift, economists and diplomats say, represents a challenge to American companies both trying to maintain their investments in East Asia and trying to compete with the low-cost products from joint ventures of Japanese and other Asian companies. But consumers worldwide could benefit from the lower prices.
 
Plants in Several Countries
For example, six Japanese companies are now making videocassette recorders in Malaysia. Hitachi is shifting its production of some electric motors to Thailand, from which they will be exported to Japan and other countries. Japanese auto makers are also charging ahead and have built plants in several Asian countries. 
To provide the financial fuel needed to keep the new regional operations going, Japan's ''big four'' securities houses have rushed to open offices and start funds for investing in the area. The Yasuda Trust and Banking Company just purchased 20 percent of Malaysia's Pacific Bank Berhad. The seller: the American Express Bank Ltd.
For Japan, the surge of investment in Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, known as the four tigers, and the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines, offers an answer to labor shortages at home, gives it a presence in fast-growing markets and possibly a way around trade barriers in the West. For the nations in the region, Japanese investment helps to fuel economic growth and bring them advanced technology they can use to improve living conditions or to make better products themselves.
And if the trends continue, Japan's trade and investment ties to East Asia will eventually rival the country's economic links to North America.
Economists say Japan will not soon be able to replace the United States as a market or as a center for investments.
 
Potentially Faster Growth
But by strengthening its bonds with other East Asian nations, Japan is tying its fortunes to a part of the world that offers potentially faster growth than the West. In addition, Japanese success there could limit the effect on Japan of any protectionist measures taken by the United States or European countries.
Japanese companies are going beyond just pouring more capital into Asia and tapping its lower-cost labor. The Japanese are also moving to a new level of sophistication by transforming the region into a manufacturing base with the flexibility to switch among different plants and to alter products quickly to meet shifts in consumer demand. In doing so, the companies are also cultivating budding markets for advanced goods.
In short, the bonds between Japan and the other East Asian nations are no longer as simple as rich countries exploiting the natural resources and cheap labor of poor countries.
''In the Asia-Pacific region, economic relations can no longer be characterized in traditional North-South terms,'' said a report by the East-West Center in Honolulu, a Government-supported organization that studies links between the industrialized West and the economies of East Asia. ''By any measure, the explosion of intra-regional trade and investment of the 1980's is exceptional,'' and the trend of mutual technological and financial dependence ''promises to continue into the 1990's and beyond.''
 
American Influence Waning
As Japan's influence in the region gains momentum, America's is clearly waning. The East-West Center's report concluded that the United States will buy fewer products from the region and will supply less investment capital.
The East Asian economic integration promises to yield some unanticipated side effects. For example, if the United States does open Japan's domestic markets further to foreign goods, the real beneficiaries will probably be other East Asian manufacturers, many of them aligned with Japanese companies, rather than American companies.
''People may not like it, but Asian countries would benefit more from an open Japan than the United States,'' said Jun Tsunekawa, assistant director of the Asian research division at the Japan External Trade Organization, a Government body. ''That is the market they are becoming more integrated with. They will begin the real opening of Japan.''
But there is also concern in the region about Japan and its strength. The concern goes back to Japan's brutal record of repression in much of Asia during World War II, in part to support a Japanese strategy to dominate what it called the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
 
'Welcomed and Feared'
''It will take some time for people to feel more secure and comfortable with us,'' acknowledged Michio Mizoguchi, who in February was named Japan's Ambassador for Asia-Pacific cooperation. ''Japan is welcomed and feared.''
Japan's direct investment into Asia - mainly to buy land, build factories and acquire companies - quadrupled since 1985, to about $5.6 billion in the year that ended in March 1989. That was more than double the direct investment from the United States. Japan's overall trade with the United States last year, $141.4 billion, just edged out its total trade with Asia, $138 billion, but the Asian trade is growing faster.
Japan imported more from the other Asian countries last year, $49 billion, than it did from the United States. The trade flows within Asia were nearly double Japan's total trade with the European Community.
 
New Range of Operations
Some of the investment is an expansion of previous operations. For example, more and more elements of semiconductor production are taking place at plants in Thailand and Malaysia.
But there are also some new twists. The Japanese car manufacturing and assembly plants can ship parts and components to one another. Engines and electrical equipment might be made in Thailand, transmissions in the Philippines, steering assemblies in Malaysia. The result is a completed car, assembled in any one of several East Asian nations.
Most of these cars are sold in East Asia, but some may be exported to the United States or Western Europe. They never pass through Japan and thus do not add to Japan's trade surpluses with the rest of the world.
 
Transforming the Region
Techniques like that are transforming the region into a highly flexible manufacturing base. Plants can quickly shift production to two-door cars from four-door models, for instance. Or a plant in one country can pick up the slack from another, while maintaining low costs. The process is regarded as a model of how investment and trade ties are pulling the region tightly into Japan's economic orbit.
It has also meant that when Asian countries do threaten to become unstable, as China and the Philippines have in the last year, it is easy to continue production elsewhere without much interruption.
One sign of the growing prosperity that regional integration is bringing is that Australia, which long resisted identifying itself with Asia because of its European roots, is now more concerned about being left out of the boom.
''We now see ourselves as part of the Asia-Pacific region, but we have to work hard to make sure we remain a part of it,'' said Jeff Scougall, counselor in the Australian Embassy here.
Yoshio Suzuki, vice chairman of the Nomura Research Institute, described an increasingly common view here about a profound shift in global economic balance. He said the postwar Pax Americana is giving way to a tripolar structure, in which American economic domination of Asia and Europe is yielding to three spheres in which a regional power will dominate - Germany in a newly opened Europe, Japan in Asia, and the United States in the Americas.
 
Clear-Sighted Policies
Mr. Suzuki said that Germany and Japan were developing clear-sighted policies on how to build up the less-developed areas in their regions -Eastern Europe for Germany and Southeast Asia for Japan - while the United States was spending more time lamenting its loss of influence than on articulating a new strategy for developing the Americas.
In a darker vein, other Japanese warn that growing protectionist pressures in the United States and the unification of the European Community in 1992 will create a ''Fortress Europe'' and a ''Fortress America'' that will block access by Japan. In this view, the cultivation of Asia is not an option for Japan, but a necessity.
Initially, the attraction of these Asian countries for both Japan and the United States was cheap labor and a source of raw materials. That is still largely the case. Wages are still just 20 percent of those in Japan and Singapore. Japan has an acute labor shortage, encouraging Japanese companies to move factories elsewhere in the region.
While the East Asian countries welcome the factories, many complain that Japanese companies are not transferring manufacturing and other technologies to the region fast enough, and that the prosperity brought by Japanese investment ends up in too few hands.
 
Effective Counterbalance
Yet despite the growth of the Japanese role, few in the region are eager to see much more erosion of American influence in Asia. Some Asian officials see the United States as an effective counterbalance to Japan, and some Japanese see the United States's presence as a means of lessening fear of Japanese domination and designs. All sides see its involvement in the region as a way of insuring that American markets remain open to Asian exporters.
''There's a danger that with the convulsions in Eastern Europe, the United States might have its attention diverted,'' said Mr. Mizoguchi, Japan's Ambassador for Asia-Pacific cooperation. ''We can only hope the United States will not lose interest in this area.''
NEXT: Thailand's remarkable boom and Southeast Asia's future.

HEADLINE: Taxes and Political Peril

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
Most people in Washington now think some kind of tax increase is inevitable, and the holdouts, President Bush included, are finding it harder and harder to hold the line as the deficit soars.
But no one wants to take the responsibility for doing the deed. In the politics of placation that prevails in the capital these days, with officeholders determined to conform to the wishes of the electorate, it is considered political poison to advocate higher taxes. That's what the opinion polls seem to counsel; that's what politicians deduced from the defeat of Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic Presidential candidate in 1984, after he discussed a tax increase. 
Hence Mr. Bush's unvarying refrain, in the 1988 campaign and ever since: ''Read my lips: no new taxes.'' Hence the Democrats' far less catchy but equally determined resolve: Never again will we give you Republicans an opening to attack us as the party that taxes and taxes, spends and spends.
Now Mr. Bush has agreed to listen to talk about higher taxes, if not to join in, and the Democrats are looking for a way to take part in that conversation without winding up as the ones who always have to raise the subject. Both sides, in other words, are more preoccupied with covering themselves politically than with solving the fiscal problem. Both would probably settle for a no-fault tax increase, if such a thing could be devised in the dead of night.
Unfortunately, virgin births are every bit as rare in Washington as they are anywhere else.
Complicating the political calculus even more is the Chicken Little problem. Every spring, people say that if serious work isn't done on the deficit the sky will fall. But it hasn't yet, and that reduces the pressure to act.
The President was driven to initiate negotiations by the growing deficit, which includes a political threat almost as severe as that posed by seeming to renege on his promise to hold the line on taxes. Instead of needing a deficit reduction of $36 billion to meet Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget targets for the fiscal year that begins this Oct. 1, as originally calculated, the White House and Congress may have to come up with $45 billion or more, Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, has said, or even $55 billion or $60 billion, in the view of some leading Democrats.
 
Campaign Considerations
Mr. Bush would shrug off that problem at his peril, not only because of the Gramm-Rudman constraints but also because of the effect of deficits on interest rates. Sustained high interest rates, some Presidential political strategists believe, could topple the economy into recession just when Mr. Bush was mounting his re-election drive in 1992. ''That frightens me more than anything else I see on the horizon,'' one White House planner commented today.
But how do you square a tax increase with the campaign pledge - indeed, the whole political ethos that George Bush has projected to the nation?
Representative Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, suggested one ploy this afternoon: Things change, he said.
''There isn't any President who hasn't tried to make good on his promises,'' said Mr. Frenzel, who is retiring at the end of this term and can state his views in these matters with more candor than some. ''There's no President who hasn't lived through times that change, and maybe outdate some promises.''
 
Watching Out for a Duck
But most Republicans are wary of that idea. Far better, several White House tacticians have been saying in recent days, to try to raise more money through something that could be credibly labeled a ''user fee'' rather than a tax, defining the problem out of existence in order to avoid a political pitfall.
Doing that might run into trouble because of the definition supplied by Mr. Darman when asked at his confirmation hearing to explain what was a tax and what was not: ''If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.'' The Democrats have developed sharp eyes for webbed feet.
If, as some Republicans were suggesting today, the President's chosen ''user tax'' was an increase in the gasoline tax, he might have difficulty beyond terminology. Gasoline taxes have never been popular on Capitol Hill, and they are especially unpopular with Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the potent chairman of the Finance Committee.
 
Casting an Eye on California
Both at the White House and on Capitol Hill, politicians are going to be watching closely the result of a vote in California on June 5. A ballot initiative would lift the cap on state spending for transportation and permit an increase in the state's gasoline tax. The current tax is one of the lowest in the nation, the California road system is falling apart, and the state's entire political establishment, including top Republicans and Democrats, agreed to the compromise that put the initiative on the ballot.
''It's a very close fight,'' said William Schneider, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, ''and it's going to send a very important signal. The big question is, 'Is it safe yet to talk about taxes?' ''
Voters in New Jersey, Illinois and Texas have signaled at the polls in various ways in recent months that it still isn't. If the California electorate confirms that judgment, the prospect of a deal in Washington that includes both spending cuts and tax increases may prove as illusory as ever.

It turned out to be a lovely weekend in New York, much to the astonishment of the weathermen. There was barely a trace of the three inches of rain that some thought would deluge the metropolitan area. For all the ostensible science (''barometric pressure,'' ''relative humidity''), forecasting the weather seems approximately as accurate as forecasting the economy.
Perhaps weather forecasting has gotten too scientific, what with computers and satellites and tropical depressions. What's wrong with heeding the ache in grandpa's leg or, Heaven forbid, looking out the window?

HEADLINE: 'Bonfire' Protest Recalls 'Fort Apache' Solution;
Belated Outrage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
On the day that the protest over the portrayal of the Bronx in the upcoming movie ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' reached its peak, the New York City Board of Education was making a valuable effort to address a serious and related issue.
This was the day when Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez led scores of authors, artists, civic leaders and other New Yorkers into school-based libraries around the city to read to children. The purpose was to strengthen literacy skills by instilling an appreciation of literature. The Read Aloud Program sponsored by the Board of Education will ultimately be a stronger voice against the perversion of the image of poor people than recent political protests. 
What makes the book and the movie versions of ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' offensive is not simply the depiction of poor black and Hispanic people. It is also the fact that the book was published and the movie is being made in a vacuum that shrouds what is largely cultural wasteland in which, despite some notable exceptions, countless literary works by nonwhites are unpublished or poorly promoted.
If published, adequately promoted and read, these works would provide a view of the inner city that is much more authentic and much less disparaging than what is to be found in Tom Wolfe's book. Another problem is that wonderful stories written by award-winning African-American authors like Walter Dean Myers and Brenda Wilkinson about young people who are not white, not economically privileged and not criminals fail to be promoted beyond the young adult market. Apparently it takes nothing less than the vision and the resources of a black superstar like Oprah Winfrey to bring a black adult novel like Gloria Naylor's ''Women of Brewster Place'' to prime-time television. But for the most part the fault lies equally with the purveyors of culture, the consumers of culture and the now avid defenders of the cultural integrity of places like the Bronx.
Where was the hue and cry against the portrayal of black and Hispanic people when ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' was a best-selling novel? Part of the problem is, of course, that most publications have very few black and Hispanic literary critics. But aside from this, why did so few African-American and Hispanic publications even print reviews of the book? The feeling was evidently that as printed matter the negative depiction of blacks and Hispanics didn't matter. An appropriate slogan for this mind-set might be: ''If it's written down, we don't even frown. But if it reaches the screen, then we get mean.'' But of course this was wrong; the book was just the beginning. And as far as unfortunate depiction of minorities goes, the motion picture may not be the end.
Those who belatedly apply their outrage to the movie ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' are not entirely wrong for doing so. But they should be prepared to fight even more diligently on quieter fronts long after the film is forgotten. Advancing the causes of literacy and literature will first of all enhance the educational growth of black and Hispanic people. And it will also help to fill the cultural void in which stereotypes have started and flourished.

HEADLINE: Don't Judge Zaire by European Standards

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your April 21 editorial comparing President Mobutu of Zaire to Nicolae Ceausescu, the late Romanian dictator, falls into the error of judging African political culture by European standards.
The two regimes cannot be compared. Nor can President Mobutu's opposition to a multiparty system be understood without reference to the traditional African political system of consensus-building through dialogue, which some scientists call existential as distinct from the dialectics of adversarial democracy. It is a view shared by, perhaps, the majority of Africa's leaders, who fear that multi-party democracy will only lead to the resurgence of tribal divisiveness. That danger is nowhere more acute than in Zaire with its 220 ethnic groups.
It is surprising that a campaign against President Mobutu is under way at a time when the country's human rights record has shown appreciable improvement and when President Mobutu has opened a dialogue with individuals and organized groups, such as the churches, with a view to giving the country's political structures greater openness and responsiveness to public needs and desires.
As for American aid, the United States Agency for International Development closely supervises the funds allocated for projects in Zaire to make sure they are being properly expended.

The Weight of Mexico

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
One local paper said 10 million people had come to the capital to see the Pope, who arrived Sunday. It's conceivable. Some Mexicans say the country's population is now 90 million. Nobody can be sure.
When I lived here in the 1950's, the population of the capital was 2.5 million, and of the country 25 million. The rate of growth approached the limit but nobody was particularly worried. The country's only demographer told me that development would soon bring a balance, and he cited the U.S. as proof that rising living standards brought a lowered birth rate. 
Now at last the rate is dropping, but the population is still soaring, and standards are falling. Mexico will enter the 21st century with 100 million or more. Population is like a supertanker: it goes a long way before attempts to slow it take effect.
There have been huge efforts to expand education, health services, roads and such, but human misery is spreading much faster with the deluge of children, many abandoned.
The writer Carlos Fuentes, who refuses to live in Mexico City, has written a book called ''Christopher Unborn,'' about a child whose birth date will coincide with the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery in 1492. He will breathe fecal dust because only a third of the city's sewage is treated, and have a high level of toxic lead in his blood, which can cause mental retardation.
Thirty-five years ago you could ride a horse through scattered villages in the valley or up the empty hillsides, with the majestic volcanos on the horizon as the guiding landmark. Now the volcanos have disappeared into the acrid, slurpy air. These are the key problems underlying Mexican-U.S. relations. There's no place to go but north, and no matter how stringent the border controls, the human tide will overwhelm them unless this country becomes livable for more of its people.
According to an opposition politician, Mexico has to import 10 million tons of grain a year for survival, at $3 billion, consuming two-thirds of the value of its oil exports. Jesus Gonzalez Schmal, a moderate in the right-wing party PAN, argues that the country could feed itself again with proper agricultural policies and better cooperation with U.S. industry.
Like everybody else, he is indignant at the abduction for trial in the U.S. of a doctor charged with involvement in the torture-murder of an American drug enforcement agent here. But like many, he is worried about the drug traffic's impact on the society and says the doctor should have been arrested here and extradited.
Mexico is changing, with the rest of the world, but painfully, perhaps catastrophically slowly. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is moving to liberalize the government-dominated economy and encourage investment. He is popular. But officials don't have much of an answer to the question why foreigners should have confidence to invest when Mexicans send their money abroad, more than enough to cover the whole debt.
The Pope's visit reflects some of the change. When he last came, 11 years ago, the Government refused a reception and he convoked a church conclave where he denounced liberation theology. This time President Salinas welcomed him formally at the airport, and the Pope's message was solidarity and social justice. But still nothing about population.
This country is another example of shifting perceptions about creating a society that offers its people a fair chance, and how much harder it is to repair the damage of bad government than to recognize it. The tendency to blame Yanqui imperialists is waning, but sensitivities about the weight and arrogance of gringo neighbors remain acute. The invasion of Panama reopened old wounds.
The U.S. cannot escape the fallout of Mexico's desperation. Neither can it intervene in the clumsy, shortsighted ways it has in Central America. The opposition leader on the left, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, says the country has the resources and capacity to pull itself up if it had rule of law and honest government.
He is a nationalist who rejects U.S. hegemony, but he doesn't want to isolate Mexico or go for central planning. He hasn't quite got the message from Eastern Europe, but he does oppose authoritarian government and puts democracy first.
In this part of the world, it seems the U.S. hasn't quite got the message from Eastern Europe either. It's freedom, to be sure, but also out from under big brother. Mexico is in a bad way, too, and needs a sympathetic partner, not a neighborhood boss.

HEADLINE: Bass Family Gives Yale $20 Million for Ecology Institute

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, May 7

 BODY:
The Bass family of Fort Worth, Tex., gave Yale University $20 million today to establish an Institute of Biospheric Studies that will greatly expand the university's research into environmental issues.
''The gift powerfully enhances Yale's capacity to meet its responsibilities for academic leadership in an area of the utmost importance to the future of humanity and of the Earth that is our home,'' Yale's president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., said at a news conference announcing the gift.
The donation, which came from the Bass Foundation and the Philecology Trust, was presented by Edward P. Bass, who graduated from Yale in 1968 and also studied architecture at the graduate level there.
Mr. Bass, 44 years old, is a rancher and venture capitalist, and one of the heirs to the billion-dollar Bass family fortune originally made in Texas oil. He is also a director of the World Wildlife Fund, the New York Botanical Garden and the Jane Goodall Institute for Wildlife Research. He founded the Philecology Trust in 1986 to help non-profit ecological programs. 
 
Yale Improving Science Programs
''The future of life on this planet urgently requires the most sophisticated research and teaching to increase our understanding of the biosphere in all its complexity and diversity,'' Mr. Bass said.
Yale is well known for its strong undergraduate liberal arts curriculum and its law school, but in recent years Mr. Schmidt has made improving its science programs a priority. The 289-year-old school has 5,132 undergraduates and 5,643 graduate students.
''We will be the best in this area, I have no doubt,'' said Mr. Schmidt, who approached Mr. Bass a year ago to propose the creation of the institute for study of the biosphere -the zone of the earth, from the oceans and crust to the atmosphere, that supports living organisms.
 
Renovated Laboratories Planned
The Institute for Biospheric Studies will be formed principally from the university's departments of natural sciences, biology, geology and geophysics and the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
The gift will be used to renovate laboratories and classrooms, endow professorships and partially finance the directorship of the university's Peabody Museum of Natural History.
About $5 million will go toward the renovation of the university's Osborn Memorial Laboratories, which will house the institute's central facilities for biological sciences. Other Yale departments that will be involved in the institute include the School of Epidemiology and Public Health, its Law School, its School of Organization and Management and its Center for International and Area Studies.
Besides coordinating research and teaching on the biosphere throughout the Yale campus, the Institute will develop close ties with other institutions, like the New York Botanical Gardens, the Smithsonian Institution, the American Museum of Natural History and other universities and environmental organizations.
''In our increasingly crowded and polluted biosphere, man's future on earth depends as never before on an understanding of ecology,'' said Arthur W. Galston, the Eaton Professor of Botany.
The largest single gift to Yale was made in 1966. Paul Mellon, a 1929 graduate, contributed his $35 million art collection and $12 million to build the Yale Center for British Art.
Other large gifts to Yale include nearly $17 million in the 1920's from John W. Sterling, used for professorships, scholarships and buildings, $16 million from Edward S. Harkness in 1930 to build Yale's residential colleges and $15 million from John Hay Whitney in 1970.
The largest gift to a single institution is believed to be the $105 million that Emory University in Atlanta received in the 1970's from Robert W. Woodruff, the former chairman of the Coca-Cola Company.
 
Columbia and Spelman
Other recent large gifts include $25 million pledged to Columbia University in 1987 by John W. Kluge, the founder of the Metromedia Company, and $20 million donated to Spelman College in Atlanta in 1988 by the comedian Bill Cosby. The figures cannot be directly compared, of course, because inflation means a dollar in the 1920's was worth far more than a dollar today.
The Bass Foundation was founded by the Bass family in 1945 to support arts, cultural and conservation projects. Mr. Bass said the family expects to make several more donations to Yale over the next year.
Mr. Bass is the chairman of Space Biospheres Ventures, which is the developer of Biosphere II, a commercial research project in Tuscon, Ariz. It is a 2.5-acre closed system including a tropical rain forest, savannah, marsh, desert and marine zones, with human habitats and agricultural areas.
Mr. Bass's father, Perry Richardson Bass, graduated in 1937 from Yale's Sheffield Scientific School.

HEADLINE: Pine Barrens Lawsuit Halts L.I. Builders

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIDGE, L.I., May 7

 BODY:
A lawsuit seeking to limit development in the pine barrens of Suffolk County has halted construction in much of eastern Long Island since November.
Environmentalists say a delay in construction within the 100,000 acres covered by the suit is justified to protect Long Island's environment and fragile water supply. They want the towns of Riverhead, Brookhaven and Southampton to study the cumulative environmental impact of all projects proposed within the central pine barrens before any individual project can move forward.
Developers, already hurt by a softening housing market, say the suit has all but halted business in a large area of Suffolk County. In addition, they say the delay is driving up the price of housing in one of the few areas where moderately priced housing was being built. $3 Billion Amid Pine and Sand ''The construction industry on Long Island is already in a recession, and this is like the icing on the cake,'' said Phil Reed, president of Orr Associates, a small development company based in Miller Place. The towns are barred from granting permits to developers in the central pine barrens while the suit is pending. 
The environmental study would be a huge undertaking, encompassing 238 pending projects worth $3 billion in the pine barrens, an area of sandy soil and pine trees atop much of Long Island's underground water supply.
''The premise is to plan first and build second,'' said Carolyn Zenk, the lawyer for the Group for the South Fork, an environmental organization.
But environmentalists also hope the suit will force developers to sell their land to the county under a conservation program in which the county dedicated one-fourth of 1 percentage point of its sales tax to buy environmentally sensitive land. The total sales tax in the county is 7.5 percent.
The developers, who supported the program when it began in 1987, say the county should not buy up land just because the environmentalists tell them to. There is an orderly way to acquire land, they say; they predict dire consequences if too much land is removed from the tax rolls.
 
Water Competes With Housing
''The thing that troubles me is that you have two valid public purposes at conflict here,'' said Jim Morgo, president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group that develops affordable housing. ''These are the protection of the ground water, but also the providing of housing to people who can't afford to live anywhere else.''
The Suffolk County Executive, Patrick J. Halpin, said the conflict represented a search for middle ground between the environment and the economy, between land preservation and development. He said that although he was in sympathy with the environmentalists, ''Affordable housing is a legitimate concern. We have to strike a balance.''
''We have to be concerned about the cumulative impact of development in the pine barren region,'' Mr. Halpin added, ''but whether or not the way to accomplish that is through a lawsuit is subject to a lot of debate.''
For Mr. Reed, the lawsuit means simply that his future is uncertain.
His project in this Brookhaven community is modest: 15 units of housing, each priced at about $140,000, off Exit 68 on the Long Island Expressway. He received final approval on the project just days before the suit was filed.
 
Investment Is in Limbo
But his property is within the boundary covered by the lawsuit, and Mr. Reed found, to his dismay, that the suit prevented the town from acting on his application for a building permit. Now the project, and his investment, are in limbo. He, the towns and other developers have filed motions to dismiss the suit; the next court date is Friday.
Environmentalists say a cumulative impact study is crucial to Long Island's water supply, which is drawn from aquifers beneath the pine barrens.
''You don't build first and then find out you need to save the land afterward,'' said Richard Amper, executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, which brought the lawsuit.
Developers estimate that they have spent more than half a million dollars fighting the suit, and they say they cannot estimate the damage done to people in the construction industry who were left idle this spring. They say the unintended result of the suit will be delays that drive up the price of housing. #10% Price Rise Is Predicted ''I think this has caused untold millions of dollars in damages throughout the county,'' said John N. Prudenti, a lawyer seeking to build 176 units of housing to sell for under $200,000 apiece in Manorville.
Even if the suit is thrown out, or his project is removed from it at the next court date, Mr. Prudenti said he will have lost important months, with his money tied up in the project.
''It will probably raise the cost of the overall project, and the cost of the homes, about 10 percent,'' he said. ''It was our intention to keep the cost of the homes as low as possible.''
Builders and environmentalists disagree over how important the pine barrens are to the economy's future.
Michael A. LoGrande, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, a developers' group, said that many of the best proposals for affordable housing involved the barrens.
 
Housing Threat Is Disputed
''Most of the projects are condominiums, and not single-family homes on sprawling acres,'' he said. Many of the homes covered in the lawsuit would sell in the $135,000 range, he said.
But environmentalists say that many of the projects include only a few units of affordable housing, and that the developers are trying to blame them for a general slowing of the market.
''Development is generally slowing down on the Eastern seaboard, and the development community wants a scapegoat,'' Ms. Zenk said.
Mr. Amper said that regardless of how small the projects were, their total impact must be considered.
''The folks that want to build four houses probably aren't hurting a thing,'' he said. ''But there are 238 projects, and it seems certain that the construction of all will have an effect.''
 
Environmentalist Blames Towns
Ms. Zenk said she was sympathetic to the small developers' problems, but that the fault lay with the towns, not the environmentalists.
''It's unfortunate that the Government didn't work earlier to have an environmental plan in place,'' she said.
But Donald G. Partrick, president of the Long Island Builders' Institute, said of the environmentalists: ''They would just as soon see grass grow over the Long Island Expressway.''
The tension between the environmentalists and the developers was evident last month when Suffolk County agreed to pay $17.8 million for Hampton Hills, a 1,400-acre parcel in the pine barrens that had been the proposed site for 307 condominiums.
Environmentalists applauded it as the county's single most important acquisition. But developers said it was a waste of money because the project would have clustered the housing on 200 acres, and the developer had promised to donate the remaining 1,200 acres to the county.
Mr. Halpin said he hoped the two sides could seek a compromise. ''The real challenge will be not to allow the whole issue to become so polarized, and dragged out in the courts so long, that the only people who benefit are the lawyers,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Historian Links Birth Order To Innovation

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
COPERNICUS, who shattered traditional cosmology by contending that the Earth revolves around the Sun, was the second of four children. His bitter opponent, Tycho Brahe, was an only child.
Charles Darwin, whose theory of natural selection overturned traditional views of the creation and evolution of life, was the fifth child of six and Alfred Russell Wallace, the co-discoverer of the theory, was the last of six children. But George Cuvier, an upholder of the creationist view, was the first child of four, as was Louis Agassiz, another opponent of Darwin.
Frank Sulloway, a historian of science who proposes that birth order makes a startling difference in the progress of science, is himself the third of four children. 
Dr. Sulloway cites the roles played by these and thousands of other scientists as prime evidence for a provocative theory: researchers who challenge established views tend to be born later in their families while those who support the status quo tend to be firstborns.
His proposal comes at a time when the idea that birth order makes any difference in behavior is under fierce attack by social scientists. Despite the attacks, the birth order concept is an idea that will not die. Dr. Sulloway's study is perhaps the most elaborate among the continuing efforts of dozens of researchers to find a link between birth order and such things as managerial ability, drug abuse, criminality, and teen-age pregnancies. In 1988 and 1989 there were 45 scientific reports on birth order, more than a third of which found it had no effect.
Dr. Sulloway, who is now a visiting scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, may be living proof of his own theory. His first major work, ''Freud: The Mind of a Biologist,'' in 1979 scandalized orthodox psychoanalysts by saying that Freud borrowed much of his theory from the biological thinking of the period.
Now Dr. Sulloway has done it again. After years of research, he has proposed that firstborns are more likely to defend current theories and those born later are more likely to attack them. In the process, he is resurrecting the notion that birth order can to some degree steer personality in later life, an idea that most social scientists have come to reject.
''I'm skeptical of any reported effect for birth order,'' said Judith Blake, a sociologist at the University of California at Los Angeles. '' People get excited by the idea of birth order, but when you look at it scientifically, it evaporates.''
 
Support From Some Psychologists
But Dr. Sulloway's studies are finding support among some eminent psychologists.
''He has solid data,'' said Robert Zajonc, a psychologist at the University of Michigan. ''I can't argue with what he's found.'' Jerome Kagan, a psychologist at Harvard, called Dr. Sulloway's work ''the most extraordinary birth-order effect I've ever seen.''
Dr. Sulloway, a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation award, came to his view through the diligence of 19 years' labor and the assistance of scores of colleagues. For the last five of those years he squirreled himself away in a small, windowless office at Harvard.
There Dr. Sulloway finished his analysis of 2,784 participants in 28 major scientific controversies in the last 400 years. He included the 20 or so great revolutions of science, as well as some obscure controversies like the debate over phrenology. The main criterion was whether enough remained in the historical record about the scientific debate to evaluate the main participants.
Though he largely worked alone, he turned to nearly a hundred colleagues in the history of science, asking them to nominate the scientists to be studied. The historians judged the stands each scientist took, as well as as the scientist's political and religious views, family size and 40 other variables.
 
Birth Order and Innovation
Birth order was by far the strongest predictor of whether a scientist would accept or reject radically innovative ideas.
Of the 28 scientific revolutions, 23 were led by later borns. And in those with a firstborn as the leader - Einstein and Newton, for example - their prominent allies were for the most part later borns.
Of the 2,784 participants studied, 37 were siblings who joined in the same scientific controversy. Of the 7 firstborns among them, 6 opposed the radical new ideas being debated. And of the 30 younger siblings of these firstborns, 27 were supporters of the innovation.
''The overall probability that a firstborn will suppport a scientific revolution is 34 percent; the odds that a later born will do so are almost double: 64 percent,'' Dr. Sulloway said.
Dr. Sulloway reported the findings at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in February. Since he announced his findings, they have sparked continuing controversy even though they are yet to be published.
 
Reformers Likely to Be Born Later
In studies currently underway, Dr. Sulloway is finding the same birth order effect at work among social reformers in historical movements like the abolition of slavery, civil rights, union organizing and women's rights.
''Later borns have a greater tendency to be reformers of all kinds,'' he said. ''For instance, the Protestant Reformation largely split noble families by birth order.''
Dr. Sulloway explains the conservatism of firstborns by their relationship with their parents. ''As the eldest, firstborns identify more closely with parents, and through them, with other authorities,'' he said. ''And they play the role of parental surrogate to later children. They end up more conforming, conscientious, and conventional than later siblings.''
On the other hand, he said, later siblings tend to rebel against the firstborn's authority.
''For the firstborn, it's taking over for daddy, being a responsible member of the establishment,'' said Dr. Zajonc. ''The younger ones grow up testing the limits, seeing what they can get away with.''
Despite a handful of influential defenders like Dr. Zajonc, Dr. Sulloway's theory is encountering a scientific attitude that is skeptical of any birth order studies.
 
Family Size Seen as More Important
Last July, Dr. Blake published data in Science showing that for 113,000 people, the order of birth made no difference in how far they went in school or how intelligent they were, despite earlier studies suggesting that firstborns had an advantage.
''What matters instead,'' Dr. Blake said, ''is how large a family one comes from. What had seemed to be birth order effects were artifacts. The real effect was due to parents' characteristics - the lower the social class and the less educated the parents, the bigger the family.''
Whatever small differences had been found, Dr. Blake said, were due to the statistical weight of those born seventh or later in families of poorer, less educated parents. Thus what seems to be an effect of birth order actually reflects the family's economic and educational status, Dr. Blake said.
Dr. Blake's attack on birth order theory came on the heels of a 1983 book ''Birth Order,'' written by two Swiss psychologists, Cecile Ernst and Jules Angst. A massive review of scientific studies, their work came to much the same conclusions as Dr. Blake: on closer scrutiny, virtually all the hundreds of findings about birth order are due to other factors like family size and economic status.
That includes the well-known findings, first proposed by Sir Francis Galton in 1874, that firstborns tend to rise to positions of eminence more than later borns.
But Mr. Sulloway used statistical methods that corrected for the influence of family size. He also pointed out that in their devastating critique of the birth order literature, Dr. Ernst and Dr. Angst found that one of the few ideas supported by well-done studies is that firstborns are more accepting of parental authority and identify more with their values than do those born later.
But, they noted, that has been shown only in studies with children and adolescents. Dr. Sulloway's is among the first to show it with adults.
 
Birth Order and Personality
Dr. Blake could not comment directly on Dr. Sulloway's study. ''I haven't seen his data,'' she said. But, she added that in a project now underway, she is analyzing data from almost 10,000 people to see if there is any relationship between any personality trait and birth order.
''I don't get anything for either birth order or family size on any personality variable, including conformity, sociability, anxiety and assertiveness,'' Dr. Blake said.
But some other recent findings fit well with Dr. Sulloway's theory. For instance, a study of 835 accountants published in 1988 found that firstborns scored higher than those born later on tests of dominance and leadership ability, of wanting to make a good impression and of achievement through conformity rather than through independence.
''The firstborns are more conformist because of their parents' expectations,'' said Arthur Bedeian, a professor of management at Louisiana State University and one of those who conducted the study. ''They're put in a leadership position from their early years, standing in for their parents in caring for the younger ones. The younger children, though, are freer to be independent, to define themselves by other standards.''
Some recent studies, like Dr. Sulloway's, are generally designed to overcome the objections of Dr. Blake and other critics. From some of the studies have come entirely new twists to the birth order concept.
For example, data from 7,018 children rated from birth to age seven showed that there was a direct relationship between birth position and the child's activity level. Firstborns were the most active, second children more active than third and so on.
''The finding surprised us,'' said Dr. Judith Chipperfield, a psychologist at the University of Manitoba and one of those who did the study. ''Children who are more active early in life learn more from their environment; they're more stimulated.''
Another new perspective holds that it is not birth order at play as much as the age of the child's mother. That position is taken by Stanley Coren, a neuropsychologist at St. Lawrence University in British Columbia. Noting that later born children have a greater chance than firstborns of being left-handed, Dr. Coren has proposed that is due to the mother's aging.
Children born to mothers in their early 30's are a third again more likely to be left-handed than children born to mothers between 17 and 24 years of age, while children born to mothers older than 40 are more than twice as likely to be left-handed.
The finding is of significance, Dr. Coren said, because about half of left-handed children have neurological indicators of problems in brain development, like dyslexia and other difficulties in problem-solving. Left-handed children also have more auto-immune diseases like allergies.
For her part, Dr. Blake remains skeptical of all the birth-order findings. ''I can't think of a domain where there's a genuine birth-order effect. Every time you look hard at it, it turns out to be an artifact, usually of family size.''
Other researchers feel that birth order still has effects, though not nearly so widespread as had once been thought. ''The psychology of birth order has a tiny effect, if any, on things like intelligence,'' said Dr. Zajonc. ''But it may be far more important in areas of life such as upholding traditional values and conventions or questioning them.''

HEADLINE: Huge Study Of Diet Indicts Fat And Meat

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
EARLY findings from the most comprehensive large study ever undertaken of the relationship between diet and the risk of developing disease are challenging much of American dietary dogma. The study, being conducted in China, paints a bold portrait of a plant-based eating plan that is more likely to promote health than disease.
The study can be considered the Grand Prix of epidemiology. Sixty-five hundred Chinese have each contributed 367 facts about their eating and other habits that could ultimately help them and Americans preserve their health and prolong their lives. The data alone fill a volume of 920 pages, to be published next month by Cornell University Press. Among the first tantalizing findings are these: Obesity is related more to what people eat than how much. Adjusted for height, the Chinese consume 20 percent more calories than Americans do, but Americans are 25 percent fatter. The main dietary differences are fat and starch. The Chinese eat only a third the amount of fat Americans do, while eating twice the starch. The body readily stores fat but expends a larger proportion of the carbohydrates consumed as heat. Some of the differences may be attributable to exercise. The varying levels of physical activity among the Chinese were measured, but the data have not yet been analyzed. 
Reducing dietary fat to less than 30 percent of calories, as is currently recommended for Americans, may not be enough to curb the risk of heart disease and cancer. To make a significant impact, the Chinese data imply, a maximum of 20 percent of calories from fat - and preferably only 10 to 15 percent - should be consumed.
Eating a lot of protein, especially animal protein, is also linked to chronic disease. Americans consume a third more protein than the Chinese do, and 70 percent of American protein comes from animals, while only 7 percent of Chinese protein does. Those Chinese who eat the most protein, and especially the most animal protein, also have the highest rates of the ''diseases of affluence'' like heart disease, cancer and diabetes.
A rich diet that promotes rapid growth early in life may increase a woman's risk of developing cancer of the reproductive organs and the breast. Childhood diets high in calories, protein, calcium and fat promote growth and early menarche, which in turn is associated with high cancer rates. Chinese women, who rarely suffer these cancers, start menstruating three to six years later than Americans. Dairy calcium is not needed to prevent osteoporosis. Most Chinese consume no dairy products and instead get all their calcium from vegetables. While the Chinese consume only half the calcium Americans do, osteoporosis is uncommon in China despite an average life expectancy of about 70 years, just five few years less than the American average.
These findings are only the beginning. Dr. T. Colin Campbell, a nutritional biochemist from Cornell University and the American mastermind of the Chinese diet study, predicts that this ''living laboratory'' will continue to generate vital findings for the next 40 to 50 years.
The study, started in 1983 to explore dietary causes of cancer, has been expanded to include heart, metabolic and infectious diseases. Dr. Chen Junshi of the Chinese Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene organized the survey to cover locations from the semitropical south to the cold, arid north.
 
Exacting, Labor-Intensive Study
The extensive volume of raw data and its counterpart on computer tape will be available to any scientist to use as raw material for medical research.
It is an exacting, labor-intensive study, initially financed by the National Cancer Institute, that probably could not have been done anywhere except China. For nowhere else can accurate mortality statistics be combined with data from people who live the same way in the same place and eat the same foods for virtually their entire lives.
Nowhere else is there a genetically similar population with such great regional differences in disease rates, dietary habits and environmental exposures. For example, cancer rates can vary by a factor of several hundred from one region of China to another. These large regional variations in China highlight biologically important relationships between diet and disease.
And nowhere else could researchers afford to hire hundreds of trained workers to collect blood and urine samples and spend three days in each household gathering exact information on what and how much people eat, then analyzing the food samples for nutrient content.
 
'The Whole Diet Panoply'
''The total cost in U.S. dollars of this project - $2.3 million plus 600 person-years of labor contributed by the Chinese Government - is a mere fraction of what it would have cost to do the same study here,'' Dr. Campbell noted. And unlike typically circumscribed American studies that examine one characteristic as a factor in one disease, the Chinese investigation ''covers the whole diet panoply as it relates to all diseases.''
Dr. Mark Hegsted, emeritus professor of nutrition at Harvard University and former administrator of human nutrition for the United States Department of Agriculture, said: ''This is a very, very important study - unique and well done. Even if you could pay for it, you couldn't do this study in the United States because the population is too homogeneous. You get a lot more meaningful data when the differences in diet and disease are as great as they are in the various parts of China.''
In the first part of the study, 100 people from each of 65 counties throughout China each contributed 367 items of information about their diets, lives and bodies. The responses from residents of each county were then pooled to derive countywide characteristics that could be measured against the area's death rates for more than four dozen diseases.
By matching characteristics, researchers derived 135,000 correlations, about 8,000 of which are expected to have both statistical and biological significance that could shed light on the cause of some devastating disease.
In the poorer parts of China, infectious diseases remain the leading causes of death, but in the more affluent regions, heart disease, diabetes and cancer are most prominent, Dr. Campbell said.
 
Adding Taiwan to the Research
Although from an overall perspective of nutrient composition the Chinese diet is more health-promoting than ours, he said, there are some important limitations that result from a lack of economic development.
''Food quality and variety are not as good as ours,'' he explained. ''With limited refrigeration, bacteria and mold contamination is more common, large amounts of salt and nitrites are used to preserve foods and hot spices are used to mask off-flavors.''
The study is now being expanded and revised. New mortality rates are being gathered to update the original mortality data from the early 1970's and to reflect causes of death for 100 million people in the late 1980's. The original 6,500 participants are being resurveyed and people from 12 counties in Taiwan are being included in the expanded survey, which will also measure many socioeconomic characteristics.
''We want to see how economics change and health factors follow,'' Dr. Campbell explained in an interview. ''Taiwan should be interesting because it is intermediate between the United States and China in nutrient intake and plasma cholesterol levels. And since the Taiwanese gene pool is more like the Chinese, we can study the relative contributions of genetics and diet to risk of disease.''
 
Cholesterol as Disease Predictor
Dr. Campbell continued: ''So far we've seen that plasma cholesterol is a good predictor of the kinds of diseases people are going to get. Those with higher cholesterol levels are prone to the diseases of affluence - cancer, heart disease and diabetes.''
Contrary to earlier reports that linked low blood cholesterol levels to colon cancer, the Chinese study strongly suggests that low cholesterol not only protects against heart disease but also protects against cancer of the colon, the most common life-threatening cancer among Americans. In China, mortality rates from colon cancer are lowest where cholesterol levels are lowest.
Over all, cholesterol levels in China, which range from 88 to 165 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood plasma, much lower than those in the United States, which range from 155 to 274 milligrams per 100 milliliters of plasma.
''Their high cholesterol is our low,'' Dr. Campbell noted. He said the data strongly suggest that a major influence on cholesterol levels and disease rates is the high consumption of animal foods, including dairy products, by Americans.
 
'Basically a Vegetarian Species'
''We're basically a vegetarian species and should be eating a wide variety of plant foods and minimizing our intake of animal foods,'' he said.
The Chinese have already begun to capitalize on these findings, using them to develop national food and agricultural policies that will promote health.
''Usually, the first thing a country does in the course of economic development is to introduce a lot of livestock,'' Dr. Campbell said. ''Our data are showing that this is not a very smart move, and the Chinese are listening. They're realizing that animal-based agriculture is not the way to go.''
The plant-rich Chinese diet contains three times more dietary fiber than Americans typically consume. The average intake in China is 33 grams of fiber a day, and it ranges as high as 77 grams in some regions. Dr. Campbell found no evidence to suggest that diets very high in fiber are in any way deleterious to nutritional well-being.
While American scientists worry that fiber may interfere with the absorption of essential minerals like iron, no reason for concern was found among the Chinese. Rather, those with the highest fiber intake also had the most iron-rich blood.
 
Iron From Vegetables
The study also showed that consumption of meat is not needed to prevent iron-deficiency anemia. The average Chinese adult, who shows no evidence of anemia, consumes twice the iron Americans do, but the vast majority of it comes from the iron in plants.
Nor are animal products needed to prevent osteoporosis, the study showed. ''Ironically,'' Dr. Campbell noted, ''osteoporosis tends to occur in countries where calcium intake is highest and most of it comes from protein-rich dairy products. The Chinese data indicate that people need less calcium than we think and can get adequate amounts from vegetables.''
Another common health concern that could prove to be a red herring is the fear that aflatoxin, which is produced by a mold that grows on peanuts, corn and other grains, causes liver cancer. Rather, the Chinese study strongly indicates that chronic infection with hepatitis B virus and high serum cholesterol levels are the primary culprits.
''We did not find any relationship between aflatoxin and liver cancer, and we have the largest study on this question ever done,'' Dr. Campbell said.
Among other intriguing findings are a relationship between infection with herpes simplex virus and coronary heart disease and a relationship between infection with the yeast candida and nasopharyngeal cancer.
''Lots and lots such relationships are turning up as we plot out the 367 characteristics on maps of China and try to match them up with maps of disease rates,'' Dr. Campbell said. ''The data now need to be interpreted, and six Chinese scientists are working with us on this. The amount of information gathered in this study is kind of staggering,'' he said, then proceeded to outline his interest in gathering more.

HEADLINE: Ocean Predator Is Preyed Upon; Sharks Need Help, Officials Say

 BODY:
SHARKS, the skillful and storied hunters of the deep, are being threatened by even tougher predators - people.
A dramatic rise in commercial fishing and a significant amount of recreational fishing pose problems for the survival of some species of shark in the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, Federal officials and scientists say.
To protect the remaining stocks, the National Marine Fisheries Service will soon propose a management plan that would limit the numbers of 38 of the 350 species of shark that could be caught by commercial and recreational fishermen. The plan covers a zone from 3 to 200 miles from the coast in the three areas. (State laws govern the area within three miles of the coast.) The plan, to be published next Tuesday in The Federal Register, is expected to take effect in September after a period for public comment and revision if any is needed. 
''If commercial fishing of sharks remains at current levels, some species may be vacant from waters within the next few years,'' said Paul Leach, an official of the fisheries service in St. Petersburg, Fla., who was also the chairman of the committee that prepared the plan.
As the predator at the top of the ocean food chain, sharks fulfill an evolutionary role by preying on fish and insuring that only the strongest survive. The sharks prey on virtually every type of fish, as well as squid, octopus, turtles, seals and whales. If the sharks were lost, the populations of prey species would explode, creating an imbalance. Dr. Samuel H. Gruber, a professor of marine biology at the University of Miami, said, ''They all live as an interwoven tapestry of life and when you pull one thread, it all unravels.''
 
A Threat From Fin Soup
The most serious threat is the practice known as finning, in which fishermen catch and slice off a shark's fins, discarding the bleeding carcass in the water. More than 35 million pounds of shark, or three times the yearly domestic catch, are discarded from finning in United States waters each year. The fins are valued in Asia, where shark fin soup is a delicacy.
In addition, shark meat has gained increasing popularity since the 1970's. At restaurants from Manhattan to Los Angeles, thresher or mako shark, both of them white, meaty fish that are grilled and served with a butter or garlic sauce, can be found on menus alongside mahi mahi and red snapper for $15 to $22. Fish markets in New York City sell shark meat for about $4.99 a pound.
''The demand from the public is increasing all the time,'' said Tom Hoff of the fisheries service. ''Since shark became a somewhat yuppie food, it's not uncommon to see two or three types of shark on a restaurant menu, and it's seriously depleting current stocks.''
In 1988, more than 14.6 million pounds of shark worth $9.5 million were sold commercially in the United States, excluding exports, more than double the 1987 level, according to fisheries service estimates.
Scientists and fishery managers are concerned about the dramatic growth in shark fishing. In 1986, reported commercial landings in the United States amounted to 1,200 metric tons. (A metric ton is about 2,204 pounds.) In 1987, that increased to 2,200 metric tons and in 1988 to 5,800 metric tons. Landings for 1989 are expected to be 10,000 to 12,000 metric tons. Recreational fishermen, who use fishing line like that of commercial shark fishermen, accounted for 3,000 metric tons in 1986, 4,000 metric tons in 1987, and 3,500 metric tons in 1988. The Federal fisheries agency warned that continued heavy fishing was likely to destroy the shark fishing industry itself.
 
'A Fascination for Humans'
Yet scientists' knowledge about sharks' habits and customs is limited, and conservation efforts must come to grips with the shark's image as a formidable predator that can prey on people.
''Sharks hold a fascination for humans, who feel obliged to kill them,'' said Dr. George Burgess, senior biologist in icthyology at the Florida Museum of Natural History. He said sharks stir up emotions of terror and dread in humans so that any brutality toward them is simply chalked up to ''evening the score.'' And environmentalists said it was unlikely that public opinion would come to the defense of such a skillful hunter.
''Sharks are just not the glamour organisms that motivate the environmentally concerned,'' said Harold Upton, the fisheries program director at the Center for Marine Conservation, an environmental group based in Washington. ''To a large degree, fish haven't been at the forefront of the conservation industry in general.''
The problem of conserving the dwindling population is compounded by sharks' low reproductive rate. A female shark typically produces 2 to 30 offspring in a lifetime, which ranges from 20 years to 30 years, depending on the species, though some have been found to be as old as 50 years.
 
Plan Sets Limits on Catches
The plan to manage sharks would set a quota of 5,800 metric tons for the commercial catch, limit the number of sharks killed as a byproduct of other fishing and limit recreational fishermen to one shark per person per day. Though the practice of finning would not be eliminated, the total weight of fins would be restricted and fishermen would be required to bring in a part of the carcasses.
The 38 species to be covered by the plan are those that are frequently caught by commercial or recreational fishermen or are particularly vulnerable because they have slow reproduction or growth rates. They include the thresher, mako, hammerhead, sharpnose, nurse, cow, angel, tiger and whale sharks.
 
Greatest Demand From Asia
By far the highest demand for shark products comes from Asia. Shark fins are dried, salted and soaked several times before the meat is extracted from them and cut into long, thin strips. Seven million pounds of shark fins worth $93 million were imported by Hong Kong last year, according to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office.
Sharks migrate through international waters and boundaries, making it difficult to calculate their population.
Though the most dangerous fish in the water may be in peril, commercial shark fishermen say it is their livelihood that is threatened.
 
Possible Government Limits
Chris Brannon, a commercial shark fisherman who operates 13 boats on the Gulf Coast, the East Coast and the Caribbean, said he favored some management of the shark-fishing industry but feared the Government limit would be too low.
''Shark can be taken off menus,'' said Mr. Brannon, who has been in the fishing industry for more than 20 years.''It's not like salmon or halibut, fish that have been entrenched in the market for a long time.
''The shark business right now is in its infancy and management could kill it or expand it,'' said Mr. Brannon, who switched about 10 years ago from catching tuna, shrimp and swordfish. ''They're forcing me back into already overfished industries.''
Mr. Brannon's company, Gulf Star Seafoods Inc., based in St. Elmo, Ala., typically ships about 180,000 pounds of shark steaks a week to retail fish markets in Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, Detroit and San Francisco. Mr. Brannon recently built a new processing plant and added five new vessels to his fleet.
 
'A Benefit, Not a Hazard'
While commercial fishermen say the quota would reduce their catch, environmentalists are saying the quota is inadequate. ''The quota is probably erring on the side of exploitation,'' said Mr. Upton of the Center for Marine Conservation.
Jack Casey, a fisheries biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Laboratory in Narragansett, R.I., who has participated in a national shark tagging program for more than 20 years, said, ''It's a testimonial to the U.S. that a resource with such a sinister reputation is now being looked at as a benefit and not a hazard.''
Those like Mr. Casey in tagging programs said they were seeing fewer and fewer sharks in mid-life and only an occasional old-timer.
''The concern is that the shark population is so vulnerable,'' he said. ''Do we have to wait until the population crashes before we do something?''

HEADLINE: Spring Series of Art Auctions May Top $1 Billion in Sales

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
A 13-day series of auctions that may, for the first time, produce more than $1 billion in art sales got under way last night at Christie's in New York.
The high point of Christie's sale of contemporary art came when Roy Lichtenstein's ''Kiss II,'' from 1962, a wordless, larger-than-life cartoon of a couple embracing, was sold for $6 million, the highest price ever paid for a work by the artist. The buyer was the Fujii Gallery of Tokyo.
Other records were rewritten for Jean Dubuffet, whose colorful 1962 painting from his Paris circus series was bought for $5 million by the Chicago dealer Richard Gray, and for Sam Francis, whose ''Round the World,'' from 1958-59, was bought for $1.9 million by Larry Gagosian, a Madison Avenue dealer who also paid $3.7 million for Willem de Kooning's 'Untitled XII'' from 1982.
''The estimates of the paintings that did not sell were far too aggressive,'' Mr. Gagosian said. ''I think that stemmed from what has been going on for a while, with Sotheby's and Christie's bidding for properties and placing too-high estimates on them - conducting auctions before the auction.'' 
 
Strong Prices for the Best
The mood at Christie's wascheerful, but the bidding throughout the evening was selective, as 25 of the 77 works offered were not sold in an auction that totaled $40.2 million, well below the house's expectations of $50 million to $71.8 million.
Allan Stone, the New York dealer, left early. ''I think it is the healthiest thing that could happen,'' he said. ''The best things went for strong prices. The rest represents consignor greed because these auction houses allow it.''
Whether this sale was an exception or a prediction of what may happen in the next two weeks, most people did not wish to say. Leo Castelli the SoHo art dealer, expressed it this way: ''Only tomorrow will we have a true indication of a trend.''
The most intense interest in the series centers on two of the most important artworks ever to be auctioned. Vincent van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' (1890) will be presented next Tuesday at Christie's by the heirs of Siegfried Kramarsky, a New York banker and philanthropist. Two days later at Sotheby's, Pierre Auguste Renoir's renowned depiction of an open-air dance hall in Montmartre, ''Au Moulin de la Galette'' (1876), will be offered. Its owner is Betsey Cushing Whitney, the widow of John Hay Whitney, the financier, publisher, sportsman and former Ambassador to Britain.
The poignant van Gogh portrait, which was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1984 until this year, depicts the artist's friend and physician Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet as a troubled, introspective man. Paul Gauguin said of the painting that it captured ''the heartbroken expression of our time.''
The widely exhibited Renoir, the smaller and more atmospheric of two versions of the work painted by the artist (the mate hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris) has been described by the art historian John Rewald as ''the finest work Renoir painted.''
 
Identical Estimates
The van Gogh and the Renoir each have the same presale estimate of $40 million to $50 million. This contrasts with the $53.9 million paid for van Gogh's ''Irises'' in November 1987, still the highest price ever paid at auction for a work of art. The disclosure that Sotheby's had loaned the Australian industrialist Alan Bond half the purchase price led to charges by critics that the market was artificially inflated. The painting has since been resold at an undisclosed price to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., but this development has not provoked a downturn in the auction market.
The upward spiral of art prices in recent years has attracted many extraordinary artworks to these auctions, further fueling positive expectations for these sales. The test of the market will be in whether the problems surrounding the sale of ''Irises'' deter the bidding for the major prizes, and in whether more moderate-priced artworks are as much in demand as they were six months ago.
Art specialists at Sotheby's and Christie's were optimistic before the sales when asked whether their sales may be affected by such factors as the continued slowdown in the economy, the fluctuations in foreign currencies (including the decline of the yen against the dollar), and the financial reversals experienced recently by some leading art collectors and dealers, including Charles Saatchi, the British advertising magnate, Mr. Bond, and Shigeki Kameyama, a Tokyo art dealer.
 
No Apparent Holding Back
David J. Nash, who heads fine-art sales at Sotheby's, said there was a ''puzzling contradiction'' between the positive results in the art market and the economic news of tremors in the Japanese stock market, on Wall Street and in the real estate market. ''From where I sit,'' he said, ''the world seems to be awash with money in the hands of the rich. I don't detect any holding back on the part of collectors and dealers when presented with these sales.''
Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York, said in assessing last night's auction:: ''We saw 75 percent of the sale sold. We saw some incredibly strong prices, and we saw some weaknesses. Contemporaary art was up 120 percent last year at Christie's. If you have a real downturn, you see greater problems than we saw tonight.''
Spurred by the boom economy of the 1980's, art-buying propelled prices to dizzying levels, bringing the 12-day series of art sales in New York last November to a record total of $930 million. Although there have been some disappointments recently at art sales in London, no major downturn has occurred in the market. The expectation for this series is sales of $933 million to $1.25 billion.
At the sale of Soviet contemporary art by Habsburg, Feldman in New York last Saturday, only 65 of the 121 offered works were sold, for a total of $1.7 million in an auction that was expected to bring $2.1 million to $2.8 million. But most New York sales have been successful thus far.
 
Auctions of Quality Works
The quality of the contemporary, Impressionist and modern art to be offered for sale in the next few days is staggering. There are five paintings at Christie's and four at Sotheby's valued at $10 million or more, and 201 artworks valued at $1 million or more - 106 at Sotheby's, 84 at Christie's and 11 at Habsburg, Feldman.
Both Sotheby's and Christie's are offering art from renowned collections, assembled by Robert Lehman, a financier who was chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art at his death in 1969; by Mr. Whitney; Mr. Kramarsky; Lydia Winston Malbin, daughter of the industrial architect Albert Kahn, and by Margaret Ryan, the widow of John Barry Ryan Jr., an heir to a New York fortune.
Museums have also consigned a number of major works to these auctions. Sotheby's will be the setting for the sale of three noted paintings from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum - Kandinsky's ''Fugue'' (1914), Amedeo Modigliani's ''Boy With a Blue Shirt'' (1918) and Marc Chagall's ''Anniversaire'' (1923). The sale of the paintings, valued in all at $22 million to $31 million, is to help finance the museum's planned multi-million-dollar purchase of more than 200 Minimalist and other works from the collection of Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo.
The Art Institute of Chicago has consigned paintings to both Sotheby's and Christie's. Sotheby's is auctioning an Edgar Degas pastel of a dancing class, a Claude Monet seascape, a Pierre Bonnard floral still life, and a 1953 oil on wood painting by Pablo Picasso, with an estimated total worth of $13.5 million to $17.7 million. The two paintings the Chicago museum sent to Christie's - a Modigliani portrait of a woman and a Maurice Utrillo street scene - are expected to bring $4.7 million to $6.9 million.
The properties from the Guggenheim and three of the four works from the Art Institute at Sotheby's are guaranteed, assuring payment of a minimum price to the consignors even if the paintings do not sell. Sotheby's has guaranteed a total of 127 works in these sales, valued at $119.5 million to $161.5 million.
These include 103 works from the Malbin collection, which is expected to total $66 million to $88 million in five different sessions. Most of the Malbin holdings of 20th-century art by Constantine Brancusi, Fernand Leger, Piet Mondrian, Joan Miro and Giacomo Balla, are to be auctioned on May 16. Eight other works are to be offered at Sotheby's contemporary sale tonight and tomorrow.
 
A Change of Policy
Christie's, long critical of Sotheby's guarantees, which were introduced about 1970, changed its policy in March and guaranteed the five works from the Lehman collection. The presale estimate for this art, to be auctioned May 15, is $40 million to $60 million.
Christie's is anticipating perhaps the most successful night in its 224-year history, the sale on May 15 of 81 Impressionist and modern works that may total or exceed $334.9 million. Some 61 of the works are valued at $1 million or more each, and five are expected to bring $10 million or more each.
Over the next two nights Sotheby's may equal or exceed those figures when it auctions 93 works from the Malbin collection, estimated to total up to $74.8 million, and 71 Impressionist and modern works from other owners valued at up to $289.5 million. In these sales, 10 works in the Malbin sale and 62 in the various owners' sale are valued at $1 million or more each, and three may exceed $10 million each.
Contemporary art comes up tonight at Sotheby's in a sale of 88 works, valued at $88 million to $114 million, in which two paintings by Mr. de Kooning are the major offerings. They are expected to bring a combined total of as much as $22 million.

HEADLINE: A Fervent Advocate Of the Proxy Battle

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Robert A. G. Monks has a resume that might endear him to any corporate board: a Harvard-educated lawyer who made his fortune as an industrialist; former chairman of a leading Boston investment firm; two-time Republican candidate for the United States Senate in Maine. And, he held top positions in the Reagan Administration.
In this case, appearances are deceiving. Mr. Monks is the scourge of many executive suites for his outspoken - and influential - views on corporate proxy battles. From a Georgetown office, Mr. Monks, 56 years old, heads a consulting business that for a fee advises more than 100 institutions, including the mammoth employee pension funds of New York City and California, on how to vote their proxies. And he has been a behind-the-scenes player in recent proxy contests, with victories at the Lockheed Corporation and Honeywell Inc.
For Mr. Monks, shareholder activism is a calling and he minces no words on its behalf. ''American chief executives are close to becoming the absolute monarchs that we saw in the 18th century,'' he said in an interview. ''Managements of large American corporations are only accountable to themselves. The words I use may be of governance and process, but what is really being said in a masculine, emotional way relates to power. In a psychological sense, it's like I'm gelding these guys.'' 
 
First-Hand Knowledge
What sets Mr. Monks apart from other proxy advisers is that he used to run companies himself. Nor does it hurt that he has enough wealth to pursue his interests. He took over a family coal and oil business that was eventually split and sold in 1972. He successfully speculated in oil during the energy squeeze in the mid-1970's and was chairman of the Boston Company, an investment firm, until it was taken over by American Express.
And while he has attacked corporate boards, he has sat on a few himself - not without criticism over possible conflicts of interest. Because of such questions, he recently decided to leave the board of Jefferies & Company, the Los Angeles brokerage that has advised corporate raiders. But he still holds paid advisory positions at Lambert Brussels Associates, which held a 33 percent stake in Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and is an adviser to the American unit of Mitsubishi of Japan, though he says he may terminate these relationships.
He approaches corporate governance with a born-again fervor, gained during his years of Government service. He came to Washington in 1981 as a director of the ill-fated Synthetic Fuels Corporation and became, in 1984, head of the Labor Department's pension and welfare benefits program. Soon, he began to exhort pension fund managers to flex their power over intransigent corporate managers.
''I got the idea that stock ownership was a responsibility,'' he said. ''Before, I just wanted to trade.''
His 1984 speech ''The Institutional Investor as a Corporate Citizen'' set Labor Department policy that has encouraged proxy activism by pension funds and is considered a seminal work by shareholder activists. After leaving Government, he began, like a well-heeled Paul Revere, to travel the country, meeting pension-fund managers and spreading his views.
 
Passion Into Business
A passion turned into a business, and Mr. Monks's vehicle was Institutional Shareholders Services, a company he founded to analyze proxy questions and make recommendations - for a $10,000 annual base fee. His timing was right. Institutional funds were growing, and few had the in-house expertise, or willingness, to analyze complicated proxies, which meant that they often automatically sided with management. And, senior Labor Department officials had begun to put pressure on large institutions, which own nearly half of all corporate equities, to consider voting their proxies as a fiduciary duty.
''One of the major criticisms of institutional investors is that they own stocks but don't know enough about the companies they own to make an informed proxy vote,'' said John Wilcox, a managing director at Georgeson & Company, a New York proxy solicitor. ''It's a perfect situation for them to seek assistance, and Bob Monks has taken advantage of that.''
In running his business, Mr. Monks has walked a tightrope - between conflicts in his business activities and between promoting his own ideas and the interest of his clients.
Eyebrows were raised when Mr. Monks served as an unpaid adviser to the Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons, who led a proxy battle for control of Lockheed. Mr. Monks took pains to disclose that relationship because his firm was recommending that institutions side with Mr. Simmons. But Mr. Monks did not make similar efforts to disclose that he was a director at Jefferies, which was advising Mr. Simmons. Mr. Monks has since left the Jefferies board but still holds an equity stake in that firm. (His one remaining corporate directorship, is at Tyco Laboratories, a New Hampshire concern,) Others are concerned that Mr. Monks's zealousness for shareholder rights makes him recommend proxy-contest positions that are sometimes not in his clients' economic interests. Lilli A. Gordon, a managing director of the Analysis Group, a rival consulting firm based in Boston, pointed to the recent proxy bid by Torchmark, an insurance company with steller earnings, for American General, an insurance company with a weak stock performance. Mr. Monks recommended that his institutional clients oppose Torchmark because it has anti-takeover provisions in its own bylaws.
''When he gives advice that could potentially decrease value for the shareholders, he's ultimately not serving his clients,'' Ms. Gordon said.
To Mr. Monks, however, corporate governance leads to superior corporate performance. ''I'm not interested in having the world's most successful consulting firm, but in promoting my own agenda,'' he said.
So far, that agenda has led to major shareholder victories at Honeywell and at Lockheed. In both cases, he was instrumental in connecting with a well-known investor willing to foot the bill to wage a proxy battle -which can cost between $1 million and $5 million.
The 1989 Honeywell battle grew out of conversations Mr. Monks had with the Texas investor Richard E. Rainwater, once a financial adviser to the Bass brothers of Texas. Mr. Rainwater and other Texas investors owned 4.4 percent of Honeywell. Mr. Rainwater's group was unhappy with the company's stock performance and upset that Honeywell was asking shareholders to approve two anti-takeover measures.
If Mr. Rainwater's group would lead the proxy battle, Mr. Monks would rally the pension funds. After a one-week blitz, their side won. The effort was remarkable because the group worked without a complete list of Honeywell shareholders. They bypassed small shareholders and relied almost exclusively on institutional votes. ''This said institutions could ignore all other shareholders and still block management initiatives,'' said Mr. Wilcox, the proxy solicitor.
Another deep pocket for Mr. Monks was Mr. Simmons, chairman of NL Industries, who was willing to spend $11 million to take on Lockheed, in which NL had a $500 million stake. Even though Mr. Simmons did not succeed in ousting Lockheed's board, the company agreed to add three shareholders' representatives to its board and enacted three shareholder-rights measures that Mr. Simmons had proposed - overturning Lockheed's ''poison pill,'' opting out of anti-takeover protections provided by incorporation in Delaware, and confidential proxy votes.
 
New Plans Afoot
With these victories, Mr. Monks is plotting again. He wants to oppose management initiatives to issue ''sweetheart'' stock to thwart takeovers. He also wants corporations to create shareholders' advisory committees for their boards and opt out of Delaware's anti-takeover protection, if incorporated there.
In the current USX Corporation proxy battle, he has sided with the investor Carl C. Icahn, who wants to split the company.
Not all his clients follow his bidding, however. Paul Quirk, head of the Massachusetts Public Reserves Investment Management Board, said Mr. Monks's views are ''very refreshing'' but not always followed by his group. And Robert C. Pozen, general counsel at Fidelity Investments, terms Mr. Monks's opinions ''useful, but one of many views.''
Still, Mr. Monks thinks he's working on their behalf. ''It's difficult for many of my clients to take a high-visibility position,'' he said. ''I'm saying that I'll be the lightning rod.''
