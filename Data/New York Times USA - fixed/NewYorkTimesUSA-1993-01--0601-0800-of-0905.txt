HEADLINE: Cuomo's Plan to Divert School Aid Comes Under Fire

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposal to divert state aid from wealthy to poor school districts came under attack today from officials in New York City's suburbs, which would bear the brunt of the cuts needed to make the plan work.
In Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland and Westchester Counties, where about 80 percent of the school districts would lose aid under the plan, school officials predicted that Mr. Cuomo's proposal would lead to teacher layoffs, larger classes, fewer courses and higher property taxes. 
 And the cuts were not reserved for affluent areas. In several districts with large pockets of poverty, including Hempstead and Yonkers, the new formula would reduce aid.
 
'Devastating' Reductions
 "This would be devastating," said Eddy Bayardelle, superintendent of the Hempstead School District in Nassau County. The school system would lose $1.9 million under the plan, or 9 percent of its state aid, even though about half of its students are so poor they qualify for a free lunch program. "You're looking at one of the neediest school districts, not just in Long Island, but in the entire state," he said.
Under Mr. Cuomo's plan, poor districts would receive up to $1,400 for each student enrolled in free lunch programs, a standard measure of poverty. The plan would do that, in part, by taking money from wealthy districts with low tax rates.
There is little question that the plan faces an uphill battle in the Legislature. Even in the best of economic times, state education aid is a thorny issue, and legislators are wont to fight for every penny they can get for their local schools.
But Mr. Cuomo, by his own admission, has chosen a particularly difficult time to make his proposal. Not only does he want to change the way the state divides its pot of school aid, he wants to shrink the pot itself by $130 million.
 
A Double Hit
 As a result, wealthier districts would, in effect, take a double hit -- first from the diversion to poorer districts, and second from the budget cut. Under the plan, about 70 percent of the $130 million cut would be shouldered by Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland Counties.
And on the flip side, because there is little money available in the state education pot, even those districts that stand to gain from the new formula will not gain a great deal. New York City, for instance, would receive an additional $6.2 million, an increase of 0.2 percent.
The fact that deep cuts would hit districts represented by Democrats as well as Republicans is likely to cause strong bipartisan opposition to Mr. Cuomo's proposal.
Reflecting the uncertainty that the plan faces in the Legislature, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, Democrat from Queens, declined to comment on it today. "It's very complicated," said Steven A. Greenberg, Mr. Weprin's spokesman. "We can't look at it in three or four hours and respond."
 
Republicans Critical
 But among Republicans, response to the plan was critical and swift. "Under the guise of reform, the Governor pits region against region, school district against school district, in an effort to unfairly manipulate the school aid formula," said Senator Ralph J. Marino, Republican from Oyster Bay and the Senate majority leader.
The proposal is based in part on the findings of a commission appointed by the Governor and the Legislature in 1988 that recommended that the state provide more aid to poor districts and to regions where the cost of living is high.
Mr. Cuomo's plan would do that in several ways. Districts with large numbers of children who receive free lunches -- which are available only to low-income families -- would receive millions more in aid. The proposal would also reduce aid to wealthy districts that have low local tax rates and increase aid to poor districts with high tax rates.
The plan would also increase aid to districts where teacher salaries and construction costs are high, a measure that would benefit both New York City and its suburbs. The plan also is designed to make districts cut costs, particularly for transportation, Mr. Cuomo's aides said.
As details about how the plan would affect each of the state's 700 school districts became public today, many officials said they were stunned by the depth and breadth of the cuts.
 
'One More Time'
 In the Plainview-Old Bethpage School District in Nassau County, which would lose $690,000, or 10 percent of its state aid, officials recalled how, just two years ago, they had laid off 35 teachers and eliminated several advanced placement courses after receiving a $6 million cut in state aid.
"I have a major problem biting the bullet one more time, one more time, one more time," said Henry L. Grishman, the school superintendent.
In East Islip in Suffolk County, which has joined other school districts in a lawsuit to force the state to distribute more aid to poorer districts, school officials said they had expected to benefit from Mr. Cuomo's plan. Instead, they face a $2.1 million cut in aid.
"There are a number of wealthier districts who had lower cuts," said Mike Griffin, the school superintendent. "On its face, this doesn't appear to achieve what the Governor says it will."
 
Mixed Impact
 In several districts, the proposed formula would have a mixed impact. Yonkers and Hempstead, for instance, would receive additional aid based on the fact that many of their students receive free lunches because their parents' incomes are low.
But on balance, both districts would lose aid because the proposed formula calculates a district's wealth in a new way, basing it more on the income of residents than on the value of their property. Because Yonkers and Hempstead are above the state average in per capita income, they would lose aid.
Mr. Cuomo has acknowledged that his proposal comes at a time when the depth of cuts is likely to cost him substantial political support.
"It's going to be difficult to explain to people in Nassau County that you have had the benefit for years of an unfair formula," Mr. Cuomo said Tuesday when he presented his proposal. "The ideal time to do it would be a time when you have so much money that no one gets hurt. My judgment was: if you don't do it now, you'll be left not doing it at all."

HEADLINE: More Donors to Neediest Honor a Slain Principal

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
The life and death of Patrick Daly, the elementary school principal who inspired thousands of children in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Red Hook, continues to weigh heavily on the minds of contributors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Since The Times published an article last month on people who donated to the fund in his memory, dozens of others have followed suit.
Members of the Kaufman family of Wilton, Conn., said they were deeply moved by the story of Mr. Daly, who had dedicated his career to the troubled neighborhood before he was shot on Dec. 17 when he walked into the crossfire of what the police said was a drug dispute. 
 "In his own unassuming way, he was a most remarkable man who quite literally gave his life for what he believed in," the Kaufmans wrote. "Our lives are enriched just by knowing of Mr. Daly." They gave $200 to the Neediest Cases.
Jean Robl of Monroeville, Pa., sent $20, noting that "as a former elementary school art teacher, I know how crucial the principal is to any elementary school." Michael and Margaret Buckner of Manhattan gave $100, and Bernard and Irene Murphy of Gainesville, Fla., contributed $15 in memory of Mr. Daly.
 
'Inner Light'
 In a letter to the fund with his $100 donation, Jonathan B. Leonard of Manhattan said he felt as if all of New York City was mourning Mr. Daly. He wrote that the principal was "a man of compassion and vision whose inner light shone bright amid the turbulence and chaos of our times."
"May his memory lead us all to a place of greater understanding, mercy and grace," he said.
Since the early years of this century, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has supported charities that help thousands of people free themselves from poverty. The campaign is facing a drop in donations while social-service agencies report a decline in government aid and a surge in demand because of the recession.
The Times pays the expenses for the fund's campaign, so all contributions go directly to the charities. This year's appeal, the 81st, ends on Feb. 28.
Besides giving in memory of Mr. Daly, many of these contributors also dedicated their donations to neighborhoods like Red Hook, where residents are struggling against a tide of drugs and guns. They asked that the money be used for counseling, after-school programs and other services for children.
Judith Block of Manhattan gave $35. Mr. Daly's "life was taken suddenly, unfairly and horribly," she wrote. "I hope this money will be used to help unfortunate children."
Christopher J. Weeks of Providence, R.I., sent $25. "The world needs more people with his courage and conviction to make a difference," Mr. Weeks wrote.

HEADLINE: Letterman's No. 1 Question: Where?;
New York City and Los Angeles Are Weighed for New Show

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
If this were a late-night talk show and we had limped through the monologue and the first commercial and it was time for the top 10 list, the No. 1 question would be (drum roll, please): Now that David Letterman has decided to switch networks, will he also switch cities?
Boosters on both coasts are already debating whether Mr. Letterman -- whose frantic, neurotic humor has had an unmistakable New York City flavor since he went on the air 11 years ago -- would be as funny if he packed up and headed for Los Angeles.
 
10. Earthquakes!

 He wouldn't have a lot of his biggest running gags. No car-swallowing potholes, no "radioactive steam" billowing from city streets (or from a pipe behind his desk), no Connecticut state police to hand out "greeting cards" that look suspiciously like speeding tickets, no "shoulderless" Merritt Parkway on which to hand them out, no Donald J. Trump to lay carpet in his Rockefeller Center office when NBC dawdled. 
 "The show has something in New York that you can't get in Los Angeles," said the Amazing Kreskin, who calls himself a "mentalist," does not use a first name and has done card tricks and word-guessing games in his occasional appearances on Mr. Letterman's show. "The New York audience is the dream of the live performer or entertainer."
 
9. Cher Lives There
 But apparently the New York audience is not the most important dream of everyone on Mr. Letterman's staff. One of his co-executive producers, Peter Lassally, worked on the "Tonight" show before taking his current assignment last year. Mr. Lassally still has a house in California and has said in the past that he would like to go back.
Mr. Letterman's other co-executive producer, Robert Morton, is said to favor keeping the show in New York City once it moves to CBS from NBC later in the year.
And Mr. Letterman? He has houses on both coasts: one in Connecticut, the other in Malibu, Calif.
 
8. N.Y. Has More Stupid Pets
 The conventional show business wisdom is that New York City offers better audiences, Los Angeles better guests. This may be an important consideration in the war with Jay Leno and NBC's "Tonight." Or it may not.
 
7. No Skyscraper Backdrops
 "In my own case, it didn't matter," said Steve Allen, who did "Tonight" from New York City in the 1950's and a syndicated talk show from Los Angeles in the 1960's. "I was born in New York, but I love the whole planet. What is more important to me is the kind of theater you get into, the physical setup. Some studios are good for comedy, others are not. I like to do stunts and unusual things, and if he isn't required to work in the CBS building, he might consider looking over other studios."
 
6. I <heart> N.Y. (Really)

 Which is what Mr. Letterman's staff has been doing. Ann L. Morfogen, a vice president and spokeswoman for CBS, said they had inspected the Ed Sullivan Theater, on Broadway at 54th Street, where its stiff-shouldered namesake presided over "a really big shue" until the 1970's. They have also toured studios at the CBS Broadcast Center on West 57th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues, where Ms. Morfogen said Geraldo Rivera tapes his talk show.
 
5. What Speed Limits?
 Geraldo Rivera? What more could Mr. Letterman, who used to drop in on Phil Donahue at NBC, want?
But his staff is also studio-shopping in Los Angeles, Ms. Morfogen said. "No decision has been made," she said, "and I don't think anyone could take a read on which way they are leaning at this point."
 
 4. No Leggy Rockettes
 Mr. Letterman said last week that he was "leaning toward staying in New York."
Determined to prevent him from leaning the other way, Richard Brick, the director the city's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting, met with Mr. Letterman's producers to discuss what incentives, if any, the city could offer to keep the show here.
 
3. Ocean on Wrong Side
 The Dinkins administration has not yet prepared a package of incentives, which often include tax credits and other financial benefits, because it does not know what the Letterman show might need, said Jennifer Kimball, a spokeswoman for Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development.
The concern about not losing Mr. Letterman comes on the heels of a report that found that a long boycott by Hollywood film producers growing out of a labor dispute in 1991 had caused a lasting talent drain in New York City. Even though fewer than 200 jobs are at stake, city officials appear to be courting Mr. Letterman as assiduously as they would court a Wall Street power broker or a garment-district ready-to-wear mogul. That may be because losing "Late Night With David Letterman" would be more about prestige and New York City's self perception than about money.
 
2. Paul Would Burn, Not Tan
 New York? Los Angeles? Either way, Mr. Letterman is sure to leave NBC's Rockefeller Center studio.
For viewers, that probably means no more Meg Parsont. From time to time, Mr. Letterman dials her phone number, and she waves out her window across the street from NBC. One night Mr. Letterman sent over a justice of the peace to perform a marriage ceremony for a couple who wanted to marry on either "Star Trek" or "Late Night." For her birthday, he arranged for a marching band to high-step its way down 49th Street.
 
1. One Word: Buttafuoco
 "I will miss having him as my neighbor," she said. "Maybe he felt like they needed to get out of a rut, though I thought the rut was working pretty well."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower And Gold Prices Advance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly lower in moderate trading on world currency markets yesterday.
Gold prices advanced across the board. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $329.90 an ounce, up $1.30 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold added 85 cents an ounce to a late bid price of $329.65. 
 The dollar declined in foreign trading and continued to lose ground against most currencies when trading shifted to domestic markets. Analysts said dealers were sidetracked by the inauguration of President Bill Clinton.
"People want to consolidate their positions while they see what a new regime will bring," said Randolph Donney, director of research at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Meanwhile, he said, there is growing skepticism about how strong the economy will prove to be in the first quarter. "People are worried that we may see a little bit of a lull after the good showings in the third and fourth quarters last year," Mr. Donney said.
After opening their wallets and spending heartily around Christmas, consumers may be more frugal in the early part of the year, traders are reckoning.
Separately, the British pound was hit hard following a report showing that British retail sales fell in December, in contrast to an expected increase. In London the pound fell to $1.5410, from $1.5470 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.5440 to buy one pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.5465.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 125.39 Japanese yen, from 125.46 yen on Tuesday. Later in London, it fell to 124.94 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 124.63 yen, down from 125.50 yen on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6038 German marks, down from 1.6110; 1.4685 Swiss francs, down from 1.4725; 5.4190 French francs, down from 5.4500; 1,464.00 Italian lire, down from 1,472.00, and 1.2814 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2784.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6060 German marks, down from 1.6105; 1.4712 Swiss francs, down from 1.4739; 5.4275 French francs, down from 5.4490; 1.8050 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8120; 1,466.75 Italian lire, down from 1,478.00, and 1.2799 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2768.

Money Market Funds Slow Their Fall in Latest Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were down in the latest reporting week, but the declines were not as severe as those posted a week earlier.
The latest survey by The Money Fund Report shows tax-exempt yields down sharply for the week that ended Tuesday, affected by money flowing into funds from recent huge redemptions of municipal bonds. 
 Walter S. Frank, the publication's chief economist, noted that investors might not be willing to risk moving money out of tax-exempt funds merely to gain a percentage point or two in taxables over the short run. The end-of-season pressures brought on by tax strategies and other portfolio shifts may be only a couple weeks off, Mr. Frank said, and yields could head to levels higher than present ones.
Assets of tax-exempt funds for the week declined $777 million, to a total of $103.1 billion. The average number of days left to maturity of securities held in tax-free fund portfolios held at 55, analysts said.
The seven-day average compounded yield for tax-exempt funds dropped 22 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 1.73 percent. The average seven-day simple yield dropped by 21 basis points, to 1.72 percent. Statisticians for the publication calculate that over a 30-day period the compounded yield is averaging 2.32 percent, and the simple yield is 2.30 percent.
Not assuming state taxes, the taxable equivalent of the average seven-day compounded yield this week for taxpayers in the 28 percent bracket is about 2.40 percent. For those in the 31 percent bracket, it is about 2.51 percent.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million surveyed by The Money Fund Report, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund had the highest yield, at 2.42 percent. The fund is distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management in Milwaukee.
 
Taxable Yield: 2.81%
 Assets of taxable money market funds rose by $1 billion, to a total $482.2 billion. Total assets of institutional funds fell by $200 million, while retail fund assets grew by $1.2 billion.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios rose to 59 from 58.
The seven-day average compounded yield for taxable funds dropped 6 basis points, to 2.81 percent. The average seven-day simple yield dropped by 6 basis points, to 2.77 percent.
Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, distributed by Olde Asset Management Inc. in Detroit, had the best return for the week, yielding 3.75 percent.
For comparative purposes, banks adjusted their yields down a basis point in the week, to 2.74 percent.

HEADLINE: Market Place

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas

 BODY:
IN December, the airline industry seemed to have turned the corner from a period of low traffic, unstable pricing and rising fuel prices. A series of fare increases raised prices by about 10 to 15 percent, and there were signs that more people were flying.
Last week, however, the industry seemed again to be in disarray as several carriers battled each other to get people out of January ruts and flying to sunny islands or snowy ski slopes. 
 Northwest Airlines began the tussle when it announced a long-term restructuring of its lowest discount fares by offering discounts of 20 percent for two people traveling together, 30 percent for three and 40 percent for four or more.
Two days later, Delta Air Lines tore into Northwest's effort by offering cuts of 30 to 40 percent without the requirement of having passengers fly together. The move forced Northwest to back off and suspend the cuts.
Thus Delta was able to head off a long-term lowering of discount fares by putting into effect deep, but short-term, cuts.
On the surface, the industry still seems unable to build a long-term pricing structure that is both stable and simple -- something that Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of American, tried to do last March. That effort was torn apart by a promotion by Northwest, which American answered with huge reductions of its own.
But there are some signs that the industry is nearing a better balance between the number of seats and the number of fliers.
 Capacity grew about 4 percent a year during the last decade, but jumped last year for the Big Three -- American, United and Delta -- which had a huge increase in the number of new planes being delivered. The 14 percent increase in the number of seats of the Big Three was partly offset, however, by the disappearance of some carriers, including Pan Am and Midway, which kept the overall industry capacity growth at 4 percent.
But that was still high at a time when the recession cut traffic growth.
Paul Karos, airline analyst for First Boston, estimated that capacity growth this year would only be about 3 percent, and that by 1994 there could be a big reduction as recent cancellations and postponements of new planes by the weakening major carriers begin to take effect.
He said he expects the carriers struggling under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, like America West and Trans World Airlines, to survive because they have good cash positions.
But the need of these carriers to fill seats could force them to continue to undercut the fares of healthier carriers, making it more difficult for the industry to keep prices firm.
There are also some new carriers that have begun to fly, like Kiwi International, operating from Newark, and Reno Air of Nevada. And this week another new carrier, Ultrair, began flying out of Houston.
But the track record of start-ups has been poor. As they grow and challenge the large established carriers, they often do not have the financial staying power to last through protracted battles to stay in major markets.
Thus the coming year could be the time when the industry, which has shrunk to five huge dominant carriers, may be able to begin using restraint on fare discounting and agree on a pricing structure that reflects their dominance of the nation's route system.
This could mean bad news to consumers in terms of rising fares but good news to investors, who could see airlines recovering from two years of huge losses.

HEADLINE: Circle in the Square Struggling to Survive

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The Circle in the Square Theater, spiritual parent to the Off Broadway movement and progenitor of New York's growing nonprofit theater boom, is struggling for survival. Its season, which was supposed to start in November, has now been postponed until April, amid speculation in the theater industry that its doors will not reopen at all.
Officials at the Circle insist that the company is merely going through a difficult stretch. Yet with a deficit of $1.5 million, a subscriber list that has shrunk to 8,533 from 22,000 over the last two decades and financial losseson two of its last three productions, the Circle in the Square is clearly experiencing more than the difficulties afflicting other companies in the recession. 
 Emblematic of its predicament, the dusty sets for "Anna Karenina," its last production, which closed nearly four months ago, still occupy the Circle's theater at 254 West 50th Street. For now, the company is so starved for cash that it is saving the $12,000 cost of striking the sets.
 
A Resignation and a Cancellation
 Robert A. Buckley, the managing director since 1990, publicly announced his resignation two weeks ago, saying he needed "a sabbatical, since I've been working nonstop for 25 years." Mr. Buckley, who is 43, will be replaced on Feb. 1 by George A. Elmer, a 52-year-old producer and general manager, who managed the current "Ruthless" and "Remembrance" on Off Broadway and "Other People's Money" and "The Rothschilds."
Last week the Circle, as it is generally known, announced the cancellation of "Reflected Glory," a comedy by Ronald Harwood that was to have opened the season in February.
Theodore Mann, the 68-year-old artistic director, said he was trying to bring in a replacement play, in a co-production arrangement. But since tickets would have to be provided to the Circle's patient subscribers -- who have already paid $75 for a three-play season that has yet to begin -- the incentive for other producers is limited, said executives at other theater companies.
Recently the fortunes of the Circle have declined critically as well. Two of last year's productions, "On Borrowed Time," with Nathan Lane and George C. Scott, and Howard Korder's "Search and Destroy," received mixed reviews. "Anna Karenina" was roundly pummeled by critics.
Asked why he was leaving at such a critical time, Mr. Buckley said he had planned to leave sooner but delayed his departure "because I was afraid that people would think I was leaving because of the difficulties the company is going through." Both he and Mr. Mann denied that creative or financial disagreements led to his departure.
Theater producers and managers, as well as former staff members of the Circle, who agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity, said the company's budgetary problems seemed insurmountable. But Mr. Mann emphatically denied that his theater was in danger of closing permanently.
 
'The Season Will Go On'
 "As Mark Twain said, the reports of our death are greatly exaggerated," he said, adding that "we have survived many worse crises than this."
"I guarantee our subscribers that the season will go on," he said.
He insisted that the actor Brian Bedford would star in two Moliere comedies in April, and said he had lined up four to six other productions for the 1993-94 season.
Mr. Elmer, the incoming managing director, said he would not have taken the job if he did not think the company would survive. He said he had "looked at all the financials and read the letters," meaning expressions of interest from potential donors. "The fiscal condition of the company is not daunting," he concluded.
Nonetheless, the company has suffered losses on recent productions. "Anna Karenina" cost $515,000, said Paul Libin, the theater's consulting producer, and the operating loss was $10,000 a week, or nearly $80,000 during the course of the run. And Mr. Elmer said "the real killer was 'Search and Destroy,' which lost more than $350,000."
The theater had expected to earn a surplus of $400,000 during the eight weeks of Al Pacino's star turn in two plays, "Salome" and "Chinese Coffee" last year. But because of throat problems Mr. Pacino had to cut back the number of performances, to six a week from eight, reducing the show's profitability. The Circle made only $200,000, according to Mr. Buckley, before operational overhead was deducted. "We broke even, certainly, but we had counted on a bigger surplus," he said.
 
'Every Week Was Treachery'
 Mr. Libin, who was the managing director and later the producing director at the Circle from 1963 to 1990,said of keeping the theater going: "Every week was treachery, taking money from one place and putting it in another, hustling up grant money to pay back our loans. It's a constant balancing act." He left to become producing director at Jujamcyn Theaters, though he retains a consulting capacity at the Circle.
Although the Circle in the Square was able to reduce its deficit by several hundred thousand dollars last season, the current accumulated deficit is about $1.5 million, according to Mr. Libin. This figure is nearly the same as it was in 1991 -- $1,581,721 -- according to the organization's most recent tax return filed with the New York State Attorney General, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1991.
The company's current lease runs until 2001; the deed stipulates that the space must be used as a theater, a result of efforts in the John V. Lindsay administration to revitalize Broadway by offering concessions to builders if they included theaters in new office towers. The builder, Harold D. Uris, got 10 additional floors of space thanks to the two theaters in the building: the 681-seat theater occupied by the Circle and the 1,933-seat Gershwin Theater, which was originally called the Uris.
The Circle in the Square moved uptown to its current location from Greenwich Village to Broadway in the fall of 1972, into a new horseshoe-shaped space that was intended to recapture the environmental intimacy of the Circle's Bleecker Street theater. But from the outset, some criticized it as awkward. Mr. Mann says the space "enables audiences to focus on the language," but some actors and directors had said it limited staging options and caused sight-line problems for the audience.
These days, aside from readings, student productions and a benefit starring Vanessa Redgrave on Monday to aid Holocaust-research efforts in the Soviet Union, the principal sign of activity at the Circle is its theater-school operation, which is a major source of revenue. According to Mr. Libin, the school, with 350 acting students, has brought in about $900,000 this season.
"Right now, they're living off the school," said a former employee of the Circle who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
 
Borrowing From Itself
 Mr. Buckley said this year's revenues from subscribers had been "commingled," meaning that they were used to cover current expenses. In effect, the Circle has been borrowing from itself against anticipated income.
Income from subscribers is often used in this way at institutional theaters, Mr. Elmer said. Executives at other nonprofits confirmed this, though several used the word "dangerous" to describe the practice, since it leaves a company without funds earmarked to meet its subscriber obligations.
"Without commenting specifically about the Circle in the Square," said Richard Barr, a spokesman for the New York State Attorney General's Office, "it is the view of our office that subscribers should get what they paid for." He said there were no complaints against the Circle and that it was not under investigation.
The Circle in the Square began in 1951, so its longevity exceeds that of the New York Shakespeare Festival, the La Mama Experimental Theater Company and most of the city's other theater perennials. In recent years, it has been facing relentless competition for audiences, financing and media attention from other nonprofit companies like Lincoln Center Theater, the Manhattan Theater Club, the National Actors Theater, Playwrights Horizons and the Roundabout Theater, companies that owe a measure of their success in part to the subscription-based institutional theater concept the Circle helped pioneer.
 
Some Early Successes
 In 1952 the company's first hit production, Tennessee Williams' "Summer and Smoke," starring Geraldine Page, brought many critics and theatergoers to performances in downtown Manhattan for the first time, and was an impetus to the development of the Off Broadway movement. The success of the Circle's 1956 production of "The Iceman Cometh" helped re-establish the reputation of Eugene O'Neill.
Although the Circle has received glowing notices for some of its revivals and experimentation with new works, in recent years productions have been inconsistent, and some critics said the value of the work seemed less dependent on institutional continuity than on the quality of the directors and actors in individual productions.
Mr. Mann, the bearded, sleepy-voiced artistic director, who was a young lawyer when he helped found the theater in 1951, is the link with the institution's past and is now its staunchest defender. He stated that he was not ready to step down, though he added that "for some time now I have been thinking about a successor."
Several managers at other subscription theaters criticized the Circle's 16-member board, which will have to find much of the money to mount the three new productions promised to subscribers, and has hired a new developmental consultant to do so. The board has a number of relatively inactive members, including Lucille Lortel, who said in an interview that she fully supported Mr. Mann but that "for a long time I haven't gone to any of the board meetings."
John C. Russell, the chairman, said, "The board has been active, but we're trying to get the board to increase its activity."
Mr. Russell said flatly that the company "will mount a season," adding, "We continue to have confidence in Ted and Paul."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
As Rock Beat Fades, Clinton's Presidency Opens on a Soft Note

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
"We march to the music of our time," President Clinton said today in his Inaugural Address. But the rock-and-roll Presidency that some feared and others hoped for has already begun to look like what radio stations call "adult contemporary" or "lite" rock, sticking to plush, cautious tunes that wouldn't risk anything like excitement, much less rudeness.
On cable television on Sunday, the Clinton media brain trust came close to hipness, booking the rapper L. L. Cool J. for may be history's first pre-Presidential rap. But on network television, in "An American Reunion," the CBS-TV variety show on Tuesday night, it was back to musical diversions direct from the Jimmy Carter era. None other than Barry Manilow, unhipness incarnate, was the first big star trotted out for a program that featured ballads, ballads, ballads. It made the average Grammy Awards telecast sound avant-garde. 
 On Tuesday night, except for jazz from a vigorous all-star group and rock-and-roll from Chuck Berry and Little Richard -- both segments brutally truncated for commercials -- the show brought music for cocooning rather than dancing, music that would rather soothe than inspire. Barbra Streisand unveiled a lounge-act version of "God Bless America" that caressed the word "sweet" as if America were a sleepy, beloved child. The first musical trend of the Clinton era is the recasting of patriotic flag-wavers as lullabies. So long, Kate Smith, and hello, Raffi.
The second trend is the willingness of rockers and rappers to take up praise songs, like African griots extolling their patrons and chiefs. In contrast to its predecessors, the Clinton Administration seems relatively hospitable to rock music, and rockers aren't wasting any time in showing their gratitude. L. L. Cool J. on Sunday, then Chuck Berry on Tuesday -- singing "Bill's gonna get this country straight" -- hailed the new chief, as if suggesting that rap and rock, already co-opted for soundtracks and commercials, are ready to line up behind the new powers instead of hurling spitballs from the sidelines. During the finale, Mr. Clinton pumped Little Richard's hand and came back to trade high-fives with him, as if welcoming rock's anarchic spirit to the team.
But the welcome seems halfhearted; schmaltz, not rock, was the official musical choice, offering reassurance rather than any jarring change. Even Fleetwood Mac's uptempo "Don't Stop," the campaign theme and the show's finale, came from "Rumours," the 1977 album that marked the commercial peak of soft rock. The Clintons (and the Gores) came of age in the 1960's, a time of psychedelia and turbulence and generational divisions, but their heart doesn't seem to be in that era. Where the two previous Republican Administrations strove to roll back the 60's, the emerging Clinton style is simply to say, as Fleetwood Mac did in 1977, "yesterday's gone."
The new Administration would clearly prefer that voters connect it to the comparatively settled 1970's, through a nostalgic haze that forgets how much the 70's extended the indulgences of the 60's. With Michael Bolton singing Bill Withers's "Lean on Me" and Ms. Streisand crooning "Evergreen," the network special steered away from the 70's of Eric Clapton's hit "Cocaine" or the Eagles' "Life in the Fast Lane," or any of rock's other tales of hedonism unto decadence, away from the 70's of Studio 54 and Plato's Retreat. After the increasingly sober, pleasure-fearing 1980's, the Clinton revue offered the 70's as a cozy remembered era of everlasting love and devotion.
In the 1990's, that coziness segues naturally to thoughts of compassion, preferably toward innocent and uncontroversial victims. Before Michael Jackson sang "Gone Too Soon" on Tuesday night, he urged the new President to "commit the resources necessary to eliminate" AIDS; he dedicated the song to the hemophilic AIDS victim Ryan White, taking pains to describe him as "very normal" (an odd word for Mr. Jackson to use). Ms. Streisand, performing Stephen Sondheim's "Children Will Listen," stumped for prevention of child abuse. Family, health and environmental consciousness are home-front issues like the economy, all about retaining (or bringing back) a sense of well-being instead of shaking things up.
For the moment, it seems as if the Presidential esthetic has skipped a musical generation, moving directly from pre-rock, Tin Pan Alley tastes to soft-rock ballads, the La-Z-Boy recliners of popular music. Maybe the idea is to ease America into a time of change. But as Americans grow ever more suspicious of photo-opportunity poses with little to back them up, it was hardly reassuring to notice that when Michael Jackson sang "Heal the World" for the new Administration, he was apparently lip-synching.

Laughs That Mask the Fears of Gay Manhattan

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Jeffrey, the title character of Paul Rudnick's wildly funny new comedy at the WPA Theater, is a gay man in his mid-30's who, exhausted from negotiating safe sex, decides to become celibate. It's not that he hasn't had his share of adventure. Jeffrey estimates he has had 5,000 sexual encounters but remained H.I.V. negative.
"I'm not promiscuous," he declares. "It's such an ugly word. I'm cheap." 
 A mostly unemployed actor, he makes his living as a freelance "cater-waiter" for fancy services with names like Arugula With Attitude. Wearing spotless uniforms and serving large numbers of people in tents, he says, "is like being in the gay National Guard."
For all its fun, "Jeffrey" captures the strained social tenor of Manhattan life as it is lived right now perhaps more acutely than any play since John Guare's "Six Degrees of Separation." The desperate, brittle tone of the hilarity underscores the ghastly sense of the absurd that the AIDS epidemic has brought to hypersophisticated Manhattan society.
Beneath its playful surface, "Jeffrey" wrestles with questions of life, death and erotic partnership that thousands are facing every day. In the sexually supercharged milieu of gay New York, the playwright asks, what are the practical implications of celibacy? And if abstinence is an emotionally and spiritually self-punishing response to AIDS, what is the wisest approach to seeking erotic fulfillment?
Mr. Rudnick's comedy is packed with bon mots that fly so profusely from the stage that the laughter rarely flags. Many of the best one-liners are delivered by Jeffrey's best friend, Sterling (Edward Hibbert), a waspish interior decorator who resembles a much younger Quentin Crisp and who defines a boyfriend as "a pet that can feed and walk itself."
Sterling's lover, Darius (Bryan Batt), in fact dresses like a pet. A sweet-natured, not-very-bright cast member of the Broadway musical "Cats," he rarely bothers to change out of his feline costume.
The play's other significant character, Steve (Tom Hewitt), is a handsome bartender whom Jeffrey meets in a gym and who could be his Mr. Right except for one impediment. Steve has been H.I.V. positive for five years, and Jeffrey is terrified of getting involved with someone he fears could get sick and die at any moment.
Short satirical sketches depict Jeffrey's visits to a gym filled with voyeurs, a safe-sex club that is all talk and no action and a meeting of Sexual Compulsives Anonymous. He attends a lecture by a sharp-tongued, double-talking new-age guru (Harriet Harris), who is apparently a caricature of Marianne Williamson, and visits St. Patrick's Cathedral, where he is importuned by a lustful priest.
A bit too digressive, the play sometimes threatens to become a disconnected series of sketches satirizing gay New York. A gay-bashing scene in which Jeffrey is attacked by toughs on Christopher Street seems inserted more to cover the political spectrum of gay issues than to advance the story.
Where Mr. Rudnick, who wrote last season's Broadway comedy "I Hate Hamlet," succeeds is in being completely up to the minute and traditional at the same time. The predicament of true love thwarted by obstacles is as old as comedy itself. But in "Jeffrey," the stumbling block isn't a disapproving parent or an inconvenient partner but a deadly retrovirus. The denouement that Mr. Rudnick has concocted is at once touching and wonderfully right.
"Jeffrey" has been brilliantly brought to the stage by Christopher Ashley, the young director who oversaw Anna Deavere Smith's "Fires in the Mirror" at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. In the production, which uses slides and a few props to evoke interiors, an ensemble of eight actors delivers Mr. Rudnick's epigrams with a seamless consistency of tone.
While Mr. Higgins and Mr. Hewitt make an appealing pair of sparring partners, the show is almost stolen by Ms. Harris. Playing eight small roles, she displays a gift for caricature that is as far-reaching as it is subtle.
"Jeffrey" is just the sort of play that Oscar Wilde might have written had he lived in 1990's Manhattan and taken aim at an epidemic that was decimating his circle of friends.

HEADLINE: Mr. Cuomo's Welcome Austerity

 BODY:
In his proposed budget, Gov. Mario Cuomo tries to make up for past fiscal sins by going straight, or mostly straight. He tries fewer gimmicks and makes more stringent cuts. He wants a fairer allocation of school aid, and if there's no income tax cut, there's no income tax increase either.
The Governor's welcome overall answer to years of mismanagement in New York State -- his own and the Legislature's -- is to get more serious than ever about reforms and the need for intelligent ways to tighten the belt. Several of his proposals can't be assessed without more information and study; others sound sensible and worth pursuing. 
 Clearly, the state should close underused mental hospitals and modernize the Department of Motor Vehicles to make it more efficient. Those and other measures would trim 4,700 jobs from the state work force.
Whether or not his plan to cut $130 million out of school aid goes too far, he deserves strong support for this latest proposal to allocate education funds more equitably.
He would give less to wealthy districts and more to poor districts like New York City that are denied their fair share of state funding now because suburban legislators in the Republican-dominated State Senate block reallocation.
This time, events outside Albany's control may make the issue harder for the Senate to duck, like the well-publicized brouhaha over a Long Island school official's outlandish pension and strong efforts to reform education funding in neighboring Connecticut.
Other aspects of the plan raise legitimate questions. The Governor proposes to take $516 million in petroleum business taxes from the so-called "locked box" for transportation and use it instead to help plug an anticipated budget gap of $3.7 billion. Is that the best use of the money?
And it's possible that the budget inflicts undue damage on the weakest and poorest of New Yorkers. Do the deep Medicaid cuts -- including new limits on home care and eliminating reimbursement for such items as walkers -- go too far? Is it really necessary to cut back on scholarships for new college students? Can local governments sustain state aid cuts without suffering?
New Yorkers may also reasonably ask whether the budget provides adequate funding for mass transit, whether raising the cigarette tax from 39 to 60 cents a pack could backfire by encouraging massive bootlegging, and whether it is wise or realistic to increase the state's reliance on gambling by creating a new keno game.
But these questions need to be asked in fair context: Mr. Cuomo presented an austere budget because he had to. The state is in financial difficulty and the economy has yet to rebound.
Given those woeful circumstances, he presented a budget plan that acknowledges fiscal reality and for the most part deals with it responsibly. Now it's up to the Legislature to do the same.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION;
CLINTON TAKES OATH AS 42D PRESIDENT, URGING SACRIFICE TO 'RENEW AMERICA'

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
William Jefferson Clinton became the 42d President of the United States today, and in an Inaugural Address striking in its appeal for sacrifice, he told Americans that if they assume greater responsibility for their country's future, "there is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America."
The 46-year-old Governor of Arkansas, virtually unknown to most Americans 18 months ago and a long shot for the White House, took the oath of office under a stunningly blue sky from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. President George Herbert Walker Bush, who once seemed sure to win a second term, watched stoically from his seat on the Capitol steps. 
 Under Mr. Clinton's left hand, his wife, Hillary, held a King James Bible given to Mr. Clinton by his grandmother. His 12-year-old daughter, Chelsea, stood at his right as he uttered the traditional oath at 11:58 A.M. Eastern time. He then spoke for 14 minutes to a sea of people, flowing down from the flag-draped Western facade of the Capitol to the Washington Monument.
 
'What America Does Best'
 "We must do what America does best: offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all," Mr. Clinton declared in an echo of John F. Kennedy's Inaugural Address. "It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing, from our Government or from each other. Let us all take more responsibility, not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country."
In a speech with the recurring theme of renewal, Mr. Clinton implored at one point: "To renew America we must be bold. We must do what no generation has had to do before." [Transcript, page A15.]
Washington never looked better, or felt better. Cheerful chaos reigned on the streets, in a subway system that is usually weirdly sedate and on the Mall, in front of the Capitol, where something like a quarter of a million people endured mobs and metal detectors and midwinter chill. Schools and Federal offices had a quadrennial holiday, so natives joined tourists beneath a Capitol that was dressed for the day in gowns of red, white and blue, and glittered in the January sun.
 
Walk Through the Crowd
 In a day of ceremonies intended to be casual and intimate -- with lots of Presidential bear hugs for friends and a conscious assertion of the passing of power to the post-World War II generation -- the Clintons walked the last few blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House. Before the Clintons decided to get out of their new armor-plated Cadillac, the crowds along the route were chanting: "Walk! Walk!"
From the viewing stand in front of the White House's iron gates, the Clintons watched a politically inclusive parade, encompassing everyone from Arkansas bands to gay groups to Elvis impersonators -- like the rest of the inaugural as meticulously scripted as any Hollywood production. Throughout, Mr. Clinton wore the amazed grin of a man whose lifelong dream had just come true.
The flag-waving crowds along the parade route were striking both for their enthusiasm and their racial diversity. The upbeat mood of the well-wishers seemed on track with that of recent national polls -- one of guarded optimism about Mr. Clinton's prospects, coupled with a strong desire to give the new President a chance.
 
Short, Informal Speech
 Mr. Clinton's Inaugural Address, far more compact than the lengthy oratory of his long 1988 Democratic National Convention speech, was informal and almost conversational.
It was typical of the New Age political style that helped him win the highest office in the land. While Mr. Clinton paid homage to many of the themes that won him the election -- the need for renewal, health-care reform, economic revival and political reform -- his address was not an agenda for action, but rather a call to service.
"You, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring," he said. "Now we must do the work the season demands."
The address was at times brutally frank in its assessment of the decline of the country under Mr. Bush and in its chastising of an aloof and self-absorbed Congress, as well as an apathetic American public.
"We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps. But we have not done so," said Mr. Clinton, who wore a dark blue suit and no top coat as he spoke on the chilly winter day. "Instead, we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence.
"Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation, we would need dramatic change from time to time. Well, my fellow Americans, this is our time. Let us embrace it. Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America."
In the age of satellite communications, which Mr. Clinton put to such good use during the campaign, the new President used his address to speak not only to the hundreds of thousands gathered before him, but also to America's allies and enemies over the horizon. He signaled the world in general, and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in particular, that while America renewed itself at home it would not abandon its responsibilities abroad.
"Together with our friends and allies, we will work to shape change, lest it engulf us," said Mr. Clinton, speaking behind a shield of bullet-proof glass. "When our vital interests are challenged, or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act, with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary."
 
Transfer of Power
 A moment after being sworn in, Mr. Clinton turned and shook hands with Mr. Bush. Their eyes locked for three seconds as they pumped each other's hands in what appeared in many ways to be the real passing of authority. At that moment, Mr. Bush's military aide carrying the locked briefcase of nuclear-warfare codes, and standing on the podium behind him, began taking orders from a new Commander in Chief.
While every inauguration celebrates the peaceful transfer of power that is the hallmark of American democracy, in the case of Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton that transfer is all the more amazing. Eighteen months ago, Mr. Bush was at the peak of his political power, the victorious commander of a successful and unusually painless war in the Persian Gulf, riding the crest of polls with 80 percent approval ratings. Most serious Democrat did not believe there was any sense in even trying to challenge him.
Mr. Clinton was then Governor of one of the nation's poorest states, worrying about getting a one-cent sales tax through his legislature, but also burning with enough ambition to set off against Mr. Bush when more cautious Democrats hesitated.
Mr. Clinton got his reward today. About 1 P.M., he and his wife waved from the Capitol steps as Mr. Bush and his wife, Barbara, flew off by helicopter to an early retirement in Houston -- while a United Van Lines trailer with Arkansas license plates was backing into the White House driveway to move in the Clintons' belongings.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton had to work closely during the transition to deal with foreign-policy crises in Haiti and Iraq, and it may have left them with a measure of mutual respect undetectable in their bitter election campaign, when Mr. Bush once dismissed Mr. Clinton as a "bozo" who knew less about foreign affairs than Millie, the Bushes' dog.
 
Salute to Bush
 At the top of his address Mr. Clinton hailed Mr. Bush, saying: "On behalf of our nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to America."
Mr. Clinton's inauguration represents not only a change in Presidents and parties but also of generations. The generation symbolized by President Bush was shaped by the patriotism of World War II, sobered by the deprivations of the Great Depression and serenaded by the music of Frank Sinatra.
It now gives way to a fortysomething crowd who were born into politics during the idealistic, prosperous era of John F. Kennedy, but forged their identities singing along with Bob Dylan through the troublesome seasons of Vietnam, Watergate and acid rain.
For the first time America has a President and Vice President younger than the Beatles. At age 46, Mr. Clinton is the third youngest President. Only his idol John F. Kennedy, who took office in 1961 at 43, and Theodore Roosevelt, who took office at 42, were younger.
Mr. Clinton's fellow baby-boomer and now Vice President, Al Gore, the 44-year-old former Senator from Tennessee, was sworn in by Justice Byron R. White, as his wife, Tipper, and his four children crowded around. Mr. Gore had chosen the retired Justice Thurgood Marshall, but Mr. Marshall was too ill and had to beg off at the last minute.
There were 14 official balls and who knows how many unofficial ones tonight, including an "Inaugural Ball for the Not Well Connected" and an affair sponsored by MTV, the only one where women showed up with bats tatooed on their bare backs.
"Everybody here knows that MTV had a lot to do with the Clinton-Gore victory," Mr. Clinton told the rock-loving crowd, where attire ranged from prom dresses to ripped jeans.
The MTV crowd greeted the Clintons like celebrities, surging forward with enthusiasm when they appeared. But Tipper Gore, who has opposed violent and sexually suggestive rock lyrics, was visibly shaken when she was booed as she approached a microphone.
Presidential reserve was thrown to the winds at a ball with fellow Arkansans. The new President grabbed a saxophone from the rhythm and blues musician Ben E. King and played a solo, then topped of a little speech with the Arkansas football holler, "Soooooweeeee, Razorbacks."
In his speech in the afternoon, Mr. Clinton said, "Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues. Raised in unrivaled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still the world's strongest, but weakened by business failures, stagnant wages, increasing inequality and deep divisions among our own people."
In a line that appeared directed most at the politically reform-minded supporters of Ross Perot, Mr. Clinton included in his address a swipe at the politicians, lobbyists and political forces that he said had made Washington a city synonymous with corruption.
"This beautiful capital, like every capital since the dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation," Mr. Clinton said, with Senators and Congressmen gathered on the Capitol steps behind him. "Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down, forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our way. Americans deserve better."
 
Biblical Flourish
 Mr. Clinton then closed with a rhetorical flourish, that blended the Biblical with the political: "From this joyful mountaintop of celebration, we hear a call to service in the valley. We have heard the trumpets. We have changed the guard. And now, each in our own way, and with God's help, we must answer the call."
Mr. Clinton's first official act was to sign an executive order imposing his new, much stricter ethical standards on senior officials in his Administration, and another order proclaiming Friday as a "national day of fellowship and hope." He also signed nominating papers for his Cabinet appointees.
Republicans, wary of being drowned in what they see as a reservoir of goodwill greeting Mr. Clinton's inauguration, despite his occasionally rocky transition to power, pledged their cooperation.
"I think he is going to have a lot of good will," said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who just returned from a Florida vacation. "I was running on the beach and I saw a lot of people and they would shout at me: 'Give him a chance, give him a chance.' So this is Clinton's moment and we won't do anything to interfere with it."
Mr. Clinton's day began, as his term begins, with a focus not on the domestic issues which got him elected but on the foreign crises which threaten to divert his attention. He was briefed at Blair House, one last time, by Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, on the state of the world he is about to inherit.
Mr. Clinton walked out of Blair House, gripping a mug of decaffeinated coffee, for the short drive to the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, a prominent black Baptist church in downtown Washington.
 
A Laugh and a Tear
 While the chorus gave a rousing rendition of the hymns "Holy Ground" and "Precious Lord Take My Hand," Mr. Clinton laughed, nodded, and sang along, dabbing a tear on his left cheek.
President Bush began his last day in the White House by making a solitary walk around the South Lawn and then returning to the Oval Office to write a note to leave behind for Mr. Clinton, as Ronald Reagan had done with Mr. Bush.
Mr. Reagan's note said: "Don't let the Turkeys get you down." Mr. Bush would not say what his note said.
Mr. Clinton's inauguration was closed by a poem read by his favorite poet, Maya Angelou, who wrote "On the Pulse of Morning" to celebrate Mr. Clinton's inauguration as the dawn of a new era of national unity. It ended with the verses:
Here, on the pulse of this new day
You may have the grace to look up and out
And into your sister's eyes, and into
Your brother's face, your country
And say simply
Very simply
With hope --
Good morning.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION;
A Change of Power, but Barely a Break in Stride

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Today was the day of Bill Clinton's dreams, the day he and his party finished the arduous climb to a "joyful mountaintop of celebration," but like all Inauguration Days, it was more than that.
It was a day when the nation committed itself once more, with the recital of a simple 18th-century oath, to what the new President felicitously termed "the mystery of American renewal." The solemn magic of the moment, in this most telling of national rituals, lies in what it symbolizes: the unquestioned acceptance by victor, vanquished and public alike of the continuity and legitimacy of governance. 
 The United States crowns no kings. But as he stood before the Capitol and spoke the words George Washington first uttered in lower Manhattan on April 30, 1789, Mr. Clinton embodied this nation's unity, in something of the way a monarch embodies Britain's at the hour of coronation in Westminster Abbey.
Jack Valenti, who worked in the White House three decades ago, calls the man in the Oval Office "the keeper of the national integrity and the steward of our civic virtue."
As such, Mr. Clinton starts with the good wishes of most Americans. But he is the leader of a Government as well as an icon of nationhood, and in that capacity he begins with less than universal acceptance. He won the votes, after all, of only 43 percent of those who cast ballots last November, and since then, he has excited wariness as well as enthusiasm in the country.
 
Bitter Democratic Memories
 Few will take exception to his message of hope and rebirth, but it is far less certain that he will carry the country with him in his appeal to "face hard truths and take strong steps" in a spirit of shared sacrifice. That will depend not only upon who is asked to give up what, and how fair the apportionment seems, but also upon Mr. Clinton's ability to stir a citizenry that has been more preoccupied with "me" than with "us" for much of the last two decades.
The Old Guard in his party remembers all too well the self-immolation of the last two Democratic Administrations, those headed by Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter, and prays that the rule of three will not apply in this case. But many have been perturbed by a rocky transition period.
"Lyndon used to say that the President proposes and the country disposes," said Walter Shorenstein, the San Francisco financier and fund-raiser, "and in his case it disposed of him. No matter how smart the Clinton people are, there are lots of bumps in the road ahead, and I hope they remember that."
Even at their moment of triumph, many of the Clinton people seem acutely aware that their margin for error, never great, has been reduced by the conflict, the disorganization and the resultant tardiness that marred the transition. When a reporter complained this week to George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, that his answers to her questions were flat and unilluminating, he replied, "I can't afford to be colorful."
At the beginning and end of his Inaugural Address, especially, the new President showed that he can find the language of exaltation that a President needs. Many in his audience were moved by the Biblical cadences so beloved of Southern orators. The length of the speech as well, only 14 minutes, showed a new discipline in a man who has often proven embarrassingly prolix.
He brings other strengths to the task of coping with economic dilemmas at home and the "ancient hatreds and new plagues" of the world -- not only his intelligence and mastery of policy detail, not only his determination and stamina, his youth and idealism, but also his membership in a fresh generation. Only four years ago, Ronald Reagan, who was born before World War I, sat in the White House; the new occupant was born after World War II, "in the shadows of the cold war," as Mr. Clinton put it.
The prospect of new departures has produced a new if guarded optimism among voters across the country who found the Bush Administration old and tired. The prospect of power has galvanized Democrats eminent and humble, from Pamela Harriman, the Georgetown hostess and power broker, who pronounced herself "thrilled" after the swearing-in, to the thousands who lined up early to cheer the Monarch Band from Papillon, Neb., and a double-dozen others.
 
A Need to Buy Some Time
 Yet Mr. Clinton has not yet shown the country that he himself can make the tough choices that will be needed -- between cutting the deficit and investing in new infrastructure or new governmental programs, say, or between allowing the slaughter of innocents in Bosnia to continue or risking a prolonged and draining American involvement.
He will try to buy time on some thorny issues, like homosexuality in the military, where he is proposing a two-step approach, or meeting with Boris N. Yeltsin, on which he is just plain stalling so as not to lose his focus on domestic affairs. But he promised a lot, and he will have to deliver something soon.
The problems experienced by the Clinton team during the transition may prove to be transitory, the product of inexperience. If a President does well in his first few months, the transition is soon forgotten. But problems may persist. As Carl M. Brauer writes in "Presidential Transitions" (Oxford University Press): "Transitions are the shadow of the man who heads them. They silhouette his past experience and future goals, strengths and weaknesses."
Some profess to see in Mr. Clinton's promises of a Government that "looks like America," to cut the deficit by a quarter in four years, to produce wonders in his first 100 days, and so on, a tendency to give hostages to fortune. Certainly they have caused him embarrassment during the transition, as has his habit of talking casually about complex foreign-policy issues.
Others worry that he is too eager to please, too loath to say no.
 
Fragile Covenant
 After a campaign that focused on questions of character, the President will be judged mostly on what he accomplishes and what he does not, at least at first. No one expects him to accomplish everything he promised to. But if he seems to make a habit of trimming, if he gains a reputation for evasion, as he did for a time during the campaign, he will quickly dissipate the advantage that accrued to him as he stood today, bright as a new penny in a city and a nation that love new things, in the thin winter sunshine of the capital.
It will happen quickly because the covenant between President and people has become a fragile one, worn thin by the lies of Vietnam and Watergate and the suspicions about politicians and institutions that linger, and also because of the awesome speed and impact of the modern media of communication.
But Bill Clinton's advantage is this: The nation is tired of gridlock and cynicism. It longs to believe again. Tonight he is there at the center, in the White House, after such a long and unlikely journey from Hope, Ark.

Primary Dealer Records a Big Loss

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The last three years have been banner ones for the 39 primary dealers that are the heart of the $2.3 trillion Government securities market.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the dealers as a whole made about $800 million in profits in 1990 and a record $1 billion in 1991. Moreover, they accumulated profits of $900 million through September and could be looking to another record year. 
 Still, the business is not as easy as rolling off a log. And for those that get it right, there are are those who get it wrong.
The Discount Corporation of New York, one of smaller primary dealers without the backing of a large parent company, is one of the firms that have got it wrong.
Discount yesterday reported a surprising fourth-quarter after-tax loss of $26.3 million and an after-tax loss of $24.5 million for all of 1992. Of the fourth- quarter loss, close to $20 million may have been from trading losses, since that is the company's main business.
 
 
Stock Plunges
 Trading of the company's stock on the New York Stock Exchange was halted before the announcement. When trading resumed, the shares fell -- ending the day down 30 percent, or $3.125, at $7.375.
Raphael de la Gueronniere, the chairman who took over the troubled primary dealership in mid-1991, would not comment on the losses.
Other players in the primary dealer business said the loss was amazing, but could not say what wrong bets Discount might have made in a year that had been pretty good for most of the other dealers. According to the Federal Reserve, about 87 percent -- or 34 of the 39 dealers -- had reported profits though September.
Possibly unfortunately for Discount, because it is not owned by a larger company, its profits and its losses from trading are easily identified, making it one of the few clear examples of the ups and downs possible in the Government securities markets. The fate of most of the other primary dealers are mixed with the profits and losses of a larger company.
Discount is still going through a major revamping, including the sale of subsidiary businesses, as the company refocuses on its core business, the primary dealership. It had reported losses for four of the last five quarters. The $8.8 million operating profit made in the fourth quarter of 1991 was wiped out by a one-time $11.95 million charge to pay for the revamping of the firm.
The company's futures trading subsidiary was closed in the fourth quarter and since new management took over a year and half ago, the firm's work force had been cut from 400 people to 125.
The loss in the fourth quarter includes one-time charges that total about $5.7 million, including $2 million for the closing of the futures business and $4.5 million for a further write-down of the value of the firm's headquarters in New York City. There is also a $1.2 million credit from adjustment of pension liabilities because of the layoff of so many employees.
 
Treasury Market
 Bill Clinton was inaugurated as President yesterday but the bond market did not have much to say about it. Prices were little changed except for an 11/32 -point fall in the price of the 30-year bond. But that was more of a correction after a hearty rally rather than any statement on the new Administration, traders said.
But Jay Goldinger, a trader at Capital Insight in Los Angeles, noted with a chuckle that the price of the 30-year bond hit its high for the day just at the time that Mr. Clinton finished his oath as President.
Traders noted there were no details of any portion of the new President's economic program in his first speech to the nation as President.
John Costas, a managing director at the First Boston Corporation, said that traders and investors seemed to steep back as the yields on both shorter maturities and the 30-year bond approached recent lows. For the two-year note that yield is 4.25 percent and for the 30-year bond it is 7.25 percent.
Yesterday, the yield on the 30-year bond ended at 7.33 percent, up from 7.3 percent Tuesday. The yield on the two-year note dipped to 4.35 percent, down from 4.37 percent the day before but up from 4.29 percent at the end of last week.
Mr. Costas said that "4.25 percent and 7.25 percent are proving to be difficult resistance levels for the market."
One of the forces that has been moving the market up and down recently, according to Mr. Costas, has been traders moving in and out of what are called curve trades. When traders think that the spread between the yields on the two-year note and the 30-year bond is widening they sell long maturities and buy short ones. When the spread is narrowing, they sell short maturities and buy long ones.
Views of what position to take, Mr. Costas said, change with the view of the economy. When people think it is getting stronger they shift into the flattening trade; when they think it is getting weaker, they short to the steepening trade.

HEADLINE: SETTLING IN: AROUND THE NATION;
Much Outrage, Little Sympathy On Main Street

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Behind the counter at a pet store in a middle-class Washington suburb, Carolyn Williford had drawn herself up in outrage at the notion that Zoe Baird might become Attorney General after hiring illegal immigrants to care for her toddler.
"She thought she could do something illegal and get away with it," said the 45-year-old assistant manager at Doctor's Pet Center in Hyattsville, Md. "I don't think it's fair. I raised my kids while I was working. I worked days. My husband worked nights at the post office. Our in-laws filled in when they had to. This makes me mad." 
 Ms. Baird removed herself from consideration as Attorney General early this morning, amid swelling opposition to her nomination. Ms. Baird's household arrangements, and her failure to pay Social Security taxes for her Peruvian employees, had struck a nerve on Capitol Hill as well as across America. Her defenders had insisted that hers was a sin of good intentions motivated by nothing more sinister than a desire for good child care -- a venial transgression for which a sincere apology and penalty payments should have been sufficient atonement. But Main Street seemed impatient with moral relativism.
 
The Sounds of Anger
 The anger across the country had come in varied tones, like a musical chord. The dominant note was one of class, of resentment over what seemed like a double standard that favored the rich.
But other notes filled out the theme: the anger of well-to-do people who wrestled quarterly with the Internal Revenue Service household tax forms that one person called "infuriating and outrageous"; the anger of people who thought that "she was just being greedy" and not paying her workers enough, whatever their legal status; the conviction of some people that she should have let President Clinton begin his Administration without having to defend her.
And while voices were raised in her defense, questioning the law or the country's preoccupation with moral purity, the major women's groups were largely silent, leaving unanswered the angry chorus that finally drowned out support for the first woman ever nominated to be Attorney General.
In a recent poll by the Gallup Organization, a majority of the public had expressed some concern when told "that Bill Clinton's nominee for Attorney General, Zoe Baird, hired illegal aliens to work in her home in violation of the law." Fifty-one percent of the 754 adults interviewed Monday and Tuesday said that was a "major concern" to them.
Another 33 percent had said it was a "minor concern," while 15 percent had said it was "not a concern at all." The national telephone poll, which Gallup conducted for CNN and USA Today, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Diane Rehm, hostess of "The Diane Rehm Show" on WAMU-FM in Washington, said a solid majority of callers had asked Ms. Baird to step aside. "There were feelings that the people did not want Mr. Clinton to start his new Administration with this as a potential problem hanging around his neck," she said.
"There were also feelings that this was a so-called 'yuppie crime.' That people in positions of power and money were feeling that they could do whatever they wanted, and to hell with the rest of the country. And that surely, surely, if this woman is as bright as they say she is, she should have known better.
"There was very little sympathy for her," she added. "Very little sympathy."
In San Diego County this week, an attorney for a woman accused in Federal Court of transporting illegal aliens moved for dismissal on the basis of selective prosecution. The grounds: Zoe Baird had not been prosecuted.
 
Some Can Understand
 Yet a sympathetic strain arose, from suburban Delaware to downtown San Francisco. While many people viewed the issue as a simple matter of right and wrong, others reacted with dismissive forgiveness.
Audrey Scott, a 30-year-old computer programmer who had just bought seedless grapes at Stiles market on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan, said she had children and had found it difficult to find help. "I don't think Zoe Baird did anything wrong," she said. "She gave some people a job."
Papusa Molina, 41, single, director of the University of Iowa's Women's Resource Action Center, said: "I'm sure hundreds of thousands of 'regular' citizens end up employing undocumented immigrants. She wasn't so out of line. It's something many middle- and upper-middle-class citizens do.
"Perhaps I'm cynical," said the Mexican-born woman, who earns $33,000 a year, "but in Mexico we believe no one is a saint. Private lives here become such an issue when a person enters public life. If everyone's background was so scrutinized, we wouldn't be able to elect anybody to public office."
 
Some Sawee No Excuse
 Shirley Ellis, a 54-year-old laborer in Chicago, said that, as the mother of three children, she empathized with Ms. Baird. "I don't like to wink at things that are truly illegal, but I think she probably put the priority of her child first," Ms. Ellis said. "I can't condemn her for that."
But the murmurs of sympathy by Ms. Ellis, Ms. Molina, Ms. Scott and others were drowned out by the cries of outrage. The sin a Wall Street Journal headline called "Boomer Blind Spot" may be widespread, but it is not publicly condoned.
Shelley Gates, an associate director at a women's organization in Chicago and the mother of two small children, said Ms. Baird's action's were inexcusable.
"Average working mothers don't make nearly what she makes, and yet we are obligated to follow the law," Ms. Gates said. "It's kind of unfair. This certainly diminishes her credibility."
 
Above the Law?
 Daniel Williams, a Philadelphia computer programmer with four children said that the issue was that Ms. Baird wanted to represent the law of the land, but that she had knowingly broken that law.
"If you don't like the law, you should work to get it changed," Mr. Williams said. "She had the contacts and the wherewithal to do that. I respect her talents, her experience, and I think her appointment would have been great, but I'm very uncomfortable with her placing herself above the law she is sworn to represent."
And James Rogers, an economist and investor in Manhattan who said he lived by the book, said, "Having had to fill out lots of forms, infuriating and outrageous forms, I don't know why I had to do it and she didn't."
But while the anger was palpable, both random interviews and the rate of mail into Congressional offices made Ms. Baird's case seem different from other high-profile character examinations in Washington.
While mail and phone calls ran heavily against Ms. Baird in Congressional offices, the overall volume of reaction did not compare with the reactions provoked by the October 1991 hearings on Judge Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court, and his confrontation with Anita F. Hill, or the 1987 confirmation hearings on Robert H. Bork's nomination to the High Court.
True, some radio hosts were deluged with calls when they raised the issue. But others, like Jan Mickelson, who has a morning show on WHO in Des Moines, got little reaction.
James Blackburn, 47, a computer manager for an aircraft-leasing firm from San Francisco, said he felt that Ms. Baird's difficulties during the hearings "reflect badly on the Administration. I believe we should have more women in government. They contribute a fresh approach, but I don't think we should sacrifice principles or the rule of law to get them."
Back in Hyattsville, one of Mrs. Williford's co-workers in the pet store was puzzled at the outrage that preceded Ms. Baird's withdrawal. Michelle Reaves, 23, whose 2-year-old daughter is cared for by her grandmother, said: "I know the law is the law. But sometimes you have to bend it."

HEADLINE: CHRISTOPHER LEERY OF BOSNIA ACCORD

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher said today that he doubted that the international mediation effort to end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina would succeed, his spokesman said.
Mr. Christopher's spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said at the State Department briefing this morning that although the Clinton Administration generally supports the negotiations, Mr. Christopher "expressed doubts about whether it can realistically be achieved, whether they can, in fact, find an agreement, find a solution that's peaceful that the parties would, in fact, agree to." 
 Mr. Christopher's remarks have put the Administration in the awkward position of publicly supporting a negotiating process while criticizing -- and perhaps undermining -- the particular plan that is on the table.
 
Settlement 'That Will Stick'
 Mr. Boucher, who is a holdover from the Bush Administration, pointed to two obstacles: the fact that the parties engaged in the Geneva-based talks have broken their commitments to agreements in the past, and that the fighting and atrocities have been "so horrible" that it is very difficult to bring the parties together.
"Obviously, it's a very difficult task to bring them to a political settlement that will stick and that will actually solve the situation with the agreement of different parties," Mr. Boucher said. The new Administration has found it particularly difficult to formulate a position on the peace plan advanced by the United Nations-European Community mediation team, which would establish a Bosnian confederation of 10 autonomous regions, most with strong majorities of one of the three main national groups.
 
Experience Under Vance
 For example, even as Mr. Boucher was expressing doubts about the feasibility of the plan, twice during the briefing he said that the new Administration supported the negotiations led by Cyrus R. Vance, the special United Nations envoy, and Lord Owen, the European Community representative.
Complicating matters is the broad spectrum of opinion within Mr. Clinton's foreign-policy team on the peace plan, ranging from cautious support of it as an imperfect but potential means of ending the bloodshed, to strong criticism because the settlement could be perceived as appeasement of the Serbs, who have made most of the gains in the fighting, and would rely too much on their goodwill when they have repeatedly broken promises in the past.
Another problem is that a number of Mr. Clinton's senior foreign-policy advisers worked for Mr. Vance when he was Secretary of State in the Carter Administration.
Mr. Christopher was Mr. Vance's Deputy Secretary, and the national security adviser, W. Anthony Lake, and his deputy, Samuel R. Berger, held key positions in the Carter-era State Department. One senior Administration official called discussion of the peace plan "agonizing" because of the deep respect felt for Mr. Vance.
But Mr. Christopher has sought to distance himself from his former boss, and appeared to align himself with the more skeptical Administration view during his Senate confirmation hearings last week. Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat, said he found it a "bit bizarre" that some of the Serbs involved in the negotiations are people the United States has labeled as suspected war criminals, and asked Mr. Christopher whether he was concerned that a map drawn up under the Geneva peace plan "ratified the atrocites of ethnic cleansing," the forcible expulsion of other ethnic groups from areas seized by the Serbs.
"I do have a personal concern along these lines," Mr. Christopher replied, but added that the United States was not a party to those negotiations.
Mr. Boucher declined to say today whether the Clinton Administration believed the Vance-Owen plan ratified ethnic cleansing.
Within the department, those who support the Vance-Owen approach argue that if the primary parties engaged in the talks -- the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian Muslims -- agree on a settlement, then it is not up to the United States to stand in their way.
Opposing them are officials who question the wisdom of negotiating with Radovan Karadzic, president of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Bosnia, and Slobodan Milosevic, President of the Serbian republic, who were on the Bush Administration's list of possible war criminals.
 
Clinton Team's Options
 Mr. Vance said in an interview in Geneva this week that Mr. Christopher personally backed his negotiations. Senior Administration officials did not dispute that Mr. Christopher generally supported the negotiating process, but cautioned that he had made no commitments on the plan. When the two men spoke by telephone several days ago, Mr. Christopher agreed to take a "hard look" at the plan, but "rendered no judgments or comments," a senior official said.
The new Administration regards the crisis in the Balkans as the most difficult foreign-policy problem it will have to address immediately. In her confirmation hearings today as chief United States representative to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright called the crisis in the Balkans "clearly the highest priority of the President in the National Security Council's agenda," adding that the N.S.C. would meet very soon to discuss the matter.
Mr. Clinton has ruled out the use of American ground troops in Bosnia, and Ms. Albright reiterated his support for speedy enforcement of a United Nations-mandated ban on flights by the three Bosnian factions and called for the creation of an international tribunal to try war criminals.
Other Administration officials said they are studying other options. Among those under consideration: a campaign to selectively lift the United Nations-imposed arms embargo, which now favors the better-armed Serbs; a further tightening of the economic sanctions; a plan for guaranteeing and enforcing any peace settlement so that it could not be misused by Serbs as a ploy to avoid outside military intervention, and a more aggressive plan through the United Nations to deliver relief aid throughout Bosnia, even if it required military intervention.

Dell to Sell Computers Directly in Japan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 21

 BODY:
A personal-computer price war heated up here today, with the Dell Computer Corporation announcing that it would sell low-priced computers directly to Japanese customers.
Dell, based in Austin, Tex., said it would sell personal computers at prices sharply lower than those announced earlier this week by the NEC Corporation, which controls more than half the Japanese market. 
 NEC announced its price cuts in response to new lower-priced computers introduced by Compaq, I.B.M., Apple and other American makers. Dell, which pioneered direct marketing of PC's in the United States, plans to avoid Japan's difficult distribution system by selling directly.
But the decision is something of a gamble, since many Japanese are used to personalized service and are not accustomed to ordering expensive goods by mail or phone. It also comes as Japan's computer industry faces hard times in the recession.
The managing director of Dell's new Japanese subsidiary, Katsumi Iizuka, said the bad economic conditions gave the company an advantage, in light of the lower prices and efficient marketing methods.
The company's cheapest computer in Japan with a 486 chip will be priced at 152,000 yen -- a little more than $1,200 -- while NEC's cheapest lists for 218,000 yen, or $1,745. But NEC's products are frequently discounted by dealers.
Dell said it would welcome orders from individuals but would focus on business customers. As in the United States, it will provide free technical support by telephone, along with a year of on-site servicing through a Japanese company.

14 Major Clinton Nominees Are Confirmed by Senate

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The Senate today approved 14 major appointments by President Clinton, including Ronald H. Brown as Commerce Secretary after he agreed to sever all ties to his former law firm and to remove himself from all decisions that might give the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Among the others confirmed today were Donna E. Shalala as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert B. Reich as Labor Secretary, Federico F. Pena as Transportation Secretary and Leon E. Panetta as director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
 The full Senate voted to approve Mr. Brown just hours after the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously voted to send his name to the floor. Mr. Brown's confirmation left only one other Cabinet nominee bogged down in controversy, that of Zoe Baird to be Attorney General. Several Senators urged Ms. Baird, who admitted knowingly breaking the law by employing two illegal aliens as domestic servants, to withdraw.
 
Critic Backs Brown
 Senator Trent Lott, the Mississippi Republican who had led criticism that Mr. Brown's initial policy on conflicts of interest was too narrow, said today that he was satisfied with Mr. Brown's pledge on Wednesday not to discuss with his former colleagues at Patton, Boggs & Blow any matter before the Commerce Department or likely to come before the department.
Senator Lauch Faircloth, a North Carolina Republican, cast the sole vote against Mr. Brown.
Mr. Brown, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, presented a more narrow conflict-of-interest policy when he appeared before the Commerce Committee on Jan. 6 in the first Congressional hearing for a nominee to the Clinton Cabinet. Nominees with later hearings, including Mickey Kantor as the United States Trade Representative, tended to adopt broader conflict-of-interest policies.
The Senate confirmed Mr. Kantor today, as well as Mike Espy as Agriculture Secretary, Richard W. Riley as Education Secretary and Jesse Brown as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Also confirmed were Henry G. Cisneros as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Hazel R. O'Leary as Energy Secretary.
Also confirmed today were Carol M. Browner as Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Roger C. Altman as Deputy Treasury Secretary and Alice M. Rivln as Deputy Budget Director.
 
Tough Questions for Babbitt
 In his second day before the Senate Energy Committee, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona faced tough questioning from Western senators about his views on Federal lands and his links to environmental groups.
Mr. Babbitt, who was later confirmed as Interior Secretary, said he would take a balanced approach to the use of Federal lands, saying he could "accommodate both resource development and resource conservation."
Mr. Babbitt said he backed the Endangered Species Act, which calls on the Government to preserve threatened species and plants. Business and labor have often criticized the act for preventing logging in parts of the Northwest to protect the spotted owl.
Mr. Babbitt said the act's concept was "sound," asserting that with "thoughtful administration" such "collisions can be avoided."
 
Focusing on Job Growth
 In a confirmation hearing today, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, Mr. Clinton's nominee to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said one of the Administration's priorities would be to fulfill the President's goal of creating eight million jobs over four years.
She signaled that the Administration was seriously considering a short-term stimulus package, including increased deficit spending in the first year, to speed up job growth, which has been anemic despite months of economic recovery.
"This is a modest recovery," she said. "It's not creating jobs as fast as previous recoveries."
She predicted that the nation's trade deficit might deteriorate as Europe's and Japan's economies flounder, causing them to import fewer American goods. She said the Government should work to insure that American companies have full access to European and Japanese markets, asserting that she favored open trade and was not, as some critics contend, a protectionist.
 
Specialist in Trade Issues
 Ms. Tyson, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told the Senate Banking Committee that the trade deficit was evidence that the nation's economic competitiveness had eroded. A specialist in trade issues, Ms. Tyson noted that American companies have lost market share abroad in computers, commercial aircraft and telecommunications.
She denied that she favored having the Government decide which industries have the best chance to be successful in the future and then aiding those industries. Instead she said the Government should encourage increased investment, research and job training for all industries.
Ms. Tyson said that to make more loans available to small business, the new Administration was studying whether to help arrange for financial institutions to package and sell such loans to outside investors, as is done with home mortgages. This would help reduce the risk for financial institutions that make such loans.
In another confirmation hearing, Madeleine K. Albright, the nominee for Ambassador to the United Nations, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the fighting in Bosnia was "clearly the highest priority of the President in the National Security Council's agenda." Ms. Albright, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, urged enforcement of the United Nations' ban on Serbian warplanes flying over Bosnia.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who was confirmed on Wednesday along with Warren M. Christopher as Secretary of State and Les Aspin as Secretary of Defense, announced today that Lawrence H. Summers was being nominated as Under Secretary for International Affairs and Frank N. Newman as Under Secretary for Domestic Finance.
Mr. Summers is an economics professor at Harvard University and Mr. Newman is vice chairman of the board and chief financial officer of the BankAmerica Corporation, the California-based banking company.
Mr. Bentsen also announced that Eugene A. Ludwig, a lawyer at Covington & Burling in Washington, was his nominee for Comptroller of the Currency.

HEADLINE: SETTLING IN: The Pentagon;
Aspin Moves In With Much Unsettled

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The mundane collided with the sublime at the Pentagon today as Defense Secretary Les Aspin and his staff began moving into their new quarters and immediately faced issues ranging from combat in Iraq to jockeying over Pentagon parking spaces.
Unlike most of President Clinton's incoming Cabinet secretaries, Mr. Aspin, a former Pentagon analyst and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, is no stranger to the department he now heads. Senior aides said that Mr. Aspin would soon give Mr. Clinton a reorganization plan for the civilian side of the agency. 
 But the Administration has been slow to fill senior civilian positions, to the point that the line of succession has left Adm. Frank B. Kelso 2d, the chief of naval operations, as acting Secretary of the Navy, a position that is supposed to be held by a civilian.
 
Phones, Locks and Parking
 A flurry of activity engulfed Mr. Aspin's third-floor offices along the Pentagon's outer ring of power suites. Aides in pin-striped suits, scurried between meetings, dickered for office space, negotiated a new telephone system and waited for Pentagon security passes. Locksmiths were called to change locks on doors and office safes. It was not until late afternoon that the traditional ceremonial sentry who stands at attention outside the Defense Secretary's office found his way to Mr. Aspin's quarters.
Telephone calls for former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney were being referred to his new employer, the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group in Washington.
"It's probably less chaotic than it seems to us," said one harried aide to Mr. Aspin. "But people were coming back from lunch today, hoping their offices were still there and no one new had moved in."
 
Nominates 49 Generals
 In other parts of the Pentagon, it was unusually quiet, despite an attack by two American F-16's on an Iraqi missile battery. Motorized carts scooted around the corridors picking up shredder-bound brown paper sacks filled with discarded files of departed political appointees.
Mr. Aspin, who in his new job gets a raise to $148,400 from his $129,500 salary as a member of the House of Representatives, spent most of the day in meetings and listening to job-seekers. One of his first official acts was to announce the nominations of 49 Air Force and Air National Guard officers to be generals.
The new Defense Secretary also met for two hours with the joint chiefs of staff, where the discussion was dominated almost completely by Mr. Clinton's campaign pledge to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military.
 
Post-Cold-War Organization
 Mr. Aspin and his aides have been finishing a reorganization plan for the Defense Department that will soon be submitted for Mr. Clinton's approval, senior aides said.
Under the proposal, Mr. Aspin and the Deputy Defense Secretary will preside over the civilian side of the Defense Department whose activities, now organized into two major groups, would be reorganized along four functional lines: policy, financial management, personnel and readiness, and acquisition.
Financial, personnel and acquisition activities would be carried on roughly as before, but the policy branch would be reorganized. Instead of concentrating largely on the Soviet threat, as it did during the cold war, the branch would address five emerging threats to national security: regional conflicts, arms proliferation, economic conversion, reversal of reforms in the former Soviet republics, and strategy and resources. The Administration has not formally named any senior Pentagon officials except Mr. Aspin. But Pentagon aides said that a handful of senior positions had been filled. William J. Perry, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in the Carter Administration, will be the Deputy Defense Secretary. He currently heads Technology Strategies and Alliances, a consulting company in Menlo Park, Calif.
Frank G. Wisner, Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs, will replace Paul D. Wolfowitz as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. Among those expected to join Mr. Wisner in the policy branch are Walter B. Slocombe, a former Defense Department official in the Carter Administration and an expert on strategic forces, and Jock Covey, a Middle East expert who serves in the Bush Administration's State Department.
 
The Aspin Contingent
 Mr. Aspin is bringing along many members of his former staff from the House Armed Services Committee. Rudy F. de Leon, the committee's staff director, will become a special assistant to Mr. Aspin. Larry K. Smith, the committee's counsel, will become a counsel to the Defense Secretary. Vernon A. Guidry, Jr., a committee staff member, will replace Pete Williams as the Pentagon spokesman.
The departures of Mr. Cheney and 39 other appointees of Mr. Bush have left vacancies at the highest civilian levels of the Defense Department.
The Clinton Administration asked the following five other Bush appointees to stay for a time to help with the transition: John Shannon, Under Secretary of the Army; Martin C. Faga, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space; Michael B. Donley, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management and Comptroller; James R. Locher 3d, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict; and Victor H. Reis, Director of Defense Research and Engineering.
Clinton transition aides approached Barbara S. Pope, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, and Robert C. McCormack, the Navy Comptroller, to help with the Navy transition, but both declined for personal reasons, Navy officials said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Talk of a Smaller Issue Lifts Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices inched higher yesterday as traders and investors continued to wait to see what the new Clinton Administration would do to stimulate the economy and cut the record Federal budget deficit.
More speculation about a Treasury move to reduce the issuance of 30-year bonds helped lift their price by 12/32 and lower the yield to 7.30 percent, from 7.33 percent Wednesday. 
 The prices of Treasury notes were also up a little as yields declined. And the discount rates on Treasury bills fell several basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
Michael H. Strauss, the chief economist at Yamaichi International, said the fact that the economy seemed to be doing "a little backing and filling" was also helping support the market both at the short and long ends. "The spending at Christmas is being offset by less spending in the beginning of the year," he said.
 
Reduction of Issue Denied

 
 Early in the day there was a rumor that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten would hold a news conference to announce that the Treasury would not reduce the amount of 30-year bonds scheduled for sale in its quarterly auction next month. That pushed the price lower. But the Treasury denied the rumor.
Then during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the nominee to head the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said that the Administration was indeed considering cutting back the sales of 30-year bonds. That comment sent the price of the bond higher in generally light trading.
Analysts and economists are split over the impact of cutting the issuance of 30-year bonds. Some argue that the Government could both cut its borrowing costs and bring long-term interest rates down a little. But achieving these benefits would require a cut in issuance probably much larger than the new Treasury staff is even considering. In addition, others argue that the Treasury could wind up with no savings in borrowing costs and little impact on interest rates.
The Treasury announced yesterday that it would auction $15.25 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday and $11.5 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday. The $15.25 billion for the two-year note was $250 million less than the last auction in November while the $11.50 billion for the five-year note was $250 million higher.
The reduction in the size of the two-year auction, Mr. Strauss said, helped lift the price of the current two-year note late in the day. It was up 3/32 to yield 4.30 percent, down from 4.35 percent Wednesday.
In the pre-auction, or when-issued, market yesterday, the two-year note was trading at a yield of 4.37 percent while the five-year note was at a yield of 5.82 percent. Both yields are several basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, higher than the yields on the current Treasury security for each maturity.
 
High Yield Bonds
 In the high-yield or junk-bond market, an issue by Overhead Door Corporation, a Dallas-based manufacturer of doors used in construction, issued $85 million of notes due in 2000 at a yield of 12.25 percent. The lead underwriter was the First Boston Corporation.
Edward H. D'Alelio, chief investment officer of the high-yield bond group at the Putnam Companies in Boston, said that this deal was an example of the smaller companies that are becoming regular issuers in the junk-bond market.
He said the demand was so strong that there were about $300 million of bids for the $85 million issue.
Mr. D'Alelio said that the junk bond market was generally being helped by the economy's slow recovery and the purchase of better-rated high- yield bonds by institutions and funds that usually purchase only investment-grade corporate bonds. He said the low yields on other securities and the improvement of prospects of many companies selling high-yield bonds were enticing these normally more conservative buyers.
According to Salomon Brothers, the secondary market for junk bonds was up 6 cents yesterday, led by gains in the bonds of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and USAir Group. USAir announced that British Airways would pump $300 million into the American carrier.
 
Money Supply
 The regular Thursday report from the Federal Reserve on the nation's money supply will not be released until today because of the observance of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday and the holiday for the Inauguration in Washington Wednesday.

HEADLINE: But Does Punishment Fit the Budget?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
With spending on corrections quadrupling in the 1980's and continuing to rise sharply, the North Carolina Legislature this week began considering a plan that would reduce the average criminal sentence in the state by 80 percent and send nonviolent criminals to community programs for supervision, treatment and work.
The Arkansas Legislature began considering a similar proposal this week, and Kansas has just started remodeling its sentencing policies and punishment programs. Criminal justice experts say other states, including Pennsylvania, Delaware, Florida, Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas and Ohio, are also slowly moving in a similar direction. 
 Pressed by rising costs for health care and other programs, the experts say, legislators and governors around the nation have begun reconsidering the merits of stringent anti-crime laws and mandatory minimum sentences that nearly all states enacted in recent years without regard to future costs. As more such laws come under review, they expect a number of states to overhaul or scrap their criminal justice systems.
 
Big Budget Item
 For a decade, corrections spending has been the fastest- or second-fastest growing part of state budgets, after health care. This year, states have allocated $2 billion to build prisons and $15 billion more to operate corrections departments. At the same time, many states have been ordered by Federal courts to relieve prison overcrowding by creating additional space in prisons or by releasing inmates, adding to their financial responsibilities. Those pressures, as well as the recession, have forced deep reductions in education and other programs.
It is a time of reckoning for the states -- and perhaps for the entire country. President Clinton, who as Governor of Arkansas created that state's commission to plan the remodeling of its criminal laws, may appoint a national crime commission to do the same thing at the Federal level, say criminal justice experts who served on his transition team.
"We're at a point of change," said Kenneth F. Schoen, a transition team leader who is director of criminal justice programs at the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, a New York philanthropy. "We're seeing a wide awareness of the failures of the current get-tough laws that most states passed, and we're seeing an almost universal interest -- motivated entirely by the cost of prisons -- in exploring the cost-effective alternatives."
Such plans will be studied by penal experts and elected officials from around the nation as they gather in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Friday at the National Association of Counties annual conference on justice and public safety. A primary focus of the meeting will be North Carolina's proposed overhaul of its punishment system, and conference leaders say they will be sharing plans to promote similar efforts in other states.
Lynn S. Branham, who will give the conference's main speech, said, "It's time to say that the emperor has no clothes, that with all these tough new laws we are not safer and we're going broke." Ms. Branham is a law professor at the Thomas Cooley Law School in Lansing, Mich., and a former chairman of the American Bar Association's committee on corrections policy.
 
3 States Are Models
 The reorganization in Kansas and the plans under consideration in North Carolina and Arkansas are far from novel or experimental ideas. They are modeled on existing criminal laws and policies in Minnesota, Washington and Oregon, which began pioneering these ideas as far back as 1980.
Even in the last few years, for example, when Minnesota got caught up in a national trend of enacting tough anti-crime laws, a special commission on corrections policy is heading off higher costs associated with proposals before the State Legislature. In one instance, the legislature defeated a plan to stiffen sentences for first-time drug offenders after the commission determined that it would require 1,300 new prison beds and a $32 million annual operating budget.
The state sends nonviolent offenders to community programs, which are 20 percent to 50 percent less expensive than prison and which experts say hold more promise for rehabilitating offenders. The experts say that more states might adopt such approaches were it not for the highly emotional arguments that arise over anti-crime legislation.
"Crime is a very emotional issue and it's difficult to create a rational policy in such an emotional area," said Debra L. Dailey, executive director of the state's panel, the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission. But fiscal experts also say budget concerns may overcome resistance in other states.
 
Reasons for Overcrowding
 As in most other states, North Carolina's increased efforts to enforce drug laws, population changes and the legislature's enactment of severe anti-crime laws in the 1980's have contributed to prison overcrowding, state officials say. North Carolina now faces a staggering 9 percent annual increase in felony convictions. The state increased its prison capacity by 50 percent in the 1980's. But because of its inability to build prisons fast enough, the state has been releasing prisoners early to comply with a 1987 Federal order that requires it to reduce overcrowding.
To cope with the system's needs and the court order, the North Carolina commission issued a report this week recommending a complete restructuring of the way the state sentences and punishes criminals. The commission recommends reducing prison sentences by an average of 80 percent, to reflect the time inmates actually serve, and publicly acknowledging the state's limited capacity to imprison offenders.
The commission also recommends reserving prison cells only for violent offenders and scattering other convicts to an expanded network of less costly, and possibly more effective, halfway houses, treatment programs, supervised probation and victim-restitution programs.

McDonnell's Earnings Off 61.9% in '92

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation said today that its earnings fell 61.9 percent in 1992, as a result of heavy losses from its C-17 cargo plane and continued declines in its commercial aircraft division. These results excluded the effects of a one-time accounting change that gave the company a net loss for the year.
Moreover, the company's fourth-quarter earnings, also excluding the one-time accounting change, declined 59.2 percent. 
 St. Louis-based McDonnell, which is the nation's largest weapons contractor, said it earned $161 million, or $4.15 a share, compared with $423 million, or $11.03 a share, in 1991. Revenues also declined in 1992, to $17.38 billion from $18.07 billion in 1991.
But McDonnell said that it took a charge of $942 million, or $24.25 a share, in 1992 to adopt new accounting rules for retiree health benefits that many United States companies are undertaking. The charge, which has no impact on the company's cash flow, resulted in a net loss of $781 million, or $20.10 a share, for 1992, McDonnell said.
For the fourth quarter, excluding the accounting change, McDonnell had earnings of $86 million, or $2.20 a share, compared with $211 million, or $5.50 a share, in the 1991 fourth quarter. But including the longer-term effect of the new accounting rules, the company posted net income of $762 million for the quarter.
The fourth-quarter results, excluding that one-time accounting item, were far below securities analysts' estimates and reflect continued weakness at the beleaguered aerospace company. Still, McDonnell Douglas shares rose $2.50 today, to $56.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Operating income for the commercial aircraft segment declined 48 percent, to $151 million, in 1992, compared with $291 million in 1991, because of overall softness in the airline market, lower margins on the MD-11 trijet, and higher research and development costs, the company said.
McDonnell Douglas, which has a shrinking backlog and few new orders on the horizon, has not been competitive with its rivals in the commercial aircraft industry, the Boeing Company and the European Airbus Industrie. Analysts have said that McDonnell needs to broaden its product line, but the company lacks the finances to do so.
The military aircraft division earned $77 million in 1992, compared with $404 million the year before. The drop was due mainly to heavy losses in the C-17 military transport program. The C-17 wing buckled and was damaged during an Oct. 1 stress test. McDonnell said that it loss about $470 million on the C-17 in 1992.
But the chief financial officer, Herbert Lanese, said that the company had now put the worst behind it and that 1993 would "be a pivotal year" for McDonnell. Mr. Lanese predicted that the C-17 would be profitable this year and that McDonnell would generate about $1 billion in cash that it will use to reduce debt. About half the $1 billion will come from improved operations and the other half from the sale of assets, Mr. Lanese said.
Mr. Lanese also noted that operating profit was about 10 percent on most weapons programs last year and that he expected the company to earn more than the $8.15 a share average predicted by analysts for 1993.

HEADLINE: Uncovered Short Sales Decline 8% on Big Board

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Reversing a 10-month trend, the number of shares sold short and not yet covered on the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 8 percent in the period from mid-December to mid-January, the Big Board reported yesterday.
At the end of the period on Jan. 15, short interest fell sharply to 931.8 million shares. That was the lowest level since September. In the previous period, short interest surpassed the billion mark for the first time. 
 The figures on short interest are closely watched on Wall Street as a gauge of investor sentiment, since they reflect the activities of professional traders who specialize in ferreting out companies whose stock price they believe is in for a fall. The sellers borrow shares of these companies and sell them, betting that they will be able to buy the shares back at a lower price and profit from the difference.
 
Amex Also Down
 The number of shares sold short on the American Stock Exchange also dropped in the period to 66.9 million shares from 69.5 million.
While the drop in short interest could reflect a belief that the market is heading up, professional traders said yesterday that the reason for the retrenchment was more basic: Many short-sellers have been making poor bets for the last two years and are now operating with less capital and are becoming less aggressive in their bets.
The raging bull market in small- capitalization stocks has been particularly damaging to short-sellers, many of whom have seen stock prices of some of these small companies rise even as negative news emerges.
"The stocks have been pushed up to these incredible levels, and people are now covering massive positions," one trader said.
Indeed, the trading has gotten so difficult that many money managers who had used short-selling in their trading strategy are backing away.
"A lot of people who thought they could use short-selling to be in a market neutral position and achieve great returns have found that they are wrong," said Steve Kibbey of Centurion Capital in La Jolla, Calif. "The lesson of the last two years is that if someone is going to manage money on the short side, they must have some market sensitivity."
One of the worst investments for short-sellers in the period was shares of Wells Fargo & Company. The stock price of the bank company has been steadily rising since October, and gained almost a dollar a day in the last 10 days of the period, closing at $85.25 on Jan. 15, the end of the current reporting period.
That grew even worse for short- sellers in the last few days, after Wells Fargo announced strong earnings. The company shares have since gone as high as $100.875, and closed yesterday at $98.25, up $1.
The short interest in Wells Fargo was huge in the period, standing at 2.3 million shares.

HEADLINE: Upturn Continues in Most Areas, Fed Reports

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
With the notable exception of California, the economy showed continued improvement in December and early January, with sizable gains in retail sales augmented by better activity in factories and residential construction, a survey published today by the Federal Reserve Board said.
But the survey found that over all employers were moving slowly in adding to payrolls as they tried to squeeze still more productivity from current workers. The cost of health benefits was repeatedly cited as a deterrent to hiring. 
 The Fed's survey, compiled largely from anecdotal reports collected in its 12 districts, is used in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee, its chief policy-making body.
 
A Look at the Year Ahead
 The committee's next session, beginning Feb. 2, is to produce a fairly detailed statement of the Fed's expectations for the economy this year and the monetary strategy to be associated with it. The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, is scheduled to present it to the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 18.
Although today's survey, which included information gathered through Jan. 11, did not indicate a sharp acceleration of activity, it did seem to show some broadening improvement. Early in December, the Fed found the economy "improving modestly but unevenly," while five weeks earlier the improvement was "slow and uneven."
Even in the still-slumping market for commercial real estate, the survey found "some positive signs here and there."
Reports from the Fed's districts "indicate continued improvement in economic conditions across much of the nation," said the Kansas City unit, which coordinated the poll this time.
It called retail sales during the recent holiday season significantly better than in 1991 in most districts and factory activity "steady to increasing moderately in nearly all districts." Residential real estate also gained, with "some glimmers of hope" for multiple-family dwellings. Atlanta and Dallas reported higher occupancy rates and firming rent levels.
But house prices weakened further in Southern California, and in the state as a whole, persistent weakness, with continued contraction in manufacturing, offset moderate growth elsewhere in the district.
Banks reported a further slight increase in demand for loans in most districts, but there was little expectation of higher interest rates. The survey found little evidence of production bottlenecks or other potential sources of revived inflation.
Retailing strength in New England was concentrated in the Boston area, the survey indicated, with various merchants elsewhere not sharing in the holiday gains. And half the factories there reported recent sales to be flat, compared with levels a year earlier.
The New York district reported solid gains for apparel of all kinds. It said that office leasing ran at a "fairly good pace" in midtown Manhattan but remained sluggish downtown. Buffalo posted the first decline in its rate of office vacancies in four years.
 
Good News From Atlanta
 Elsewhere, one-third of factories in the Philadelphia district expect to step up hiring and increase working hours over the next six months, and Atlanta reported double-digit gains in holiday sales and strong tourism, especially from abroad.
Many of those responding to the survey in the St. Louis district complained of a lack of qualified workers, even as many small businesses "worry about the rising cost of health care."
Minneapolis reported a strong winter recreation business in northern Michigan and strong home construction throughout the district.
The Dallas bank said that Austin had become the district's first major metropolitan area in a decade to show office vacancy rates below the national average.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Economies In Europe Show Weakness

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled higher in moderate trading yesterday on worsening economic conditions in Europe.
Gold prices fell in United States trading, but advanced on overseas markets. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $329.20 a troy ounce, off 70 cents from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $329.30, down 35 cents. 
 The dollar rose in European trading, spurred by the British Government's announcement of a two-tenths of a percent rise in unemployment in December to 10.5 percent. That news, in addition to anticipation of further interest rate cuts by the Bank of England, continued to set the tone when trading shifted to domestic markets, analysts said.
 
Profit Taking Seen
 "It was a day of dollar gains, mostly concentrated at sterling's expense because of the bad economic figures," said Mike Faust, a foreign exchange analyst at MMS International. "The dollar had been under pressure for the past few days and saw some relief today."
Ronald Holzer, chief currency trader at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said, "Prospects for lower European rates and weaker economies prompted profit taking at the lower dollar levels."
The market also appeared to focus on Europe because of a dearth of significant domestic economic news. The Federal Reserve provided a rosy economic outlook in its latest report on business activity, but this gave the dollar only minor support, traders said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.68 yen, down from 125.39 at Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar rose to 125.04 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 124.90 yen, up from 124.625 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5180, from $1.5410 late Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.5225 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.5440.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6135 German marks, up from 1.60375; 1.4795 Swiss francs, up from 1.4685; 5.4530 French francs, up from 5.4190; 1,477.00 Italian lire, up from 1,464.00, and 1.28515 Canadian dollars, up from 1.28135.

HEADLINE: Figure Skating;
Reunited U.S. Pair Captures Crown

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Calla Urbanski didn't mean to call him a toad.
Rocky Marval was sorry he didn't practice his triples. 
 Apologies behind them, a great American figure-skating story resumed. Urbanski and Marval, a team again, won the pairs competition Thursday night at the United States championships. Perhaps more surprising they are on speaking terms.
"I was just a temporary toad," said Marval, the quiet trucker from New Egypt, N.J., born Rocco Marvaldi.
"His work habits are better," said Urbanski, who is 32 years old and still waits on tables for one week every month at Kid Shelleen's in Wilmington, Del.
Romeo and Juliet on ice they are not. There is still creative tension in the air when these two perform their synchronous double axels. But with a fresh start and a Winter Olympics to aim at just one year away in Lillehammer, Norway, Urbanski and Marval hope their past differences can work, quickly, in their favor.
 
'It Was Like Walking on Glass'
 "I don't want to harp on the split," Urbanski said. "For a while after we got back together, it was like walking on glass. Everything was very fragile. But now, we're more friends on the ice. My patience is better. Rocky knows my frustration, and it's new for him to reach out and explain things."
After finishing a disappointing seventh last year at the Albertville Olympics and 10th at the world championships in Oakland, Calif., Urbanski decided in June that Marval was not working hard enough and that she would look for another partner.
"I have to kiss a few toads before I find a prince," she said at the time.
Urbanski tried her luck skating with Scott Kurttila, a former singles skater who was 27 years old, the same age as Marval. Kurttila displeased Urbanski even more than Marval.
In July, Marval tried out a new partner of his own, Natasha Kuchiki. That didn't work well, either, and tough economic times forced him to sell five of the nine trucks in his Marvaldi Trucking Inc. fleet in New Jersey.
Then, less than two months after they had broken up, Urbanski called.
"It was her initiative at the beginning, and her initiative at the end," Marval said.
"Rocky's anguish was public; mine was unseen," Urbanski said. "I became the evil one."
Together again, the skaters face logistical and injury problems that have nothing to do with their stormy relationship. The pair divide their training between Wilmington, where they work with a coach, Ron Ludington, and a choreographer, Phillip Mills, and Monsey, N.Y., where they are coached by Peter Burrows.
They both spend a lot of time on the New Jersey Turnpike. Urbanski drives around while watching a small television in her car, and has rented a condo near Seton Hall University, in South Orange, as a geographical center.
"It's a place where I can relax, bring my fan mail, and just think about my skating," Urbanski said.
 
Injuries Become a Problem
 Urbanski has other troubles, not so easily solved. A muscle is torn away from the bone in her right leg. Another muscle in the same leg is strained. After years of topflight competition and several partners, Urbanski might be running low on time, and princes.
"I'm not 100 percent, but we know what's at stake," Urbanski said. "We're both looking to have a career out of this."
On Wednesday night at the America West Arena, the odd couple skated a strong technical program in campy silvery outfits. They had wanted to wear body suits with designer muscles, but had been discouraged from doing so by conservative judges at Skate America in Atlanta.
On Thursday night their physically demanding long program placed them first, ahead of another good pair with a bumpy history, Jenni Meno and Todd Sand. Meno and Sand dumped their respective pairs partners, Scott Wendland and Kuchiki, after romance blossomed between Meno and Sand in the Olympic Village in Albertville last February.
 
Coaching Not Always Easy
 "Right away, I was in a state of shock," said John Nicks, who coached both Meno-Wendland and Sand-Kuchiki. "Rational arguments, pro and con, were falling on deaf ears. I was wasting my time and breath."
It took months before Meno and Sand got their timing right, but Thursday night they earned the second of two berths for the for the world championships at Prague in March. Once there, an American team will need to place among the top five to earn a third pairs berth in the 1994 Olympics at Lillehammer.
"This hasn't always been easy," Urbanski said. "But we have to peak at the worlds."
 
ICE CHIPS
 BRIAN BOITANO, much talked about in absentia, was expected to arrive Thursday night to scout the men's competition on Friday and Saturday. . . . RENEE ROCA and GORSHA SUR won the original dance program Thursday night and led the ice-dancing event going into Friday night's final free-dance program. That program will count 50 percent of the overall scores.

HEADLINE: The Art Market;
New Mood at Antiques Show

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
COMPETITION is healthy. At least it seems to have made a difference at this year's Winter Antiques Show, which opens to the public tomorrow at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan and runs through Jan. 31. For most of its 39 years, the event has been something of an institution on the antiques circuit, but in recent seasons this decidedly American show had become overridden with boring brown furniture, banal objects and works of dubious provenance.
Then the arrival of the fall International Antiques Show at the armory four years ago changed things. And for the better. For starters, the quality controls at the Winter Antiques Show became stricter. They had to. Since the International Show is vetted, a practice common in Europe but still relatively new in the United States, the Winter Show felt it had to follow. Dealers at the Winter Show have always been required to offer customers a certificate of authenticity for every purchase, but this year, in addition to the guarantees, a committee made up of more than 70 dealers, scholars and art experts toured the armory, reviewing the objects in every booth. Anything they found questionable was removed. 
 "It has certainly made the show more expensive to produce, since we've had to take the armory for an extra day in order to give the vetting committee time," said Betty Sherrill, the chairwoman of the show, which benefits the East Side House Settlement, a century-old community service organization that sponsors programs for children, teen-agers and the elderly in the South Bronx. "There's always been pressure to vet. I guess the fact that the International Show is vetted has had a lot to do with it."
Penny Jones, the show's organizer, added that vetting was an important "comfort factor" in troubled economic times, especially for the new collector.
Still, many of the old-time dealers don't like the idea. "I'm not a believer in vetting," said Allan S. Chait, president of Ralph M. Chait Galleries in Manhattan, who has participated in the Winter Antiques Show for 34 years. "I suppose it's keeping up with the times, but things still slip through the cracks."
Other seasoned dealers expressed concern that vetting would raise the standards of the show, thereby raising prices, which in turn would discourage business. Of the two major antiques shows in Manhattan, the Winter Antiques Show has always been the bigger commercial success. Less forbidding than the more proper International Show, it plays to a larger audience and has made its reputation by featuring more decorative pieces and fewer museum-quality objects.
"Just because a show is vetted doesn't mean it has to be dull," said Thomas K. Woodard, co-owner of the Madison Avenue gallery that bears his name. The centerpiece at his booth this weekend is a 17-foot-long, late-19th-century English work of fairground art called the Charioteer. Made of intricately carved gilded wood, it depicts a pair of horses with the figure of Perseus in the center. The piece was originally designed to attract attention at the entrance to a fairground.
The $325,000 work makes quite a spectacle, but it's not exactly an easy sell for someone looking to furnish a Park Avenue living room. "It was designed to make a pitch to sell the show, and that's exactly what we are doing," said Mr. Woodard. "I hear Donald Trump is building an amusement park. Wouldn't this be perfect for the entrance?"
 
Eyecatchers Abound
 As unusual as the Charioteer is, it will be in the company of a host of other exotic antiques in an extraordinary range of offerings from the eccentric to the mundane. "People will be especially fascinated by the unusual forms and shapes at this year's show," said Mrs. Jones. "Dealers have brought eye-catching, show-stopping things."
Michael Goedhuis, a London dealer who has taken part in the Winter Antiques Show for 10 years, is highlighting a pair of Japanese bronze lions 5 feet long and 45 inches high. Originally temple guardians, the lions came from Langley Park, England, just outside of Windsor. "I haven't seen any of this scale and quality," Mr. Goedhuis said, adding that the pair was priced at $475,000.
Hardly a bargain, but then dealers seem undaunted by the high price tags that are ubiquitious at this year's show. This attitude is, in fact, quite a change from three months ago, when the recession was on everyone's mind at the International Antiques Show and dealers made an extra effort to show affordable, useful pieces.
 
'Feeling of Optimism'
 Among the 67 dealers in the Winter Antiques Show, the mood seems far more upbeat than it was in the fall. "Business has been terrific," said Stuart Feld, who runs Hirschl & Adler Galleries in Manhattan. "There's a tremendous feeling of optimism."
Edward Munves Jr., the president of the James Robinson gallery on East 57th Street, said he had noticed that "everyone wants to feel good." He suggested that the high prices in evidence were a reflection of the rising cost of rare, top-quality pieces. "The best things won't go down in price," he said. "There's just not enough supply."
Another Manhattan dealer, Leigh Keno, said he had seen a lot of interest in this weekend's opening, far more than last year. "There's real excitement," he said. "Collectors have been calling to ask about opening night. As dealers are feeling better about the market, they are bringing things they might not have brought last season when the mood was more somber."
This being Presidential Inauguration week in Washington, some objects in the show make an appropriate nod to patriotism. Mr. Keno, for example, is featuring a miniature portrait of George Washington by William Russell Birch. "It's certainly the right season," the dealer said. He added that Birch had chosen to make the enamel miniature from two Gilbert Stuart portraits of Washington, even though Washington had offered to sit for him. Birch sold the miniature to James McHenry, Washington's Secretary of War; Mr. Keno said he bought it from a descendant of McHenry. The portrait costs $55,000.
Other patriotic pieces can be seen at Fred B. Nadler Antiques, where a green-and-white porcelain cut-corner bowl and serving dish (circa 1800) in a pattern known as Green Fitzhugh, features an eagle in the center. The Green Room at the White House has the same pattern, acquired during the Nixon Administration, Mr. Nadler said.
 
Dollhouse From George III Period
 There are also objects at the show that boast a royal provenance. A doll's house, beautifully outfitted with tiny furniture and objects and on view at the Kentshire Galleries booth, was made by the children of King George III and given to the children of Sir George Grey, who was the captain of the King's flagship. The gallery bought it at a small English country auction. "This is my third year doing the show and it seems we're all making a special effort," said Fred Imberman, an owner of the Manhattan gallery. "The competition has really forced us to try to improve the show."
Of the eight new dealers participating, two joined the show because of the success they had at the International Show in October. "This show is supposed to be more commercial, and I thought it would be good to try it," said Peter Finer, a dealer from Warwickshire, England. "I've got some inexpensive items, ranging from $5,000 to $10,000." But the star piece in his booth is a $125,000 sword carried by Napoleon.
Mark Jacoby, a director of Philip Colleck, a Manhattan gallery that specializes in English 18th-century furniture and objects, is another first-time participant. Because he is the new kid in the show, he said, he purposely filled his booth with a wide range of furniture and objects: "It's our way of introducing ourselves." Among his selections are a Victorian settee with its original needlepoint upholstery, a miniature coromandel screen, and a Queen Anne over-the-mantel mirror.
 
Hard Acts to Follow
 Seasoned dealers who have done both shows for four years now concede that it gets harder each season to fill their booths with exciting objects. "The two shows are too close together," said Mr. Chait. "Playing to a house that has already seen your act once is difficult." Complaining that he must find new things to take to each show, Mr. Chait explained: "I have to. Real collectors have too good a memory."

 BODY:
There's the Rhodes scholar connection, the Yale connection, the Little Rock connection. And now, it seems, there's also a Carnegie foundation connection that leads right to the top of the Clinton Administration.
The foundation, known formally as the Carnegie Corporation of New York, is losing 3 of its 17 trustees to President Clinton's Cabinet or other high posts. WARREN M. CHRISTOPHER, until now chairman of the foundation, is now Secretary of State; ROBERT E. RUBIN, chairman of the its finance committee, was chosen to be chairman of the National Economic Council, and DONNA E. SHALALA is Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
"Donna Shalala was just appointed to the board and never even got to a meeting," Dr. DAVID HAMBURG, president of the Carnegie Corporation, said yesterday.
The Clinton transition team didn't limit itself to trustees, but tapped others from influential posts at the foundation as well. RICHARD RILEY, the former South Carolina Governor who is the new Secretary of Education, was chairman of a foundation task force on "Meeting the Needs of Very Young Children," which is expected to issue its report by the end of the year.
"We are hoping he will pay close attention to it," Dr. Hamburg said.
And then there was a task force that issued a report in 1990 called "Turning Points: Preparing American Youth for the 21st Century," including recommendations for the overhaul of junior high and middle schools. Among its members: Gov. BILL CLINTON of Arkansas.
"He made a major contribution to it and was the principal spokesman explaining it on national television," Dr. Hamburg said.
Faced with the prospect of replacing so many people, he said: "To lose a chairman and a finance committee chairman at one time is significant for any foundation. But needless to say we are proud. And we'll adapt."
In fact, the foundation coped with losses to Republican administrations, too, he said, citing the departures of John C. Whitehead, Deputy Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan, and James D. Watkins, Secretary of Energy in the Bush Administration. Thomas H. Kean left, too, when he was elected Governor of New Jersey.

The classic reason for the use of American military force has been to protect our vital interests. In one pregnant sentence of his Inaugural Address, President Clinton added another.
"When our vital interests are challenged," he said, "or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act, with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary." (Emphasis added.) 
 If that important new doctrine is to have any meaning -- if it is to be respected as the Clinton Doctrine -- the place to apply it is at hand in Bosnia. And the time is now.
That Serbian aggression in Bosnia defies the conscience of the international community cannot be in doubt. Not unless at the end of the 20th century the world accepts mass murder, rape and terror directed at one ethnic group.
"It borders on genocide," Patricia Diaz Dennis, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, said of Serbian behavior as she released the annual State Department report on human rights around the world. The Serbs' "ethnic cleansing," the report said, was "on a scale that dwarfs anything seen in Europe since Nazi times."
What can and should President Clinton do to stop the horror? He may be tempted to postpone the hard decisions because Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen are seeming to make progress in their negotiations on Bosnia. But that would be a disastrous mistake, morally and politically.
The singular fact about the Vance-Owen effort is that while it has gone on, over many months, the Serbs have continued their killing. They are still besieging Sarajevo and other cities, lobbing shells at civilians. And they will go right on, as things look now.
The Bosnian Serbs' "assembly" voted this week to accept the Vance-Owen plan for a Bosnia with 10 autonomous provinces. But the Serbs, though that plan would reward their aggression, insisted that they would keep working for their ultimate aim: a Bosnian Serb republic.
Even if all the parties sincerely accepted the Vance-Owen principles -- a huge if -- the borders of the autonomous provinces still have to be negotiated. And while that difficult business goes on, the Vance-Owen approach allows the Serbs to continue their slaughter.
To earn any respect, this "peace process" would at a minimum require that the Serbs immediately stop their siege of Sarajevo and other Bosnian cities. Even under their own aggressive theories, what possible excuse do the Serbs have for shelling and starving a capital that has never been a Serbian city?
That is where President Clinton must act: to stop the killing while peace negotiations go on. He can do so with great effect by speaking directly and strongly to the warring parties in Bosnia. These are some of the things he should say:
* The siege of Sarajevo must end at once.
* Aid to civilians elsewhere must get through. Any further interruptions of relief convoys will not be tolerated.
* Military attacks on civilians must stop.
President Clinton would of course work with our European allies and with the United Nations. But if there was at last some forceful American leadership, it would quickly have its effect. For one thing, he could urge on the British and French, and the United Nations, a change in the rules for their peacekeeping forces on the scene allowing them to use their weapons if there are any further attempts to block relief convoys.
Moreover, the President would have many ways to signal the Serbs that he means business. He could act to tighten the economic embargo, for example. He could reduce the number of U.S. diplomats in Belgrade.
And he could prepare to act militarily. After 14 months of American dithering and evasion on the Serbian attacks, military action is more difficult. But at a minimum the United States could join in setting up and protecting safe havens for the Bosnian Muslim population now threatened with genocide.
The stakes are high: for Bill Clinton's credibility abroad as a decisive President, and more broadly for the world's safety. Continued appeasement of the worst calculated atrocities in Europe since the Nazis would exact a terrible price.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
What's in It for Us?

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The ruler of a great power had shown kindness and friendship to a new nation. So its leader wrote a letter of appreciation, and of his country's realities.
"Within our territories there are no mines either of gold or silver, and this young nation, just recovering from the waste and desolation of a long war, have not, as yet, had time to acquire riches by agriculture and commerce. 
 "But our soil is bountiful, and our people industrious, and we have reason to flatter ourselves that we shall gradually become useful to our friends."
At the inauguration of the 42d President, those words from a letter by George Washington to Sultan Mohammed III of Morocco in 1789 were in my pocket and mind.
They possess those qualities Americans would most like to distinguish their nation and Presidents, and occasionally even do: common sense, dignity, candor, a decent modesty joined to a comfortable sense of self-worth, and, in world affairs, loyalty and faith.
At inaugurals, each of us listens for a word that touches our own sense of national purpose. Most people at the Capitol saw President Clinton as a dot. But each had a clear, unobstructed view of himself.
The passage I hoped for came toward the end. The President spoke of America's greatest strength -- the power of "our ideas" -- and said: "Our hopes, our hearts, our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom. Their cause is America's cause."
Hellbent for brevity, Mr. Clinton did not explain just why freedom's causes have to be ours. What's in it for us?
At least in part he has explained it in other talks. Democracies do not go around slaughtering each other, a fact that tends to increase American longevity. The more democracies that exist, the less American blood is likely to be spilled abroad.
Also, the American system prospers economically and politically in concert with other free nations, even if sometimes we threaten not to drink their white wine.
Dictatorships can be good customers for awhile, particularly for arms. But the stronger the tyranny becomes the quicker it presents a political price the U.S. cannot pay -- Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, or Saddamite Iraq. Why we expect Communist China, with its burgeoning military might, to be different is a puzzle, unless we again put cash register ahead of international security and individual freedom.
Political freedom may not be "our" idea and certainly was not during slavery. But Mr. Clinton was right: it is our greatest strength abroad.
I have lived in nations oppressed by Communist despotism and nations oppressed by poverty. Almost every day, the longing for the freedom America represented could be touched. Poles threw roses in the path of Richard Nixon because he was the Vice President of the United States. In India, college students filled lecture halls to hear almost every visiting American, roses of attention.
The hopes of and for America often had cost to those who held them. In every war, every crisis, the U.S. asked the help of other peoples. It was given in belief that political freedom was transferable and that the U.S. would be its conduit. Without that trust, for most of the world the U.S. would be just real estate.
American "pragmatists" warn that democratic idealism will make us the world policeman. Not if we have any judgment it won't. Sometimes American armed power is necessary -- with or without the U.N., which is supposed to expand freedom's boundaries, not confine them.
But mostly freedom fighters plead not for U.S. troops but for food, medicine, a political arm around them.
To Mr. Clinton and his chief of staff Thomas McLarty: Freedom's causes need supporters in the Administration. The transition has squeezed most of them out -- a dangerous invitation to cynicism.
To journalists: We are the last people who can justify becoming automatic cynics. The whole beauty of journalism is that every day we get another crack at the story, to get more information, assuage cruelties, adjust our heads, correct mistakes.
Maybe Bill Clinton can make that the whole beauty of being President, who knows?

May Stores Moving Merchandise Staff to St. Louis

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The May Department Stores Company announced yesterday that it would move its New York merchandising office to its headquarters in St. Louis.
The company said all 430 employees of the May Merchandising Company would be offered jobs in St. Louis. It said it would retain its office on the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan to give its buyers and executives a place to hold meetings when they are in New York.
 
Closer to the Stores
 David C. Farrell, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the relocation would bring May's trend-spotters and style arbiters closer to their counterparts in each of May's department store chains, including Lord & Taylor, Filene's and Hecht's. The move will be completed June 14. 
 "We believe this relocation will make the company more coordinated and cohesive and give us more agility in being able to respond to what's happening in the market," Mr. Farrell said in a telephone interview.
In a separate announcement yesterday, Conran's Habitat, the chain of specialty housewares stores recently purchased by a group of investors headed by Marvin Traub, the former Bloomingdale's chairman, said it would move its headquarters from White Plains to Manhattan, bringing in 46 jobs.
Over the last few years, May has merged its various regional department store divisions and mercilessly shut or sold unprofitable stores. But Mr. Farrell stressed that May Merchandising was not being moved to pare costs. The company took a $30 million charge in the third quarter to cover relocation costs. "Future cost savings associated with the move are likely to be minimal," indicating it is a strategic decision, said Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retail analyst with Salomon Brothers.
May is the second department store company to move its merchandising operations out of New York. The Mercantile Stores Company moved its buying and merchandising office to Fairfield, Ohio, in April.
Barry F. Sullivan, New York's Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, said that because May was relocating for business reasons and not to escape a heavy tax burden or high rents, the city had no incentives to offer the company to stay. He noted that May still had a presence in New York in Lord & Taylor and Payless Shoe Source, its budget shoe stores, and that it could open more stores.
May also announced that Anthony J. Torcasio, chief executive and president of Famous-Barr, the company's department store chain based in St. Louis, would become president and chief executive of May Merchandising, replacing Kenneth Folker, 69, who is retiring. May will announce Mr. Torcasio's replacement soon.
John L. Dunham, chairman of the G. Fox chain, will become chairman of the merchandising unit, succeeding Kenneth B. Winfield Jr., 59, who is retiring.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 26, 1993, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about the relocation of the May Department Stores Company's merchandising unit misidentified the chief executive of May Merchandising, who has since retired. He was Kenneth Kolker.

14 Major Clinton Nominees Are Confirmed by Senate

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The Senate today approved 14 major appointments by President Clinton, including Ronald H. Brown as Commerce Secretary after he agreed to sever all ties to his former law firm and to remove himself from all decisions that might give the appearance of a conflict of interest.
Among the others confirmed today were Donna E. Shalala as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert B. Reich as Labor Secretary, Federico F. Pena as Transportation Secretary and Leon E. Panetta as director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
 The full Senate voted to approve Mr. Brown just hours after the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously voted to send his name to the floor. Mr. Brown's confirmation left only one other Cabinet nominee bogged down in controversy, that of Zoe Baird to be Attorney General. Several Senators urged Ms. Baird, who admitted knowingly breaking the law by employing two illegal aliens as domestic servants, to withdraw.
 
Critic Backs Brown
 Senator Trent Lott, the Mississippi Republican who had led criticism that Mr. Brown's initial policy on conflicts of interest was too narrow, said today that he was satisfied with Mr. Brown's pledge on Wednesday not to discuss with his former colleagues at Patton, Boggs & Blow any matter before the Commerce Department or likely to come before the department.
Senator Lauch Faircloth, a North Carolina Republican, cast the sole vote against Mr. Brown.
Mr. Brown, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, presented a more narrow conflict-of-interest policy when he appeared before the Commerce Committee on Jan. 6 in the first Congressional hearing for a nominee to the Clinton Cabinet. Nominees with later hearings, including Mickey Kantor as the United States Trade Representative, tended to adopt broader conflict-of-interest policies.
The Senate confirmed Mr. Kantor today, as well as Mike Espy as Agriculture Secretary, Richard W. Riley as Education Secretary and Jesse Brown as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Also confirmed were Henry G. Cisneros as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Hazel R. O'Leary as Energy Secretary.
Also confirmed today were Carol M. Browner as Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Roger C. Altman as Deputy Treasury Secretary and Alice M. Rivln as Deputy Budget Director.
 
Tough Questions for Babbitt
 In his second day before the Senate Energy Committee, former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona faced tough questioning from Western senators about his views on Federal lands and his links to environmental groups.
Mr. Babbitt, who was later confirmed as Interior Secretary, said he would take a balanced approach to the use of Federal lands, saying he could "accommodate both resource development and resource conservation."
Mr. Babbitt said he backed the Endangered Species Act, which calls on the Government to preserve threatened species and plants. Business and labor have often criticized the act for preventing logging in parts of the Northwest to protect the spotted owl.
Mr. Babbitt said the act's concept was "sound," asserting that with "thoughtful administration" such "collisions can be avoided."
 
Focusing on Job Growth
 In a confirmation hearing today, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, Mr. Clinton's nominee to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said one of the Administration's priorities would be to fulfill the President's goal of creating eight million jobs over four years.
She signaled that the Administration was seriously considering a short-term stimulus package, including increased deficit spending in the first year, to speed up job growth, which has been anemic despite months of economic recovery.
"This is a modest recovery," she said. "It's not creating jobs as fast as previous recoveries."
She predicted that the nation's trade deficit might deteriorate as Europe's and Japan's economies flounder, causing them to import fewer American goods. She said the Government should work to insure that American companies have full access to European and Japanese markets, asserting that she favored open trade and was not, as some critics contend, a protectionist.
 
Specialist in Trade Issues
 Ms. Tyson, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told the Senate Banking Committee that the trade deficit was evidence that the nation's economic competitiveness had eroded. A specialist in trade issues, Ms. Tyson noted that American companies have lost market share abroad in computers, commercial aircraft and telecommunications.
She denied that she favored having the Government decide which industries have the best chance to be successful in the future and then aiding those industries. Instead she said the Government should encourage increased investment, research and job training for all industries.
Ms. Tyson said that to make more loans available to small business, the new Administration was studying whether to help arrange for financial institutions to package and sell such loans to outside investors, as is done with home mortgages. This would help reduce the risk for financial institutions that make such loans.
In another confirmation hearing, Madeleine K. Albright, the nominee for Ambassador to the United Nations, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the fighting in Bosnia was "clearly the highest priority of the President in the National Security Council's agenda." Ms. Albright, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, urged enforcement of the United Nations' ban on Serbian warplanes flying over Bosnia.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who was confirmed on Wednesday along with Warren M. Christopher as Secretary of State and Les Aspin as Secretary of Defense, announced today that Lawrence H. Summers was being nominated as Under Secretary for International Affairs and Frank N. Newman as Under Secretary for Domestic Finance.
Mr. Summers is an economics professor at Harvard University and Mr. Newman is vice chairman of the board and chief financial officer of the BankAmerica Corporation, the California-based banking company.
Mr. Bentsen also announced that Eugene A. Ludwig, a lawyer at Covington & Burling in Washington, was his nominee for Comptroller of the Currency.

HEADLINE: SETTLING IN: Easing Abortion Policy;
CLINTON ORDERS REVERSAL OF ABORTION RESTRICTIONS LEFT BY REAGAN AND BUSH

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Signaling a sea change in domestic policy, President Clinton moved today to reverse a decade of Republican edicts on abortion and other issues, including a repeal of the ban on abortion counseling at federally financed clinics.
Mr. Clinton signed five abortion-related memorandums on the 20th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. 
 As he signed the documents, a crowd that the Park Police estimated at 75,000 rallied against abortion in the nation's capital and pledged to fight on.
In addition to lifting the ban on counseling, Mr. Clinton lifted restrictions on Federal financing of research that uses fetal tissue, eased the policy on abortions in military hospitals, and reversed a Reagan Administration prohibition on aid to international family-planning programs that are involved in abortion-related activities.
 
'Safe and Legal but Rare'
 He also called for a review of the ban on the importation of the French abortion drug, RU-486, for personal use.
In a ceremony at the White House this afternoon, Mr. Clinton reiterated the carefully nuanced position on abortion he had maintained in the campaign, calling for "an America where abortion is safe and legal but rare."
Outside, angry abortion opponents protested his moves. John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, was one of many religious and political leaders who addressed the annual March for Life in the nation's capital. He told the marchers: "Your presence here makes very clear that we will not be intimidated, we will not be ignored, and we will not be treated with contempt. We have only just begun."
 
180-Degree Turns
 On its third day, the Clinton Administration busily set about putting its mark on domestic policy. As Mr. Clinton erased years of Federal abortion policies with five signatures, other Administration officials were announcing 180-degree turns on two other issues that loomed large in the Bush years.
Just hours after he was sworn in as director of the Office of Management and Budget, Leon E. Panetta rescinded scores of proposed Federal regulations issued by the Bush Administration in its final weeks, effecting areas like the environment and banking. [Page 10.]
Vice President Al Gore said the Administration had abolished the Council on Competitiveness, a Cabinet-level group that had led the Bush Administration's assault on environmental regulations it considered too costly.
And Mr. Clinton's new Labor Secretary, Robert B. Reich, gave a full-throated endorsement to legislation that would require employers to give workers time off for childbirth or family illness, insuring quick approval of a bill twice vetoed by Mr. Bush.
Mr. Clinton's memorandums on abortion, which were roundly cheered by abortion-rights supporters, repealed one of the most hotly debated Bush Administration regulations, the ban on counseling about abortion in family-planning clinics that receive Federal money.
Mr. Clinton declared today: "This dangerous restriction censors the medical information and advice that health-care professionals can give their patients. As a result of today's action, every woman will be able to receive medical advice and referrals that will not be censored or distorted by ideological arguments that should not be a part of medicine."
 
Allows Fetal-Tissue Research
 In reversing the ban on fetal research, Mr. Clinton declared, "This moratorium has significantly hampered the development of possible treatments for individuals afflicted with serious diseases and disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and leukemia."
The result of another memorandum will be that military hospitals will be allowed to perform abortions, "provided the procedure is paid for entirely with private funds."
Mr. Clinton took one of his more far-reaching steps by reversing the policy established in 1984 by the Reagan Administration that cut off aid to international family-planning programs that were involved in abortion counseling or other abortion-related activities, including lobbying efforts to have abortion legalized. His action would open the way to restoring contributions to United Nations population programs.
While much of abortion policy is enshrined in legislation and thus not able to be changed quickly, Mr. Clinton asserted today that his actions "will go a long way toward protecting vital medical and health decisions from ideological and political debate."
Kate Michelman, President of the National Abortion Rights Action League, hailed him for "swiftly and decisively fulfilling his vow to revoke dangerous Bush-Reagan anti-choice policies."
Although Mr. Clinton's moves had been widely expected, leaders of the anti-abortion movement reacted with outrage. Roger Cardinal Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles and chairman of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee for Prolife Activities, declared today that Mr. Clinton was not fulfilling his vow to make abortion "safe, legal and rare."
"Surely you cannot reduce abortion by promoting abortion as just another method of birth control," the Cardinal said. "You cannot reduce abortion by fueling a market for the tiny dead bodies of unborn children. You cannot reduce abortion by exporting abortion to the poor in the Third World."
Senator Jesse Helms, addressing the March for Life today, put his message to Mr. Clinton more simply: "I say to him, shame! shame!" Mr. Helms declared to a crowd that sprawled across a muddy Ellipse still marked from Mr. Clinton's inaugural celebrations.
The protesters, who in other years had received telephoned messages of support from Presidents Reagan and Bush, vowed that the change in Administrations would not cause them to flag. March organizers estimated the size of the crowd at 250,000, although United States Park Police put it at less than a third of that.
While some of the signs in the crowd were bitterly partisan, most were not. People wore stickers that read, "In Your Heart You Know It's Wrong," and "The Natural Choice is Life," and they carried banners from scores of small towns, schools, churches and parishes. Some of the speakers, noting Mr. Clinton's education by the Jesuits at Georgetown, said they would pray that he would see the error of his ways.
Again and again, the speakers declared that this was a spiritual battle, and that they were in it for the long haul.
 
 
 
CHANGING RULES ON ABORTION
COUNSELING
Rebublican Policy: Counseling women on the option of having an abortion was prohibited in 4,000 family planning clinics that receive Federal financing.This "gag rule" was imposed by Ronald Reagan in February 1988.
Clinton Action: No immediate effect because courts have blocked the ban.
 
INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS
Rebublican Policy: Cut off all money to family planning programs of the United Nations or other international groups that provide abortions or abortion counseling as any part of their work. United States policy declares that rising population is not an important factor in economic development (this position, established in 1984 by Mr. Reagan, reversed decades of policy).
Clinton Action: Opens the way to restore Unites States financing to United States population programs if Congress appropriates the money.
 
MILITARY HOSPITALS
Rebublican Policy: Banned abortions in military hospitals overseas. Extended a 1980 ban on Federal financing for military abortions.
Clinton Action: Will permit abortions if women pay the operations themselves. Would not permit Federal payment for military abortions, which would require Congressional action.
 
FETAL TISSUE
Rebublican Policy: A ban imposed by Mr. Reagan in 1988 blocked transplant research using organs from aborted fetuses. Research into an area considered promising by scientists -- transplantion of unformed fetal cells into adult brains to replace neural cell damaged by disease -- was stopped.

HEADLINE: Paying for Health, The German Way -- A special report.;
Medical Care in Germany: With Choices, and for All

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 22

 BODY:
If the most critical problem in providing national health care is getting control over rapidly rising costs, as President Clinton has often said, he may find some intriguing ideas in the German health care system, which offers coverage to all at a much lower price than Americans pay.
Germany's much-admired system of health care, provided through nonprofit but private "sickness funds" that are legally mandatory for nearly 90 percent of the population, leaves patients with freedom to choose their own doctors and their own hospitals, and freedom from almost all medical bills. 
 Germans spend only about half as much per person on health care as Americans do, $1,486 in 1990 for Germany, compared with $2,566 for the United States. As a percentage of gross national product, however, it was 14 percent for the United States in 1992 and a little more than 8 percent for Germany. In 1990, the G.N.P. comparisons were 12.1 percent for the United States and 8.1 percent for Germany.
American health experts and politicians have flocked here in recent years to try to learn how they could apply at home what they see here. But they have found little that could simply be copied from a country with different cultural traditions.
Visiting a German doctor's office or hospital is much like visiting a good one in the United States. Many German hospitals are regarded as among the best in the world, and few have the crowded emergency rooms and waiting areas that are common in urban American hospitals because people have no other source of medical care. Neither do they have to increase bills for insured patients to cover those who cannot pay, because in Germany insurance covers virtually everybody, including foreign workers and asylum-seekers.
For years, the German Government has tried to keep medical expenditures from growing faster than the economy as a whole, not so much by limiting benefits as by pressing drug makers, doctors and hospitals to contain fees, an approach that has worked fairly well.
The biggest savings have come from Government-mandated programs that brought down the prices of German pharmaceutical products, once the highest in Europe, by ordering insurance funds to pay only what generic drugs cost.
Doctors administer their own payments from the health insurance system, and since 1985 they have agreed to annual caps on total payments, which they share depending on the number of treatments performed.
In another effort to curb costs, and to counter what is generally seen as a surplus of physicians, doctors have been told that from now on they would have to retire, as far as the sickness funds were concerned, at age 68. New practices can only be set up in localities where the Government agrees there is a need for them.
The restrictions have stirred some unhappiness among doctors. German general practitioners earn an average of $95,565 before taxes, which puts them among the country's highest earners, but their incomes have not risen as fast as average wages over the last two decades.
"Many people go into the medical profession with expectations that are too high," said Dr. Karsten Vilmar, head of the national physicians' association in Cologne. "But these kinds of limitations seem to us to violate the constitutional guarantees on professional freedom."
Another factor in keeping costs down is that malpractice suits are less common in Germany than in the United States, and so are extraordinary life-prolonging measures for patients judged to be terminally ill. "If an elderly patient is clearly dying of natural causes, I treat her at home," said Dr. Ursula Friedrichs, who like most of her colleagues still makes house calls. "I know a hospital stay wouldn't do any good."
According to a recent study by John K. Iglehart in The New England Journal of Medicine, "On the average, German hospitals have fewer pieces of high-technology equipment than most big urban hospitals in the United States." But Germany concentrates its most expensive medical technology in teaching hospitals like the University Hospital in Bonn, where the basic daily room rate can be as high as $400 -- but remains far below American rates.
 
A Mounting Demand
 Still, with a mounting demand for medical services, costs have been soaring here too, putting the insurance funds billions of dollars in the red last year. To try to bring costs under control the Government, with a determination worthy of Otto von Bismarck, the Chancellor who expanded the sickness fund system in Prussia 110 years ago to keep the Socialists at bay, has recently run roughshod over the lobbies of doctors, dentists, hospital administrators and drug manufacturers, all of which are seemingly far less powerful here than they are in Washington. A law that went into effect Jan. 1 imposed more across-the-board reductions in the price of most medicines, tightened the caps on doctors' fees, and changed the way hospitals are paid in ways devised to encourage efficiency and lower costs.
 
How Things Work
Some Choices, Some Limits
 Germany's system bears little resemblance to the state-run system of cradle-to-grave national health care the British adopted after World War II. It is also very different from the American health-insurance system, which leaves some 35 million people uncovered.
The main difference between the German system and the American one is that most Germans have no choice about whether to join a health insurance plan, and no problem finding coverage, either. Unless they are either very poor or pretty well off, the law requires them to become members of one of 1,147 "sickness funds" in the country. Some of the funds are connected to private employers, while others are quasi-public institutions.
The funds are supposed to break even, and each one sets a monthly premium rate as a percentage of a wage-earner's monthly salary. The rates among the funds now vary between 8 percent and 16.8 percent of salary, and have reached a historically high national average of 13.1 percent. The premiums are shared equally by employer and employee and paid by payroll deduction. The rate is the same for single and married wage-earners, with or without dependents, in any given sickness fund.
"Everybody knows exactly how much health insurance costs, and when the figure climbed above 13 percent, everybody in the system knew they had to get costs under control or the public would be after them," said Uwe E. Reinhardt of Princeton University, an economist who is an expert on the German system.
Nearly all employers are required to participate, including small businesses and low-wage industries, which in the United States often say they cannot afford to offer health benefits.
The funds cover not only workers and employees but retirees and people on welfare. Government agencies pay the premiums for the elderly and the indigent, as well as for the three million Germans now out of work. Changing jobs, or losing them, does not mean losing insurance coverage, even for a minute.
 
Never See a Bill
 Germans who have the basic, mandatory insurance never see their doctor or hospital bills. Starting this year, most of them have to pay more for medicine, but only up to a maximum of 7 marks -- less than $4.50 -- every time a prescription is filled.
Hospital patients must pay only $6.80 a day in western Germany, and $6.25 in the formerly Communist eastern part, and only for the first 14 days -- after that, even this charge is dropped.
"All I had to do was fill out a health care coupon from my sickness fund and present it to the doctor," said Mrs. Marianne Wettlauffer, 68, who had a slight heart attack several years ago and also spent six weeks in a rehabilitation cure in the Black Forest. All but a nominal amount was paid for by her sickness fund.
Her husband, Hellmut, 68, also had a heart attack 10 years ago, while he was a Government employee. His current care, too, costs him nothing out of pocket, though he supplements his Government pension plan with an inexpensive private policy that provides additional benefits like private hospital rooms.
Their physician, Dr. Friedrichs, has a small second-floor practice in a modern building in Bad Godesberg. From the small waiting room to the two consulting rooms, every room is white and antiseptically modern. Dr. Friedrichs takes privately insured patients as well as those in the sickness funds.
The private patients bring in bigger fees, but the funds provide the bread and butter, with a minimum of administrative headache, she said. "I get the payment automatically when I turn in the coupon, with the services performed marked on it," she said.
Germans who earn more than $40,000 a year ($29,450 this year in the formerly Communist eastern part of Germany, where wages and salaries are still lower) are not required to buy health insurance, but almost all of them -- about 6.3 million people -- purchase it anyway.
Because 88 percent of the population is covered by the sickness funds, risk is more evenly distributed among them than in the United States, and private insurance is also relatively cheap by American standards.
 
Containing Costs
Price Rollbacks And Limits on Fees
 How to reduce waste and inefficiency has been a preoccupation of German Governments since the mid-1970's. Three years ago, changes were put into effect that were supposed to put the health system on a secure financial basis for the next century. Sickness funds were ordered to pay for generic drugs only wherever possible, dental benefits were curtailed and hospitals were directed to increase efficiency.
But costs kept rising anyway, much faster than the rate of inflation or the funds' income from premiums. Either the rates had to be raised or costs had to be cut. And for German politicians, raising health premiums was about as desirable as raising taxes.
Since the system is set up to be self-financing, the German Government did not bail out the funds with taxpayers' money. Instead, it enacted a draconian new law that went into effect on Jan. 1, with the backing of all the major political parties.
Among other new controls on the pharmaceutical industry, the law mandates an across-the-board reduction of 5 percent in the price of most nongeneric medicines sold in the western part of the country this year, and a price freeze through 1994. In the poorer east, the law requires all medicine to be sold at a 20 percent discount.
The law also reduces orthodontists' fees by 10 percent, mandates that hospital fees rise during the next two years no faster than incomes, and bars clinics or private practices from buying expensive new "major equipment" without Government approval.
 
Charges for Weekends
 The law eliminates the traditional practice of reimbursing hospitals' costs and letting them bill the funds at a daily rate -- a practice that, many doctors concede, often led to admissions on Fridays, so hospitals could collect fees over the weekends even though no treatment was given, and discharge 10 days later on Mondays for operations that need only have taken a few days.
By 1996, German hospitals and physicians are to work out new fees based on the procedure, not the length of stay.
To hold down doctors' fees, the new law provides that reimbursements from the sickness funds rise only as fast as income from premiums. The funds pay doctors by the number of services they perform at a rate negotiated with the sickness funds, so by limiting the total "pot," the payments can be limited too.
 
What the Future Holds
Changing Needs In Aging Population
 In all, the Government says that the new law will save $6.5 billion this year and that premiums will not have to rise faster than inflation.
Government and health officials all insist that they do not want to be forced to delay care, the way the British National Health Service does for "elective" operations like hip replacements and heart transplants, with waiting lists that can delay them for years. Nor can they understand why Americans accept a system with what they see as Darwinian traits.
"We are not entitled, particularly with our German past, to decide who is entitled to survival and who is not," said Dr. Vilmar, who heads the national physicians' association. "All we have to ask ourselves is whether we really need a system that provides 100 percent coverage to everybody. There should be a system of perceptible cost-sharing."
He is among the critics of the new law who question if providers of medical care will ever have a strong reason to keep costs under control as long as most consumers never have to even think about how much their care costs.
Regardless of the new law, serious challenges will remain. As in the United States, for example, there is debate about how to cover the costs of long-term care like nursing homes for the growing population of disabled elderly.
Nursing care for the elderly at home is partly covered under the German system, but only up to four weeks and only if it is connected with an illness or accident.
Nursing homes cost about as much here as they do in the United States, and those who cannot pay usually have to sign over their assets or rely on help from welfare. Children with incomes can also be required to pay for nursing home care for their invalid parents.
The Labor Minister, Norbert Blum, has proposed a new state-run old age insurance plan to cover nursing home care, to be paid for by payroll deductions and by eliminating one national paid holiday. But opposition from churches as well as labor unions makes it doubtful whether the plan will become law by 1996, as Mr. Blum wanted.
Only one thing seems sure: with a rapidly aging population -- the proportion of those over 60 will grow by 19 percent by the end of the century, while the segment between 20 and 40 is shrinking by more than 12 percent -- the pressure from medical costs will continue to mount.

HEADLINE: SETTLING IN: An Angry Public;
Fueled by Radio and TV, Outcry Became Uproar

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22

 BODY:
By Sunday, most of official Washington and the news media had already dismissed the problems with Zoe Baird's nomination as Attorney General. But anyone listening that morning to Susan Estrich's talk show here on KABC radio knew the nomination was in deep trouble over Ms. Baird's hiring of illegal aliens as household help.
"The phones went crazy," said Ms. Estrich, who was the Presidential campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 and now teaches law at the University of Southern California. "That's the only thing people wanted to talk about. I found a fire already raging, just looking for a house to burn down." 
 Over the next few days, as Washington insiders scratched their heads in bafflement, public fury over Ms. Baird reached a boil -- on radio-talk shows from Boston to San Diego, in bars in New Orleans, in the remote reaches of West Texas. "The more exposure she got, people would say, 'Look at this,' " said Roy Markey, owner of Markey's Bar in the working-class Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans.
 
Isolation of Washington
 By early today, the uproar forced President Clinton to withdraw the nomination -- demonstrating both that there is often an enormous gulf in political sensibilities between Washington and the general populace and that a new means of communications are giving new political power to the public. The anger rose on a crest carried by a new generation of talk shows, cable television and other programs that Mr. Clinton used to win election but that has now come back to haunt him. These media have made for the direct exchange of ideas and emotions, short-cutting traditional news outlets.
It was also, to be sure, an issue that resonated powerfully in families searching for solutions to the problem of raising children and earning a living. And it hit particularly hard here in economically battered California, where illegal aliens are increasingly perceived as a drag on state and local government services and as taking jobs away from legal residents.
For 57-year-old Shirley E. Roth of Fountain Valley in Orange County the blood began to heat a week ago Thursday when she first read in The Orange County Register that Ms. Baird had hired a Peruvian couple who were in this country illegally. Anger turned to outrage in the next two days when that newspaper and The Los Angeles Times endorsed Ms. Baird's nomination.
 
Taking Jobs Away
 Ms. Roth, who moved here from Rochester with her husband, an engineer, and four children 17 years ago, wrote letters to the editor of The Register, to her Congressman and the Senators from California, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both Democrats.
"Our concern was that she was taking meaningful employment away from American citizens," Ms. Roth said today. "Citizens can't compete with illegals for a living wage, and that makes for a volatile environment, especially here in California."
The telephone lines at the local offices of Senators Feinstein and Boxer were overwhelmed on Thursday by callers who complained that Ms. Baird broke the law and that illegal aliens were taking away jobs.
The Senate hearings shown on cable television fueled the complaints. John De Roo Jr., a 72-year-old retired school administrator who lives in the upper-middle-class Granada Hills area of the San Fernando Valley, watched senators questoin Ms. Baird on Thursday. He said he was struck that Ms. Baird did not seem to grasp what was wrong with hiring illegal aliens.
"We're facing tremendous problems in Southern California," he said. "Dianne Feinstein pointed that out in her questioning yesterday that she didn't seem even aware that this was such a tremendous problem."
Like many who watched the hearing, Muriel North of Hackettstown, N.J., felt that the Senators on the Judiciary Committee were not sufficiently tough on Ms. Baird, a corporate lawyer who had failed to pay the Social Security taxes of the Peruvian couple, then dismissed them after the Clinton victory.
"I got so upset over the hearings and I thought they were missing the point," said Mrs. North, 90, who called her Representative, Marge Roukema, a Republican. "I was watching the whole day getting madder and madder. No one was saying the big thing, which was that she was very unethical. She is probably brilliant and capable, but to live in a democracy you've got to be honest and ethical."
In Garden City, Kan., Roberta Renick, a retired drug-store owner, called the office of Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Republican. She complained that the Senators were too "generous" to the nominee. Mrs. Renick said she had never hired anyone without paying for Social Security. "I think everyone should do it if that's the law and she knew what was right and what was wrong," she said.
At KPRC-AM in Houston, Jon Matthews's talk show has been swamped with calls about Ms. Baird. "There was not great sympathy for her," he said. "People were perplexed. Here's someone with half a million in income who has no problems. It's hard to identify with somebody who has that type of income and assets breaking the law. People read a lot of arrogance into that."
Hundreds of miles west, in the ranch country of West Texas, where Mexican immigrants have long been employed and exploited, there was consternation, too. Bill Young, a retired Air Force master sergeant in San Angelo, complained to his Congressman, Lamar Smith, a Republican. "I'm tired of people being so darn greedy and grabbing," he said in an interview today. "We're the ones at home sacrificing to keep them up there."
The mood was no different half a continent away in politically liberal Boston, where callers would talk of nothing else on Marjorie Clapprood's morning talk show on WHDH. "This is a big reaction," said Ms. Clapprood, who likened the furor to that over the testimony of Prof. Anita F. Hill at the Clarence Thomas hearings. "It really touched a chord. I think two-thirds of my calls were from women who've been through the rigorous process of finding day care -- and they were having none of it."
At the Harvard Medical School, Patricia Thomas, editor of The Harvard Health Letter, said that sentiment turned against Ms. Baird as her all-female staff listened to the hearings. "This is an office where everyone wore buttons that said, 'Vote for Hillary's Husband,' " she said. "First people were saying, 'What woman doesn't have problems with child care?' But then as time went on, people thought, 'If this woman is such a good lawyer and her husband is a constitutional law expert why did they knowingly do something against the law?' '

HEADLINE: Russia and Partners Meet, But Unity Still Eludes Them

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States met today in the Belarus capital, Minsk, for a summit meeting that once again failed to give real shape or purpose to the association that emerged 13 months ago as the successor to the Soviet Union.
The meeting, which was delayed three times, ended without resolving a quarrel between the commonwealth's two largest members, Russia and Ukraine, over the control of strategic nuclear weapons. 
 But it also left unanswered more fundamental questions about whether the commonwealth has any function other than to gather together its 10 disparate members, from Europe's edge to the steppes of Central Asia, for periodic high-level meetings.
At the end of the daylong meeting, the leaders agreed to sign a memorandum that lays out the principles of the commonwealth while allowing individual members more time to consider a more substantive charter defining the range of the commonwealth's authority. Seven of the 10 members are apparently ready to sign the charter, but Ukraine, Turkmenistan and Moldova, fearing the surrender of their new sovereignty, held back.
"I think by joint mental effort we found a decision that suits everybody and does not create problems within the national interest of individual states," President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia said at a news conference after the meeting.
 
Ownership at Issue
 On the eve of the meeting, Russia proposed to take control over the former Soviet Union's strategic nuclear forces, including weapons in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan scheduled to be transferred to Russia for dismantling under recent arms control agreements with the United States.
Although its Parliament has yet to ratify the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start I, Ukraine has not backed away from its commitment to become a nonnuclear country. But it insists that the 176 intercontinental missiles on its territory are legally Ukrainian property.
The meeting did produce a few agreements, including the creation of an interstate bank that will serve to resolve conflicts over money transfers and currency issues. According to an initial draft approved by the commonwealth's Prime Ministers, the ruble will serve as the bank's single currency and Russia's Central Bank will keep control over the issuing of credits.
But the members were divided over a proposed charter that would more closely coordinate defense and economic policies among the commonwealth's members. They now include the Central Asian states of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyryzstan and Uzbekistan, as well as Kazakhstan, Armenia, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine, with Azerbaijan taking part as an observer.
Ukraine, together with Turkmenistan and Moldova, has had reservations about signing the charter. Several days ago, the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, told reporters in Kiev that he "will not allow the Commonwealth of Independent States to be turned into a supranational body subject to international law."
Unable to resolve their disagreement over the nature of their relationship, the commonwealth leaders today prepared two documents -- one, a charter, that would promote greater integration, and another, called a memorandum, that calls for a looser cooperation. To preserve the appearance of unity, the leaders decided to sign the memorandum jointly, leaving open the option of a more definitive charter, which requires ratification by local parliaments.
The uncertain status of the commonwealth's armed forces is one reason why Russia this week proposed to claim jurisdiction over nuclear weapons outside its territory. Under the original agreement reached between Russia and the three other "nuclear" states, strategic nuclear forces were to remain under the command of the Commonwealth Armed Forces.
But as Marshal Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, commander of the armed forces, noted recently, this did not resolve the issue of which state has legal jurisdiction over them. This right, he said, should belong to Russia, the only one of the former Soviet republics that will remain a nuclear power and the one that has pledged to undertake the dismantlement of nuclear weapons.
According to reports from Minsk, Belarus and Kazakhstan are ready to consider Russia's position. But Ukraine insists that it is the legal heir to the nuclear weapons on its territory.

Labor's Problem: Must Beliefs Be Whitewashed?

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Among the thousands who gathered on Wednesday under red, white and blue flags in the Dorchester Hotel ballroom to raise a long-distance toast to Bill Clinton's inauguration were more than a smattering of Labor Party leaders, members and sympathizers. They could be forgiven for what they were thinking: we could have been winners, too.
Nowhere are the changeover to a new Administration in Washington and the lessons of the Democratic victory in November being studied more closely than in Britain, where Labor has been wandering in the desert during 13 years of Conservative rule. 
 The questions bouncing around the ballroom -- before the hard realities of governing set in -- were simple: what was the secret of Mr. Clinton's magic in getting elected, and could it be made to work on this side of the Atlantic?
"The first lesson we learned is to keep your eye on the ball, which is the economy," said Tony Banks, a dapper East Ender who represents a London district in Parliament. "That's the same over here."
 
Praises Clinton's Stand
 As he spoke he stared up awe-struck at a fuzzy screen where a 20-foot-tall President Clinton waved his arms in triumph.
Mr. Banks continued: "Then there's the populist way it was done, very good. The way Clinton appealed to the broadest spread -- you don't win elections by narrowing your appeal. Course, I don't think one should go overboard."
Mr. Banks was hedging his observations advisedly, for the Labor Party, so hungry for power that at times it seems weak with starvation, is undergoing a rift over how far it should proceed with what is called "Clintonization."
On the one side are the "modernizers," who believe that the party should soften its class-conflict militancy and position itself more in the mainstream of British life in the way that Mr. Clinton, as Governor of Arkansas, helped create a more conservative and popular wing of the Democratic Party.
These Young Turks, who mostly joined Parliament in the elections of 1983 and 1987, want to build on and expand the changes instituted by the former Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock. Mr. Kinnock rescued the party from near oblivion after it took a far-left detour in the 1980's but resigned as leader after the humiliating loss to John Major's Tories in April, the party's fourth straight defeat.
On the other side are the traditionalists, who fear that the party is in danger of watering down its beliefs, moving away from its working-class and trade union origins, and in short losing its soul in a Faustian bargain to gain a majority of seats in four years.
Presiding over it all and standing above the fray is the new leader, John Smith, a broad-browed, square-jawed Scottish lawyer who has been very sphinxlike. Most assume he will carry on in the Kinnock tradition, trying to nudge along reforms in both party and electoral procedures while trying hard not to offend believers in the old-time religion of collective egalitarianism.
But so far he has not made any dramatic moves or articulated a hard-driving philosophy. In fact he plays his cards so close to the chest that no one can say for certain which path he might take. As a headline in the Conservative Daily Telegraph put it: "Smith: Lost for Words or Just Quietly Confident?"
 
Devastating Series of Events
 While the fortunes of the Major Government have fallen low, those of the opposition have not risen correspondingly high. Over recent months, the Government has been hit by a devastating succession of events: an abrupt decision to pull the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, thus effectively devaluing it; the announced closing of 31 coal mines that would put 30,000 miners out of work that was hastily reversed for cooler consideration, and even some long-running personal scandals among Cabinet ministers that forced one to step down.
Above all, after three years of recession, there has been a continuing stream of bad economic news. While some Government officials squinted hard and said they saw ahead the first signs of a slight upturn, figures released on Thursday showed that unemployment had jumped up to reach nearly three million, the highest level in six years.
 
Creating an Acceptable Vision
 But for whatever reason Labor has not been able to exploit these woes. In debates in the House of Commons, Mr. Smith can throw punches at Prime Minister Major but, so far at least, he has not managed to deck him. Some weeks back, private polls were showing Labor running ahead by some 20 points but more recently the gap is said to have narrowed.
The lack of headway feeds the arguments of those who look across the Atlantic for inspiration, like Anthony Blair, Labor's shadow Home Secretary and a man sometimes touted as Mr. Smith's heir apparent. "Clinton presented the Democrats in a different way to the American people, and that certainly has application for us here," he said.
Along with figures like Gordon Brown, the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, he gives the vision an acceptable slant by promoting it as a "new radicalism." Among other things, it represents a loosening of ties with the trade unions that control party congresses through a system of bloc voting, revisions in the scheme of universal benefits, a shift away from a "tax and spend" reputation and a slightly more pro-European tilt.
But at heart it is an attempt to capture the non-unionized workers in the private sector -- the middle-class consumers as well as the assembly-line producers -- in much the same way that Mr. Clinton recovered the Democrats' traditional blue-collar constituency.
The approach was detailed in a conference here two weeks ago at which some Clinton poll takers and advisers told an audience of Labor and trade unionists how the victory was achieved.
 
A Warning for the Future
 The "traditionalists," on the other hand, believe in shoring up the party's base in the working class and retaining the pervasive role of the unions, the party's founders. They shrink from the idea of debating the sanctity of "Clause 4" in the party's constitution, which holds out the shimmering and ever-distant promise of full nationalization.
In learning about Mr. Clinton, most traditionalists were scandalized to discover that he favored capital punishment.
"Let's go back to being proud of our roots" is the battle cry of John Prescott, shadow Transportation Minister, who is a leader of this faction. Like others in the group, he harbors a distrust for image makers and sophisticated campaign techniques. In a recent interview with the BBC, he warned the "Clintonizers" of the risks of having the party fall under the domination of poll takers, advisers and public relations executives.
Both sides share one reaction to the new Clinton Presidency. An editorial in The Independent summed it up: "On this side of the Atlantic we may be forgiven a powerful twinge of envy for the cleansing of the Augean stables that is taking place across the water."

HEADLINE: New Appeals to Pocketbook Patriots

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ABINGTON, Pa.

 BODY:
By the standards of respectable economic thinking, people like William Lynott are dismissed as well-meaning but misguided eccentrics whose ideas come from the Rush Limbaugh-Patrick Buchanan school of economics.
Mr. Lynott is the president of the year-old Buy America Foundation here, one of a handful of organizations that have sprung up in recent years to urge consumers to wield their wallets like patriots and buy American-made goods. 
 And they are finding a growing audience for their message. Marketing surveys show that more Americans have qualms about buying imported products and are increasingly looking for the "Made in U.S.A." label. The shift in sentiment is apparently linked to concerns about American jobs and a belief that the economy has deep-seated problems, a chord struck so effectively by Bill Clinton during the Presidential election campaign.
But most economists and academics say the Buy America movement's appeals to pocketbook jingoism are simple-minded and wrong in today's global economy, which muddles the geographic lineage of products because companies shop around the world for low-cost components.
"Absurd on the face of it" is the verdict of Louis W. Stern, a professor at the J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
The Buy America advocates, if heeded, could actually hurt the American economy, argues Robert Z. Lawrence, a professor of international trade at Harvard University. Nationalistic consumers, he says, violate a basic tenet of economics -- namely, that everyone is better off if each nation produces what it is best at making and free trade allows consumers to buy from the most efficient producer. This "theory of comparative advantage," first advanced in the early 19th century by an English economist, David Ricardo, is regarded today as "a fundamental insight into the way the world ought to work," Mr. Lawrence said.
Yet in its annual survey of consumer attitudes, completed in November of each year, Yankelovich Partners Inc. found in 1992 that 61 percent of Americans said they "feel guilty when purchasing non-American products," up from 49 percent in 1989.
Demand Factors Inc., a research firm in St. Louis that conducts market surveys for domestic clothing and textile makers, found in December that 38 percent of women under 35 years old checked labels for the country of origin when shopping for clothes, up from 23 percent in 1985. Of those who look for the Made in U.S.A. label, about 90 percent buy American-made goods.
Frank Schapiro of Demand Factors says the interest of the under-35 crowd is significant, because in the mid-80's, when he began the research, it was mainly consumers aged 50 and older with blue-collar backgrounds who noticed where goods were made.
"In the past few years, there has been a massive increase in the interest of young people and higher-income people in the country of origin of the products they buy," he said.
Yet it is unclear whether consumer misgivings about buying imports can be translated into changed buying habits. The Buy America campaigners speak of forging a new "consumer ethos" and point to the environmental movement, with its promotion of recyclable and natural products.
 
 
Wrapped in the Flag
 To be sure, more American marketers are sounding patriotic themes these days, like the "Heartbeat of America" slogan of the Chevrolet division of General Motors. And no company has wrapped itself in the flag as blatantly as the nation's leading retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The company asserts that its "Buy America" program, begun in 1985, now supports more than 100,000 United States jobs through orders Wal-Mart has shifted from foreign suppliers.
Wal-Mart's stores today are adorned with stars-and-stripes motifs and "Made in the U.S.A." signs. Still, a drawback of being so closely identified with the Buy America theme was seen last month when the weekly news program "Dateline NBC" asserted that Wal-Mart had placed "Made in the U.S.A." signs over imported goods. The company conceded that goods had been improperly marked, but said that the mistakes had been made in only a couple of its 2,000 stores.
Market researchers say that appeals to patriotism can influence buying habits, but only if the price and quality of domestic goods equal that of the imports. "All things being equal, people will choose American products today," said James A. Taylor, the managing partner of Yankelovich Partners. "But things aren't equal often enough."
A new book, "The Patriotic Consumer: How to Buy American," illustrates both the interest in buying American-made products and the challenge of doing so. Since the $6.95 paperback was published in November by Andrews & McMeel of Kansas City, it has sold briskly, nearly 50,000 copies so far. The book provides a guide to every room in the house from the bedroom to the garage, with charts that detail the origins of several hundred products.
Brand names, it seems, offer little help to the patriotic consumer. Take a product as simple as deodorant. Old Spice Stick, for example, is classified as 100 percent American made and owned, while Old Spice Anti-Perspirant uses less than 50 percent American ingredients or labor.
"The whole idea of how you buy American in a global economy can be incredibly difficult," said Anne Grant, co-author with Web Burrell of "The Patriotic Consumer."
There are heavyweight groups trying to jump-start the Buy America movement. The Crafted With Pride in U.S.A. Council, founded in 1984, is backed by big textile and apparel producers; its television advertising budget was about $15 million last year. The Made in the USA Foundation, begun in 1989, supports a lobbying affiliate as well as the foundation, with more than 50,000 individual, corporate and union members, and a yearly budget of roughly $10 million.
 Mr. Lynott's Buy America Foundation is a leaner operation. "Say hello to my staff," he said, gesturing toward the fish in an aquarium in the paneled office behind his garage here. He answers the phone, replies to letters and empties the trash himself. He is the reporter, writer and editor of the Buy America newsletter, which he sends free to anyone who asks for it. He receives no salary from the nonprofit foundation.
Less than two years ago, Mr. Lynott was ready to settle into a comfortable early retirement. A former executive at Sears, Roebuck & Company, he had a consulting practice and rarely gave much thought to where the goods he bought were made.
But after watching a public-television documentary on how the Japanese conquered America's consumer electronics market, Mr. Lynott began reading up on international business issues. A fascination, fed by selective study, developed into some fervently held beliefs.
In his view, America's chronic trade deficit is a disturbing symptom of the erosion of the nation's manufacturing sector, which cannot be replaced by service businesses.
A dapper 64-year-old, dressed in a tweed jacket, his necktie never loosened, Mr. Lynott is no zealot. His newsletter is packed with straightforward accounts of American products that are mentioned favorably in magazines like Consumer Reports and Motor Trend, and summaries of newspaper reports on trade issues.
"We don't lecture people on trade issues," he explained. "It's not an extremist approach. You turn off thinking people with extremism."
Mr. Lynott started the foundation last year with $4,000 of his own money. Since then, enough donations have come in to pay for his modest operation, with the average donation at $18 and about 30 percent of his readers contributing. The newsletter has grown to 10,000 copies and he hopes to double its circulation this year, and perhaps increase its frequency (it is now published quarterly) and hire a full-time staff member.
"I know that distinguished economists very often dismiss the Buy America movement as simplistic," Mr. Lynott said. "But I believe that it does matter where goods are made and who owns the company."
He added, "And if you walk into a store and U.S.-made goods are of equal or better quality than the imports, you owe it to yourself and your kids to buy it."

HEADLINE: Trenton Tries to End $2.2 Billion Budget Gap

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Faced with a projected $2.2 billion budget gap in an election year, New Jersey officials have begun negotiations on a range of revenue sources that they hope will allow them to close the gap with "minimal pain" to voters.
But the proposals are based on projections that the economy will grow significantly and that New Jersey residents will have a large appetite for a new lottery game. And one proposal is largely dependent on the Florio administration's ability to get the Federal Government to reimburse it for Medicaid bills it has refused to pay. 
 Among other things, budget officials are pinning their hopes on an 8 percent increase in revenues, an increase in Department of Motor Vehicles fees, a new Keno lottery game, a commuter tax mainly on New York residents and an early retirement plan for state employees. Those proposals would help raise about $1.9 billion.
Legislators and Florio administration officials say the money is needed to help offset a $900 million increase in spending and a $1 billion structural deficit left from last year, when officials used an $800 million pension revaluation and other one-time sources of revenue to close a similar gap in the 1992-93 fiscal budget. An additional $250 million is being sought as a surplus to help improve the state's bond rating.
 
Counting On U.S. Help
 According to a preliminary budget plan being circulated in the Legislature, administration planners are also counting on a large part of a $450 million in retroactive Medicaid reimbursements, which the state claims the Federal Government owes, for care at state psychiatric hospitals.
Without those reimbursements, the state would be left with at least a $200 million shortfall. Legislators and the Florio administration believe that they can bridge that gap with fee increases and other revenue enhancements without layoffs.
"If the administration also receives the $300-$400 million in Medicaid money from the Federal Government that the state is owed," according to the budget plan, "then the fiscal '94 budget will be balanced with minimal pain."
The disputed Medicaid reimbursement was the cause of a fractious budget battle last year. Gov. Jim Florio first included the money in his proposed 1992-93 fiscal budget. He yanked it out at the last minute, telling angry Republicans that the money would not be forthcoming. The move forced huge last-minute cuts.
The emerging budget, which is expected to be $15.2 billion to $15.5 billion and will be presented by Mr. Florio on Feb. 8, tries to thread a narrow course between two political minefields: raising taxes and cutting services or forcing more layoffs. The current budget is $14.7 billion.
Although the proposals outlined include raising the minimum tax on corporations and increasing the fees on such things as motor vehicles, the budget proposals largely skirt big cuts in services or employment, and impose no big new taxes.
The state has already eliminated some 5,000 state employees through early retirements and layoffs, cutting the work force to 65,000, from 71,000 when Mr. Florio took office in January 1990. And last year the Republican Legislature cut Mr. Florio's budget from $15.7 billion to $14.6 billion, incurring widespread criticism for cutting the Governor's popular Homestead Rebate program. The reductions in the work force and the budget cuts already made will make it difficult to make further cuts to achieve a balanced budget.
But Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian said that once the Governor proposes his budget, "We'll go through it line by line just as we did this year, and if cutting is necessary, we will do it."
The proposals being discussed today represent a new-found spirit of co-operation between Mr. Florio's Democratic administration and the overwhelmingly Republican Legislature. Republican leaders do not want to give voters the impression of partisan gridlock, which held up several issues last year. The Governor and all 120 members of the Legislature are up for election in November.
The anticipated $2.2 billion budget shortfall, according to budget officials in the Legislature and in the Florio administration, comes basically from the use of "one-shot" revenues to close last year's budget gap, including $800 million from the pension revaluation and $100 million from early collection of the utilities tax.
Although neither will be available this year, the state must allow for increases in school aid spending, Medicaid costs and outlays for prisons and prison personnel.

Steel Prices Rise, and Industry Sees Profitability

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Buoyed by the economic recovery and the possibility of new duties to protect them from foreign competition, the nation's large steel companies have announced price increases that could help the industry return to profitability this year.
The USX-U.S. Steel Group, the nation's largest steel company, said today that it would match increases announced Thursday by the LTV Corporation, the third-largest steel company, of $20 a ton for most sheet steel, a rise of from 4 percent to 5 percent. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the second-largest producer, and several smaller steel companies said that they were studying the increases and would make announcements next week. 
 The increases, if the industry can force customers to accept them, might be enough for most of the major companies to return to profitability in 1993 after two years of heavy losses. The increases affect spot prices and will have no near-term impact on much of the steel used by major manufacturers with long-term contracts.
The increases came on top of price rises earlier this month, which were the first the industry managed to maintain after more than a year of failures. But even the earlier increases were not a complete success. They held for cold-rolled steel but have been only partly enforced for hot-rolled products and failed completely in zinc-coated, or galvanized, steel.
The new increases, effective in April, apply only to hot and cold-rolled steel. But U.S. Steel said today that it also intended to impose changes in transaction costs that in effect would enforce this month's price increase for galvanized steel.
Some analysts noted that the increases did nothing to solve the industry's fundamental problem of overcapacity. Although the economy has been recovering since last spring, factory utilization has only recently nudged past 80 percent and several new highly efficient mini-mills are scheduled to open in the next few years. Some on Wall Street also fear that any gains from the price increases will be lost to unions in coming negotiations.
Still, investors responded positively, with the share prices of LTV, USX, Bethlehem, and Inland Steel Industries rising smartly in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Stocks Show Gains
 LTV rose 37.5 cents today, to $1.125; USX climbed $2.75, to $37.75; Bethlehem was up $1.75, to $19.25, and Inland finished up 87.5 cents, to $24.125. The increases continued a rebound for the sector that began last October, when big investors switched from drug stocks into steel and other cyclical industries expected to benefit from economic recovery.
Much of the industry's pricing optimism is hitched to the success it has enjoyed in Washington with its complaints against foreign steelmakers aimed at getting duties or quotas imposed on various types of steel imports.
The industry is anticipating one of its biggest victories yet next week when the Commerce Department is expected to find that major producers in a number of countries have been selling flat-rolled steel in the United States at prices below cost, a practice known as dumping.
 
Heavy Duties Seen
 Flat-rolled steel, used in the automobile and appliance industries, is the single largest segment of the industry. The Commerce Department is expected to call for duties of up to 25 percent.
The ruling would be a preliminary one subject to further action by both the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission, but industry sources say that a number of foreign steelmakers have already slowed shipments to the United States to avoid some of the liabilities they face in fighting it.
Experts say the import share of the market is likely to fall from about 17 percent last year to 15 percent this year.
The decline in foreign competition comes at the same time demand is picking up from auto makers and other major steel users. "Orders are definitely coming in more strongly than a few months ago," said Robert Lefley, a spokesman for Inland Steel.

HEADLINE: Japanese Trade Surplus Leaps to a Record

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Japan said today that its trade surplus with the United States jumped 14 percent last year, as its surplus with the entire world reached a record high.
It was the second consecutive yearly increase in the surplus with the United States after several years of declines. That trend may pose a challenge to President Clinton, who is facing calls in Congress for a tougher stance on the Japanese trade issue that could include retaliatory measures. 
 The amount by which Japanese exports to the United States exceeded imports rose from $38.22 billion in 1991 to $43.67 billion last year, still below the record of $52.09 billion in 1987.
But Japan's Ministry of Finance said the overall worldwide merchandise trade surplus soared 37.6 percent in 1992 to a new record. The total excess of exports over imports reached $107.06 billion in 1992, compared with $77.79 billion in 1991 and well beyond the record $82.74 billion in 1986.
[In Washington Friday, the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said in a statement that the Japanese trade surplus was "a call for action, an end to the policies of the past and a move to a results-oriented trade policy."
[Mr. Gephardt said the scale of Japan's trade surpluses with many countries, and not just the United States, showed that Japanese leaders "need to understand, as today's figures show, that this isn't just a bilateral problem, it's a global problem."]
President Clinton and some of his Cabinet members and advisers have vowed to take a tougher stance on Japanese trade, and the new figures could give them one more justification.
In a policy speech today, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he hoped to address bilateral economic issues "expeditiously and properly." He called Japan's economic situation "very grim."
Economists said the main reason for the rising Japanese trade surplus was a recession that reduced imports by 1.7 percent in 1992, to $232.70 billion. At the same time, Japanese companies, with their home market slumping, continued to increase their exports, which rose 8 percent, to $339.76 billion.
Those conditions are likely to persist into 1993. Indeed, the fact that the American economy appears to be recovering faster than the Japanese economy could further enlarge the surplus because it will lead to a spurt of Japanese exports without an equivalent rise in imports.
Another reason for the rise in the surplus, Japanese officials said, is the strengthening of the yen. That means exports valued in yen are converted into a higher dollar figure when the trade figures are calculated.
Still, the figures are considered embarrassing for Japan, which has long pledged to convert its economy to one that relies more on domestic consumption and less on exports. Japan made progress in that direction during the speculative "bubble" economy of the late 1980's, but that movement is now reversing.
Japan's trade surplus is also causing political problems with the European Community and with the rest of Asia, both of which also have large and growing deficits with Japan.
The Japanese trade surplus with the European Community rose 14 percent, to $31.18 billion, and with Asia 32 percent, to a record $41.76 billion.
Japanese officials have said that the best way to reduce the surplus is to improve the domestic economy. The Government last year enacted an $86 billion economic stimulus program centered on increased spending for public works. And reports are circulating that the Bank of Japan would soon cut the discount rate, which now stands at 3.25 percent, as a way to stimulate the economy.
It is likely that another stimulatory package will be enacted this year, although there is debate about how far it should go. Some business executives favor an income-tax cut to spur consumer spending, even if it means a national budget deficit. But the Ministry of Finance is strongly opposed to a budget deficit.
The trade figures released today are on a customs-cleared basis and differ from the balance of payments method used by the International Monetary Fund. Under that measurement, Japan's trade surplus might reach about $130 billion in 1992.

 NEW YORK CITY
 
 ROOMS FOR HOMELESS AVAILABLE AND EMPTY
Despite an overflow of New York City's shelter system that has caused up to 175 families to sleep in city welfare offices on recent nights, hundreds of apartments that have been set aside as permanent housing for the homeless have been standing empty, often for months at a time. According to the city's Housing Authority, there are currently 401 available apartments scattered across the five boroughs. Page 1.
 
 3 TAKEN FROM SHELTERS FOR MENTAL CARE
State officials said that they had inspected two New York City shelters for the homeless in an effort to identify residents who are dangerously mentally ill, and so far three residents of the Franklin Avenue shelter in the Bronx have been voluntarily taken to psychiatric emergency rooms. The results of a visit to the Borden Avenue Shelter in Long Island City, Queens, are expected to be available on Monday. The inspections are part of a new effort by state officials after a mentally ill man was charged with bludgeoning an 80-year-old woman to death near the Franklin Avenue shelter where he sometimes lived. Page 25. 

 MAN SAYS VOICES TOLD HIM TO KILL FAMILY
An unemployed garment worker from Queens fatally stabbed and bludgeoned his wife and two young daughters on Thursday, telling the police that voices had warned him they would be tortured if he did not kill them before the Chinese New Year, the authorities said. Page 25.
 
 The Rev. Al Sharpton apparently decides against running for City Council President. 24.
 
 REGION
 
 NOMINATION ENDS BUT NOT DISPUTE
Hours after Zoe Baird withdrew her nomination for Attorney General, her employer, Aetna Life and Casualty, issued a statement of warm reaffirmation, saying it would gladly welcome her back as the company's top lawyer. But few of her neighbors in New Haven offered any defense of Ms. Baird's violating Federal immigration law by hiring two undocumented Peruvian workers. And immigration officials said an interview with the Peruvian couple had been set for next week to help decide whether they should be deported. Page 8.
 
 NEW RULES ON AUTO EMISSIONS BLOCKED
A Federal judge blocked the adoption of stringent automobile standards that would have required 1995 model cars sold in New York State to produce cleaner emmissions. Environmental lobbyists said the ruling was the first of its kind in the country and could affect many other states that have adopted the clean air rules known as the California standards. 26.
 
 TRIPLE GAMBLE TO ERASE THE RED
Faced with a projected $2.2 billion budget gap in an election year, New Jersey officials have begun negotiations on a range of revenue sources that they hope will allow them to close the gap with "minimal pain" to voters. But the proposals are based on three projections: a growing economy, a successful new lottery and Federal Medicaid reimbursements. Page 26.
 
 WITNESS SHIFTS FROM SWORN STATEMENT
A former defendant in the Glen Ridge, N.J., sex-assault case, now testifying for the defense, disavowed a key element in the sworn statement he made to a judge last year in pleading guilty. He also added details to his account. Page 26.

HEADLINE: Island of Lost Souls? No, but the Talk of the Mall.;
Spate of Highly Publicized Crimes Leaves Many Asking What's Got Into Long Island

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SMITHTOWN, L.I.

 BODY:
On Long Island, in the same suburbs that for decades have been considered prototypes of security, wealth and tranquillity, now comes the macabre.
"I suppose the question for a lot of people is how this all could have happened on our quiet, tree-lined streets," said Louis Simpson, the poet and a Long Island resident for more than 20 years. 
 "It is strange, but I think it is just coincidental," he said in a burst of defensiveness shared by many here. "I mean, really! You could have three mass murders in Indianapolis."
 
No Mass Murders, at Least
 Mass murders, thank goodness, have not been the problem. But perhaps few crimes would have attracted such relentless publicity as those popping up on Long Island.
They include the case of Katie Beers, the 10-year-old held captive in a subterranean Bay Shore bunker; the sordid story of Sol Wachtler, the former chief judge of the State Court of Appeals, arrested in November on charges of threatening his former mistress and now under house arrest in Manhasset, and the tawdry tale of Amy Fisher, the Merrick 18-year-old who has become known, through three made-for-TV movies and more media attention than is normally allotted to a small war, as the "Long Island Lolita."
It has all unfolded here, prompting many to raise an all-but-imponderable question: Why here? One jibe is that there must be something strange in the Island's drinking water.
Some are asking if the recession has been so deep and long that it is pushing Long Islanders over the brink into violence.
But to most people here, the cases of Katie Beers, Amy Fisher and Sol Wachtler are aberrations, strung together only by coincidence of geography and timing, and yield no deep secrets about life on the Island.
Still, Long Island has gained the unwanted distinction of being a national center of scandal and crime. And therein lies a problem that may linger after the headlines.
"Obviously, this has all been negative for the Island," said the Rev. Tom Hartman, a Catholic priest and director of radio and television for the Diocese of Rockville Centre.
"There are a lot of people around the country that already view us as being an extension of New York City -- hard nosed, insensitive and money driven. "These stories just underscore that perception," he added.
"I do worry," said Mr. Simpson, a retired professor of literature at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and a recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. "People in the suburbs watch a lot of television, and it has a degrading effect. They get an exaggerated sense of violence, and they lose proportion. Now, with these stories, it is all real, and suddenly it is right on top of them."
 
Repelled and Attracted
 The emotional response in schools, churches and synagogues, around dinner tables and in parking lots, has been complex and sometimes conflicting. While many say they resent the media coverage, others admit to a strong tug of fascination.
"It may be voyeurism," said Ron Craddock, manager of the Smith Haven shopping mall here, which was itself drawn briefly into the media blitz when Miss Fisher, on the day before her sentencing for shooting Mary Jo Buttafuoco, came shopping for a new outfit, reporters in tow.
"I didn't know she was here at the time," Mr. Craddock said. But with a smile and a slight blush, he added: "If I had, I would probably have wanted her autograph."
Many Long Islanders now have personal stories of coming close to celebrity, or scandal.
"You know, I've seen him many times at the diner," said Sylvia Sones of Massapequa, who was plodding through the mall here with her husband, Lou, and their friends Ted and Esther Zuckerman.
To most people in Massapequa, Mrs. Sones's reference to "him" would be obvious -- he is Joseph Buttafuoco, the man Amy Fisher says was her lover.
Some are angry, less about the scandals than about the coverage. "I am appalled by the coverage," said Carole Kohlmar of East Hampton, a retired librarian, as she made her way with her husband, Matthew, through a throng of shoppers at the mall here the other day.
"It titilates people, nothing more than that," said Mr. Kohlmar, a retired history teacher. He attributed the vast coverage to Long Island's proximity to the networks, magazines and major newspapers of New York City, and for what he called the worst of the media blitz he blamed checkbook journalism, and the ability of movie and television producers to turn real tragedy into Hollywood fiction.
 
Background in Foreground
 But while few here welcome the attention, some say it was all but inevitable, given the backgrounds of those involved.
"If Amy Fisher were black and living in Harlem, that story would have gotten no more than first-day reporting," said Father Hartman. "But the fact that Amy, and now Katie Beers, are white, suburban kids makes them more comfortable" and easier for others in the nation's suburbs to relate to.
Is it mere coincidence that Long Island is awash in scandal now? Perhaps not, he said.
"Long Island is generally an affluent place, but we've got a lot of people out of work and a collapsing real-estate market," Father Hartman said. "We are dealing with the fact that we are no longer on the same economic plane as in the past, and maybe that has contributed to a sense of personal desperation that can push people over the edge."
To whatever extent the recession has played a role, many fear that the publicity has created a new hurdle, if only a small one, to recovery.
"These are individual horrors that should not be associated in people's minds with Long Island, but they will be," said Patricia Poppiti of Seldon, one of the Smith Haven mall shoppers. "Will businesses be discouraged from moving to the Island? I don't know," she said. "Will some people have more trouble selling their homes? It could be."
Mrs. Poppiti said she had already been forced to defend Long Island against exaggerated fears of crime in her own job as an administrator of programs that bring European young people to the New York City area as exchange students and au pairs.
Most people here are confident that the Island will soon fade from the public's consciousness as a center of scandal and bizarre crimes.
"My analysis is that Long Island, like other places, has its share of the abhorrent behavior, but for some strange reason it all came to the surface here this year," said James L. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association, a business group. "Who knows why? But communities do survive these things."
 
A Teen-Ager's View
 Perhaps least upset by the media blitz are the Island's teen-agers. Who better to judge a made-for-TV plot, fictional or real?
"Sure, this stuff is out of the ordinary, but big deal," said Brian James, 17, of Sayville, as he emerged from the Gap here with Rob Sholly, and Simeon Serrao, both of Bohemia.
"These things could happen anywhere," said Mr. Sholly, 18. "There is a lot of publicity, but it won't last. None of this really matters to me."

HEADLINE: Queens Man Kills Wife And 2 Girls, Police Say

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
An unemployed garment worker from Queens fatally stabbed and bludgeoned his wife and two young daughters on Thursday, telling the police that voices had warned him they would be tortured if he did not kill them before the Chinese New Year, the authorities said yesterday.
The man, Da Pei Wu, then tried to electrocute himself with exposed wires from a radio, but succeeded only in blowing a fuse in the apartment on 56th Avenue in Elmhurst, the police said. 
 The police said they discovered the bodies of Mr. Wu's wife, Hui Ming, 31 years old, and their daughters, Lauren, 5, and Renee, 2, early yesterday morning, after a neighbor told them that she had called Mr. Wu when she did not see the children's shoes outside the family's door as usual and that he had explained how he had had to kill them. When officers arrived, they found Mr. Wu pacing in the living room and the bodies, neatly lined up and covered with a blanket, in a bedroom.
Capt. Bernard Gillespie, the commanding officer of the 17th Division detective squad in Queens, said that Mr. Wu had never been in trouble with the police before, but appeared to have recently suffered "periods of mental instability." Six months ago, Mr. Wu, who is 37, lost his job sewing buttons for a factory in the Garment District in Manhattan.
 
Emigrated From China
 "He said he had to kill them before Saturday, the Year of the Rooster," Captain Gillespie said yesterday afternoon at a news conference at the 110th Precinct station house. "In his own mind he was saving them."
Mr. Wu and his wife, who emigrated from the Guangdong Province in China about seven years ago, lived in one of four apartments in a three-story duplex in the diverse middle-class Elmhurst neighborhood beside the Long Island Rail Road.
Neighbors described the Wus as a quiet family. They said that Mr. Wu and his wife had worked at home, sewing garments delivered occassionally by a truck, but that the truck stopped coming six months ago.
Edwin Espinosa, a student who lives in an apartment in the other half of the duplex, said his brother, Kenny, had played with the girls and attended kindergarten with Lauren at Public School 102.
"The girls were happy kids," said Mr. Espinosa, who is 20. "They played outside on tricycles. The mother planted flowers."
Mr. Wu, who speaks little English, is said to be cooperating with detectives, speaking Cantonese through a translator. The police said he had told them that he bought a knife on Monday after voices told him he had to kill his family before the Chinese New Year, which begins today.
On Thursday at 11 A.M., the police said, he beat his wife, apparently with a hammer, and stabbed her repeatedly with the knife before slashing the throat of his youngest daughter.
He then changed clothes and walked to his daughter's school to pick her up, the police said. When they returned home, he slashed her throat, officers said.
Mr. Wu was charged with three counts of intentional murder, three counts of murder by depraved indifference and one count of possession of a weapon. He was to be arraigned last night in the Criminal Court Building in Kew Gardens. District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens said that if Mr. Wu is convicted, he faces a prison sentence of 25 years to life.
"This is a terribly tragic case," Mr. Brown said at the news conference, "not only because of the vicious and mindless killing of a young woman and her two defenseless children, but because it has occurred on the eve of the Chinese New Year -- on the eve of that which would otherwise be an occasion of great joy."

HEADLINE: Top Futures Regulator Quits; Clinton Can Name 3 to Panel

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Wendy Gramm resigned as chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission yesterday, clearing the way for President Clinton to appoint a majority of the five-member body that regulates the nation's futures markets.
William Albrecht, a member of the commission since 1988 and a former economics professor at the University of Iowa, was named acting chairman by the other members of the commission. He will serve in that post until the President appoints a chairman. Mrs. Gramm had headed the commission since 1988. 
 Mrs. Gramm's departure, coupled with the resignation earlier in the week of Fowler West, leaves the commission with only three members. Mr. Albrecht's term expires in April, giving President Clinton the opportunity to appoint a majority of the five members within the first few months of his term.
 
3 Democratic Openings
 The two other remaining members, Sheila Bair and Joseph Dial, are Republicans, while Mr. Albrecht is a Democrat. The rules require that no more than three commissioners be from one political party, clearing the way for the President to make three Democratic nominations.
The commission under Mrs. Gramm's leadership successfully fought off an attempt by the Securities and Exchange Commission to gain regulatory control of stock index futures. That Congressional decision was strongly supported by the futures exchanges, but they were disappointed earlier this month when the commission voted to exempt over-the-counter trading of currency and interest rate swaps from regulation without providing a similar exemption for similar products traded on futures exchanges.
It is likely that the futures exchanges will press for appointment of commissioners who might be willing to change that decision, while the large banks and brokerage firms that dominate the swaps markets will be looking for regulators who would not upset the previous decision.
 
Gramm Defends Record
 Mrs. Gramm, who holds a doctorate in economics from Northwestern University, was an official in the Office of Management and Budget before being appointed to the commission by President Reagan. She did not disclose any employment plans.
"I have worked to assure that our regulations measure up to sound economic analysis," she said in announcing her departure, which had been expected. "We've followed the philosophy that consumers are best served by free market innovation and competition, not paternalistic government."

SOUTHWESTERN BELL CORP. (N)

 BODY:
The Southwestern Bell Corporation, the regional Bell company for Texas, Arkansas and some Midwestern states, attributed its fourth-quarter earnings growth of nearly 11 percent to the "outstanding" performance of its local-phone business, which provides the majority of its revenue.
It posted a record increase in the number of telephone lines, adding 405,000 lines in 1992, compared with 293,000 in recession-weakened 1991. The total is 12.8 million lines. 
 The company also benefited from a strong performance by Telefonos de Mexico, the Mexican national carrier in which Southwestern Bell owns a 10 percent stake. Mexico, which adjoins Southwestern Bell's main territory of Texas, has been growing rapidly.
Southwestern said its wireless telephone business was growing rapidly. Cellular telephone customers totaled 1.4 million, an increase of 453,000. The year before, Southwestern got only 293,000 new wireless-phone customers.

HEADLINE: New-Home Starts Rose Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Builders broke ground for new homes in December at a pace 5.5 percent faster than in November, the Government said today, ending a year in which housing starts posted their first advance since 1986.
The 1992 total of 1.2 million represented an 18.5 percent increase from 1991 that helped lift the economy out of recession. 
 Yet housing starts, the effects of which ripple broadly through the economy, remain far below the 1.8 million of 1986, the year in which an overhaul of the tax code made real estate investment less attractive.
While genuine, the 1992 increase is "certainly nothing like we had in the past," said Patrick J. Moriarty, chief investment officer for Bank Julius Baer in New York. Analysts also cautioned that further gains were being jeopardized by continued sluggish growth in jobs, a factor that limits confidence and incomes.
 
Optimism, and Wariness
 Indeed, the Labor Department today reported a second straight rise in first-time claims for unemployment insurance, which suggested that the lengthy downtrend in new claims was flattening.
On five occasions during the 1970's, when demographic factors were more favorable than today and the Federal Government was providing huge subsidies for low-income apartments, the United States built two million or more dwellings in a year.
Last month's gain, to an annual rate of 1.302 million, was the biggest since December 1991. It was spread across all regions but the West and was aided by rebuilding of homes, mainly in Florida, damaged by hurricanes. It was a better performance than analysts had expected since much of the country suffered severe December weather.
Still, analysts noted, after the 1981-82 recession, housing starts soared some 60 percent in 1983.
In the week ended Jan. 9, 361,000 new jobless claims were filed, 17,000 more than in the preceding week. On a four-week average, which many economists view as a more accurate gauge than weekly numbers subject to big gyrations, claims edged up to 331,750, from 331,500 in the Jan. 2 week.
The latest week's claims were also the highest since just before Thanksgiving.
"The data confirm that the improvement in the job market will be gradual," said Marilyn Schaja and Christine Schneider, economists at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The biggest rises in claims were 25,618 in California, 18,791 in Tennessee and 16,708 in Michigan. The biggest declines, on the other hand, were smaller than 1,500 -- in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Indiana.
The gain in housing starts included some rebound in the long-depressed multifamily sector, but specialists were skeptical that this signaled a turnaround.
"There's no indication that things are fundamentally better in multi," commented David Seiders, economist for the National Association of Home Builders. He also expressed concern about a failure so far to renew the tax credit for low-income housing, an important support for the market that has expired.
In December, the rate of housing increase was 68,000 -- 40,000 in single-family homes, 8,000 in buildings with two to four units, and 20,000 in buildings with five or more units, the Commerce Department said.
The single-family pace was 1.1 million, up 3.7 percent, bringing the gain for the full year to 22.6 percent.
Today's report also showed a 7 percent December gain in permits for future construction, to an annual pace of 1.2 million. But specialists have come increasingly to believe that permit issuance is a poor predictor of activity.
By region, starts in December jumped 32.7 percent in the depressed Northeast, and rose 7.9 percent in the Midwest and 4.3 percent in the South. The West recorded a 4.9 percent drop.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Lower on Fears Over Level of German Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark and settled weaker against most other major currencies yesterday amid fears that German interest rates would not be lowered soon.
The dollar slumped to 1.5915 German marks, from 1.6144 on Thursday, in late afternoon trading in New York. Earlier in London, the dollar traded at 1.5970 marks, down from 1.6158 late on Thursday. 
 Gold prices fell 60 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where gold for current delivery settled at $328.60 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York reported a late price of $328.85 an ounce, off 70 cents.
 
 
Too Early to Ease
 The dollar opened modestly lower in the United States but managed to stay above 1.60 marks overseas. It barely took notice of mixed economic data but plunged around midday on heightened fears that the German central bank would not lower rates.
A regional Bundesbank president was quoted as saying that it was too early to ease German rates. His comments, coming after other similar remarks by German monetary officials, brought more support to those who see the dollar continuing to slide.
Uncertainty as to what measures President Clinton will take to trim the United States deficit and stimulate the economy were also weighing on the market, traders said.
"In the short term, the dollar looks a bit bearish in response to uncertainty about Clinton, Iraq and German rates," said Peter Connolly of Wells Fargo.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.15 yen, up from 124.68 on Thursday. It dipped in London, settling at 125.10 yen. In New York, it settled at 125.14 yen, up from 124.88 yen late on Thursday.
In London, the British pound settled at $1.5280, above $1.5185 late on Thursday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.5305 from $1.5224.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Thursday quotes, included: 1.4600 Swiss francs, down from 1.4787; 5.3830 French francs, down from 5.4565; 1,465 Italian lire, down from 1,479, and 1.2823 Canadian dollars, down from $1.2850.

HEADLINE: Q & A

 BODY:

Valuing Nonpublic Stock

Q For purposes of an employee stock option plan, how is stock in a corporation valued if it is not publicly traded?
 
 FRED STURUP, WOODSIDE, QUEENS 
 A There are four principal ways to value stock that is not priced by market forces, said Eric Scoones, a principal of William M. Mercer Inc., benefits consultants. "The first is to have an outside appraisal done about once a year," he said. "It has the advantage of taking into account all the facts and circumstances in the value of a company, but some people consider it to be subjective."
Another way consists of book value. According to Mr. Scoones, "book value, the company's assets minus its liabilities, is easy to measure, but may not be an accurate reflection of the company's true market value."
Then there is a formula intended to mirror the market value of a company. For example, this value may be a multiple of the company's total earnings, often based on the multiple used to value publicly traded companies. "Sometimes companies don't use a formal method at all," Mr. Scoones said. "The board of directors simply states what it believes to be the market value of the stock."
 
Buying Foreign Stocks
Q What are the benefits of investing in foreign stocks?
 
 AZARIAH ESHKENAZI, FOREST HILLS, QUEENS
A "Significant values exist for investors in foreign stocks," said Michael A. Dritz, president of Smith New Court Securities. At some points in the cycle, stock markets in other countries may be a better investment than in the United States. For example, if the United States market has been strong and the Swiss market has been weak, it may be advantageous to switch out of United States equities and into Swiss equities.
"Dealing with other currencies can be both a positive and a negative," Mr. Dritz said. "Whenever you buy a foreign stock in any form, there is a currency risk involved. But because of economic considerations, you might want to diversify some of your holdings into nondollar-denominated equities."
 
Differences in Insurance
Q What are the advantages and disadvantages of whole life insurance, as opposed to term insurance?
 
 JAN ANDERSON, WASHINGTON
A Whole life insurance, which is permanent insurance designed to provide coverage for a person's lifetime, typically has a fixed premium and death benefits that do not change. "A whole life policy has a cash value -- a savings element -- that you may borrow against or will be paid to you if you surrender the policy," said Diane Coffey, a spokeswoman for the American Council of Life Insurance. "However, whole life insurance premiums are generally more costly than term insurance premiums."
Term insurance, considered to be temporary insurance protection, does not have a cash value. "The premium rises every time the policy is renewed, which most often is annually," she said. "Term insurance is particularly attractive for people who need life insurance for a limited period or who cannot afford to pay whole life premiums."

HEADLINE: Munis: Popular, Tax Free and Tricky

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
With as much as $15 billion worth of municipal bonds being redeemed this month by the states, cities and public authorities that sold them, and almost $7 billion worth of new municipal bond issues coming to market, many investors are focusing their attention on these tax-exempt securities.
It is their freedom from Federal income taxation, and in some cases their exemption from state and local taxes as well, that accounts for the popularity of these investments. Millions of Americans, and particularly people who invest for income rather than growth, include municipals in their portfolios. 
 Among them is Jerome Rabkin, an executive at a Long Island pharmaceutical wholesaler. Several weeks ago, he bought $25,000 worth of New York City bonds that expire in the year 2000, continuing his efforts to stagger the maturities of his holdings.
"Because I'm in the 31 percent bracket, the taxable yield equivalent is much higher than the actual tax-exempt yield," he said.
 
What Exemption Means
 Mr. Rabkin bought the New York bonds at a yield of 6.05 percent, but because he will pay no tax on the income, they are worth as much to him, a resident of New York State, as a fully taxable bond issued by a corporation and paying about 9.50 percent.
At the end of 1992, the yield to maturity of the Bond Buyer municipal bond index was 6.39 percent, compared with interest rates of 7.20 percent for the Salomon Brothers index of medium-term corporate issues and 7.40 percent for 30-year Treasury bonds. However, some one-year municipal bonds yield as little as about 3.25 percent.
Despite their advantages, many investors find that the pricing system for municipals is too complex for them to understand.
"Don't be put off by the fact that superficially municipal bonds seem to be a much more complicated business than rolling over a C.D. at your local bank," said Heather L. Ruth, president of the Public Securities Association."
However, munis are not for everyone. For one thing, the return of the money invested is not guaranteed by the Federal Government the way up to $100,000 in a bank account is. If you sell a bond before maturity, the market price could be lower than your purchase price. The reason is that when interest rates rise, the prices of municipal bonds and other fixed-income securities decline to bring the yield up to current levels.
Conversely, when interest rates fall, the value of the bonds rises and they can be sold at a profit. Unlike the tax-free nature of interest earned by municipal bonds, the profits on a such a sale are subject to capital gains tax.
What is more, there is always the possibility -- although a slim one -- that a municipal bond issuer will default and fail to pay principal or interest when it is due. The Washington Public Power Supply System defaulted on $2.25 billion in bonds in 1983, the largest default in history. Even New York City defaulted on some of its short-term obligations in 1977 until the courts compelled city officials to pay up. To cover such eventualities, many municipal bonds are backed by insurance.
"Credit quality is something that investors should continue to be concerned about," said Howard D. Sitzer, director of municipal bond research at Greenwich Money Management. "The appropriate advice is that people should diversify."
But a more common risk for muni bond buyers is a redemption, or call, by the issuer before the bonds reach maturity. The terms of most bonds authorize such calls, and issuers make them when their bonds are paying a high interest rate at a time when rates have moved significantly lower.
That is what is happening now, and it explains the high level of redemptions this month. The holders of called bonds get the full face value of their investment -- and sometimes more -- but when they reinvest the money, they will have to accept a lower rate of return.
Investors can acquire municipal bonds in several ways. They can invest in individual issues, usually in $5,000 denominations, by purchasing bonds from dealers who make their profit on the spread between the wholesale and retail prices. Many dealers, however, require minimum investments from their customers of $10,000 to $25,000.
Or they can invest in municipal bond funds, which are like other mutual funds, with relatively low minimum investment requirements and professional management of a group of diversified securities. Funds have no specific maturity, so that there is not a set expiration date when shares must be redeemed. Instead shareholders receive the net asset value on the day they sell.
Unit investment trusts and closed-end funds are other types of municipal bond products, both also widely available with a relatively small minimum investment.
Unit trusts contain a fixed portfolio of tax-exempt bonds and mature at a specified time, when the units are redeemed. And closed-end funds are managed investment companies holding a variety of municipals and traded on a stock exchange, with prices determined by supply and demand.
 
Classifying the Bonds
 Municipal securities can also be classified in one of two basic categories. General obligation bonds, which must be voter-approved, are backed by the issuer's full taxing and revenue-raising power. Revenue bonds finance specific projects like hospitals, airports and bridges -- and their principal and interest are secured only by the income earned by these particular facilities.
"Historically it was felt that general obligation bonds were safer, but we've seen during the 80's that some municipalities passed legislation prohibiting the raising of property taxes," said Samuel R. Fales, vice president of Legg Mason. "A lot of professional portfolio managers now prefer looking at the flow from a particular revenue source because they can look at the financials."

HEADLINE: Too Many Specialists

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Only 12 percent or so of American physicians are generalists, the rest specialists. In part this explains the high cost of medicine in America. 
 In Europe's socialized countries, 30 percent of doctors are generalists, and the cost of medicine is about 8 percent of gross national product.
About 80 percent of what's medically wrong with Americans is rather ordinary stuff. That is to say, in the United States we've developed a medical system of specialists, who do ordinary things at very special prices.

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks for Companies in Puerto Rico Don't Help Islanders

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Trade Pact Threatens Puerto Rico's Economic Rise" (front page, Jan. 3) implies that Puerto Rico's economy continues to benefit from Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, which exempts United States corporations from paying taxes on profits earned in Puerto Rico. 
 However, these companies employ few Puerto Ricans, and 936 has done little lately to improve the island's economy or quality of life. Only 12 percent of the work force is employed by companies benefiting from 936. These companies receive a $3 billion annual tax break from the Federal Government under 936, meaning Washington provides a $100,000 subsidy for each 936 job.
These tax credits are based on profitability, not the number of jobs created. Because industries such as pharmaceuticals are not labor intensive, they do little to create the vast number of jobs and training opportunities envisioned. Instead, industries have used 936 to exempt some of their United States income from taxation. Meanwhile, the island's per capita income, at $6,000, is lower than that of any state and falling.
The North American Free Trade Agreement will not have a significant impact on the more than 600 corporations that benefit from 936. Many of these -- especially the pharmaceuticals -- are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and cannot manufacture their products elsewhere in the Caribbean. They will not leave, with or without the trade agreement or elimination of 936.
Puerto Rico will benefit from elimination of section 936. It is time to replace outmoded economic blueprints with a strategy for today, providing United States companies with compelling reasons to operate in Puerto Rico, while offering real training and employment opportunities to an able work force. Such strategies should include a tax credit to wages and real investment as in the enterprise zone proposals before Congress.
Once Puerto Rico is a state, special tax treatments will no longer be needed.

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks for Companies in Puerto Rico Don't Help Islanders;
Repeal Is Dangerous

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Trade Pact Threatens Puerto Rico's Economic Rise" (front page, Jan. 3) states that the North American Free Trade Agreement, if approved by Congress, will encourage United States companies in Puerto Rico to take advantage of even lower wages in Mexico. 
 As a result, you state, Puerto Rico will become more reliant on the benefits of Internal Revenue Code Section 936, which exempts United States corporations in Puerto Rico from paying taxes on the profits they earn on the island. Even this tax advantage, you state, is threatened because the Clinton Administration has promised to reduce the huge Federal budget deficit. Congress and the Treasury Department, you report, have shown interest in proposals to abolish or reduce Section 936 exemptions, which could raise as much as $26 billion a year in tax revenues.
Puerto Rico is not just another part of the United States, to be affected by measures aimed at balancing the Federal budget. Puerto Rico is the most vital United States Army and Navy stronghold in the Caribbean, with one of the largest United States naval bases.
The United States must keep Puerto Rico's economy healthy and stable, free from the ruinous economic and political instability that repeal of or amendments to Section 936 could bring to Puerto Rico.
It won't be easy for an island like Puerto Rico, small, overpopulated and lacking natural resources, to establish by itself a solid and stable economic base. It will need help. It must attract outside investments by providing maximum incentives.
We are not getting something for nothing. Nor do we intend to continue being beggars of the Federal Government.

HEADLINE: World Bank Keeps Improving Its Approach

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Before We Let World Bank Squander More" (letter, Jan. 6), Deborah Moore, Bruce Rich and Lori Udall of the Environmental Defense Fund are misguided in their argument that the United States should not support the World Bank's International Development Association's $18 billion replenishment. 
 Worse, their attempt to make the development association a whipping boy for what they perceive as poor project policy at the World Bank threatens to transfer the burden to the world's poorest people, who are desperate for programs and projects to improve their lives.
The authors cite "Effective Implementation: Key to Development Impact," a World Bank report whose task force I headed. The authors have misread this report. It says that about one-third of the projects do not live up to the bank's standards in implementation; but it also says that projects need to meet a minimum 10 percent economic rate of return to be deemed satisfactory.
Many projects have not reached this target, but have been of considerable value to developing countries in building institutions and other benefits. Many others may still yield a positive rate of return, especially as efforts to improve performance continue after construction is complete.
The report notes that the percentage of projects not meeting the bank's rigorous criteria doubled in the last decade. But it also notes that much of this can be attributed to difficult world economic conditions in the 1980's -- the debt crisis, the global slowdown in growth, persistently low commodity prices. Many of the assumptions once thought reasonable turned out to be too optimistic, a fate that has befallen many investments -- not only those in developing countries or those supported by the bank.
The bank's criteria for and record of financing successful projects compare favorably with those of any other development agency. Our report is part of the bank's self-assessment. It should be seen as telling evidence that the institution is not complacent, but continuously seeks to improve.
Lewis Preston, president of the bank, has said the report underscores the bank's commitment. The report and its reception by the World Bank, far from an argument against supporting the International Development Association, should assure supporters that the development association remains concerned that the resources entrusted to it are used prudently.

HEADLINE: Paying for Health, The German Way -- A special report.;
Medical Care in Germany: With Choices, and for All

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 22

 BODY:
If the most critical problem in providing national health care is getting control over rapidly rising costs, as President Clinton has often said, he may find some intriguing ideas in the German health care system, which offers coverage to all at a much lower price than Americans pay.
Germany's much-admired system of health care, provided through nonprofit but private "sickness funds" that are legally mandatory for nearly 90 percent of the population, leaves patients with freedom to choose their own doctors and their own hospitals, and freedom from almost all medical bills. 
 Germans spend only about half as much per person on health care as Americans do, $1,486 in 1990 for Germany, compared with $2,566 for the United States. As a percentage of gross national product, however, it was 14 percent for the United States in 1992 and a little more than 8 percent for Germany. In 1990, the G.N.P. comparisons were 12.1 percent for the United States and 8.1 percent for Germany.
American health experts and politicians have flocked here in recent years to try to learn how they could apply at home what they see here. But they have found little that could simply be copied from a country with different cultural traditions.
Visiting a German doctor's office or hospital is much like visiting a good one in the United States. Many German hospitals are regarded as among the best in the world, and few have the crowded emergency rooms and waiting areas that are common in urban American hospitals because people have no other source of medical care. Neither do they have to increase bills for insured patients to cover those who cannot pay, because in Germany insurance covers virtually everybody, including foreign workers and asylum-seekers.
For years, the German Government has tried to keep medical expenditures from growing faster than the economy as a whole, not so much by limiting benefits as by pressing drug makers, doctors and hospitals to contain fees, an approach that has worked fairly well.
The biggest savings have come from Government-mandated programs that brought down the prices of German pharmaceutical products, once the highest in Europe, by ordering insurance funds to pay only what generic drugs cost.
Doctors administer their own payments from the health insurance system, and since 1985 they have agreed to annual caps on total payments, which they share depending on the number of treatments performed.
In another effort to curb costs, and to counter what is generally seen as a surplus of physicians, doctors have been told that from now on they would have to retire, as far as the sickness funds were concerned, at age 68. New practices can only be set up in localities where the Government agrees there is a need for them.
The restrictions have stirred some unhappiness among doctors. German general practitioners earn an average of $95,565 before taxes, which puts them among the country's highest earners, but their incomes have not risen as fast as average wages over the last two decades.
"Many people go into the medical profession with expectations that are too high," said Dr. Karsten Vilmar, head of the national physicians' association in Cologne. "But these kinds of limitations seem to us to violate the constitutional guarantees on professional freedom."
Another factor in keeping costs down is that malpractice suits are less common in Germany than in the United States, and so are extraordinary life-prolonging measures for patients judged to be terminally ill. "If an elderly patient is clearly dying of natural causes, I treat her at home," said Dr. Ursula Friedrichs, who like most of her colleagues still makes house calls. "I know a hospital stay wouldn't do any good."
According to a recent study by John K. Iglehart in The New England Journal of Medicine, "On the average, German hospitals have fewer pieces of high-technology equipment than most big urban hospitals in the United States." But Germany concentrates its most expensive medical technology in teaching hospitals like the University Hospital in Bonn, where the basic daily room rate can be as high as $400 -- but remains far below American rates.
 
A Mounting Demand
 Still, with a mounting demand for medical services, costs have been soaring here too, putting the insurance funds billions of dollars in the red last year. To try to bring costs under control the Government, with a determination worthy of Otto von Bismarck, the Chancellor who expanded the sickness fund system in Prussia 110 years ago to keep the Socialists at bay, has recently run roughshod over the lobbies of doctors, dentists, hospital administrators and drug manufacturers, all of which are seemingly far less powerful here than they are in Washington. A law that went into effect Jan. 1 imposed more across-the-board reductions in the price of most medicines, tightened the caps on doctors' fees, and changed the way hospitals are paid in ways devised to encourage efficiency and lower costs.
 
How Things Work
Some Choices, Some Limits
 Germany's system bears little resemblance to the state-run system of cradle-to-grave national health care the British adopted after World War II. It is also very different from the American health-insurance system, which leaves some 35 million people uncovered.
The main difference between the German system and the American one is that most Germans have no choice about whether to join a health insurance plan, and no problem finding coverage, either. Unless they are either very poor or pretty well off, the law requires them to become members of one of 1,147 "sickness funds" in the country. Some of the funds are connected to private employers, while others are quasi-public institutions.
The funds are supposed to break even, and each one sets a monthly premium rate as a percentage of a wage-earner's monthly salary. The rates among the funds now vary between 8 percent and 16.8 percent of salary, and have reached a historically high national average of 13.1 percent. The premiums are shared equally by employer and employee and paid by payroll deduction. The rate is the same for single and married wage-earners, with or without dependents, in any given sickness fund.
"Everybody knows exactly how much health insurance costs, and when the figure climbed above 13 percent, everybody in the system knew they had to get costs under control or the public would be after them," said Uwe E. Reinhardt of Princeton University, an economist who is an expert on the German system.
Nearly all employers are required to participate, including small businesses and low-wage industries, which in the United States often say they cannot afford to offer health benefits.
The funds cover not only workers and employees but retirees and people on welfare. Government agencies pay the premiums for the elderly and the indigent, as well as for the three million Germans now out of work. Changing jobs, or losing them, does not mean losing insurance coverage, even for a minute.
 
Never See a Bill
 Germans who have the basic, mandatory insurance never see their doctor or hospital bills. Starting this year, most of them have to pay more for medicine, but only up to a maximum of 7 marks -- less than $4.50 -- every time a prescription is filled.
Hospital patients must pay only $6.80 a day in western Germany, and $6.25 in the formerly Communist eastern part, and only for the first 14 days -- after that, even this charge is dropped.
"All I had to do was fill out a health care coupon from my sickness fund and present it to the doctor," said Mrs. Marianne Wettlauffer, 68, who had a slight heart attack several years ago and also spent six weeks in a rehabilitation cure in the Black Forest. All but a nominal amount was paid for by her sickness fund.
Her husband, Hellmut, 68, also had a heart attack 10 years ago, while he was a Government employee. His current care, too, costs him nothing out of pocket, though he supplements his Government pension plan with an inexpensive private policy that provides additional benefits like private hospital rooms.
Their physician, Dr. Friedrichs, has a small second-floor practice in a modern building in Bad Godesberg. From the small waiting room to the two consulting rooms, every room is white and antiseptically modern. Dr. Friedrichs takes privately insured patients as well as those in the sickness funds.
The private patients bring in bigger fees, but the funds provide the bread and butter, with a minimum of administrative headache, she said. "I get the payment automatically when I turn in the coupon, with the services performed marked on it," she said.
Germans who earn more than $40,000 a year ($29,450 this year in the formerly Communist eastern part of Germany, where wages and salaries are still lower) are not required to buy health insurance, but almost all of them -- about 6.3 million people -- purchase it anyway.
Because 88 percent of the population is covered by the sickness funds, risk is more evenly distributed among them than in the United States, and private insurance is also relatively cheap by American standards.
 
Containing Costs
Price Rollbacks And Limits on Fees
 How to reduce waste and inefficiency has been a preoccupation of German Governments since the mid-1970's. Three years ago, changes were put into effect that were supposed to put the health system on a secure financial basis for the next century. Sickness funds were ordered to pay for generic drugs only wherever possible, dental benefits were curtailed and hospitals were directed to increase efficiency.
But costs kept rising anyway, much faster than the rate of inflation or the funds' income from premiums. Either the rates had to be raised or costs had to be cut. And for German politicians, raising health premiums was about as desirable as raising taxes.
Since the system is set up to be self-financing, the German Government did not bail out the funds with taxpayers' money. Instead, it enacted a draconian new law that went into effect on Jan. 1, with the backing of all the major political parties.
Among other new controls on the pharmaceutical industry, the law mandates an across-the-board reduction of 5 percent in the price of most nongeneric medicines sold in the western part of the country this year, and a price freeze through 1994. In the poorer east, the law requires all medicine to be sold at a 20 percent discount.
The law also reduces orthodontists' fees by 10 percent, mandates that hospital fees rise during the next two years no faster than incomes, and bars clinics or private practices from buying expensive new "major equipment" without Government approval.
 
Charges for Weekends
 The law eliminates the traditional practice of reimbursing hospitals' costs and letting them bill the funds at a daily rate -- a practice that, many doctors concede, often led to admissions on Fridays, so hospitals could collect fees over the weekends even though no treatment was given, and discharge 10 days later on Mondays for operations that need only have taken a few days.
By 1996, German hospitals and physicians are to work out new fees based on the procedure, not the length of stay.
To hold down doctors' fees, the new law provides that reimbursements from the sickness funds rise only as fast as income from premiums. The funds pay doctors by the number of services they perform at a rate negotiated with the sickness funds, so by limiting the total "pot," the payments can be limited too.
 
What the Future Holds
Changing Needs In Aging Population
 In all, the Government says that the new law will save $6.5 billion this year and that premiums will not have to rise faster than inflation.
Government and health officials all insist that they do not want to be forced to delay care, the way the British National Health Service does for "elective" operations like hip replacements and heart transplants, with waiting lists that can delay them for years. Nor can they understand why Americans accept a system with what they see as Darwinian traits.
"We are not entitled, particularly with our German past, to decide who is entitled to survival and who is not," said Dr. Vilmar, who heads the national physicians' association. "All we have to ask ourselves is whether we really need a system that provides 100 percent coverage to everybody. There should be a system of perceptible cost-sharing."
He is among the critics of the new law who question if providers of medical care will ever have a strong reason to keep costs under control as long as most consumers never have to even think about how much their care costs.
Regardless of the new law, serious challenges will remain. As in the United States, for example, there is debate about how to cover the costs of long-term care like nursing homes for the growing population of disabled elderly.
Nursing care for the elderly at home is partly covered under the German system, but only up to four weeks and only if it is connected with an illness or accident.
Nursing homes cost about as much here as they do in the United States, and those who cannot pay usually have to sign over their assets or rely on help from welfare. Children with incomes can also be required to pay for nursing home care for their invalid parents.
The Labor Minister, Norbert Blum, has proposed a new state-run old age insurance plan to cover nursing home care, to be paid for by payroll deductions and by eliminating one national paid holiday. But opposition from churches as well as labor unions makes it doubtful whether the plan will become law by 1996, as Mr. Blum wanted.
Only one thing seems sure: with a rapidly aging population -- the proportion of those over 60 will grow by 19 percent by the end of the century, while the segment between 20 and 40 is shrinking by more than 12 percent -- the pressure from medical costs will continue to mount.

Programs That Work.

RECKONING
Drugs, the Cities, and the American Future.

 OVER the last 12 years, America's drug problem has erupted from a low-grade fever into a raging contagion. In 1981, when Ronald Reagan took office, the nation had about three million hard-core drug users; today, the figure is around six million. The number of deaths by drug overdose has soared, and drug-related homicides have pushed murder rates to record levels in cities across the country. All of this has occurred despite an eightfold increase in Federal antidrug spending. Clearly something has gone wrong.
Now the Democrats get their chance. During their years out of power, alternative drug strategies have piled up like Chinese menus under the door. Mathea Falco and Elliott Currie provide two new ones. Both authors criticize the Republicans for relying too heavily on law enforcement. Both reject drug legalization as too extreme an alternative. Both propose a new middle way for dealing with drugs. Otherwise, their approaches have little in common -- an indication of how sharply today's liberals can differ.
"The Making of a Drug-Free America: Programs That Work" comes with a seal of approval from the new Administration. Vice President Al Gore has publicly endorsed the book, and Ms. Falco was an adviser to Bill Clinton during the Presidential campaign. A visiting fellow at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Ms. Falco says she decided to write the book as an antidote to the widespread pessimism she has encountered about drugs. At a meeting of Midwestern business and civic leaders, she says, a newspaper publisher asked, "How can we do anything if we don't know what works? We'll just have to write off this generation until someone comes up with some answers." Determined to find them, Ms. Falco spent five years visiting schools, clinics, treatment centers and community groups all over the country. She found many programs that did seem to work, and her book provides a sort of consumer's guide for policy makers.
In Westchester County in New York, for instance, Ms. Falco came upon the county's Student Assistance Program, "one of the most promising approaches to preventing teen-age substance abuse." In the program, health professionals working full time offer students at some schools regular confidential counseling. Ms. Falco attended a session at one high school in a plush suburb. Here, beside a lake, flower beds and a parking lot filled with expensive cars, a group of ninth-grade girls discussed the "Monday morning oh-no's" -- the foolish things they did while high or drunk at weekend parties.
Jill B., as Ms. Falco calls her, a social worker trained in adolescent development, offered advice about how to resist peer pressure to drink or smoke dope at parties. "We would die without Mrs. B.," one of the girls tells Ms. Falco. "She's the only person we can talk to honestly." A 1989 study of Westchester high schools found that the rates of drinking and drug use were one-third lower among students at schools offering the program.
In an inner-city Detroit neighborhood, Ms. Falco toured streets with members of a church-led citizens' group called Reach (Reach Everyone Administer Care and Help). Going beyond the usual street patrols, Reach engaged residents in a number of volunteer programs, such as feeding the elderly, operating a day-care center and, especially, renovating houses. Using local sweat equity, Reach bought and repaired two dozen houses, some of them previously used by drug dealers. By thus galvanizing the community, Ms. Falco suggests, Reach has managed to banish open drug dealing from the area and reduce property crimes by 25 percent.
Ms. Falco is especially bullish on treatment. She writes glowingly of visits to a therapeutic community in Tucson, Ariz., an acupuncture clinic in Miami, an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Boston, and Matrix, a program for wealthy cocaine users in Beverly Hills, Calif. "Drug treatment remains our best hope for breaking the costly cycle of crime and addiction," she writes, "but we have not yet begun to meet the nationwide need for new programs." Noting that treatment is available for fewer than 15 percent of the nation's addicts, Ms. Falco would channel funds from prison construction and border patrols into rehabilitation centers and methadone maintenance clinics.
On this point, Ms. Falco is quite eloquent. The United States, she declares, needs a "new vision" of drug policy, one focused on "reducing demand, changing attitudes and engaging citizen participation." The question is, does her vision go far enough?
Ms. Falco, who directed the State Department's antinarcotics bureau under Jimmy Carter, foresees a very limited role for the Government. "The most promising strategies," she writes, "are coming not from Washington, but from communities working to find new solutions to their drug problems." Federal spending to combat drugs, now $12 billion a year, is quite enough, she believes.
Without more public support, though, it is unclear whether local initiatives can succeed. Despite the achievements of Reach in Detroit, for instance, citizens' groups have generally had limited success in sweeping drugs from their neighborhoods. Most rely on the dedication of a few energetic individuals -- a quality not easily replicated. As one organizer from Pasadena, Calif., tells Ms. Falco, "Apathy is our greatest enemy. . . . To get the whole neighborhood involved is very tough. I've got a hard-working small group and I have to pull the rest in by their hair." Even when successfully mobilized, neighborhood residents seldom prove a match for Uzi-toting crack gangs.
TREATMENT and prevention programs, meanwhile, have had uneven success, especially among low-income drug users. The Westchester Student Assistance Program is a good example. In 1988, Ms. Falco notes, some of the program's counselors began working at six homes for abused and delinquent children in Westchester County. Most of the children were poor blacks and Latinos. The results were decidedly mixed: half the homes recorded "substantial declines" in alcohol and drug use; the rest had "much smaller declines." For the most part, school-based prevention programs have been less successful in depressed urban neighborhoods than in prosperous suburban ones. Not only do inner-city youths face far more serious problems, but many are not even in school to begin with.
"We know that a drug-free America is within our grasp," Ms. Falco states at the conclusion of her book. Yet as she herself notes, drug abuse, while declining among the educated and well-to-do, is rising among poor minority groups. In 1991 more than one-third of all Americans who reported using drugs at least once a month were black or Hispanic. For policy makers, the problem of addiction in the inner city remains the primary challenge.
The inner city is the focus of "Reckoning: Drugs, the Cities, and the American Future." Its author, Elliott Currie, a research associate at the Institute for the Study of Social Change at the University of California, Berkeley, maintains that the United States really has two drug problems. One is drug use among the affluent. While not insignificant, he writes, this is a "manageable problem" that has been steadily decreasing for several years. The other problem is drug use among the "have-nots." And this, he says, "has grown malignantly in the face of the drug war -- and it is much farther from solution than it was when that war began."
In a previous book, "Confronting Crime," Mr. Currie argued that violent crime in the United States reflects the grinding poverty and inequality in our nation's cities. In "Reckoning," he makes a similar argument about drugs. The United States has the world's worst drug problem, he believes, not because of its affluence or permissiveness but because of "deeper structural problems in our economy and society." To support this view, Mr. Currie draws on a storehouse of statistical surveys, sociological monographs and ethnographic studies dating back to the 1950's. Then (as now), drug addiction was widely viewed as a psychological phenomenon; addicts, Mr. Currie tells us, were considered "maladjusted" individuals drawn from all sectors of society.
In the early 1950's, however, a team of New York University researchers began recording all the cases of adolescent heroin addiction that came to the attention of the courts and hospitals in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx. It then charted those cases by census tract. The overwhelming majority, the researchers found, were concentrated in Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant and other poor neighborhoods. For the first time, Mr. Currie says, scholars had "pointed clearly to the central role of social and economic forces in addiction." Since then, he adds, numerous studies have borne out the point: "The link between drug abuse and deprivation is one of the strongest in 40 years of careful research."
Class, not race, is the key factor. Thus a survey of more than 1,000 disadvantaged youths in Baltimore, Detroit, Cincinnati and Providence, R.I., found that 19 percent of the Irish young adults admitted using heroin regularly -- virtually the same proportion as blacks in the survey. Since deprivation is most widespread among minority groups in the inner cities, Mr. Currie says, drug abuse is most acute in those areas. In his view, crack struck with such force not just because it was cheap and plentiful, but because social conditions were ripe. The loss of traditional blue-collar jobs in the 1970's and early 1980's helped to create a pool of unskilled, uneducated Americans. Just when they needed help the most, the Reagan Administration sharply cut social programs. "Had we set out consciously to prepare the ground for a fast-moving drug epidemic, we could hardly have done a better job," Mr. Currie writes. Crack "was like a match thrown on dry tinder."
Oddly, Mr. Currie does not discuss alcohol, the nation's most widely consumed intoxicant. Middle-class Americans who abuse substances are far more likely to use alcohol than heroin or cocaine. By limiting himself to illicit drugs, Mr. Currie may have understated the extent of addiction among better-off Americans. Nonetheless, he makes a convincing case for the role of root causes in generating the nation's drug problem -- a perspective long out of favor in Washington.
Mr. Currie is less convincing when it comes to solutions. Dismissing conventional treatment and prevention programs as palliatives, he holds that "in the long run, dealing with America's drug crisis means attacking the conditions that breed it." To that end, Mr. Currie advocates a national employment policy, an increase in the minimum wage, an expansion of the Job Corps, increased health care for the poor, paid family leave, affordable housing and, not least, a reduction in social inequality. "Over time," he proclaims, waxing lyrical, "we can shift the social and cultural balance -- turning blasted wastelands where the dominant youth occupations are idleness, drug dealing and sporadic work in poor jobs into vital neighborhoods where most of the young are either in school or working at respected jobs with a visible impact on their community."
Such a utopian agenda is, at bottom, a prescription for doing nothing. In these belt-tightening times politicians will no doubt find Ms. Falco's approach more appealing. Still, one hopes they will consider Mr. Currie's views as well. "Reckoning" is a provocative book -- precisely what we need in this time of political transition.

THE BUBBLE ECONOMY
Japan's Extraordinary Speculative Boom of the 80's and the Dramatic Bust of the 90's.
By Christopher Wood.
210 pp. New York:
The Atlantic Monthly Press. $21. 
 ONLY in the Japan of the late 1980's would office workers and casual investors reach for their newspapers in the morning to check what golf club memberships are worth. More than any other published item (except perhaps for the news report that the land under the Imperial Palace had so swelled in value that it was worth more than all the property in Florida), the Nikkei Golf Club Membership Index took the measure of the financial insanity that until recently gripped Tokyo.
The reason the index attracted so much attention is that the club memberships were not about golf at all. They were about speculative crazes and, of course, behind-the-scenes national politics. For if you dug into the underbrush of a Japanese golf course, you were bound to find, along with lost golf balls, shady characters scheming with each other to enrich themselves, Japan's banks and the coffers of the country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Now with the bursting of the multitrillion-dollar speculative bubble that brought the stock and property markets to remarkable heights, the covers have been ripped away from some of the most sordid aspects of the close relationships that keep the Japanese economy ticking -- most recently, the ties that bind Japanese business, organized crime groups and the country's politicians.
Christopher Wood, a correspondent for The Economist, has turned the details of the schemes that underlay Japan's financial boom, and now its bust, into a gripping account of how the greedy and the corrupt were able to lead the blind. Throughout the 1980's, he recounts in "The Bubble Economy," the accepted wisdom in Tokyo was that the property and stock markets could not plummet, no matter how overvalued they became, because "Japan Inc. would never let it happen." In fact, "Japan Inc." is not nearly as monolithic as many, in the West as well as in Tokyo, would like to believe. And when the supports that were holding up the speculative boom got kicked out one by one, with a tightening of credit and a sudden ending to Japan's free-spending ways, the markets began to tumble.
The results, Mr. Wood shows, were startling. Mighty brokerage houses like Nomura Securities, which seemed invincible in the late 80's, began compensating their biggest clients for their sudden stock losses in order to preserve their most valued business relationships. The securities houses should be thankful they got caught at this; in time, their effort to manipulate the market on the way down (a lot harder than manipulating it on the way up) would have bankrupted them.
Similarly, the giant banks were caught with enormous bad loans on properties that were now worth a fraction of what they once were. The banks are still denying these losses, for fear of the consequences if the depths of their misjudgments became known. The Government has abetted them, making sure that they are not required to tell their shareholders or depositors the ugly truth. It has come out anyway, as some of Japan's mightiest institutions have been forced to merge or dump their worst holdings. "The Japanese banks' preferred approach has been to sit on their hands and literally do nothing," Mr. Wood notes. "This has the merit of preventing them from having to admit to a loss, which would mean wiping out capital."
Indeed, the careful plans and endless strategies that propelled Japan on the way up have been notably missing as it has fallen back to earth. In part, Mr. Wood says, this was because hope was allowed so often to overwhelm logic, as it did for life insurance executives and Government bureaucrats who confidently came up with implausible justifications for the stratospheric land and stock prices. In part, it was because the few oversight mechanisms Japan had, especially in the Ministry of Finance, were one with the banking and securities industries. In part, too, it was because the biggest beneficiaries were the politicians, who found ways to funnel huge amounts of the finance and property industries' profits toward their own causes.
The question is: Is Japan still deluding itself? Mr. Wood observes that "the Japanese establishment still clings to the comforting though naive notion that the excesses of the bubble economy -- the supposedly fringe world of the stock market, property market and assorted speculative nonsense, such as frenzied trading in golf course memberships and the like -- were somehow distinct and separate from the core industrial economy and therefore could not harm it. Unfortunately, this is not the case."
True enough. But for those outside of Japan there is a different "comforting though naive notion" at work, one that Mr. Wood does not discuss. It is the idea that somehow the United States can relax because the Japanese have run into trouble. At best, though, the United States has been given a brief respite, a few years perhaps, for the Clinton administration to revive American competitiveness. We should remember that in recent years Japan has survived every economic crisis that was supposed to level it, adjusting more quickly than anyone thought possible. The energy crises of the 1970's and the Plaza Accord of 1985, which revalued the yen in an effort to slow the export machine, come immediately to mind.
The fact is that while research and development funds are now scarcer in Japan because of the market losses, and while new factories are not being constructed at so frenzied a pace as before, Japan is still rebuilding its manufacturing sector faster than the United States is rebuilding its own. Desperate as Americans might be for a signal that they can stop worrying about Japan, the collapse of the bubble economy is not it. Japanese-style capitalism, despite its ugly side, still has more than a few things to teach us.
Mr. Wood emerges with some reassuring conclusions that Japan's financial system is converging with the rest of the industrialized world's -- that the endless stream of scandals is forcing a change. One can only hope that he is right, but so far the evidence is scant. In the past few months alone, court trials picking through the wreckage of some of the "bubble" companies have uncovered a far deeper nexus of cooperation among business, government and organized crime than anyone imagined.
Indeed, there are still many in Japan who, as Mr. Wood puts it, are "yearning for the golden days when stock prices could be supported by administrative decree or rank manipulation." They are also yearning to keep the forces of reform at bay as long as possible. But it will be years before we know if they have won out.

HEADLINE: The Reformation of a Street Preacher

BYLINE: By Catherine S. Manegold; Catherine S. Manegold is a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Al Sharpton was up on the stage, that familiar voice booming and his words streaming in a hot cascade over an audience of teen-agers, most of them black, who strained forward in their chairs. The Democratic senatorial primary was long since over. But Sharpton looked as though none of that had really registered. Two months after his defeat, he was still running. His speaking, handshaking, protest marching, celebrity bow-taking, back-room strategizing schedule was so busy that his youngest daughter, Ashley, who is just 5 and perhaps does not yet understand what makes her father run, had to ask, finally, "Does Daddy know yet that he didn't win?"
Nothing that small could ever stop Al Sharpton. 
 "Hey," he shouted to the packed auditorium at the John Marshall High School in Rochester on a cloudy afternoon. "There is nothing hip or slick about being ignorant. And there is nothing hip or slick about going around killing each other for no good reason."
The kids shouted back. Connected. He was right. They knew it. They were jumping in their seats, locked onto every word, driving the school monitors a little wild as they cruised the aisles. It was a losing battle. Kids who later would sit listlessly in classrooms were spinning and twisting, clapping each other on the back, interrupting "the Rev" with little spurts of glee and agreement.
Sharpton rocked back and forth, leaning toward the thousand or so faces, drawing them to him like a magnet. He pulled them all in talking about Malcolm X, today's repolished hero, and about how "an X on your cap" means nothing "if you've got zero in your brain." He admonished, cajoled and shared his life. "Everything I always tried to do -- they laughed at," he boomed in a baritone swept by the cadences of Pentecostal preaching. "That laughter made me harder. You have to believe in yourself and stand by yourself and trust yourself. Ignorance is easy. It's easy to talk bad. The hard thing is to try to lift yourself up."
Called to Rochester to talk some sense into these kids after a shooting last September, Sharpton arrived to play his new role of father, teacher, politician and wacky, inspirational disciplinarian. The students were jittery at first, waiting to check out "Reverend 911," the guy who always comes when he is called. School officials worried that just his presence might make matters worse. But the speech won them over.
Afterwards, Mary Gallina, a secretary in the school's guidance office, rushed toward him. "You were great," she told him. "If you get to just six kids, it will be worth it." Later, she turned to a stranger. "You hear so much about him," she said. "And his old reputation. He deserved that. So, you hear he's changing, but you just can't imagine it until you see him personally."
THERE IS A STORY that Al Sharpton tells, invariably to laughter, of how loud and long he hollered as an infant. "I yelled when I was hungry," he says. "I yelled when I was wet. I yelled when all those little black bourgeois babies stayed dignified and quiet. I learned before I got out of the maternity ward that you've got to holler like hell sometimes to get what you want."
Standing in a typical pose, his thick legs spread wide like braces beneath that famously capacious frame, his dark hands laced across his paunch and his soft chin tucked back in a way that can, at times, seem almost childish, the Rev. Alfred Charles Sharpton Jr. cuts a singular picture of pugnacity. Thirty-eight now, and working to reform an image that has made him internationally famous as a rabble-rousing pain in New York City's side, he is yelling, still. Modulation holds no interest, compromise no real allure. He has always wanted to be the thumb in the eye, the tack on the park bench, the lone voice calling: "No justice. No peace." His bumper stickers said as much during his grass-roots, $63,000 run for the United States Senate last year. Bold orange and green, they were unmistakably Sharpton, a glaring challenge to complacency.
Yet something was distinctly different about the Sharpton that New York and the nation saw during the primary season. He was still talking passionately about injustice. But he seemed softer, more focused and more intellectually polished. In his own words, that change was the essence of simplicity: "It was time," he says, "to bring down the volume and bring up the program."
Others saw a new sophistication in his performance and said it was time, finally, to bring him into the fold. "No question about it, he's matured" says Representative Edolphus Towns, a Brooklyn Democrat who is the former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. "He's been out there for so long that sometimes people think that he is older than he is. But when he started, he was literally akid." The primary, Towns says, showed the city an older, more seasoned politician and a man who had finally "learned to knock on the right doors." Just as important, it showed New York power brokers that Sharpton had something that many more traditional politicians lack: an uncanny ability to reach the poor and chronically dispirited, voters who otherwise would turn away from politics. "There is a real commitment there," Towns says. "I have a lot of respect for him. He paid a lot of dues. He was the one who shook the trees. Some of us were the ones to come by and pick up the fruit. He can relate. But instead of saying 'Burn, baby, burn,' he's telling them, 'Build, baby, build.' "
Since the election, Sharpton has pressed this new public perception of his goals. He went with Towns to meet with Edward J. Perkins, the United States's representative to the United Nations, to talk about Somalia. He daily devotes himself to meetings and telephone conversations with prominent blacks and appearances at some of the most high-profile political events. On the day Mayor David N. Dinkins made a televised appeal for an end to the running conflict between New York City's blacks and Jews, the mayor spotted Al Sharpton in a crowd of prominent city leaders and greeted him with a bear hug.
Some of that change is earned, arising from basic political arithmetic. When he held his own in televised debates and held his temper on the campaign trail, some voters scoffed. But 166,665 others pulled the lever with his name beside it, giving him about 15 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary and landing him third in a field of four, ahead of Elizabeth Holtzman, perhaps forever changing the idea that this man with flowing hair and an endless avalanche of angry prose would never do more than pose for the cameras: part street preacher, part buffoon, persistent claimant to the heritage of black rage.
The primary battle silenced many detractors, whites and Republicans among them, who found "the Rev" more dignified -- that was the word they used -- than the seasoned politicians he faced. As Robert Abrams, the Attorney General, Geraldine A. Ferraro, the one-time Vice Presidential candidate and Elizabeth Holtzman, the City Comptroller, traded barbs, Sharpton followed the Rev. Jesse Jackson's advice to "fly above the storm."
Everyone took note. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, after one particularly vicious debate, singled out Sharpton by favorable contrast, "Because he was positive, because he was mature." The other three candidates, the Governor concluded, "all got hurt" in their debate. Reflecting on that change, Representative Maxine Waters of California, who herself successfully balances activism and mainstream politics, says she, too, was surprised by his transformation. "He obviously made a decision to show how smart he really is."
Sharpton's longtime supporters do not see much change. They maintain that American politics shifted with the Rodney King verdict and the race-related police beatings exposed since. They say the political mainstream is moving in Sharpton's direction, not the other way around. "The 'political experts' gave him no chance at first," says C. Vernon Mason, a lawyer who has worked with Sharpton for years. "I think that what has changed is that other people have changed. Once Mario Cuomo praised him, that had a major impact on the other elected officials. Now Mayor Dinkins knows that he needs Al Sharpton to win his own election."
New Yorkers were certainly startled by his new, buffed image. They had lived so long with Sharpton's angry sound bites that most started the primary season with an image of him as an irresponsible, inflammatory, race-baiting agitator hungry for publicity. They saw him as devoid of grace, a bashing plug of a guy dashing about in a jogging suit and Martin Luther King medallion, more interested in winning air time than in healing racial wounds. They recalled his former link with the New Alliance Party, likening the group to a cult. To most New Yorkers, Sharpton was the guy it was always safe to hate, the real-life equivalent of the wild-eyed street preacher who wreaked havoc in Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities."
To the nation he was a nightmare image, the ultimate expression of New York's fall from the epitome of sophistication to a troubled urban madhouse. Overseas, the image was sour, too. During a trip to London in 1991 the Brooklyn-born Sharpton was introduced to the reading public as "The Bronx Beast" by a slightly confused tabloid press. Conservatives in the House of Commons glumly discussed blocking his entry altogether -- only to be forestalled by the Home Office.
Cornel West, who heads the Afro-American Studies Program at Princeton, describes Sharpton as "in process." That is true. Since the primary, Sharpton has been offered many maps to his own future, including running for City Council President, a post likely to be vacated if Andrew J. Stein runs for Mayor, or for a House seat. But he has loftier ambitions, pointing instead to the Senate primary in 1994. "I plan to continue my drive for statewide office," he says, "and to run against Daniel Patrick Moynihan for the United States Senate seat."
Even as he plots his future, though, he runs. A typical day includes a dozen stops or so at schools, union headquarters, Harlem restaurants and the offices of politicians. He meets with Mayor Dinkins, Towns, Representative Charles B. Rangel and other New York politicians, editors, radio personalities. As he works to extend his political reach, he visits with Italian-American, Jewish and Hispanic voters, too, and bones up on environmental, gay rights and other issues in which he admits he needs education. Almost everywhere, but particularly in Harlem, he is stopped for a handshake and a word or two, an autograph or a bit of advice. Some people simply stop to gape, like the woman in midtown Manhattan who screeched to a halt on her high heels and stuttered: "Well! Al Sharpton! You look . . . just-like-you-look!"
Sharpton takes it all in stride. When the votes were finally tallied, he walked away with 67 percent of the black vote statewide, 20 percent of the union households and 16 percent among Hispanic voters. He sees that as just the beginning.
"You know, they never will admit that I have a core of people, a basic group that is behind me," he says of the political establishment. "They said I had about 200 followers. But 200 people cannot cast almost 170,000 votes -- I don't care where you went to school."
ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT recognize it then, Al Sharpton's process of political rebirth began two years ago, at 1:30 P.M. on Jan. 12, with a sudden blow to the chest and a dull stab of pain as a steak knife with a five-inch blade was plunged two inches from his heart. For a moment, he was startled. He thought he had been punched.
"I felt something brush past," he remembers. "But when I looked down, there was a knife sticking out of my chest. Instinctively, I grabbed the knife out and that's when the air hit and I went down." He crumpled to his knees, then slumped forward on the sidewalk as his assailant, a drunken 27-year-old named Michael Riccardi was tripped up and pummeled before police could bring the situation under control. Sharpton was rushed off to Coney Island Hospital where he was listed in serious but stable condition. The assailant was later sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison, despite Sharpton's plea for leniency.
The attack came in Bensonhurst, a part of Brooklyn famous for the racial tensions that swirled around the death of Yusuf K. Hawkins, a black youth killed by a white mob in the summer of 1989. Sharpton had gone there, as he went most places, to stage an angry protest march accompanied by busloads of supporters, many of whom, the rumors went, provided their support only in exchange for money. (A former Sharpton aide testified in court that many young blacks were paid $5 each to show up at rallies.) More than 100 police had cordoned off a "frozen zone" intended to keep passions muted and Sharpton and his flock from harm. But Riccardi easily dove past the defenses.
Recuperating in the hospital, Al Sharpton suddenly found himself surrounded by some of New York's political elite. Mayor Dinkins, with whom he had always had strained relations, appeared at his bedside along with other prominent black leaders. To this eternal outsider, the laying on of hands of the establishment was strange and unsettling. "I'm always teasing Mayor Dinkins that I looked up and I thought I had died and gone to hell," he says with his deep, rolling laugh. "But I told the Mayor that I did not want violence because I didn't want to be remembered that way."
The person he did want to see was someone who for years has been both a mentor and a friend. He told his wife, Kathy Lee Jordan, a former backup singer for James Brown whom he met in 1979, that he wanted to speak to Jesse Jackson. The next morning, when Sharpton was wheeled out of the emergency room, the head of the National Rainbow Coalition was there to meet him. They talked at length about strategy, street protest and longterm goals.
Jackson's advice to calm down and spread a wider net went against Sharpton's grain. But he could not ignore it. "When somebody hits you two inches from your heart, you have to start thinking: 'Well, I could really die. How do I want to be remembered? Do I just want to be the guy who could vent?' You re-evaluate yourself."
Then, too, there is the inescapable fact of approaching middle age. "You get older," he says with a shrug. "I am 38 now. I am not 28. You begin to say: 'Our generation is in charge now, where is our base? Where is our power? If I stay one dimensional then where does the next generation go? They can either eliminate me or I can make room.' All of that ran through my mind."
It was time for a change, anyway. His street constituency had been dwindling for some time and his credibility was at a low ebb. The Washington Post, months earlier, dismissed Al Sharpton as a "professional provocateur," one of "an assortment of kooks, crazies and crackpots" given undue attention by the press and television. Other newspapers had turned against him, too. And by then, exhausted by Sharpton's steady stream of outrage, many blacks agreed.
AL SHARPTON doubtless will always have to answer for the old days. He was, even he admits, sometimes out of control, reveling in incendiary tactics that included picketing a meeting of city officials and prominent black activists with a sign accusing them of being "coons"; promising New York the most widespread civil disobedience the city had ever seen, and so stirring racial passions throughout the 1980's that, by 1990, a poll published by The Daily News found that 90 percent of whites and 73 percent of blacks in New York City believed that he was worsening race relations, not improving them.
It is the Tawana Brawley case, however, that has created the most lasting doubts about him. He aggressively sided with a 15-year-old black girl who claimed to have been raped, smeared with dog feces and abandoned by a group of white men. He took on the State Attorney General's office and indulged in a series of stunts and confrontations that, to many, reeked of self-promotion. He came across as both paranoid and opportunistic, willing to inflame race relations just to further his own fame. When a special grand jury dismissed the case as a hoax, he did not budge. To this day, he maintains that Tawana Brawley was raped, then abused by a judicial system that would not believe her.
Yet in talks with reporters after the case was dismissed, Al Sharpton showed the lengths to which he would go to manipulate the public and the press. In one instance, he acknowledged that his claim that he was taking Brawley into hiding for her own protection was nothing but a ruse. Instead, he merely took her out for an ice-cream cone.
There were other conflicts with the press. Once he lit out after a photographer in a rage. "That left the public image that I was out of control," he says. In that instance, he admits, he was.
Many New Yorkers saw a hint of that same recklessness just recently when Sharpton stood by Ralph Nimmons, a 25-year-old black man who was beaten in Crown Heights by Hasidim who accused him of burglary. Though the case was different, and Nimmons's injuries were indisputable, old fears of Sharpton's cynical manipulations resurfaced when Nimmons vanished the day he was due to appear before a grand jury. Yet Sharpton's basic point was one that few would dispute: No matter what Nimmons may have been doing in that alley behind Lubavitch World Headquarters, there was no justification for the beating he received.
For many, though, doubts about the "new" Sharpton linger, and old hints of impropriety still resonate. In 1989, he faced a 67-count indictment on charges that he stole $250,000 from charitable donors and cheated on his income taxes. He was ultimately acquitted of all 67 counts. Of three other taxcharges that lingered, two were dropped this month, after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of failing to file a tax return in 1986, for which he was fined $5,000.
Even after all that, however, his accounting still seems lax. His $2,200-a-week operation runs on funds from public speaking and cash donations at his weekly Saturday rally for the nonprofit National Action Network, a loose-knit political group of which he is president. Though he retains an accountant and insists that his books are in order, it is hard to see how the funds can be tallied and how he can keep track of his daily expenses. The phrase "cash flow" for him has a literal meaning. As he spins through town, many of his expenses seem to be met with a wad of bills that he pulls from his pocket.
Sharpton answers questions about his taxes, his activism and his rhetoric with barely a shrug. He is calm in the face of a possible jail sentence that still awaits him, after conviction on charges stemming from a 1987 protest. When confronted with questions about his legal troubles, he leans back in his chair and recounts case after case of civil rights leaders being held to a higher standard than white politicians. He volunteers that his stint as an informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation -- he insists he did it only in response to the bureau's attempt to frame him -- would be a badge of honor for other politicians, who might cite it as a mark of their respect for law and order.
He waves off his youthful indiscretions, too. Now, he says, he has a higher calling, to reshape black leadership. "The battle of the 60's and 70's was to get blacks into office," he says. "The battle now is to get the right blacks in office. Clarence Thomas got into the Supreme Court. But he is the most reactionary black jurist that I have ever seen."
Cornel West ranks Sharpton with a half dozen or so young men and women who will define black activist politics in coming years. But theirs, he believes, is a delicate challenge: to pressure their elders without either alienating the black establishment or being co-opted by it. "Al Sharpton has been much more critical of the black establishment than the power club has ever been," West says. "He is now one of our most progressive voices. But the best way for him to proceed is to keep some kind of pressure on. Because if he just becomes another insider, his impact will erode and people won't keep listening."
The risk for Sharpton is clear: how to yell and yet seem reasonable. Some critics doubt that he can do it. "People in Scarsdale and those places see him and say, 'Oh, he is just going to support that one group,' " says one political veteran who spoke on condition that his name be withheld. "That's the problem you have. When you look at the profile of him in whiteAmerica, they say he is just out for black people." Even many blacks, he says, would turn away if Al Sharpton got too close to victory. "He came and spoke and we gave him a standing ovation," he says of ameeting of the city's black leaship. "But don't confuse that with going out and voting for him. I think he ought to stay out there -- outside. That is the place for his kind of pot stirring."
Mostly, though, New York's black leaders back Sharpton up, and stiffly reject suggestions that his temper could flare and knock him back. "He was the only one who brought not only humor but substantive issues to the campaign," Rangel says. "When you consider the percentage of the vote that he got, the past has already been answered."
Some of his harshest critics do not care to speak of him at all. Neither Robert Abrams, the Attorney General who faced him down over the Tawana Brawley case, nor Charles J. Hynes, Brooklyn's District Attorney, would comment on his change, or lack of it.
Sharpton, meanwhile, revels in his new prestige. "Now, when I go to talk to Governor Cuomo or anyone at the state level," he said after the election, "I talk to them with an established state constituency. Before, I was talking to them based on the yelling of the crowd or whatever media was covering the issue. That doesn't mean that I'm going to get everything I want, but they can't just dismiss my point of view."
TO UNDERSTAND THAT point of view and its roots, one must look backward at Sharpton's youth, his teachers and his upbringing. Preaching, he says, is where his education started. "I think it was a natural, inborn thing. Like we say in church, your 'call to life.' "
Born in Crown Heights, he found his voice in the church before he could either read or write. He preached his first sermon, "Let not your heart be troubled," at the Washington Temple Church of God in Christ in Brooklyn at the age of 4. Those who remember him from his pre-teens invariably say that he was precocious, demanding and wired, a "groupie" in a dark suit who had a way of charming himselfright into the center of things. "I met Al Sharpton when he was about 12," Jesse Jackson says. "He was a child prodigy. It was obvious that he had special gifts. And he had a will to lead early on."
It was before that meeting, though, that Al Sharpton's life had changed in a way that would inform it always. He grew up in a classic nuclear family rising gradually up the economic ladder. His father, a contractor, moved the family from East New York in Brooklyn to a 10-room house in Hollis, Queens, and did so well that the kids were squired about in twin Cadillacs.
Suddenly, when Sharpton was 10, his father moved away and his world changed. "When he walked out, the money walked out," he says in his spartan Brooklyn office, talking on a cloudy winter afternoon over the constant ringing of a telephone. His mother took work as a domestic helper and moved her son and 13-year-old daughter, Cheryl, into a project. One year later, in 1965, the family moved to what Sharpton remembers as a "five-room ghetto apartment" in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. It was an experience that gave him a lasting sense of life's inequities.
"I knew that the world was better than this," he says. "In the project, I thought: 'No, I don't have to accept this. I know there's a better life. I know there's good schools. I know that the garbage man picks up garbage in some neighborhoods, because I lived in them.' So that really gave me indignation."
At the same time that his personal sense of outrage grew, his understanding of politics was developing at the knees of some of the nation's most prominent black leaders. Today, he unabashedly ticks off a list of men he adopted as surrogate fathers.
The first was Bishop Frederick Douglas Washington, who helped him find his way in the church and encouraged him to read theology. Then, still in his teens, he attatched himself to Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr., minister of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. In 1973, a year after Powell's death, he found another friend, the soul singer James Brown, whom he met after Brown's son died in an automobile accident. He worked with Brown through the 1970's, helping promote concerts and even styling his hair similarly.
"I did a lot of on-the-job training with people who are masters," he says. "To grow up under people like James Brown, Jesse Jackson and a promoter like Don King, I would have to be either retarded or totally incompetent not to learn something."
As an adult, he has tried to create the family core he lacked in his youth. Though his schedule gives him a seemingly endless string of long days, he talks proudly of his marriage of eight years, of his 5- and 6-year-old daughters and of the fact that his wife worked for years as an Army reservist to help pay the bills for his grass-roots politics. For several years, he and his family have split their time between a Crown Heights apartment and a house in Englewood, N.J., where they spend most weekends. This spring, however, he plans to move the family into a two-bedroom cooperative apartment in Crown Heights. He counsels his children not to follow in his footsteps. "The only advice I ever give my kids," he says, "is just don't come home with an activist. I've done enough of this for all of us."
THIS FALL AFTER THE primary, when Sharpton had to look ahead, he determined that he would, in the 60's tradition, keep on keeping on and worry later about his destination. His advisers form a bridge between his old life and his new identity. He still works with Mason and Alton H. Maddox Jr., the lawyers who worked with him (and became equally controversial) throughout the Bensonhurst, Crown Heights and Tawana Brawley periods. But he has added new names and faces, too, and stays in touch with them as he spins through town in his leased black Mercury Grand Marquis. On the road, he is in constant touch, a phone junkie forever linked to people like Spike Lee, local politicians, union leaders, the Mayor and a new legal and political adviser, Michael Hardy, an activist lawyer.
Between guttural, grunting phone conversations on diverse subjects, Sharpton's head sometimes drops back. He tends to fall asleep in an instant, snoring at high volume, making up for a schedule that seldom allows more than four or five hours of sleep a night. Then the car phone rings and he swings to attention, usually with a snort and a monosyllabic drawl: "Yeah. Hunh. Yeah. When?"
Day by day, he is moving fast through a new milieu. Cornel West says he was always impressed by Sharpton's perseverance and courage, but had not appreciated his intelligence. The two men met last April at Sylvia's, the famous Harlem soul food restaurant, to "chat" but ended up holding a five-hour marathon that Sharpton would later call the cornerstone of his re-education. The two men talked of politics, strategy and history, and West provided a reading list to help Sharpton fine-tune his political thinking. Among the books he recommended were "Who Will Tell the People? The Breakdown of American Democracy," by William Greider; "America: What Went Wrong?," by Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, and "Breaking Bread: Insurgent Black Intellectual Life," written by Cornel West and Bell Hooks, a feminist scholar and social critic.
Another new adviser is Patricia L. Irvin, a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, whom Sharpton credits with coaching him to relate to the "issues and fears" of the upper class. That coaching came only after Sharpton allayed Irvin's own fears. After meeting him during a luncheon hosted by the firm, Irvin later admitted to him that, as a black, she was nervous that he would come across as strident, foolish or ill-informed. Her first reaction, he recalls, was: "Oh, my God. He's the only black candidate running, and he's going to embarrass us because he's going to come on in here and say, 'No Justice. No Peace.' " Instead, he talked about the issues and the two quickly became friends.
Others have not been so easily won over. One prominent former elected official dismisses Sharpton's prospects, saying that the next generation of black leaders will come through more traditional political backgrounds. Some simply will never trust him, expecting him to go wild at any moment. "The guy symbolizes all the hatred and all the problems and all the anti-Semitism of New York City," says Noach Dear, a City Councilman who has savagely criticized Sharpton for his behavior in Crown Heights. "We will listen to him. But the degree of repentence must be equal to the degree of the sin. And Al Sharpton has been one of the city's worst sinners."
Sin. Outrage. The words pound a rhythm through Al Sharpton's days. "I am given to being flippant and just shooting from the hip," he admits. "I think I have been not looking at the broader picture sometimes and haven't been analytical enough. I've called the Mayor names and I've called other people names. But now I've learned."
Now he can picture a new future. Al Sharpton at 70. He stops a moment to think. "I'm writing my memoirs. I've been in the United States Senate for 20 years. And I am explaining to young people the days when we had to march to even get a prosecutor on a race case, something that is now automatic. I'm explaining to them that there was a day when I was very controversial and people had real emotional opinions of me. And I am wondering how I ever made it to 70."
His hair, he says, will still be long, but totally shock white. He pictures himself in the style of a British barrister, with that hair, that lasting trademark, a sign of distinction in the year 2024.

HEADLINE: ENDPAPER/LIFE AND TIMES;
Gunmen, $150 a Day

BYLINE: By Jane Perlez

 BODY:
On a misty July afternoon when I first arrived in the Somali bush town of Baidoa, two young workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross greeted me nervously on the veranda of their compound. A journalist, accompanied by a photographer with a bulging bag of equipment, was more than they wanted to cope with. We could stay the night but after that we were on our own. It had taken them weeks to gain the confidence of the suspicious Somalis who, with guns and no sympathy, lorded over this town they would later call the city of death.
In fact, our overnight hosts provided Fiona McDougall, the photographer, and me with a vehicle, four armed guards and a Somali translator, our essential tools for the next six months. We didn't have to go far to see what the Red Cross had been telling the world but few had chosen to believe. 
 Six months later, after tens of thousands had perished, humanitarian workers suffered from a more exasperating problem: too many journalists, with too much equipment and too much air time to fill. Suddenly, Somalia, a story that had come and gone in spurts -- an August wave of ghastly photographs, an airlift announced just before the Republican Convention, the United Nations flailing, Washington Congressmen hand-wringing -- was full blast.
WE KNEW THE SOMALIA STORY HAD arrived when the networks rolled into Mogadishu. The Marines and other American forces were coming, 28,000 of them -- nobody quite knew when -- and television had to be there to record the American-doing-good-for-the-starving-Somalis Christmas images. So about a week before the military waded ashore on the beach of Mogadishu, the airstrips suddenly got very busy. The bush planes that arrived every morning from Kenya with khat, the plant with amphetamine properties that Somalis use for their afternoon high, had some competition.
CBS was the first in, with a 707 bearing five tons of equipment, and an armada of light aircraft ferrying Dan Rather, and more than 40 reporters, producers and technicians. CNN, NBC and ABC were not far behind.
Where to house all the people and their planes full of satellite dishes, generators, phones, editing banks, sleeping bags and crates of bottled water? For a $17,000 deposit and the pledge that Mr. Rather could use his comfortable bedroom, the owner of the Shamu Guest House, rented his high-walled, triple-storied whitewashed building with views of the Mogadishu shoreline as CBS headquarters.
The place turned out to be perfect for television. When Mr. Rather was ready for a face-the-camera piece, a specially rented, theatrically painted "technical" would be wheeled through the front gate, its anti-artillery gun cocked at a provocative angle providing trouble-free but menacing atmospherics for the viewers back home.
A WORD ABOUT "TECHNICALS." AID workers in Somalia discovered early in 1991 that as clan warfare raged around them, they needed protection. So humanitarian agencies would rent souped-up jeeps, with outrider teen-aged gunmen from the bush -- "camel boys" -- as bodyguards. Wherever an aid worker went, his personal car, carrying several gunmen in the back seat, would be followed by a heavily armed, makeshift war machine, making a conspicuous two-car convoy.
There is some dispute among aid workers how the word "technical" came about. The pious say it was coined from the word used by some European armies for a self-contained military unit.
But probably more accurate is its derivation via expense accounts. Aid agencies found it difficult to describe to headquarters that they were renting, for up to $150 a day, gunmen to protect themselves and food deliveries. How would "gunmen, $150, daily rate," look on the monthly statements? So in suitable, vague bureaucratese, the gunmen and their vehicles were listed as "technical assistance," a euphemism that entered the Somali lexicon.
By Christmas week, when American buff-colored military trucks had replaced the gaily decorated Somali jeeps as the most ubiquitous vehicle on the Mogadishu streets, they were being called "American technicals."
THE MARINES AND THE journalists got to Mogadishu when the worst of the famine was over. Convenient words on American television aside, Somalis did not get miraculously better thanks to the Marines. Despite a lot of looting, the aid agencies and an American airlift from Kenya had pushed enough food into badly off areas in the months before so that by December the starvation had eased.
And by the year's end, the financial thrill of looting food had lost much of its attraction anyway. The price of rice in Mogadishu was probably lower than anywhere else in the world: 10,000 Somali shillings, or about $3 for a 50-kilogram sack, equivalent to about three packs of African-made Sportsman cigarettes hawked by street kids in the capital.
So with the looting of food no longer lucrative, the always opportunistic Somalis found other avenues for profiteering, namely manipulating the currency. Perhaps the most worthless money in the world, the Somali shilling doubled in value after the journalists and military arrived. With no banks, no law and no scruples a handful of Mogadishu money-changers made a killing.
"Sorry, Mr. McDonagh, the Somali shilling will be down to 3,000 by the end of the week," said Ibrahim, a money changer, to Mike McDonagh, the head of the aid agency Irish Concern, just before President Bush arrived. The shilling had been a steady 7,000 to the dollar; by mid-December it was 4,000.
The hike in the value of the shilling caused havoc to humanitarian agencies and also to journalists, who could better afford it.
One news organization -- The Times, as it happens -- paid $12,000 for one month's rent for a house -- without running water or electricity. If the basics had been working, the house might rent for $4,000 in New York City. On top of the rent came $100 a day for a tanker of water, $200 every other day for diesel fuel to run the tempermental generator and $150 a day for each car, with its driver, translator and pair of gunmen. The networks launched fleets of up to a dozen cars.
As the main thrust of the Marine action was about to end, and the cameras had moved on, what had been accomplished? The entrepreneurs had gotten richer. The camel boys were now unemployed. But Somalia's armory of weapons was largely intact, and the economy remained in tatters. That left the humanitarian workers, obscure once again, to grapple with a country still on the edge of chaos.

HEADLINE: WINE;
The Price Is Ripe

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
A NEWSPAPER COLLEAGUE, propelled by talent and a touch of luck into the editorship of a major Midwestern daily, said to me:
"We don't run any wine stuff. No one in this town's going to shell out $30 for a bottle of wine." Allowing for the fact that that's the way editors talk, he nevertheless put his finger on one of wine's persistent problems: Most people think it has to be expensive to be good. 
 For many people, of course, the point is moot. In these uncertain times, $30 is food money or gas money, not wine money. Better times are ahead, we are told, but the signals are mixed. So, until the forecast clears, here are a few suggestions for good red wine -- this being the season for roasts and stews and other hearty red-wine food -- that costs no more than $10 a bottle. Not all these wines will be found in all locations but most are reasonably well distributed. And most, it is hoped, will change some minds about what's good.
Beaujolais, for example, was once a blue-collar wine, and even though it has moved up the economic scale a bit, it continues to be what it's always been: one of the best of all wine bargains.
There are plenty of different Beaujolais in this country, most of them good. And one of the easiest labels to find is Georges Duboeuf. Though Duboeuf bottles the offerings of many towns, it's impossible to beat his simple Beaujolais-Villages. It sells for around $6 in New York and, at the moment, it's still possible to buy the fine 1991 vintage.
With its thousands of chateaus, most of them small and obscure, Bordeaux produces more bargains in good wine than almost any other wine region in the world. But distribution is haphazard; the little chateaus to be found in one shop will rarely be found in another.
Luckily, a few fine Bordeaux properties are making enough wine to satisfy customers all over the map. Look for Chateau Greysac and Chateau Larose Trintaudon. Both make excellent Bordeaux for under $10 and both are not too difficult to find.
Wines from vintages maligned by the critics often turn out to be bargains. The 1987 Bordeaux is a good example. It was dismissed because it did not match up to some of the finer vintages flanking it. Even so, good wine makers make good wine, i.e., Jean-Louis Triaud at Chateau Gloria. His '87 Bordeaux is just right for drinking now, and it can found for as little as $9.99.
Cotes-du-Rhone is another perennial bargain but many of the wines are mediocre. Not so the 1989 of Marcel Guigal, which can be found for around $8. This big wine is made for hearty winter meals.
You could do a book on good Italian wines under $10. I recently tasted a delightful 1990 Frescobaldi Chianti that sold for $5. The sturdy Chiantis from the Castello Gabbiano cost a fraction more, but the Gabbiano Chianti Classico at about $8, is a buy. Try, too, the 1990 Rosso di Montalcino from the Fattoria dei Barbi, also about $8. Further north, in the Piedmont, Luigi Dessilani & Sons produce a variety of excellent wines made from the nebbiolo grape. The 1989 Spanna, which is what the nebbiolo grape is called in the Novara Hills, sells for about $7.
The Olympics introduced many people to Catalan wines. Torres is the best-known wine name in this part of Spain (Barcelona is the capital), and one of the best-known Torres wines is Sangre de Toro -- bull's blood. A soft but full-bodied red, it sells for about $6. Rioja, to the west of Barcelona, is Spain's best-known wine region. The excellent 1987 from the Marques de Riscal, is available in New York for about $7.
From Australia, Penfold's 1990 Koonunga Hill cabernet and shiraz blend is a remarkably full, rich wine at a great price: about $7. Rosemount's 1990 Shiraz at about $8 is also worth seeking out.
Hard times have taken their toll in California, and though there are still a few $75 cabernets around, hubris has taken a back seat to pragmatism. Look out for the old standbys: Beaulieu Vineyard's Rutherford cabernet sauvignon for just under $10 and the same winery's Beautour cabernet at around $7. Rodney Strong Vineyard's 1989 Sonoma cabernet sells for between $7 and $9 and the 1989 Hawk Crest, a second label for Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, is around $9. Both these wines are as good as others at double the price.
If you prefer an easygoing cabernet with no sharp corners and even a touch of sweetness, try Glen Ellen's Proprietor's Reserve. It usually sells for around $5 but I've seen it as low as $3.50 when sold by the case.
Estancia Estates, a label of Franciscan Estate Selections, adorns some excellent wines at affordable prices. The 1989 Estancia cabernet, at about $7 in some New York shops, is a true bargain. Marietta Cellars, in Sonoma, offers an intriguing blend of cabernet, zinfandel and other reds called Marietta Old Vine Red, which sells for about $6, and is worth every penny.
The Fetzer family recently sold the booming Mendocino winery bearing their name but their wines are still in the stores, and, as always, rank among the best California bargains. Fetzer's Barrel Select cabernet sauvignon, at about $9, is a wine that could grace any table, any time.
If better times truly are ahead, you may soon be in a position to pay $30 for a bottle of wine. Which is fine, but you'll inevitably discover that $30 is no guarantee that you'll do better than the wines suggested here.

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
Money, Prestige, T-Shirts -- and Even Art

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
One of the more curious spectacles this autumn was the sight of out-of-towners frantically checking their watches. Like amateur air-traffic controllers, they were calibrating traveling time from the Modern to the Metropolitan, from the Whitney to the SoHo Guggenheim, factoring in tricky variables like closing days and, of course, arranging everything around the Matisse tickets they had bought months in advance. The lines that stretched all the way from the Modern down 53d Street and up Fifth Avenue for the poor souls who had not bought advance tickets were eclipsed only by the mob at the Met on the Sunday the Magritte show closed. You would have thought the museum was giving the art away.
Every week, it seemed, another important show opened in New York City. Not only Matisse at the Modern and Magritte at the Metropolitan, but also an exhibition of the 17th-century master Jusepe Ribera at the Met, a survey of the Russian avant-garde at the Guggenheim uptown, Rauschenberg's early work and Chagall murals at the downtown Guggenheim, retrospectives for Agnes Martin and Jean-Michel Basquiat at the Whitney, and an overview of the 19th-century French painter Frederic Bazille in Brooklyn. When the Matisse show closed this past Tuesday, it effectively brought to an end an exhibition period so frenzied, even by the standards of this city, that it had everyone wondering what had happened. 
 "The great international art exhibition is passe," Thomas Hoving, as director of the Metropolitan, wrote in 1974. He wasn't alone in thinking so. The blockbuster, which originated decades before Mr. Hoving brought King Tut to town, was declared dead more often than Bill Clinton's prospects for the Presidency. Yet just as President Clinton is unpacking his sax and shades in the White House, the blockbuster reigns.
So what exactly is a blockbuster?
There is still little agreement about the meaning of the word. Try Webster's, and the first definition you will find is a "bomb that can demolish a large area," which may apply to the Guggenheim's Russian behemoth of 800-plus works but which is not otherwise relevant here. The second definition is apropos, although still not precise enough: "a particularly powerful, forceful or effective person or thing; specif., an expensive or pretentious movie, novel, etc., intended to have wide popular appeal." (Isn't it interesting that this applies almost as well to Mr. Hoving as to his Tut show?)
Blockbusters needn't be big in terms of the number of objects they include. The Tut show had only about 50 works. And most big exhibitions do not turn out to be blockbusters. Impressive international loans are usually at the heart of those that do; yet content isn't the issue, really. A blockbuster can be as scholarly and focused as the late-Cezanne show that was such a hit at the Modern several years ago or as unfocused as the Vatican treasures exhibition earlier at the Met. You may think of blockbusters as hyped events, with lots of advance publicity. But the late-Cezanne show was an unanticipated blockbuster.
To qualify as a blockbuster, an exhibition must be a crowd-pleaser of extraordinary proportions. The Matisse and Magritte shows qualify. About 900,000 people saw the Matisse show during its four-month run, and had the Modern not limited tickets to 6,900 a day, who knows how many more would have stuffed themselves into galleries often so crowded that they resembled the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during trading hours. After the Picasso retrospective of 1980, which was seen by 1.1 million people, the Matisse show was the best-attended exhibition in the Modern's history.
During its two-and-a-half-month run, the Magritte retrospective was seen by about 453,600 visitors, an average of 7,000 a day -- more people, in other words, than saw the Matisse show. (Tut still rules at the Met, with an average of 10,600 visitors a day.) Even more impressive, a survey of out-of-town visitors to the Magritte show suggested that about half of them had come to the city specifically to see it and/or the Ribera exhibition (which attracted a respectable but modest total of about 142,000 people).
Are big shows big moneymakers?
You might assume that with all those people paying to see these shows, the museums housing them rake in big bucks. Wrong.
Some shows are breadwinners, of course; but contrary to popular belief, modest shows that don't attract the biggest crowds can be the most profitable, while blockbusters often end up costing a museum money. "They're usually expensive to put on, and in most cases they don't raise the full cost it takes to organize them," said Emily Rafferty, the Met's vice president for development and membership. "I think you'll find that blockbusters on the whole don't make money."
Museums figure costs and earnings in different ways, and their public estimates may not always be reliable: nonprofit institutions don't necessarily want to be seen as making large profits or taking heavy losses. Whatever the case, the Guggenheim says its Russian show was seen by almost 250,000 people and ended up setting the institution back tens of thousands of dollars.
The museum's math is complicated: the show cost $1.15 million to put on, at least $375,000 of which the Guggenheim calculates was covered by "in kind" support like the transportation of art by Lufthansa. Lufthansa also gave about $60,000 in cash, and the Frankfurt museum where the show was presented before it came to New York accounted for another $350,000.
Because the museum could not find additional corporate sponsorship, it hiked admission fees for the show from $7.50 to $10. The museum estimates that admissions accounted for $470,000. Because the net loss on the catalogue, to date, is $130,000, the bottom line is a debit of at least $25,000. "We're struggling to break even through catalogue sales," said Michael Govan, the deputy director.
The Ribera show cost $530,000 to mount, which includes packing, shipping, insurance, installation and so on. At the Metropolitan, which does not sell tickets to specific exhibitions, it is difficult to determine precisely how a show does financially. Still, even though the Ribera exhibition was supported by a $350,000 grant from Argentaria, a Spanish banking consortium, and other grants, the museum estimates that it probably cost the institution about $100,000.
Nothing demonstrates more clearly the current recession's effect on museums than the fact that no corporate sponsor could be found for the Met's Magritte show, which cost $450,000. Last spring the museum even contemplated canceling it.
Taking into account the number of people who paid admission to the museum because of the Magritte show, who bought spinoffs like Magritte posters, who ate in the museum restaurant and parked in its garage, officials at the Met have concluded that the fifth most popular show in its history did little more than break even.
The Matisse show was something of an anomaly. The cost was at least $5 million, slightly less than half of which was covered by a donation from Philip Morris. The contribution was generous. But when a sure-fire hit cannot cover even half its costs through corporate gifts, that is further proof that corporate sponsorship has become scarce.
The practice of selling tickets for a specific show within a museum, as the Modern did with Matisse, costs money. Another Matisse cost involved the drop in admissions revenues during the weeks before and after the show, when the galleries where it was presented have had to close. Although Richard Oldenburg, director of the Modern, emphasized that the museum does not yet have final figures on the exhibition, he said "there is no question we will have made money, certainly several hundred thousand dollars, although probably less than people think."
If these shows don't guarantee big returns, then why do museums do them?
The short answer is that nonprofit institutions are not in the business of making money. The full answer is more complicated.
Museum directors insist that shows are organized for their contribution to learning, and that if such shows become blockbusters, so much the better. In fact, popular exhibitions mean increased membership -- a whopping 14,000 new members joined the Modern during the Matisse show. They mean lots of people passing through the front doors who might not otherwise have come to the museum -- and who may return. They also mean happy trustees and sponsors, whose satisfaction can translate into future support. Moreover, many museums depend in part on public money, and the clearest way to demonstrate their value to the public is through impressive admissions figures.
Yet these very incentives to organize blockbusters can also be disincentives. Sponsors may be attracted to a museum by its blockbusters, but they may expect blockbuster returns for each investment. They are not necessarily interested in the vast majority of shows, which attract smaller crowds. Trustees at museums where blockbusters have made money can come to feel that museums should solve their money problems by focusing on mega-shows. More than one museum has failed to take into account that much of the rise in attendance and membership during a show is temporary. "These shows distort your figures because they set levels which you're not going to match normally," Mr. Oldenburg said. "You hold on to some of the new members, but not all."
Some institutions have expanded their operations based on blockbuster numbers only to discover that they can't support themselves. This causes them to conceive of shows with blockbuster results in mind. That proposition is not only risky financially; it also degrades the museum. "Blockbusters can be profitable and that's one of the big dangers with them," said Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan. "They can suddenly make the exhibition program look like a cash cow, which invites depreciation of the currency of art. Such an attitude invites abuses, and it attacks the intellectual integrity of the institution."
Mr. Oldenburg agreed: "Too many shows are cynically and badly calculated to be popular -- 'Treasures of X' shows, for example, that have no substantial purpose otherwise. Blockbusters are seductive. And if the content is right, there's nothing wrong with having a big popular success. But even if you wanted to, you couldn't produce these too often, especially nowadays."
Will there be continue to be mega-shows?
 This autumn's spree partly reflects a last gasp of 80's optimism, a delayed reaction, since most of the shows were conceived years ago. It also reflects serendipity. Since it takes so long to put an exhibition together, some inevitably fall by the wayside or must be postponed for one reason or another. This year, many shows on the books were realized, and a few, like the early-Rauschenberg exhibition, which turned out to be available at the end of a tour, were added at the eleventh hour.
For as long as there have been blockbusters, museum directors have been saying that major exhibitions are becoming harder to produce. Still, recent economic changes have clearly made it more difficult to assemble the sort of ambitious loan show that is the most likely blockbuster. Insurance costs have risen while corporate support has dwindled. Companies like United Technologies, Mobil, I.B.M. and Chrysler, significant sponsors of exhibitions during the booming 80's, have drastically curtailed their arts financing or dropped out entirely, and the number of new players is small. For a while, museums like the Metropolitan could rely on European companies to pick up the slack, but now Europe is in a recession. "Corporations are still spending money on marketing," Mr. Rafferty said, "and sponsorship of an exhibition provides good visibility for them. But everybody recognizes that it's tougher than it's ever been before. It's not the priority when people are laying off employees."
Museums try to set aside money to cover costs of shows. The average annual cost at the Met is between $6 million and $8 million, not including catalogues. But the museum allots only $1 million of its $85 million yearly operating budget for the exhibition program, which underscores its dependence on corporate help. At the Modern, where the average annual cost of shows is between $3 million and $5 million, officials are trying to build up an endowment that at present generates only about $350,000 toward exhibition expenses.
The forthcoming schedules look leaner than usual at institutions like the National Gallery in Washington and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where, among other things, new directors have yet to make their mark. But despite the financial strains, there will, of course, continue to be mega-shows with blockbuster aspirations: the National Gallery is planning a major de Kooning show; the Modern will stage a big Miro show; the Met has a huge Impressionist exhibition in the works; the Art Institute of Chicago is planning a Monet retrospective, and there's plenty elsewhere, including a survey in Paris of 16th-century Venetian art that looks to be one of this year's most glittering events.
At the same time, in straitened circumstances, museums are having to think about more modest shows and shows that depend on their permanent collections -- typically less glamorous undertakings, if no less beautiful and instructive, than the big international loan exhibitions. As a measure of things, consider the precarious state of a medieval Spanish art show, a potential blockbuster, which at the moment is on the docket at the Metropolitan. Mr. de Montebello flew to Spain 10 days ago to seek corporate support. He learns this week whether the corporation comes through. If not, the Met says, the show will be indefinitely postponed.

HEADLINE: LAUGHING OFF THE RECESSION

 BODY:
It was I who, with my colleague Bob Freedman, hired Diane English as a secretary at WNET ("Laughing Off the Recession," by Hilary de Vries, Jan. 3). We had a wonderful time, and indeed, Diane and her husband, Joel Shukovsky, have remained my friends.
What Diane may not remember, or may never have known at the time, is that at a certain point it became clear that we needed to give her a real raise if we wanted to keep her. Public televison wasn't exactly Fort Knox, and all any of us were getting as raises that year were cost-of-living increases. I tried to get my boss to take the percentage I was supposed to get and add it to Diane's increase. He couldn't do it. 
 Although that circumstance certainly wasn't the start of a chain of events leading to her success, it is another piece of the story that might let people aspiring to their dreams believe they can come true, even from modest beginnings.

Your article on Diane English had an impressive amount of detail, including the information that her father was an alcoholic. But there were only three paragraphs about a topic that the article states "earned headlines": her union-busting. (And of the three paragraphs, one was a rebuttal of the charges by English's husband. A union camera operator replaced by English had his say -- all three words of it.) 
 Would these activities have received the once-over-lightly treatment if the subject had been a conservative instead of a liberal like English?

HEADLINE: Once-Sleazy Timeshares Gain New Vacation Respectability

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
THE concept of a timeshare vacation had never appealed to Sandy Bowman of Cincinnati. "Buying a studio for a specific two weeks at the same resort didn't seem that attractive," she said.
Like many vacationers, she had been pestered by hard-sells and even toured a few resorts. "But nothing persuaded us to buy," she said.
Last spring, when Ms. Bowman, her husband, Chuck, and son, Adam, now 11 years old, visited Disney World, in Orlando, Fla., they took a look at the Disney Vacation Club, the company's first time-share venture, started in December 1991. 
 "We heard it was a pleasant experience and no one would pressure us to buy," Ms. Bowman explained. When the Bowmans returned to Disney World the following August, they had decided to buy a time share there.
"We trusted the Disney name and liked the fexibility they offered," she said. Instead of selling specific weeks in perpetuity, Disney offers purchase points that the buyer can spend to create different kinds of vacations.
Each point costs $56.50 and the Bowmans bought 230, the minimum number allowed, which they can use for three weeks in a studio or one week in a one-bedroom house in the spring or summer. Or they can switch to a two-bedroom house in the fall. They can even bank their points over to the next year and splurge on one week in a three-bedroom, four-bath villa.
This new flexibility, tied to the entrance of many high-profile companies, like Disney, Marriott, Westin and others, is giving the time-share industry a new respectabilty. In fact, some are predicting it will be the next wave in the vacation business.
"People who wouldn't have winked at time sharing before now have a comfort level with the big companies involved," said George Leposky, communications director for Interval International, a vacation exchange service for time-share buyers. "And the luster is rubbing off on some of the lesser-known resorts as well."
Demographics also seem to be working in the industry's favor. There are indications that ownership of second homes will rise dramatically in the next 20 years as baby boomers reach the ages of 45 to 64, the group accounting for 48 percent of recreational property owners, according to American Demographics magazine.
"This increased demand for second homes should benefit time sharing, since many people don't have the money for a full-time second home," said Brad Edmonson, editor of American Demographics.
Typically, a week at a time-share resort costs an average of $9,500, according to the American Resorts Development Association, the trade group representing time shares. The term is usually 25 to 50 years, and there is an annual maintenance fee, which can range from $200 to over $1,000, depending on the resort.
"I can't afford my own condominium, especially the maintenance of one," said Chuck Giglio of Miami, who owns four time shares in Florida. "I like the fact that I can share my expenses with 51 other people."
Time sharing is really an infant industry in this country. Started in the French Alps, it was exported here in the 70's.
"After initial growing pains, it's starting to be a mature industry now," said Bill McCreary, senior vice president of Westin Hotels and Resorts, which operates a time-share resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., bordering Orlando.
The industry has grown dramatically in the last decade. The American Resorts Development Association reports that more than 440,000 time-share weeks were sold in 1991, a 340 percent increase over 1980. The gross sales volume in 1991 was $3.7 billion (the latest figure available), a more than 650 percent increase over 1980.
The United States has 43.6 percent of the world total of time-share resorts and Americans account for 60 percent of all time-share owners.
In the industry's early years, abuses were rampant, from overselling of units, bait-and-switch tactics and outright embezzlement. By the mid-80's most states had begun regulating the selling of time shares, requiring the licensing of salespeople, the registration of developers, bonding for completion of improvements and an escape period for those who bought contracts.
"In almost all states, especially those with a lot of time shares, there are extensive protections for the consumer," said Stephany Madsen, vice president of state legislative affairs for the resort association. "The sleazy operators have long ago been put out of business."
"THERE'S no question that the industry is better regulated now than it was in the early 80's," said Tom Bell, chief attorney with the Florida Department of Business Regulation. "But there are still problems of enforcement. So the consumer must still use his head."
Mr. Giglio has seen both sides of the situation. One of his time shares, in Key Largo, Fla., went bankrupt and another, in Marathon, Fla., fell into disrepair. "The most important thing to watch out for is that the resort has good management and that it's well maintained," he said.
Mr. Giglio's most recent time-share purchase was at Disney. "With that kind of company, I figured that accountability is going to be to the dime," he said. "And I'm pretty sure they're not going to go bankrupt."
Disney has already completed 197 timeshare units at Orlando and is building 150 more. The company hopes to build a total of 500 units eventually.
"We're also considering building more clubs in established resort areas in other parts of the country," said Mark Pacala, general manager and senior vice president of Disney Vacation Club. "We expect to make an announcement early this year."
MARRIOTT was the first of the major players to enter the timeshare business, in 1984. The company now operates 16 resorts and has sold units to 40,000 owners. It is currently building a 280-unit resort in Hilton Head Island, S.C. The first phase, 60 units, is scheduled to be completed in June.
"Marriott was a trendsetter in that regard," said Mr. Leposky of Interval International. "When they first got into the business, other big companies waited for them to make fools out of themselves. Instead they were a howling success and soon it was like critical mass -- everyone followed."
A major part of the reason for that is that hoteliers all over the world were hit hard by the recession. Saddled by a huge supply of empty rooms and falling profit curves, they were eager to latch onto any new opportunity.
In contrast to Marriott, his company has been "tiptoeing into time shares," said Mr. McCreary of Westin. At the start of last year, it began converting the Blue Tree Resort, a rental and condominum complex in Lake Buena Vista, , into a time-share resort. "We feel its's a solid opportunity," said Mr. McCreary. "Consumer trends indicate a preference for a guaranteed vacation experience. And we can provide it."
Other big names now in the time-share industry include Ramada International Hotels and Resorts, which acquired a 214-unit complex in the Bahamas that it is converting into a time-share resort, and Hilton Hotels Corporation, which formed a partnership with Grand Vacations Ltd., calling the new enterprise Hilton Grand Vacations.
To overcome the industry's negative image, the new time-share operators are being very careful about how they sell units. Disney, for instance, has a 30-day cooling off period after a contract is signed, allowing the buyer to change his mind; Florida requires only 10 days. Most time-share resorts are affiliated with one of the major vacation exchange services, Interval International and Resort Condominiums International. This allows people to swap their time-share weeks with other owners around the world.
A recent survey by resorts association showed that 80 percent of time-share owners cited the exchange opportunity as a primary motivation for buying a time share.
Unlike other real estate transactions, however, time shares should not be considered an investment. Reselling them can be next to impossible, unless one has bought at one of the top resorts in the country.
"Time shares should be bought for vacation fun and savings over the long term," said Ms. Madsen of the American Resorts Development Association. "It may be they're like cars that depreciate the moment they leave the showroom. But as a vacation investment, they're ideal."

HEADLINE: Delegation Gains Posts To Guard Home Front

BYLINE: States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NO one knows exactly what it takes to win a coveted seat on a major Congressional committee because voting on assignments takes place behind closed doors. The ingredients seem to be a predictable political mixture of seniority, networking, regional affiliation and power of personality.
Whatever the magical formula, the Connecticut delegation managed to work wonders in the waning days of 1992, coming out of December's assignment frenzy with appointments to four of the most prized committees. The assignments will add to the delegation's clout in the 103d Congress, influence already enhanced by its building seniority and enviable connections to the new White House. 
 "The delegation will have infinitely more power," said Peter Sloan, a Washington lobbyist and Connecticut native. "Its Democratic members are now so well-placed that the delegation is really in a position to get things done for the state."
The possibilities include insuring Connecticut's military-dependent economy suffers as little as possible from Federal budget cuts, as well as guaranteeing that the state receives its share of money for transportation projects, military projects and for programs to help companies convert to civilian enterprises.
New committee assignments include the appointment of Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, Democrat of New Haven, to the House Appropriations Committee, which holds the pursestrings in Congress, and Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, Democrat of Hartford, as one of three liaisons from the tax-writing committee, the House Committee on Ways and Means, to the Budget Committee.
House Republicans voted Representative Gary Franks of Waterbury onto the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over more than half the bills that move through the House. And in the Senate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of New Haven, won a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which draws up the Pentagon budget and has a hand in deciding such issues as whether another Seawolf submarine is needed. Mr. Lieberman also will probably be appointed the chairman of a subcommittee on the Senate Environment and Pubic Works Committee.
 
'Helps to Be at the Table'
 "It really helps to have members of the delegation in more powerful positions because decisions aren't always made in the public eye during committee meetings," said Terry Meulenberg, spokeswoman for Gov. Lowell P. Weiker Jr.'s Washington state office. "It's crucial to have those people to make contacts and build those relationships that will help the state get what it needs. It helps to be at the table."
Ms. Meulenberg heralds Ms. DeLauro's appointment as most important for the state because the Appropriations Committee makes the decisions which states spend what money."She will be looking out for the state's interest on that committee and making sure Connecticut is as well protected as it can be," Ms. Meulenberg said.
Ms. DeLauro will be on the Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee, which covers health-care issues. Health-care reforms are expected to be considered in this session. Ms. Meulenberg said Connecticut, like most states, has been hard hit by spending cuts on medical care. Money is desperately needed for drug- and alcohol-abuse treatment programs, community health centers and AIDS care, she said.
Ms. DeLauro said she would also use her position on the Appropriations Committee to insure that Connecticut received aid for education and job-training and diversification programs and for cleanup efforts in Long Island Sound. "It will be a way in which to address national problems and, at the same time, to address our problems in the state of Connecticut," Ms. DeLauro said.
 
A Backup in the Senate
 Mr. Lieberman, who also has forged a strong relationship with the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, will insure Ms. DeLauro's work is not undone in the Senate. But Mr. Lieberman will do most of his bidding for the state in his new assignment to the Armed Services Committee, where he will look out for Connecticut's extensive military-dependent industry.
Mr. Lieberman's committee seat comes at a time when major Pentagon cutbacks are expected. The end of the cold war presages a re-evalution of the country's military needs and the will be in a position to influence the tenuous transition period, according to Peter Kelly, a political consultant and longtime Democratic Party leader.
"Joe has done a brilliant job of developing the right relationships and he is widely regarded as the most effective member of that class," Mr. Kelly said. "The delegation will need to preserve critical contracts that major employers in the state fought hard to win."
Mr. Kelly said the Senator, who is a friend of President Clinton since their law school days at Yale, would have a series of battles ahead of him, not least of which would be holding President Clinton's "feet to the fire on Seawolf."
Mr. Clinton voiced his support for the nuclear submarine during his election campaign, but it is not yet clear whether he supports the construction of a third Seawolf. Senator Lieberman said he was beginning to lay the groundwork in Congress for the battle to finance another Seawolf and has scheduled a meeting this week with Adm. Frank B. Kelso 2d, Chief of Naval Operations and the highest-ranking Navy official.
Mr. Lieberman is expected to make the case for maintaining a strong military base. "Once you have dismantled our defense, it will be very difficult to resurrect," Mr. Lieberman said. "I will be concerned with both national security interests as well as those of Connecticut."
Mr. Lieberman's appointment is especially important for the state because Connecticut lost its only representation on the committee in the House when Mr. Franks secured his appointment to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has some of the most far-reaching powers in Congress.
In his new slot, Mr. Franks will contend with issues like Medicaid financing and nuclear energy. Mr. Franks said he would use his position to enact welfare revisions and to enforce state laws for collecting child support.
Mr. Franks said he also hoped to push a series of bills introduced last year to revitalize deteriorating urban centers, including providing incentives to corporations to invest in urban areas.
 
A Boon for Machine Industries
 Connecticut's machine tool and ball-bearing industries may also get a boost from Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of New Britain, and Mrs. Kennelly, both appointed to the Trade Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee. Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Kennelly plan to work together to protect these industries from unfair competition and to insure they receive government support.
"We will use our position to make sure Connecticut industries are not unfairly taken advantage of," said Mrs. Johnson, who was largely responsible for forcing the Department of Defense to buy ball bearings from domestic producers.
Mrs. Kennelly's appointment to the Budget Committee is also seen as a boon for the state. She already has her finger on the pulse of Congressional power as the Chief Deputy Whip. Her appointment as Ways and Means Committee liaison to the Budget Committee will give her more power to shape budget priorities, influence tax policy and set the agenda for the House.
Mrs. Kennelly, a seven-term lawmaker, last week reflected soberly on her growing influence and the decisions that will be made. "This week of celebration will end," she said. "It will be followed by many difficult choices and tough years."

HEADLINE: Have Snow, Forget the Travel

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
EVEN though machine-made snow is the staple of their existence, Connecticut ski areas have always been affected by weather factors miles away.
"Unless they see snow, a lot of people, particularly beginners, won't go skiing," said Ed Beckley, general manager at Mount Southington. "They have to see snow before they think skiing." 
 Within the ski industry, that is known as the "snow in the backyard" snydrome. And for more than a week now that syndrome has proved a boon to the state's five ski areas, since many people living in Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts can look outside and see snow.
The sight of snow, after three light snowfalls within four days in mid-January, has given Connecticut ski operators their best year's start in recent memory. Thousands of skiers turned out a week ago at the five ski areas, all of which offered excellent conditions during what for many people was a three-day weekend because of the observance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday on Monday.
"It was the best weekend we've had in years," said Carol Lugar, owner of Mohawk Mountain in Cornwall, the state's largest and oldest ski area, with the highest vertical drop of 660 feet. "Not only did we have plenty of snow, but we had sunshine, too."
Connecticut ski areas, while they were able to make snow, had little sunshine and natural snow the last two winters, which were among the mildest on record. Coupled with the recession, the unseasonably mild weather kept many skiers away from the slopes, both in Connecticut and farther north. But so far this year, cold weather has enabled the state's ski operators at Mohawk, Mount Southington, Powder Ridge, Ski Sundown and Woodbury Ski Area to blanket their trails with machine-made snow. "The natural snow is just so much frosting on the cake," said Rick Carter, president and owner of Ski Sundown in New Hartford, the state's northernmost ski area 22 miles northwest of Hartford.
 
Snow, Deep Snow
 Ski Sundown, the state's second-largest ski center in terms of trails and skiable acreage, got a huge helping of "frosting" on Dec. 12 when two feet of snow fell. That snowstorm, combined with several snowfalls since then, has given Sundown its deepest base in years, as of last week up to 40 inches.
"The last three years were tough," said Mr. Carter, a former math teacher who has owned Ski Sundown since 1978. "It was a combination of the weather and the recession," he said. "But so far this year, we're off to a great start."
Largely because of the recession and in an effort to lure skiers back after two virtually snowless winters, the state's ski operators have essentially held the line on lift-ticket prices. Mohawk has actually reduced the price, to $29 from $30 for adults, seven days a week. Mount Southington and Woodbury, the state's smallest ski area, are charging the same as last winter. Mount Southington, which has 12 trails, charges $26 on weekends and $22 on weekdays, while the price at Woodbury, with 15 trails, is $20 every day. Ski Sundown and Powder Ridge, which is in Middlefield, between Meriden and Middletown, charge $28 on weekends, up a dollar from last year, and $24 and $22, respectively, on weekdays.
Prices for rental equipment have remained about the same as last year, the operators say. Lift-ticket prices for juniors and skiers 65 years and older are usually less. Half-day tickets and those for night skiing, which is now offered at each of the state's five ski areas, tend to be about $5 cheaper.
 
Staying Closer to Home Slopes
 Though the recession may have kept some skiers home the last few years, Mrs. Lugar, at Mohawk Mountain, said she believed the poor economy might have helped business. "I think it actually has been positive for us," she said. "People have been more cautious about their spending and not as willing to drive great distances to ski."
Connecticut ski areas, besides being heavily dependent on machine-made snow (ski operators abhor the term "artificial" snow), rely almost entirely on day-trippers for their business. Though the vast majority of skiers drawn to the state's ski trails are from Connecticut, some come from nearby areas of New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. But in almost every instance they return home after skiing, since the Connecticut ski areas are not "destination resorts," like those with lodging and other amenities farther north.
However, the state's ski areas do serve food and beverages and sell skis and other accessories. And at one, Woodbury, which is about 15 miles west of Waterbury, there are weekend ski parties in the lodge.
Though it is the state's smallest ski area, with a vertical drop of 300 feet, Woodbury is also the most unusual. Downhill skiiers (downhill is the most popular form of skiing) are usually outnumbered there by cross-country skiers and, at times, by snowboarders. "We may be small, but we do a lot of different things," said Rod Taylor, owner and manager. "About half of our business is cross-country, and we have 15 miles of cross-country trails, which is more than any of the other places."
 
Make Way for Snowboarders
 Until this month, though, most of those cross-country trails had not been skiable for five years because of a prolonged snow drought. During much of that time, Mr. Taylor said, cross-country skiers were able to ski on machine-made snow on a two-mile trail, part of which is lighted at night.
Mr. Taylor said that snowboarders account for anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of the business at Woodbury. "We were the first place in Connecticut to allow snowboarding," Mr. Taylor said in referring to the sport that primarily appeals to teen-agers and young men. Originally known as "snurfing," snowboarding employs a single board similar to those used in surfing and skateboarding.
Most skiers and ski areas were slow to accept snowboarders, who initially were restricted to a specific trail. Now they are welcome at all Connecticut ski areas, which even rent out boards and offer lessons while permitting the snurfers on most trails.
"We were the last of the holdouts in the state, but we haven't had any problems or complaints since we started permitting snowboarding three years ago," Mr. Beckley, at Mount Southington, said. "We had to face up to the fact that it's the fastest-growing winter sport in the country."
 
A Revival Sport
 At Powder Ridge, crowds last weekend numbered in the thousands, with as many as 3,000 skiers on hand on Sunday, according to David Harlow, general manager. "It was the third-best day since I came here in 1984," Mr. Harlow said.
"Last year was a little better than the year before, which was about as bad as it can get," he said.
For those not inclined to try downhill or cross-country skiing or snowboarding, Mr. Taylor at Woodbury has turned back the clock and in effect gone full circle when it comes to snow sports. His newest snow activity? Sledding, which he says has proved as popular among adults as with children.
"All you've got to do is bring a sled along and for $10 you can go sleigh-riding down the mountain," Mr. Taylor said. "And if you don't have a sled, we'll rent you one for $5."

HEADLINE: New Effort To Teach Homeless Children

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
A STUDENT at the Burnet Street School in Newark recently learned how to read.
For most elementary school students, that might not seem a notable accomplishment, but for this homeless sixth grader, who has attended 10 different schools in the last year and a half, it represented a major triumph. Through intensive remedial instruction during school and a tutorial program after school and on weekends, he has been able to make up much of the learning time he lost while moving from temporary shelter to temporary shelter, surrounded by the chaotic welfare-hotel environment of drug dealing, gunfire and neglect. 
 At a time when the number of homeless children in New Jersey's schools continues to rise, these children are beginning to benefit from new federally supported programs in effect since Octoberaround the state.
"When you think of homelessness, you don't think of children," said Dalia Georgedes, coordinator of the New Jersey Department of Education's Office of Education for Homeless Children and Youth. But, she said, 60 percent of the homeless are families with children.
Despite a decline in New Jersey's unemployment rate, school districts say that, more and more homeless children are showing up in the schools. In East Orange, for example, the total jumped from 614 in the 1990-91 school year to 684 last year. In Newark, school officials say homelessness is on the rise and is probably double or triple the official state count of 892 students for that city.
The increase, Mrs. Georgedes said, is being felt beyond Newark and Camden, "in areas that have never had to deal with it." Communities like Englewood, Prospect Park, West Orange and Montclair have begun calling the New Jersey Department of Education for assistance.
In addition to the expense and logistical problems associated with busing students from welfare hotels and shelters, districts are finding that homeless children often have psychological problems that require remedial education and counseling to compensate for the confusion of their home lives.
Charles Lagos, who runs an after-school arts program in Hackensack for the homeless through the Bergen County Special Services School District, said that his students, though not learning disabled, show many behavioral patterns often associated with the learning disabled.
"They're not acting up or being disruptive," he said, "but these youngsters are desperately clingy and in terrible shape emotionally."
Until this year, districts received little financial assistance in coping with the homeless. But the reauthorization of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act has made more Federal financing available to support supplemental programs for the homeless.
One such program offers science instruction on Saturdays for students, accompanied by their parents. Ruth Schumacher, supervisor of financed programs for the Bridgeton schools, said it was easier to capture elementary school children's attention with science because many viewed it as magic. Older students are serving as lab assistants.
During the school day, parents living in shelters are visited and given information on services and housing.
"It's basically anything to make it simpler for the family so the child can get all the services he can," Mrs. Schumacher said. "Our philosophy is to take it to them. Don't insist that they have to come to you all the time."

 
Never Played Softball
 In East Orange and Newark, families gather for dinner once a week as part of the school district's after-school tutorial programs for the homeless. In Newark, the time is split between academics and recreational activities, since many of the children have never learned to play group games like kickball or softball.
Another program financed through the McKinney Act is an after-school tutorial project in Pemberton, which is offered by a consortium of districts in Burlington County. Trenton has an after-school program for homeless high school students.
The rewards of such supplemental programs can be high. In East Orange, 85 percent of the students enrolled in a pilot after-school tutoring program for the homeless saw improvement in their grades. Most students attending Newark's after-school tutorial program for the homeless are now performing at or above grade level.
Teachers involved in both programs say the improvement in performance can be credited not simply to the extra tutoring but to the nutritional benefits of the supplemental meals the students receive.
Last year, a City University of New York research project on stress and homeless children indicated that they share two fears -- that they will be physically harmed and that someone close to them might die.
 
'Survival Is a Priority'
 "Education isn't a priority; survival is a priority for these children," said Sheila Guions, a guidance counselor at the Burnet Street School and coordinator of its after-school tutorial program for the homeless, where the C.U.N.Y. study was conducted.
The reasons behind homelessness are varied. Many of the children have drug-abusing parents. Some children are living in shelters for victims of domestic violence. In Belleville, a new program of supplemental instruction and support services at a domestic violence shelter is expected to reach more than 250 children this year.
"These kids are not only homeless; they have to deal with the emotional problem of domestic violence," said Mark Solimo, director of special programs for the Essex County Educational Services Commission. "Counseling is a really important and vital part of the program."
But the vast majority of homeless children are victims of harsh economic times. "The primary reason is the economy," said Michael Del Pozzo, director of pupil personnel services in Asbury Park, where the homeless count is, he said, "way ahead" of last year's.
Just how many New Jersey children are homeless is difficult to gauge, in part because of the constant movement of families, but also because of the large number of the "hidden" homeless -- parents and children who are too ashamed to admit they are without shelter. Teachers say they sometimes find out inadvertently, through something a child has written or said, and even then they are often confronted with denial.
 
State Numbers Nearly Double
 In 1988, the state estimated that there were 14,439 homeless school-aged children. Two years later, after a broader survey, the official estimate climbed to 29,527.
New Jersey was one of the first states to pass legislation protecting the rights of homeless children. Under the law, which was enacted in 1990, the school district in which the parent or guardian lived before becoming homeless has responsibility, in consultation with parents, for determining the education of the child.
The law was intended to encourage some continuity in a student's education, and in most cases, officials say, it appears to be working. Before 1990, children would usually enroll in whatever schools were closest to their temporary residences, even if it meant switching schools dozens of times. Now most remain at their original schools until they are permanently settled.
"Our district maintains the position that until the family is securely nestled in its new home, that it would be to the child's advantage educationally to have them be maintained in the same school district," said Geraldine Staadecker, family consultant in East Orange, echoing the policy most school districts have adopted.
There are a few exceptions, however. In some cases, the distance children would have to travel to attend their original schools is so great that commuting becomes impossible. Also, in cases of domestic violence, they enroll in the schools closest to their shelters to maintain a distance from the violent parent.
 
Praise for an Agency
 Educators and advocacy groups for the homeless praise the Office of Education for Homeless Children and Youth as an effective source of information and lobbying.
"We're usually pretty critical of these agencies, but they've done a good job," said David Schiarra, a senior lawyer with the New Brunswick-based Legal Services of New Jersey. "They're responsive, they get right on things and really resolve them, and they have a good sense of what's going on."
Mr. Schiarra said that a number of years ago there was "a lot of agitation" about school districts' handling of homeless cases, but with the creation of the office in 1988 and a state advisory council of homeless parents and representatives from shelters, advocacy groups and school districts in 1990, "the level of complaints has dropped off to nothing."
Ceil Zalkind, associate director of the Association for Children of New Jersey, also has high praise for the tiny Office of Education for Homeless Children and Youth, which consists of Mrs. Georgedes, who works part time, and one full-time aide.
"They've done an outstanding job," said Ms. Zalkind, a former state advisory council member. "Every time I say that, I say it with a bit of surprise because our track record with the D.O.E. on other issues hasn't been great."

HEADLINE: A SENSE OF PLACE

BYLINE: By Michael Norman

 BODY:
A new column, "A Sense of Place," begins today in the New Jersey Weekly; it will appear on the fourth Sunday of each month. The author, Michael Norman, a former New York Times reporter, is an associate professor of journalism at New York University.
In the column, Mr. Norman says, he will explore "how the dislocations of modern life -- economic, political and psychological -- have shaken our sense of place and order and made us re-examine our notions about the cities, towns and villages we call home."
MONTCLAIR 
 THIS was not my town. I was not born here of an old family from one of the stone mansions or gabled summer homes on the hill. I arrived a college student on a weekend break, come to see the large house my mother and stepfather had just bought for their circle of seven.
I was the oldest, already out of the nest, and although I rarely touched down here in the years that followed, years on campus or in the barracks, I came to think of this place as native soil -- green and familiar. The family was happy then, together and content as it has never been since.
And no doubt because of that, the town became a place of myth for us. Long after we left, it lingered in memory. Even now, more than 20 years and thousands of miles away, none of them can talk of this place without longing for home.
I alone came back. It was the beginning of a new decade, the 1980's. The swan in Edgemont Park was gone, but skaters still took to the ice in the winter, and the greensward of the long oval park beside it was still inviting. The old ice-cream parlor on Valley Road was gone, but up the street, the red brick firehouse still stood, and so did the big white-faced clock in front of the bank. A new town hall had gone up; the Police Department got the old building, gray stone and stout.
The Wedgewood Cafeteria was still around -- 50 years of roast chicken and potatoes. There were more antiques shops than I remembered, and more pizza parlors. A video store had opened, but the Bellevue Theater with its balcony and brass rail still had Saturday matinee specials. Walensky's, a dreary haberdashery for "working men," was as durable as ever. Blue jeans bought there always seemed to have a tougher gauge.
And finally, there was the big green house on Erwin Park Road that my stepfather had bought and remodeled, 13 rooms on a corner lot with a gentle slope, someone else's home now.
I was married and a father when I returned. Beth had landed a professor's job at a nearby university, and I was sending off manuscripts to New York. The budget was threadbare, and we should have settled someplace else, someplace cheaper, but the surrounding precincts seemed pale.
They did not have the long streets with colonnades of pin oaks and Norwegian maples. They did not have the Iris Gardens, the train depots, the Art Museum, the parade on the Fourth of July. And even if those other places had been as green, as genial, they would not have had the feel of this place. I had history here, a sense that I belonged.
So we ate hot dogs and frozen vegetables and put a deposit on a railroad flat of an apartment in a two-family house a stone's throw from the busy main drag, Bloomfield Avenue. The house sat on the edge of an asphalt parking lot, and our quarters were hot and dusty. At night, the lot seemed to draw muscled young men in sleeveless T-shirts -- from other towns, I imagined -- who drank from bottles in brown paper sheaths and took long drags from the same twisted cigarette.
Beth was promoted, I went to work for The New York Times, and soon we'd saved enough for a down payment on a house, a small two-story
Colonial on a long, narrow lot with four massive pin oaks that formed a canopy over the large backyard.
The house was in desperate shape, but we grabbed the deal. I wanted a piece of the place I'd once called home.
And yet, back in town over a year at that point, I could not fully recapture the sense of place that was so palpable when my family first lighted in town years before. Something was wrong; something was wanting. I could feel it, but not give it form.
Then I spotted an ad for a garage sale at my parents' old house on Erwin Park Road. The family that had bought it was moving, lightening its load. I thought a visit might help make my return complete.
I got there at midafternoon and lingered until the detritus was sold and the last of the customers turned away. Then I introduced myself. "Oh," the mother said, "so you're one of the Hellers." (My stepfather's name.) And then they took me through the place, slowly, room by room.
Here again was the huge kitchen with the center island and breakfast nook where the family gathered after first light. Here were the butler's pantry, the dining room, the huge center hall where, every Christmas, we stood a 12-foot spruce. Here was the front porch where I embraced my mother as I went off to war. Up the stairs were the master bedroom and sitting room, down the hall the children's rooms, and on the third floor at the end, the chamber that once was mine.
I walked the empty halls and listened for the echo of old footfalls. But it did not help. The house seemed smaller and worn -- a stranger's house -- and I came away as unfulfilled as before.
What did I want? In the dry age of alienation, I wanted a place to refresh myself, that's all, a place that matched memory.
And then, slowly, I began to see: the town had moved on, but I hadn't. My idea of home -- safe, peaceful ground ruled by the laws of rectitude -- was a product of desire. In short, I was chasing a myth.
When I finally turned forward instead of back, I realized that every month something was happening to unmask the illusion I was trying so hard to embrace.
The Wedgewood Cafeteria closed. A sprawling restaurant with a King Cole mural on the wall and busboys in yellow waist jackets, the Wedgewood was our town's common table -- everyone ate there, from the shoeshine man to the mayor. Hahne's department store closed; I'd bought presents there for three generations of family. The balcony in the Bellevue Theater came down to make way for a "triplex"; the toy store shut its doors; the five-and-dime went out of business too. And it wasn't long before every block of stores seemed to have the same four anchors: a monotony of banks, real-estate offices, Chinese takeout shops and video stores.
The psychic dissolution was worse. My neighbor in the house on the left announced he'd lost his job -- a victim of the recession that had yet to touch me. His wife and daughter seemed to keep more to themselves after that.
A short time later, the couple in the house on the right started a domestic war that ended in divorce. We had shared a lot across our common divide of peonies and hedges. On warm summer evenings, we exchanged news and invitations to drinks and dinner. When things turned sour, their sorrow drifted across the divide.
In the end, we watched him load up his car and leave. Then she sold the house and took the children away. We have a picture from next door on our mantelpiece -- their little boy and ours, hugging each other.
Across the street, a woman we knew came home one day to discover her husband hanging in their bedroom. The block was dark and quiet after that. I would sit on a window seat and stare at the front of their house, at the door she entered the day she found him.
Not long afterward, Charlie the contractor -- a short, genial man who loved mussels in red sauce -- unexpectedly died of a heart attack. I went to Charlie's wake with two neighbors. It was crowded when we arrived; not an empty seat in the room. I took a Mass card and stepped to the coffin to pay my respects.
Charlie seemed a quiet man, the sort who would deliver a kindness, then slip silently away. When it snowed, he'd crank up his front loader, scoop out his own driveway, then cross the street to mine. By the time I had a shovel in my hand, the job was done, and there was no sign of the driver or sound of his yellow machine.
I know from all of this, and so much else since, that home is not a matter of two-by-fours or topography. Home is complicated, and like all complex truths it is slow to reveal itself. One must examine the small things; one must search the unexpected places. So I've become a perambulator, trying to get a new sense of place, a feel for a thing that is constantly changing.
Perhaps it's in the office of the eye doctor or the alcove of the Congregational Church. Maybe it's under the oaks at the cemetery on Valley Road or in the dark, malodorous lobby at the Y.M.C.A. The cleaning ladies might know it, the black and Portuguese women with worn faces who make the long bus ride from Newark up Bloomfield Avenue to the big homes on the hill. I can look in the schoolyards among the knots of angry boys who sometimes bloody one another's noses, or possibly in the stooped ranks of the weathered floriculturists who weed the town's iris beds.
Maybe I should go back to Edgemont Park and walk the oval that surrounds the great lawn. Little Ben, my Ben, the younger of two, will soon play ball there, just as his brother and uncles did, hitting home runs that roll along the greensward toward the pond where the white swan no longer swims.

HEADLINE: Building the Electronic Superhighway

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
AMID all the sweetness and light at Bill Clinton's seminar on the economy last month came a not-so-harmonious exchange between Robert E. Allen, chief executive of A.T.&T., and Al Gore, then Vice President-elect.
The topic was the development of Mr. Clinton's No. 1 priority for improving the country's infrastructure: a national "superhighway" for data. This high-capacity, high-speed computer network could do for the flow of information -- words, music, movies, medical images, manufacturing blueprints and much more -- what the transcontinental railroad did for the flow of goods a century ago and the interstate highway system did in this century. 
 Mr. Gore said the enormous network of fiber-optic cable and sophisticated switches should be built by the Government. Mr. Allen disagreed.
"I was hoping we'd have one disagreement before lunch," Mr. Clinton quipped.
Polite and brief though it was, the discourse got to the heart of a widening dispute among some of the nation's most powerful industries, the new Administration and public-interest advocates. That dispute is over how best to build, and control, a project widely viewed as a national resource that would improve education, health care, scientific research and the ability of corporations to compete in the world economy, among many other things.
On A.T.&T.'s side are the nation's other long-distance phone companies, which own and operate the nation's voice communications network quite profitably and stand to lose big if they suddenly face competition from a more advanced network they don't control. They argue that the data superhighway should be built, owned and operated by private companies, including themselves. Agreeing with the long-distance carriers is a diverse group including opponents of industrial policy and those who say that Government can't afford to pay for a data superhighway, that a viable network could be fashioned much less expensively from the current telephone network.
 
Gore's Argument
 Mr. Gore argues that the private sector won't gamble on such a risky investment. Even if it did, he says, it would build not a superhighway available to all but rather a kind of private toll road open only to a business and scientific elite. He says a new national data highway should be a public network constructed and regulated by the Government for all Americans. Indeed, the whole project would be a key test for the industrial policy that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore view as a way to revive the economy.
The regional Bell operating companies, which could profit by delivering the data from the superhighway to homes and businesses, might well support Mr. Gore because they think the Government can get the superhighway up and running most effectively. Public-interest advocates for groups like the nation's librarians and educators also support a large Government role to prevent them from being excluded from the network.
Also on Mr. Gore's side are computer makers like I.B.M., Apple and Digital Equipment, which hope to gain as the network creates a greater demand for new computers. Like the Bell companies, they think the Government can make the superhighway happen most quickly. Businesses offering information services, like Prodigy, Compuserve and America Online, take a similar view.
The data superhighway will carry data on hair-thin glass fibers at thousands of times the speed of today's digital systems and will link a computer user at home or work to a multitude of services that are either not available today or are time consuming, difficult to use and expensive.
As now envisioned, when the data superhighway is finished early in the next decade, a student whose local library proved inadequate for research could tap into an enormous electronic library once available only to elite scholars. Someone with a personal computer could ask a supercomputer far away to help solve a complex problem. Health care could become more efficient because computerized patient records, containing not just words but X-rays and other medical images, would be instantly available to any hospital or clinic; a faraway specialist, for example, could therefore make recommendations in a local case. Scientists, engineers or product developers far from each other could collaborate because their computer screens would become a sort of electronic blackboard for everyone to work on.
A couch potato could summon any movie ever made by pushing a button. Working at home could become a snap because one's personal computer could retrieve and manipulate information just as fast as the office work station; communicating with fellow workers would be far more natural because the network could handle videophone conversations.
The data superhighway will also alter the way manufacturers work with customers and suppliers by allowing the huge volume of orders and records that now go back and forth on paper to be exchanged electronically. Mr. Gore also thinks dozens of information industries will be spawned, promoting economic growth.
"What we are talking about is nothing less than a revolution in the way we communicate," said Lawrence H. Landweber, a University of Wisconsin computer scientist who has been a leader in developing an early version of the data superhighway. "The complexity of the task is so great that it is absolutely essential that government and industry work together."
 
An Existing Version
 A primitive form of the data superhighway already exists. Construction began in 1969 when the Department of Defense financed the design of a computer network to link a handful of universities, research laboratories and military bases. Since then, that has mushroomed into a matrix of more than 9,000 interlocking networks communicating over existing telephone lines and touching down in 102 countries. Today, most of these networks are still used by the Government, universities and research laboratories to communicate and share information. But there is also a rapidly growing number of businesses offering information services and electronic mail to companies and individuals.
Although there are no accurate estimates, it is widely thought that more than 10 million people are connected over the global network, which has come to be called the Internet. Some estimates indicate that the number of people connected is now doubling annually.
 
What Is Needed
 But the Internet conveys data much too slowly and does not reach enough people to have the kind of impact that Mr. Gore envisions.
Creating a much faster data highway that reaches as many homes and businesses as today's telephone network would solve that, but it will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The nation's long-distance and local telephone switches cannot handle the flood of data that would be carried over the superhighway, and must be upgraded. And the nation's copper phone wires must be replaced by higher-capacity fiber-optic cables; that has already happened for long-distance lines, but not for local telephone lines that connect homes and businesses to the closest switching center. Finally, software must be developed that would allow such huge amounts of data to move effortlessly over such a complex network, and allow tasks like transmitting X-rays or video from a teleconference.
 
The Gore Proposal
 Mr. Gore, whose father championed the nation's interstate highway system in Congress, argues that a data superhighway should be built by the Government and then operated by private industry. The result could be a powerful competitor for the long-distance carriers.
His scenario resembles what has happened with the Internet: Government financing paid for the construction of the network, but virtually all of the services are being provided by the private sector, under the supervision of the Government.
So far, however, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have not articulated a detailed plan. Henry H. Perritt Jr., a member of the Clinton Administration transition team on telecommunications issues and a law professor at Villanova University Law School, thinks that a plan will emerge quickly, perhaps within 100 to 200 days.
But he suggested that the Government would play an active role in building a data superhighway. "I think the telecommunications industry is not moving very rapidly," Mr. Perritt said. "If the Federal Government sets out to build a high-speed digital infrastructure, that will be a kind of competitive spur. You will have competition between private and public sectors and that would be a wonderful thing for the infrastructure."
The kind of Government-industry cooperation that Mr. Gore envisions can perhaps best be seen in legislation he pushed through Congress two years ago as a Senator. Called the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, it authorized $2.9 billion in financing over five years for the development of a National Research and Education Network (N.R.E.N.).
If completed, that network would raise the capacity of the Internet to more than 3 billion bits -- the equivalent of 300 copies of "Moby Dick" -- per second, up from 45 million bits, the capacity of the current backbone of Internet. Today the N.R.E.N. projects consist of five Federally financed "testbed" centers where industry and university researchers are developing techologies for a data superhighway.
In short, the Government is financing the development of advanced technology that may be the basis for the data superhighway. What isn't clear, however, is who will finance the construction of the network, who will own it and how it will be regulated.
Mr. Allen of A.T.&T. is comfortable with the Government's role in developing new technology but is uncomfortable with the Government's building a network that would compete with that of the phone companies. That should be left to private communications and computer companies, which are already rapidly deploying new kinds of data networks, he feels.
"I think the Government should not build and/or operate such networks," Mr. Allen said at Mr. Clinton's economic seminar. "I believe that the private sector can be and will be incented to build these networks."
Mr. Allen has company. Although the rapid growth of computer networks has been subsidized to a significant degree by the Government, many computer executives think future Federal investment in building networks is wrongheaded.
"The Government should declare victory and get out," said Mitchell D. Kapor, a computer industry pioneer who co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The Washington-based foundation is conducting a campaign to persuade state and Federal officials that the quickest way to a data superhighway is to permit the deployment by the phone companies of a digital technology called Integrated Services Digital Network (I.S.D.N.).
Deploying this technology would offer a shortcut by using existing copper telephone cables to enable every home in America to have computer communications as easily as using a telephone and for just about the same price. But while the technology is largely developed, many people think it isn't fast enough, and the phone companies have run into problems in winning approval from state public utility commissions on the proper rates to charge.
Mr. Kapor said the I.S.D.N. could be easily upgraded to a higher capacity once new markets open. Those who back him say I.S.D.N. is the best solution in light of the difficult economy facing the Clinton Administration.
"Everybody sees a big feeding trough, but I'm not sure where the money is coming from," said David Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computer scientist who was a creator of the original proposal to build the experimental N.R.E.N. with Government financing.
Some economists wonder whether huge Government investment in a data superhighway will be wasted because there is no strong evidence that markets exist for the services it would offer. They point to costly commercial failures like the Bell Laboratories Picture Phone fiasco of the late 1960's as well as the failure of the SBS broadband corporate satellite network of the late 1970's.
But Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore and Robert B. Reich, the new Secretary of Labor, all favor long-term investment in infrastructure and are likely to take a more activist approach than their Republican predecessors toward Government involvement in areas like building telecommunications networks.
Their view is cautiously supported by the regional Bell operating companies, which have been urging the Government to build a "backbone" for a data superhighway that they could then extend to homes and businesses using additional fiber-optic cable and switches that would be the equivalent of feeder roads.
Other industry and public-interest groups think there is room for a large Government role in building the network. This month members of a computer manufacturers' group called the Computer Systems Policy Project, which includes I.B.M., Apple and Digital, called for the creation of a Government entity to be chaired by Mr. Gore and called the National Information Infrastructure Council.
The council would direct Government spending, possibly more than $3 billion annually, for computer-network development as well as for existing Federally developed networks that are part of the Internet.
Electronic information services and other businesses that would use the data superhighway argue that private industry has been slow in developing it and that Government involvement is necessary to create the market for advanced networks.
"Your perspective on this depends on whether you already own a network or not," said Stephen Case, president of American Online, a commercial information service that has recently connected to the Internet. "There needs to be a core infrastructure and I don't care how we get there. If the Government kick-starts the market it will happen more quickly, and that makes sense."
This kind of spending, according to some economists and industry executives, would help create markets that are not now being pursued by private industry because of the prohibitive costs of developing new technologies.
 
The Public Interest
 Perhaps the organizations most concerned about losing out if the Government does not play a big role in the data superhighway are libraries, schools, hospitals and other public institutions.
If the highway is built and run by private interests without significant Government investment, these institutions might not be able to afford hooking up to the network.
"There is the danger of the public interest being lost here," said Carol C. Henderson, deputy director of the Washington office of the American Library Association. "We see libraries as the public institution available everywhere that could be the safety net for those who can't afford such access."
Indeed, said Marc Rotenberg, Washington director of the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, "in the final analysis the success of Gore's information superhighway won't be measured by frames per second but by who has access and on what terms. Those are the real policy questions."
 
 
REVOLUTIONIZING THE WAY WE DO THINGS
 THE primitive version of the data superhighway known as the Internet has already become a way of life for some students, teachers, researchers, government officials, office workers and executives.
It foretells the coming of a world in which virtually all aspects of modern life, from shopping to making medical diagnoses, will take place electronically.
In the future, say advocates of Vice President Al Gore's data superhighway, with the advent of extremely fast computer networks connected to homes and businesses, we will be able to order any movie with the press of a button rather than going to the video store. Medical specialists in the best hospitals will be able to help doctors in remote areas after examining X-rays and MRI scans over the network.
Inexpensive videoconferencing will make it possible for employees to work from home or avoid traveling, saving them time and cutting traffic in urban areas.
Even today's lower-speed Internet has had a remarkable impact on the way people learn and share information. Following are some examples.
* Michael Hawley, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, now routinely browses through a digital version of the Library of Congress catalogue from his computer work station in his office in the school's media laboratory. When he finds a book he wants, he simply orders it from a bookstore connected to the Internet; it arrives the next day by overnight mail.
* High school students who have access in increasing numbers to the Internet from computers at their schools are finding that it changes the way they do research.
Asked to do a term paper on the bombing of Hiroshima recently, one student in Washington connected to a database in a university's computer. There he found a reference to a second computer database, in Hiroshima itself. Without leaving his classroom terminal, he obtained transcripts of eyewitness accounts of the bombing from interviews with survivors.
* Perhaps the most important facet of the Internet is that it has created what computer researchers call virtual communities. These are computerized conferences that bring together people with shared interests in business, research and hobbies.
For example, David Kahaner, a Navy researcher who has lived in Japan for several years, has regularly passed detailed reports over the Internet to American researchers on the latest technical advances in Japan.

An early form of the data superhighway already exists. Called the Internet, it is the world's largest data network, accessible in more than 100 countries. Below is some of what's available on the network:
DIGITAL LIBRARIES A vast library accessible to virtually anyone at minimal cost is being assembled. Ambitious projects are under way to make much of the world's literature available electronically.
DATABASE PUBLISHING The major commercial databases, like Dialog and Mead Data Central, are now available over the Internet.
ELECTRONIC MAIL Electronic messages can be exchanged with millions of users worldwide. MCI, A.T.&T, Compuserve, America Online and Prodigy all offer electronic-mail connections to the Internet.
ELECTRONIC COMMUNITIES The Internet allows what computer researchers call virtual communities -- conferences through the computer that attract people of common interests around the world.
 SOFTWARE ACCESS Software programs, even large ones, can be copied from one machine to another in seconds.
WEATHER INFORMATION Up-to-the-minute weather forecasts can be found for any city in the United States. Hourly updated weather-satellite digital photographs can be copied from a computer at the University of Illinois.
 ENTERTAINMENT "Interactive" computer games include chess and role-playing fantasy games called Multi User Dungeons. In the future, the Internet may carry video services such as television and movies as well as new forms of interactive entertainment.
 DATA EXCHANGE The Microelectronic Computers and Computer Technology Corporation now offers a service that allows corporations to exchange business information with suppliers and customers.

Sharing the Load, and Other Topics

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
READERS have written recently asking about sales commissions, fund performance data, tax-exempt funds and more. Following are some of their questions.
Question: How much of the sales commission do stockbrokers keep when they sell shares in load funds? 
 Answer: Broker compensation varies from firm to firm, but most brokers receive 30 to 45 percent of the sales load, said Dan Jamieson, who edits Registered Representative, a trade publication in Irvine, Calif. The fund sponsor normally takes 20 percent and the brokerage gets the remaining 35 to 50 percent.
At big brokerage houses, the percentage paid to a broker often is based on the broker's gross commissions: the more sold, the bigger the cut. The median in gross commissions for the industry is $225,000, and at that level a broker from Merrill Lynch, for example, would receive 32 percent, Mr. Jamieson said. Thus, a broker who sold $10,000 worth of shares in a fund with a 4.5 percent load would earn $144 on the sale.
Merrill discontinued the practice of paying brokers more for selling shares of its own funds several years ago, but many other big brokerages have not. A Paine Webber broker at the middle level in gross commissions would be paid 37 percent on outside funds and 47 percent for Paine Webber funds. Kidder Peabody would pay 40 percent on outside funds, 45 percent on in-house shares.
Funds are also sold by financial planners, insurance agents and others who are supervised by brokerages but basically run their own businesses as independent contractors. These people would receive 70 to 80 percent of a fund's sales load, Mr. Jamieson said. The balance would be split between the mutual fund and the brokerage.
Instead of upfront loads, some funds levy "12b-1 fees," which are intended to cover marketing expenses and normally range from a tenth of 1 percent to 1 percent of the value of an account every year. Because this could exceed the 8.5 percent legal cap for a front-end load over time, the Securities and Exchange Commission, beginning in July, will limit total 12b-1 fees paid to 7.25 percent, or 6.25 percent if funds also collect a 0.25 percent "servicing" fee. A broker's share of these fees usually follows the same payout schedules.
Q: The weekly table accompanying this column shows whether a fund is a no-load (NL), low-load (LL) or load (L) fund and then gives its performance over various periods. To interpret the figures correctly, I would like to know whether the returns are computed using the fund's net asset value or its total cost, including the sales charge. The second method would yield a lower but, in my viewpoint, more honest figure.
A: The New York Times table, like most published mutual fund performance data, does not factor front-end sales charges into total returns. Nor do the figures include any "back-end" loads or redemption fees, assessed when investors sell shares in a fund before a specified time, usually five or six years. Any 12b-1 fees, however, are figured in because they are treated as ordinary fund expenses. As you noted, accounting for front-end loads creates a smaller return on the investment because less of your money is used to buy fund shares; the table with this column demonstrates the results.
Q: When I used the Morningstar Mutual Fund Sourcebook to research tax-free bond funds, I noticed that Morningstar analysts credited the Dreyfus Municipal Bond Fund's strong performance to the fact that it owned many New York state and city issues. Given the fiscal problems in New York, how can this be?
A: Morningstar says its ratings are based on a fund's past performance, not on the current creditworthiness of its holdings.
Municipalities are clearly feeling the pressure of the recession, with budget problems and potential defaults, said Ralph Norton, editor of the Bond Fund Advisor in Woburn, Mass. But given the diversification built into funds, he adds, "I have no concerns about New York tax-free bond portfolios now; it's a big state with many different types of issues." In fact, he said, yields on all New York tax-free funds are extremely favorable right now, even for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket.
He suggests New York residents consider national municipal bond funds if they are leery of those that invest solely in their state, which do carry slightly more risk. Income from the national funds would be free of Federal taxes, and state and city taxes for New York residents on the portion in New York issues. (Funds provide this information to investors.) Right now, the Dreyfus Municipal Bond Fund, which has 15 percent in New York issues, yields 5.71 percent, or 7.93 for people in the 28 percent tax bracket (and 8.28 percent for those in the 31 percent bracket), compared with 5.25 percent for its New York Tax-Exempt Bond Fund, or roughly 8.68 percent for state residents.
Note: Many readers have asked how to contact funds mentioned in the column. Most have toll-free telephone numbers, which can be obtained by calling (800) 555-1212. Comprehensive fund information, including telephone numbers and addresses, can be found in the Morningstar Mutual Fund Sourcebook, available in some libraries.

It's 1993. Is Your Office Outmoded?

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
BY commission or omission, how offices look is no coincidence. Most Fortune 500 companies are organized and furnished by design. Decisions about who goes where and gets what perk are deliberated. Smaller businesses have tended to cobble their corporate look as they grow and develop, but how the use of office space evolves still reflects, de facto, relationships between co-workers and their differential access to power.
A nifty new book called "Office Access" is designed to guide businesses through the tricky waters of planning an office, from the sublimina of distributing offices to the nuts and bolts of choosing curtain fabrics or lighting fixtures. 
 True to its name, it makes accessible what might be called the semiotics of office design -- what the position of a desk means, say, or the proximity of one person to another. It is intended for smaller businesses -- the biggest growth segment of the economy -- wanting to be more deliberate about spatial relationships. But because the book throws down a challenge to conventional thinking about space, it could certainly find a home at larger companies too.
"Office Access" was commissioned by Steelcase Inc., a maker of office products based in Grand Rapids, Mich., and is being brought out by a San Francisco information and electronic publishing firm that goes by the name TheUnderstandingBusiness (or TUB). The book will look familiar to anyone who has used TUB's distinctive, graphics-happy "Access" city guides. As in those books, text shares equal billing with photographs, columns of epigrams and data-rich charts and diagrams.
The book's writers -- a committee, according to Mark Johnson, TUB's president and creative director -- don't quibble with the truism that space and proximity are indexes of power. But they observe that the evidence of outmoded management thinking is obvious in many corporate environments. Some of the misguided assumptions about the best way to organize the office:
* Title and organizational status should determine the location, size and furnishings of an office. Until recently, it may not have mattered that vice presidents -- of whatever -- were removed, perhaps by several floors, from the people who work for them or, by walls and secretaries, from their peers. Under today's management styles, executives should see continuities between departments. Woe betide the marketing exec who doesn't understand finance. And the book raises the question implicit in the current enthusiasm for managing by walking around: "How effective can you be if you're away from the action?"
* People who do the same functions should be grouped together. A holdover from the days when managers thought "little people" like accountants or salespeople ought to be segregated for efficiency. It makes more sense to assume that people in different jobs, like executives in different divisions, will learn from each other and apply what they learn to their own jobs. Companies can encourage encounters outside the immediate work group by, for example, weaving a path to the elevator through work stations.
* Coffee rooms, drinking fountains and lunchrooms are wasted space and possibly an invitation to poor work habits. Threats of layoffs and downsizing may give managers the upper hand, but whip-cracking is a mistake. "Office Access" asserts: "Good conversation breeds good ideas, and serendipitous conversation breeds the best ideas of all." In other words, work often continues during breaks and meals, when the employee theoretically is on his or her own time.

IF the book offers a guide to managerial philosophy on the macro level of allocating space, it also helps with the more prosaic decisions that everyone will have to live with day to day.
It offers suggestions for prevention and relief of carpal tunnel syndrome, by now well documented as a scourge of the millions of workers who use keyboards.
It also provides a guide to other potential irritations and threats to health. Deciding on the type of lighting, for example, may seem to be a "mere" technical problem, but as one of the book's charts indicates, the decision begins with the fact that there are several types of artificial light. And as other diagrams show, ambient light, wall surfaces, computer screens and glass create an almost infinite number of aggravating light-reflection-glare combinations. Which makes light -- as in simple old fiat lux  -- one of the most complicated elements of office design.
Mr. Johnson cautions that the book is not intended to be a substitute for an architect or a design consultant. But what it clearly can do is prepare a company to work with the pros when they arrive.
"Office Access" ($12) will be in bookstores in early February.
 
 
SOME OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS
 "OFFICE ACCESS" ends with an inventory of questions businesses should consider before redoing office space. A sample follows.
How does your office renew and reward people's performance? How are people motivated to work effectively? Is everyone on a career path? What type of management style reigns? Is work team-oriented and does the office physically make it easy for people to work together?
How are people organized in terms of proximity? Are they placed near others whose work they support? Does everyone have access to equipment like copiers and fax machines? Is there a place for quiet work? Is it easy to get from office to office?
What kind of structure does your company have? Do people's job titles match their job descriptions and their responsibilities? Do employees have any say over their environment? Does everyone have enough room?
Are your office seats comfortable? Is there a lot of sneezing and illness in the office (possible indicators of poor air quality)? Are glare and reflections a problem? Is work compromised by lack of privacy? Are there any views? Can they be shared by everyone?

When Inflation Hits the Gallop -- Duck

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA

 BODY:
INVESTING during high-inflation times is apparently fun only for the short sellers. When the consumer price index soared 1.8 percent in August 1973, tobacco stocks dropped 8 percent, and drug issues lost 8.5 percent in a single month, said Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a research firm in New York. In August 1974, the price index jumped 1.2 percent and electrical equipment stocks lost 20 percent while retailers dropped 16 percent, he added.
"The upshot of it is that there aren't a whole lot of things you can buy that make sense" when inflation is high, said Mr. Birinyi. Investors get more maneuvering room when price increases are minimal -- or when inflation has actually been negative. 
 In the five months between January 1970 and September 1992 when prices actually declined, auto, retail and tobacco stocks rose. Just now, inflation is holding at historically low levels and autos especially are doing well. The bears, no doubt, are hoping for some reckless Democratic spending to get inflation rolling again.

A Fairy-Tale Scenario for the Nikkei

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
CALL it the Theory of the Royal Rally.
Over the past year, the best that could be said of the Japanese stock market was that it was floundering. When it was not floundering it was generally plummeting, as it has been for three years, and most analysts predict more of the same for 1993. The economy is in recession, banks are mired in bad loans and a Government stimulus package of public works spending has had no apparent impact. 
 But now some think that with all earthly remedies exhausted, help may have arrived from a higher power -- Japan's imperial family. After an embarrassingly protracted seven-year search, Crown Prince Naruhito has found a bride. His engagement to the Harvard-educated diplomat Masako Owada was formally announced last Tuesday.
Some economists and analysts wasted no time in proclaiming this just the thing to revive the stock market. Researchers at Nippon Life Insurance reckoned that a revival in consumer confidence and increased buying spurred by the wedding, expected in June, could add as much as one percentage point to the anemic economic growth rate this year.
Travel agents are reportedly already planning royal tours to Oxford, where both Miss Owada and the prince studied. Department stores are watching carefully what she wears to introduce new lines of clothes copying her styles. Commemorative stamps, gold coins and even a special cigarette are anticipated.
Some are betting that the stock price of companies like Tasaki Shinju, a major pearl producer and distributor, will soar as young women begin wearing strings of thumbnail-sized pearls, as the princess-to-be has.
"The news will loosen up the wallets of housewives," said Rokuro Ishikawa, head of the Japan Chamber of Commerce.
It is a nice idea, but in fact investors do not seem to have bought it, at least not yet. The Nikkei stock index closed Friday at 16,336.81, down 201.87, little changed from the beginning of this year. "This whole idea has gotten some credence because there's very little else out there," said Jeff Bahrenburg, the stock market strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. "It's a straw to grasp."
"It's iffy, but conceivable," said Mike Allen, the retailing analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities here. "But if you see retail sales pick up it won't be because of the wedding. It'll just be a coincidence. We have yet to hit bottom in my view."
The more pessimistic assessments begin with the fact that the market remains, by some measures, extremely expensive. The ratio of stock prices to that of the expected earnings per share of companies is slightly more than 50, down from more than 60 three years ago but some four times the level in the United States.
The dividend yield of Japanese stocks, relative to stock prices, is slightly less than 1 percent, about a third that on Wall Street. That does not strike many analysts as a market that has hit bottom.
After three years of declines, however, one of the worst problems is that the market is dead: volume is about a tenth of its peak level four years ago. There is not enough investor energy to move the market significantly either way, some say. If anything, the only thing keeping it above 16,000, many agree, is concerted buying by Government-controlled pension and trust funds.
Banks, through which the Government does most of its stock buying, purchased a total of more than 600 billion yen, or nearly $5 billion, worth of stock in November and December last year. That compares with net sales of 527 billion yen by all other sources in that time -- a sign that the only real buying at the moment may be by the Government.
There is, in fact, an open debate within the Finance Ministry over the wisdom of continued intervention, officials say. "There's a sort of paralysis," said Alan Bell, deputy head of research at Baring Securities here. "Over all, there's just no impetus to go anywhere."
In Mr. Bahrenburg's view, this has resulted in part from the Government's continuous intervention. In addition to the buying by Government-controlled trusts, officials have pressured institutions not to sell their shares and trigger another big decline. The institutions have shown restraint, but that has contributed to the dearth of trading.
Mr. Bahrenburg rates as high the chance that the market will drop to 14,000 in the next few months -- near its low last year. There is even a chance, he added, that a panic could push the market down further than that. But he added that the Nikkei average is likely to climb to 20,000, although well after the imperial wedding.
Mr. Bell's range for the year is similar; he puts the top at 21,000 on the Nikkei index. But he is much more sanguine about the prospects for picking individual stocks that will perform better than the overall market.
"The general paralysis does not extend to every individual stock," he said. "There is tremendous potential for individual stocks if you pick carefully."
In particular, he said, he likes stocks of companies that have done very poorly over the past couple of years but have now taken measures to improve their businesses. These include Nissan and Isuzu, which announced recently that it is getting out of general auto production.
"I'm looking for companies that were doing badly," Mr. Bell commented. "The evidence is beginning to come through that some of them are turning themselves around. But any connection to this wedding is purely coincidental."

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
It's Comedy at Night After McKinsey by Day

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
IT'S January. The Bills are on their way to the Super Bowl. There's bombing in Baghdad. And another Stuart Flack play is poised to open in Buffalo.
Swelling the small audience at the Alleyway Theater next Thursday night will be a number of business consultants from McKinsey & Company, the New York-based management firm whose offices ring the globe and whose client roster boasts some of the biggest of big businesses. 
 The consultants will be on hand not to advise the tiny Alleyway Theater on strategic alliances or on how to market its plays on a weekend when everybody is glued to the tube, but to cheer the aspiring playwright who happens to be a colleague.
This is the second comedy by Mr. Flack to be staged since he joined McKinsey as a public relations executive in May 1990. Loosely based on the real life kidnapping of several students working with the primatologist Jane Goodall in the mid-1980's, "Peaceful Creatures" is set in a steamy African rain forest teeming with America-loving terrorists, endearingly inept pols, morally myopic scientists and deviant chimps.
Mr. Flack, at 32, is anything but the stereotypical struggling artist with a day job. Married to another McKinsey employee, Claudia Eisen, he relishes the business of business. A former Forbes writer, Mr. Flack helps McKinsey's 400 partners cope with press requests for interviews and information. Most of his time is spent promoting McKinsey's research findings, including negotiating contracts for books by McKinsey consultants, drafting Congressional testimony and pitching McKinsey research to the editors of the Harvard Business Review.
The son of a teacher and a businessman in the floor-covering trade in Evanston, Ill., Mr. Flack says "the economic dimension of people's lives" is just as important as their inner, emotional lives. "People who write plays all try to understand human psychology," Mr. Flack said. "How can you depict life and teach people, which is what the theater is about, without a full understanding?" He sees having a full-fledged business career as a way "to immerse yourself."
In addition to business, Mr. Flack immerses himself in basketball, bridge and the banjo, as well as reading about science and economics. His hero? Brecht.
Combining the pursuit of the muse with that of money was actually the theme Mr. Flack tapped for his first play, which was also staged off-off-off Broadway at the Alleyway for no other reason than that that was the theater that booked it. The subject of "American Life & Casualty" is an imaginary meeting between two highly successful insurance executives returning on a train from a Harvard-Yale football game. One is the poet Wallace Stevens, the other the pioneering American composer Charles Ives.
What made Stevens and Ives so intriguing, said Mr. Flack, was that they were truly dedicated to their business careers, from which they made a lot of money, while at the same time being devoted to their art. Ives, in particular, who was almost evangelical in his enthusiasm for selling life insurance, built a highly successful agency and wrote an influential book called "The Amount to Carry." Stevens, a surety claims lawyer who achieved much more fame as a poet during his lifetime than Ives did as a composer, turned down numerous offers to teach poetry that would have involved quitting the insurance business.
"What occurred to me if they actually met," said Mr. Flack, "is that neither would tell the other he was an artist because they would have been embarrassed."
When Stevens, who has taken Ives home with him after the latter apparently suffers a heart attack on the train, learns from his clerk that Ives is a composer, he shouts: "An artist and an insurance man . . . good God!"
The point of the play, as Mr. Flack puts it, is that "you can't confuse the token of the thing with the thing itself, the artist with a certain life style that you associate with being an artist."
Mr. Flack is already at work on a new play, squeezing in as much time as he can writing on nights and weekends, largely between bouts of play with his 2-year-old son, Nathaniel. The new play is based on Denton Cooley, the larger-than-life millionaire Texas heart transplant surgeon who filed for personal bankruptcy a couple of years ago.
"Good dramatic characters contradict themselves," said Mr. Flack. "There's an omnipotence to being the world's greatest heart surgeon. Yet there's a certain incompetence in mishandling your finances so badly that you go bankrupt on $8 million a year."
Mr. Flack's commitment to his job is also a realist's decision. From Arthur Kopit, the author of the Broadway hit "Oh Dad, Poor Dad" for whom Mr. Flack once worked as an intern, he learned that making a living, even as a very successful playwright, was dauntingly difficult. At Joe Allen, the theater district restaurant where he recently discussed his playwright ventures, Mr. Flack pointed out that the posters adorning the restaurant's walls were all for Broadway shows that had closed after a single night.
"In the theater, a thousand things go wrong," said Mr. Flack. "My first play opened during the Gulf War when the Bills were in the Super Bowl."
Mr. Flack did try going the normal route of more casual day jobs. Once, while trying to complete "American Life & Casualty" in the mid-80's, he teamed with a former bridge partner and stockbroker in Vermont who wanted to run a $10 million investment fund while he was attending Dartmouth. Mr. Flack's job, in return for rent, was to execute trades based on a so-called hedged portfolio strategy twice a day, once after breakfast, once after lunch.
"We were the only people in the world that were short Macy's when it was taken over," said Mr. Flack. "The guy in New York whose money it was would call us and scream: 'Where are you guys? In Vermont, in the middle of the woods?' "

HEADLINE: Men at Work

BYLINE: By DAN SHAW

 BODY:
FASHION shows, it turns out, are really just business meetings with music.
Most of the 250 people who crowded into Donna Karan's gold-colored showroom on Tuesday morning to preview her fall men's wear collection were conservatively dressed in safe, serious dark suits. "This is what's wrong with men's wear in this country," said Garth Condit, a fashion stylist, surveying the room filled with the most influential men's wear buyers, editors and retailers in the United States. "I feel like a freak in my sweater. Everyone here looks like he has to rush back to the bank after the show." 
 Except for Liza Minnelli, the token celebrity (who sat in the place of honor next to Ms. Karan's husband and muse, Stephan Weiss), the crowd consisted of people who earn their living buying and selling, praising and damning, photographing and accessorizing clothes.
It was a busy week for them, with nine men's wear shows, which ranged from intimate showroom presentations to a lavish production at the New York Public Library.
Many in the audience at Donna Karan had just returned from four days of shows in Milan, Italy -- where they had seen Edwardian silhouettes, romantic ruffled shirts and velvet jackets -- and they were eager to see a down-to-earth, hometown collection.
Ms. Karan did not disappoint them. It was her first full runway show for the two-year-old Donna Karan Menswear company, and she went all out. She hired 35 models -- tall, tanned and toned guys with names like Lance, Haskell, Zane and Luciano -- to model the company's three lines: DKNY sportswear, her brand-new gold-label collection (suits in the $795 to $950 range) and her black-label couture (suits $1,250 and up).
"We're going head-to-head with Armani and Valentino now," said Linda Beauchamp, the president of Donna Karan Menswear.
The first model sent down the 64-foot-long runway wore a morning-after gaze and a blanket-plaid robe over a rayon nightshirt. He was followed by a procession of models in separates that might be called gentrified grunge -- gray wool jodhpurs tucked into brown leather combat boots, hand-knit Scandinavian-style sweaters, Henley shirts, union suits, shearling vests and paraffin-coated cotton overalls. The clothes looked like they could even be worn out on the street.
" A bsolutely gorgeous," said Jon Weiser, the president of Charivari, who watched part of the show through black Ray-Bans. "This is as good as anything in Europe. I'm proud for America."
Mr. Weiser was not sure whether his enthusiasm would translate into a big order, but he was encouraged because he thought the clothes looked expensive, which, he explained, is necessary when selling high-ticket items to men. "I always try to visualize writing a check for $2,000 plus tax for a suit when I'm putting in my orders," he said. "That's a hard check for anyone to write."
It was the first men's show Ellin Saltzman, the fashion director for Bergdorf Goodman, had attended in her 30 years in the business, and she was most impressed by something she rarely sees at women's shows: male models. "I was having a ball," she said. "I kept circling Stefano and Claudio's names on my program."
 
THE RIGHT-AND-LEFT GRIP
The men's-fashion establishment is a fraternity that even has its own handshake. As you shake with your right hand, you grab the other guy's right bicep with your left hand, rubbing it gently. It's a way of saying "Nice to see you, old chap," to check out the fabric of his jacket and to see if he's been lifting weights as often as he says he has.
 
THIS OLD THING?
"I don't know if people are looking at me because I'm a freak or because I look like Kiefer Sutherland," Jeffrey Uhl, a fashion associate at Details magazine, said on Wednesday, the second day of men's market week.
Actually, people were staring at Mr. Uhl last week because each day, his clothing seemed to be an oddly prescient, thrift-shop variation on the main runway show.
At Donna Karan's on Tuesday, he arrived in old mismatched tweeds, distressed brown leather boots and a sweater tied around his waist -- an outfit that Ms. Karan might have sent down her runway. "It's thoughtfully disheveled, which is why I liked the DKNY clothes so much," said Mr. Uhl, who is 26 and has a goatee and pomaded blond hair with a few strategically untamed tendrils.
On Wednesday, at John Bartlett's show, the week's poster boy was wearing another thrift-shop outfit of a totally different sort -- a navy Nehru vest over a gray suit jacket, with black ski pants ("I got them for $5 at Canal Jeans and they look like leggings") that were tucked into black motorcycle boots. It was an appropriately unorthodox combination, echoing Mr. Bartlett's iconoclastic designs.
On Thursday, Mr. Uhl put together a look that he called "corporate grunge" -- cutoff striped suit pants over long underwear, a blue pin-stripe suit vest and a gray pin-stripe Romeo Gigli jacket, which foreshadowed what Calvin Klein would show that afternoon.
Mr. Uhl, an Oklahoma native who studied feminist and Marxist sociology at the University of Chicago, mused about 20-something men and their relationship to fashion. "I think most guys want to have an interesting look," he said. "Eclecticism is big with us. We're doing a bizillion different things. There's a greater tolerance, which crosses sexual and religious lines."
 
WALKING THAT WALK
One of the problems with men's fashion shows has always been how to get the models to have a sexy strut without seeming feminine. This season, the fashions themselves provided the solution. The slow, deliberate, undulating walk that signals confidence and masculinity is an invariable result of strolling in a pair of thick-soled boots, and all the designers this season outfitted their models in them.
 
THE BOYS HAVE SOME FUN
Some of the models finally smiled Wednesday afternoon, during the small show of clothes by John Bartlett.
There were the accessories, like knit hats speared with a single plume, that could not be worn with a straight face. There was the music, including "The Hustle," which accompanied the showing of flared corduroy pants, and "The Lonely Goatherd," which accompanied Tyrolean jackets and von Trapp shirts. And then there were the props, like a giant sickle that a model in a soot-brown vest and drawstring mountain jeans carried as though he were a Lilliputian.
And why exactly did Mr. Bartlett design a handsome hooded winter coat based on the robes worn by Trappist monks?
"Monks," he said cheerfully, "are unbelievably sexy."
 
JUST BODY COVERING, AFTER ALL?
Ingrid Sischy, the former editor of Artforum and current editor in chief of Interview, was front and center at Joseph Abboud's megashow -- 109 outfits, 45 models -- at the New York Public Library on Tuesday evening. It was fashion in the round (actually, the stage was square) so that a lot of people could claim front-row seats.
The show attracted both the new guard, which is led by James Truman, the editor in chief of Details, and the old guard, which was represented by Nonnie Moore, GQ's fashion matriarch, and GQ's editor in chief, Art Cooper. Mr. Truman wore tapered trousers with zippers at the ankles, and Mr. Cooper had on a blue shirt with a white collar and an 80's yellow power tie.
Since Joseph Abboud is not known for cutting-edge design, it seemed odd that Ms. Sischy, a champion of the avant-garde, was in the audience.
"What's always interested me about Abboud is his lack of pretension," she said. "He faces up to the fact that clothes are how we get warm and keep us from getting arrested because we're walking around on the street naked."
Ms. Sischy was also impressed by Donna Karan's show. "There was a lot of rugged individualism there," she said. "It wasn't the man in the gray flannel suit. It's interesting to see how the definition of men is changing."
She's also wary of overanalyzing fashion phenomena. "Remember when pants dropped down on kids last year?" she said. "I thought you could think of it as recession wear. At the Gaultier show last fall, the pants were pulled up to the breasts, just about the time Bill Clinton's fortunes were rising. I've noticed some of the pants way high at the shows here, too. It might mean something about hope, or nothing."
 
MAN AS PROP
"The view from here is so weird," said Dave Howard, a model who was standing on a 20-inch-high platform on the second floor of the Guggenheim Museum SoHo, where GQ magazine had a party on Wednesday night. Dressed in layers of Andrew Fezza, Mr. Howard, who spent two hours staring at an untitled matte black triptych by Robert Rauschenberg, was glad that he hadn't ended up dressed in a wool sweater and scarf like some of the other fellows.
GQ had hired 24 models to stand on platforms throughout the galleries, and they looked like they didn't know why they were there or what they were supposed to be doing. Weren't they given any instructions as to how to act or what attitude to project? "The only thing they told us," Mr. Howard said, "was 'Don't get off.' "
 
SHOWER, SHAVE, LAYER AND TUCK
On Thursday, Tommy Hilfiger seemed to be predicting another energy crisis. At his showroom, which resembles one of his department-store boutiques, which resemble libraries in neo-Georgian mansions, he sent his models out in several layers of wool, plaid and tweed.
Mr. Hilfiger also seemed to be predicting a flood. Most of the models came down the runway wearing their pants tucked into their boots, which ranged from heavy black biker styles to knee-high Wellingtons. It was a show of classic preppy-inspired design mixed up in color-coordinated ways. In other words, dry-cleaned grunge.
 
BOX SEATS FOR THE FAMILY
It looked like lunchtime at the Royalton.
Calvin Klein's extended family -- Ross Bleckner, Tina Brown, Barry Diller, David Geffen, Fran Lebowitz, Ian Schrager -- crowded into his showroom Thursday afternoon. They all sat together, all in the front row, their Boswell, Billy Norwich, behind them. They were there to watch models with an "I'm stoned out of my mind" air amble down the runway wearing the new Calvin Klein Collection, the designer's most sophisticated and expensive men's line.
The clothes that were paraded past the crowd, which also included Tommy Tune, Miranda Richardson, Griffin Dunne and Phil Hartman (from "Saturday Night Live"), were not what you'd expect Marky Mark to wear. They weren't really clothes you'd expect to see on Mr. Geffen, either, whose trademark is a white T-shirt with a V-neck cashmere sweater, or on Mr. Diller, who favors banker's suits.
"They're clothes for men who like Matsuda and Comme des Garcons," said a magazine editor.
For aficionados who wanted to know which way the fashion winds will blow next fall, there was a very clear forecast: button only the top button of your three- or four-button suit jacket; wear your pants casually tucked into your leather chukka boots; throw a shawl over your suit; wear leather suspenders over your sweater or a thick wool vest over your suit jacket.
Outside on West 39th Street, models on their way to Paris for another round of men's shows looked for their radio cabs, while the taste makers held post-mortems.
"There's a little grunge, a little androgyny," said Michael Goff, the editor in chief of Out magazine, who had just returned from attending inaugural events in Washington. "It's really right for the Clinton years."

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Again -- and at Last -- a New Camaro

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
"In the 1960's, muscle cars were like the muscle men of the era: formidable, hulking presences dominated by brute strength. But the science of muscle has come a long way since then. Like today's bodybuilders, the 1993 Camaro is lean, finely proportioned and powerful. It's a muscle car for the Nineties."
 -- Chevrolet overview of the 1993 Camaro.
I HAVE been prowling through my computer, looking for notes on a conversation that is now more than a decade old. Electrons are amazing, and I actually found what I was looking for.
It turns out that it has been 11 years since that sunny morning when the late Pete Estes and I stood talking in the outdoor dining area of Tavern on the Green in Central Park. Estes was then about to retire as president of General Motors, and he had come to New York to show off his final creation, Chevy's 1982 Camaro.
I remember discussing the crucial need for better fuel economy. The new Camaro was lighter than its predecessor but still heavy enough to have displeased the critics. Estes agreed, noting that the engineers had only scratched the surface.
"So far, we've done the easy part," he said. "We got rid of the fat. The rest is going to be tougher."
Aha! And now there is a new Camaro, the fourth generation, exactly 100 pounds heavier than the '82 model, but of the modern ilk, which is to say that it looks nothing like Camaros of the past. In the intervening years technology has taken the place of dieting and, heavier or not, the new car does go farther on a gallon of gas.
I remember expressing surprise, too, during that conversation with Estes, that G.M. had managed to get 10 years out of the same basic model. And his response was this: "It shows what you can do when you do it right in the first place."
In fact, the Camaro and its twin, the Pontiac Firebird, have always been exactly right for their markets, sporty cars that could be dressed inexpensively or in go-fast fashion, appealing both to low-end buyers and to hot-rodders. And the Camaro is still right, still with an available V8 engine to burble pleasantly and to drive the rear wheels, still fast even in its conservative standard mode.
The new car competes against the Toyota Celica, Nissan 240SX, Ford Mustang, Eagle Talon, Plymouth Laser and the Mitsubishi Eclipse, among others. According to Chevrolet, 50 percent of the buyers in the sporty-car segment are women, and nearly half of Camaro's principal drivers are female, a figure that drops to 30 percent for the high-end Z28.
Both the Z28 and the standard car are hatchbacks, and the base coupe carries a 160-horsepower V6. The Z28, with a 5.7-liter V8 under its hood, is as always a flat-out performance car, and it will give a Corvette a run for its money.
That is not surprising, of course, since the 5.7-liter power plant is the same basic engine that lives under the Corvette's hood. In the Camaro, it produces 275 horsepower, and its bulk fills the engine compartment.
The new 3.4-liter V6 delivers 20 horsepower more than was available in 1992's standard car, and it sends it to the road through a five-speed manual transmission. The V8 produces 30 more horsepower than last year, and it is coupled to a new six-speed manual. Four-speed automatics are optional with either engine.
For '93, rack-and-pinion steering has replaced the recirculating-ball system of the past in order to improve responsiveness and an "on-center" feel. Antilock brakes also are standard.
The fourth generation car was redesigned head to tail, and Chevrolet's literature says that "all classic Camaro design ingredients are evident." That is arguable, however, and the new model looks more like a Mitsubishi Eclipse than like anything else.
Part of that, at least in the case of the Z28, has to do with the paint scheme and the upper body. All Z28's have black roofs, and the darkly tinted glass makes the entire "greenhouse" look black. What has been retained from the past is the Camaro's tenacious stance, aggressive front end and brawny tires on 16-inch wheels.
The car is smooth but wedge-shaped. It rides on the same 101-inch wheelbase as the '92, but the body is longer, wider and taller. Sideview mirrors are fared into the front fenders, and a spoiler is integrated into the rear hatch. Trim is of the blackout variety, and the headlights nestle in black pockets.
The new Camaro makes extensive use of dent-resistant, rustproof body panels. The roof, doors, hatch and spoiler assembly are made of sheet-molded compound, and the front fenders, and nose and tail pieces also are made of composite material. Rust-resistant two-side galvanized steel is used for the rear quarter panels and hood.
The hatch itself has a very high liftover, leading to a deep well just inside and then to a shallow cargo floor. Luggage capacity is not this car's long suit.
Space also is at a premium in the rear of the redesigned interior, and even small children are likely to complain. On the other hand, the cockpit is comodious, and the new front buckets -- available only in cloth -- are both commodious and supportive.
The black and white Z28 test car had a two-tone gray interior, nicely finished although abundantly plastic. The instrument panel sort of wraps around the driver, and the analog gauges, dominated by a 150-mile per hour speedometer, are easy to read.
A huge door covers a medium-size glove compartment, in which resides the remote button for the rear hatch. The console contains a small ashtray, a single cupholder and a bin whose cover serves as an armrest. The shifter, as always, is topped by a large round knob, now covered with leather.
As tested and loaded with options, the car carried a sticker of $19,098, although the base price for a Z28 is a more reasonable $16,779. The least expensive Camaro goes for $13,399, and the cars will begin arriving in dealerships early in February.
Oddly enough, they are "imports," coming from an assembly plant near Montreal. And they do now feel less like Detroit iron. The bone-jarring ride of the past is gone, as are many of the creaks and rattles that resulted from the huge metal doors. The new Z28 is tighter and a great deal more civilized than its ancestors.
On the road, though, there is still that slingshot acceleration. There is the taut suspension and good handling. And, of course, there is that wonderful rumble of a potent V8.
Like the '82 model that lasted almost unchanged for a decade, the newest Z28 has been named to pace the Indianapolis 500. And with the 77th running of the race on May 30, Chevrolet will set a record. In all, nine Chevies will have led the pack. Four of them, including the 1967 original, have been Camaros.

HEADLINE: Clinton Steps In, and the World Locks On

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
JUST three hours after President Clinton returned to the White House from his inaugural balls, Saddam Hussein's radar was back in action, locking on to American warplanes over Iraq. American pilots retaliated, but a similar confrontation occurred the next day. Suddenly, the Iraqi leader had maneuvered himself to the top of Mr. Clinton's dance card.
Two months ago, when reporters asked Mr. Clinton to define his foreign policy priorities, he ticked off an ambitious list: a multi-year plan for a defense budget, reducing nuclear weapons, ending the proliferation of biological and chemical weapons, continuing the Middle East peace process, strengthening global economic growth. 
 He later spoke of a "disciplined, aggressive approach" to foreign policy, using preventive diplomacy to head off global problems before they boil over and steal time from his cherished domestic goals.
In these grand visions, nothing was said about how to deal with international thugs.
But now, in the White House, his first need is to face down two of the most unsavory, Mr. Hussein in Iraq and Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia. And, it became evident last week, his team is not ready with a specific approach for dealing with either.
On domestic policy, Mr. Clinton showed an ability last week to quickly seize the initiative -- by cutting his losses in the failed nomination of Zoe Baird to be Attorney General, by signaling dramatic changes in policy on abortion and the presence of homosexuals in the military. But the crisis in Iraq clearly showed him at a disadvantage in his efforts to master the moment in foreign affairs.
The first difficulty in dealing with Mr. Hussein is that no one in the new Administration can figure out just what the Iraqi dictator is up to. When he started flouting allied restrictions on Iraqi flights and resisting other United Nations demands in recent weeks, it seemed a strictly personal challenge to George Bush in his final days in office -- a perverse way, perhaps, of saying goodbye.
But the irritation persists, and now it seems Mr. Hussein may have had something more in mind: a signal to the new Administration that even if he no longer has the force of a bully, he remains a relentless tease. Mr. Hussein's promise to abide by a cease-fire at first seemed a sort of diplomatic housewarming present for Mr. Clinton. But it was followed by the training of Iraqi radar on the allied patrols, and by the weekend it was impossible to determine whether the incidents were accidental or purposeful.
This teasing put pressure on Mr. Clinton and his foreign policy team to first do something Mr. Clinton has vowed to avoid: spend time trying to figure out what is in Mr. Hussein's mind. "Saddam sometimes likes to try everything at the same time," said Phebe Marr, a leading scholar on Iraq. "He could now come in with a charm offensive that would present a package of cosmetic concessions designed to elicit a response from the new Administration and to drive a wedge in the alliance. If the soft approach doesn't work, then there is little doubt he will revert to his pattern of probing, testing and challenging the will of Washington. He might do both at once -- as a reminder of how much trouble he can cause."
Indeed, the tactic of mixing reward and punishment -- ruthlessly suppressing his population while meeting the basic needs of the people who count -- is one that has helped Mr. Hussein survive so long. In his country, it is known as mixing "tarhib" (terror) with "targhib" (enticement).
In response, the Clinton Administration is struggling to come up with a mix of terror and enticement of its own, one that will put Mr. Hussein back in his box and keep him there. But there are deep divisions in the Administration about the best way to do this -- perhaps the inevitable byproduct of an election campaign in which foreign policy was deliberately played down and not worked out in detail.
One approach, espoused by Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is detachment: Avoid overreaction to Mr. Hussein and try to accept the status quo as a necessary product of a war that left the Iraqi leader in power. "You treat Saddam like a toothache," said a Pentagon official familiar with the general's thinking. "There are periods when it doesn't hurt as much as other times, but it just doesn't go away and you can never quite forget about it."
 
Keeping Hussein Cornered
 This is not essentially different from the Bush policy that Mr. Clinton has inherited: Keep Mr. Hussein cornered in the hope of eroding his power, rather than doing something more drastic and risking the dismemberment of Iraq.
A variant on this approach that is under discussion is to start with Mr. Bush's stated premise that Mr. Hussein must be ousted but then go further than Mr. Bush did by taking real steps to oust him. Vice President Al Gore was -- and may still be -- an advocate of this point of view, having written in 1991 that not only Mr. Hussein, but also his entire Baath Party apparatus, must disappear. Some of the tougher tactics that have been suggested include extending the ban on Iraqi military flights to the entire country and arming the Iraqi opposition with help from Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. But both steps were rejected last year by the Bush Administration and neither enjoys much support among the countries that would have to help.
A fundamental problem with this approach is that ousting Mr. Hussein has never been popular in the coalition that supported the gulf war. A number of allies might quietly agree today with the stunningly frank statement made on the eve of the war by Boutros Boutros-Ghali, then Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and now the United Nations Secretary General. Despite the passions of the moment, he said, Egypt could coexist, even cooperate, with Mr. Hussein.
A third approach might be called, as one official did, "the cake-and-eat-it approach." The goal would be to launch an essentially diplomatic initiative designed to take the focus off Iraq and allow more attention for Bosnia, which the Clinton Administration considers a more intractable problem. In a series of meetings last week, policy makers debated how to do this with a combination of diplomatic sticks (and perhaps carrots) that might persuade Mr. Hussein at last to abide by the United Nations resolutions intended to curb his power. Suggestions include creating a war-crimes tribunal and forcibly deploying human rights monitors throughout Iraq, Administration officials said. But keeping the alliance together is very time-consuming and containment doesn't offer a long-term solution for the Kurds in northern Iraq.
Still, in the long run, the Clinton team may be correct that the more difficult adversary to deal with will not be Mr. Hussein, who has already been isolated for two years, but Mr. Milosevic, the Serb leader in whose name ethnic cleansing is carried out in the Balkans.
 
An Inconsistency
 The new Administration has acknowledged that there is an inconsistency in turning the screws on Mr. Hussein but not on Mr. Milosevic. It finds itself caught between wanting the United Nations negotiations led by former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance to succeed in bringing peace to the Balkans, and fearing that the proposed settlement would only ratify Serbian aggression and atrocities. The contradiction was exposed last week when the Administration publicly expressed support for the Geneva-based negotiations while Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher expressed doubts through his spokesman that the peace plan will work.
In helping to shape new policies for both Iraq and Bosnia, Mr. Christopher, a lawyer, charged in his confirmation hearings that Democratic and Republican Administrations had "tolerated and supported dictators too long in many countries," and called for war crimes trials for atrocities in both Iraq and the Balkans.
He has also sought to distance himself from an image that lingers from his days as Deputy Secretary of State to Mr. Vance -- of being too much the litigator and too little accustomed to using force.
But there is reluctance among top Clinton Administration officials to state categorically that Mr. Milosevic cannot be negotiated with, just as there is an unwillingness to say that Mr. Hussein must go. And in neither Iraq nor the Balkans has the the new Administration gone beyond strategies for containment to consider how it might promote truly democratic, peaceful rule.

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
EVEN before taking the oath of office, President Clinton was bombarded with advice on how to deal with Russia and the other former Soviet republics. Most of it portrayed Boris N. Yeltsin as a critical and threatened bulwark against the revival of an evil empire. If the United States fails to shore him up, goes the argument, Russia could fall to Communists, fascists, revanchist generals or worse.
Yes, Russia is in a perilous state, and the risks this carries are indisputable. But not so long ago, many pundits were similarly arguing that only Mikhail S. Gorbachev's finger in the dike was keeping a new cold war at bay. In those days, Americans and other Western leaders kept the meddlesome Mr. Yeltsin at arm's length. Only a month before the August 1991 putsch, George Bush was still instructing the Ukrainians that their place was in a Soviet Union. 
 Of course, there are plenty of compelling reasons to support Mr. Yeltsin. He is likely to play the central role in Russian politics for some time to come, and he has demonstrated openness, courage and a dedication to change. Still, the struggle being waged in Russia is among ideas and interests far larger than any one man. And Mr. Yeltsin is no more the last word than Mr. Gorbachev was; there is no reason to assume that every alternative to him is terrible.
Within Russia's leadership, after all, the power struggle being played out so far is less a mortal contest between democrats and reactionaries than a tactical tug-of-war between shock therapists and gradualists.
The case of Yegor T. Gaidar is instructive. Many in the West had feared that his ouster as President Yeltsin's Prime Minister would deal a death blow to reform. But first, the West proved helpless to preserve him, and then it turned out that the new Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, may not be the reactionary many had feared. In fact, Westerners who have met him have been impressed by his openness and common sense.
This alone offers strong reason to think that the doomsday notion of a fascist dictatorship slouching toward Moscow is overblown. Some members of Mr. Yeltsin's entourage have tried to rouse such fears with dire warnings, most recently when Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev stunned an international conference in Stockholm with a prankish speech concocted from hard-line positions that he didn't really espouse. But among Russians, at least, such cries of "wolf" are increasingly dismissed as irresponsible.
None of this suggests that Russia is safely headed toward democracy and a free market, the goals Mr. Yeltsin has championed, or that the danger of dictatorship has been lifted. The unruly session of the Congress of Peoples' Deputies last month was enough to dispel any such illusions. But even the belligerency there was less an insurrection than a reflection of the boisterousness of Russia's political discourse. Extremists of left and right were isolated, and a large majority applauded when the chief Justice of the Constitutional Court proposed to mediate a pact between the legislature and the president.
Even without an immediate threat of dictatorship, of course, the political contests under way in Moscow are enormously important. The pace of change could well spell the difference between stability and instability. But it is not necessarily a contest in which the United States has to take sides. First, it is not clear whether Mr. Gaidar the shock therapist or Mr. Chernomyrdin the gradualist has the better chance of success. Second, Mr. Yeltsin himself has never made a clear choice. Third, there is little evidence that Washington could have much effect even if it did have a clear favorite. For all the fervent debates on American op-ed pages, foreign advisers are not all that influential in the Kremlin.
It is also worth noting that for all Russia's travails and spiritual dislocation, the people have proved surprisingly resistant to extremism. The National Salvation Front uniting the "reds" and "browns," (die-hard Communists and rabid nationalists) has attracted little support. Russia's most vocal fascist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is considered more a clown than a threat. Pamyat, the Russian nationalist organization that roused so much anxiety several years ago, is fragmented and all but defunct.
The more consequential struggle is among groups and interests not so easily classified as good or bad: These are the managers of state-owned industry, the military-industrial complex, the new entrepreneurs, the armies of bureaucrats, the disenfranchised soldiers, elected deputies, regional authorities, the agro-industrial complex, the ethnic minorities, Communist apparatchiks and many more. These are people who might speed or slow the pace of change, but none would easily cede power to a Zhirinovsky, or welcome back central control.
These forces are not inherently anti-West or anti-reform; rather, like the whole of the former Soviet society, they are little versed in the methods and rules of the world they seek to join. So it is with them that America and the West might have the most profound influence, simply by sharing their experience. Many a thoughtful Communist or industrial manager could benefit from exposure to a world that he has perceived until now only through hostile propaganda.
Americans in particular often do not appreciate how great a reservoir of good will the Russians and most other citizens of the former Soviet lands still hold for the United States. This is not the trite sort of "friendship among peoples" that the Communists used to preach, but a deep sense of kinship and admiration. America is still the most important foreign land to most Russians, the one against which they measure success and failure.
These sentiments carry power as great as any financial or humanitarian aid; the risk is that Americans could squander them through inadvertent condescension or dismissiveness, or by promoting a perception that the West is pillaging Russia's resources. Conversely, any gesture of solidarity or concern has a potentially far-reaching effect.
Financial aid is one obvious way to show concern, but magnanimity can also be free. Many Russian leaders were insulted, for example, that they were not consulted on the military actions taken against Iraq, even though these might have serious reverberations in Russian politics. And some diplomats in Kiev thought a touch of personal diplomacy by Mr. Bush would have gone a long way to get Ukrainian support for nuclear disarmament.
The argument here is less for any specific action than for a need to be sensitive to people who have suffered an extraordinary setback, a fractured nation facing the devastating realization that 70 years of its life have been misguided. It is not simply a question of honor or sympathy. Recent history offers compelling evidence that victory in war can be claimed only when the vanquished has not lost everything, including hope. The cold war is no different.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Lesson for a High-Tech President

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
IT is no mystery why Silicon Valley became Clinton country in last year's election. The Clinton Administration's style and policy pronouncements appeal to the people who labor in high-technology industries like software and semiconductors. The Clintonites talk technospeak, often at length. They aren't squeamish about declaring that some industries are more equal than others, or that these favored high-tech fields should get government help and taxpayers' money.
President Clinton arrives in Washington with an ambitious technology policy that calls for using government-backed research projects, tax incentives and trade policy to help high-tech industries become engines of economic growth and job creation. 
 But the future has an elusive quality in fast-changing technology fields, which raises questions about government's ability to help industry get there. Even Japan, often viewed as a model of high-tech industrial policy, hasn't had much luck lately. Its so-called fifth-generation computer project, so feared in the early 1980's, closed up shop recently, left in the dust by the private sector's pace of innovation. Similarly, Japan's high-definition television effort seems to have bet on yesterday's technology.
Perhaps the most vivid example of how quickly shifts in technology can change markets and assumptions is illustrated by the plight of the International Business Machines Corporation, the humbled giant of the American computer industry. Last week, I.B.M. reported a $4.97 billion loss for 1992, the largest in corporate history. Its work force has been slashed, the company's shares trade for less than half the price they did last summer, and some fear that I.B.M. may not be able to pull out of its slide.
Yet not so long ago, in the mid-1980's, the setting was very different. Back then, I.B.M. was the dominant force in the world computer industry. But the great worry in the American computer and semiconductor industries, and in policy circles, was the threat posed by Japan. The Intel Corporation, which makes microprocessor chips that serve as the brains of personal computers, was reeling from heavy losses.
A few years earlier, when Intel was first under pressure, I.B.M. made a big investment in it. This was an act of benevolent self-interest by I.B.M., supporting a key supplier and American semiconductor development.
For its part, the Japanese computer industry viewed I.B.M. as its White Whale. Catching up to I.B.M. was an obsession for Japan and every possible effort, legal or otherwise, was made to match it.
Today, not only is I.B.M. embattled, but the big Japanese computer makers have similar problems. Intel, meanwhile, is enjoying explosive growth as the demand surges for personal computers that use its chips. New, powerful Intel chips let small, cheaper computers replace larger ones.
So I.B.M. is being hurt not by its perceived enemy of a few years ago, Japan Inc., but by its old friend -- or, more precisely, by its inability to adjust to the technological pace set by other American companies.
There is a lively debate about why this happened to I.B.M. Still, whatever the cause, if I.B.M., with all its resources, could not keep up with the trajectory of change, what chance does government have of guiding technology development?
"A crisis like the one I.B.M. is going through raises questions about the kind of technology policy a nation should pursue," said Peter Cowhey, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of California at San Diego.
 
Synfuels to Data Highways
 In Mr. Cowhey's view, there has been an evolution in the thinking about technology policy. The first generation, he says, was the effort to back huge projects like the synthetic fuels plan of the late 1970's to do things like extract oil from shale. The next generation's idea, much discussed in America and actively pushed in Europe in the 1980's, held that Western nations needed to compete with Japanese industrial groups by backing similar groups and so-called national champions -- big corporations with the financial strength and research prowess to be technological standard bearers. I.B.M. long epitomized the national champion corporation.
The focus now is less on the structure of industries or on fostering technologies within single companies than on insuring that the United States has key technologies within its borders or access to them abroad.
The Clinton technology policy is a blend of infrastructure projects like a national optical-fiber telecommunications highway, spending on education to create a more skilled work force, tax incentives for investment in startup companies and aggressive use of trade policy to open foreign markets.
To nurture technologies deemed critical to the economy, government-industry collaborations would be encouraged, patterned after Sematech, which was founded in 1987 to develop American-made tools to make computer chips. The idea is that with private industry putting up at least half the money, there is far less chance of creating costly high-tech pork barrels.
To help pay for new programs, President Clinton plans a post-cold war shift in the Federal research-and-development budget away from defense, freeing up an additional $7 billion over three years.
The Administration's early positions on technology and trade policy owe much to the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy at the University of California at Berkeley, where the new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, was research director.
Government, said Michael Borrus, a co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable, should distinguish between a pervasive and essential technology, like semiconductors, which Washington should back, and a product, like high-definition television, which it should not.
Yet many economists warn that having government select target areas, even broadly, is risky. Washington, they say, should create an environment for innovation with policies that reduce the cost of capital, provide an ample pool of scientists and skilled workers and offer tax incentives for research. Bolster the nation's technological infrastructure, they advise, but then let companies and markets pick the projects.
"It doesn't mean there's nothing government can do," said Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at Harvard University, "but that you get precise at your peril."

Clinton's Blunt Reminder of the Mood That Elected Him

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE were many "if only" post mortems offered last week after President Clinton was forced to withdraw the nomination of Zoe Baird as Attorney General in the first, dramatic failure of his Administration.
If only she had not been an exceedingly well-paid corporate lawyer, her nomination might have survived despite her admission that she hired two illegal aliens for child care and household help. If only she had a more expansive track record on traditionally liberal issues that would inspire support from feminists or other core Democratic constituencies. If only her name had not been introduced at the last minute as Mr. Clinton cast desperately about for an appointment that would demonstrate his commitment to diversity. 
 One White House official even mused that if only Ms. Baird had been considered by the Senate earlier, she might have been approved on the first wave of goodwill that allowed Senators to ignore the questions raised about other nominees.
"If her hearings had been on Jan. 6 and Ron Brown's had been on Jan. 19, there would have been opposite outcomes," the official said.
"Any one of these nominations could have blown up in a similar way," said another Clinton adviser. "There were plenty of other time bombs."
Mr. Brown's violations, of course, were ethical rather than legal. The new Secretary of Commerce seemed to be too cozy with the industries he was overseeing and with his tony Washington law firm.
Ms. Baird had admitted breaking the law to Mr. Clinton's transition officials and yet was still in line to become the nation's top law enforcement officer. Many of the people who elected Mr. Clinton felt that by nominating her, he broke a compact with them. But their complaints, in interviews and in phone calls to radio and television call-in shows, centered more on the fact that she cut corners than that she broke the law.
And Mr. Clinton, who spent the last year warning against taking for granted average people who "work hard and play by the rules," appeared in his first days in office to be doing just that. He has been found guilty of the gravest error for a man who campaigned on a platform of change: conducting business as usual.
Conducting business as usual sank John Tower's nomination four years ago. Although he was accused of excessive drinking and womanizing, his star really fell because he came to represent all that is smarmy about the nation's capital.
In stanching the flow of criticism before it reached the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Clinton may have taken his cue from James A. Baker 3d, the former Secretary of State, Treasury Secretary and White House chief of staff who headed off a scandal of his own in 1989 by announcing that he would sell his stock in Chemical New York Corporation, a bank holding company that had made billions of dollars in loans to third world countries.
The point of Mr. Baker's announcement was to demonstrate his commitment to high ethical standards by erasing any perception of conflict of interest before the notion took hold in Washington. John Sununu, the White House chief of staff who stubbornly ignored signs that his penchant for using Government-paid transportation for private purposes would be debilitating, could have taken a lesson from Mr. Baker.
He did not, and when he was forced out of his job, the odor of scandal accompanied his exit.
When Senator Tower's nomination ran aground barely two weeks after President Bush took office, historians and politicians murmured that the rules of conduct had all shifted. They said there was a new morality in American politics that was holding Cabinet nominees to a new, stricter standard.
If that was true in 1989, it is also true in a different way in 1993. The standard, however, is more personal and more specific to the chief problem Mr. Clinton has pledged to help cure -- the economy.
For Mr. Clinton, the lesson to be learned from the Zoe Baird debacle is that he should not allow the Presidential bubble to block his famous political instincts. Some of the advisers who helped run his effective and media-savvy campaign fretted among themselves last week that those around their old boss seemed to have gone politically tone deaf.
Caught up in the rush of the Inaugural, working with a White House staff he appointed barely a week ago, and assuming overconfidently that a Senate controlled by Democrats would not reject one of his most important nominees, he failed to note that no one among the reliable constituencies was standing up for Ms. Baird.
Absent this support, Mr. Clinton, Ms. Baird and her backers needed to organize a groundswell on their own. When they did not, Clinton advisers said, the Senators were listening only to ringing phones with angry home-state voters on the other end.
Perhaps Mr. Clinton was following the wrong score. He was listening for the sounds of organized opposition, not the absence of organized support. In the end, that absence was just as damaging.
The televised images of Ms. Baird in a designer suit, talking about how motherhood had forced her to break the law, clashed with the chord Mr. Clinton struck in his campaign book, "Putting People First."
"For the last 12 years, government has served the rich and special interests," reads the preface signed by Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. "Millions of middle-class Americans have paid more to government but gotten less in return."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Britain Senses a Lapse in That Special Relationship

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
FOR weeks, editors and politicians here have been waging an unusual trans-Atlantic campaign, nudging the incoming Clinton team to consider preserving at least one holdover from the Bush Administration: Raymond G. H. Seitz, the United States Ambassador to Britain. "If he is wise," The Times of London advised, "Mr. Clinton will recognize that there are some virtues in continuity."
The new Administration has not yet signaled what it will do with Mr. Seitz, a Foreign Service officer whose appointment by President Bush in 1991 broke a more-than-200-year tradition of naming well-heeled political appointees to the London post. 
But on this side of the Atlantic, the public testimonials on behalf of the United States Ambassador appear to represent more than admiration for his skills as a professional diplomat. These days there are many in Britain who have a bad case of jitters over the transition from the Bush to the Clinton Administration, and they perhaps yearn to hang on to Mr. Seitz as a calming influence during what could be a bumpy ride.
At stake is the future course of what Winston Churchill called "the special relationship," that complex bundle of shared history, values and language -- coupled with common economic and strategic goals -- that over time have made Britain America's closest and most loyal ally, even if there are those in London who would prefer still to regard America as the junior partner.
In some ways, the special relationship matters more now than ever. While the United States dwarfs Britain in military prowess and global influence, Washington has increasingly relied on the British as a loyal sidekick as they try to police an increasingly fractious world after the cold war.
In the Persian Gulf war, in Bosnia and, most recently, in the renewed conflict with Iraq, the United States and Britain have become the axis around which at least part of the new world order spins. Last weekend, Prime Minister John Major and Mr. Bush conferred by telephone six times about the military reply to Saddam Hussein's defiance of United Nations resolutions.
But in a world in which instant telephone diplomacy is increasingly important, the change in administrations represents a challenge to the British after 12 years of ideological compatibility between Reagan-Bush Republicans and the Conservative Governments of Margaret Thatcher and Mr. Major.
For one thing, there is a strong sense in London that Mr. Major is setting out with a big disadvantage. Last fall, some Clinton aides concluded that Mr. Major's Government was pulling for Mr. Bush in the American elections. Not only did the Conservative Party dispatch advisers to Washington to work with the Bush campaign, they say, but British bureaucrats searched Government records to check out spurious rumors that young Mr. Clinton had sought to renounce his American citizenship while a student at Oxford University in the 1960's.
At the same time, candidate Clinton irked Britons during the campaign, criticizing British policy in Northern Ireland and suggesting a harder line with China at a time when the British already have their hands full with China's leaders over the future of Hong Kong.
Officially, the Government plays down any friction with Mr. Clinton, or foreboding over the relationship. An aide to the Prime Minister even suggested that Mr. Major would get on splendidly with Mr. Clinton, not only because the new President studied at Oxford and knows Britain, but because both he and the Prime Minister are "self-made men" with humble backgrounds.
Over the last 40 years there have been real jolts to the special relationship. The biggest came in 1956, when President Eisenhower angrily blocked a British-led campaign to wrest back control of the Suez Canal from the Egyptians. President Nixon and Edward Heath never got on well, partly because the Prime Minister pushed British policy toward Europe. And Harold Wilson's refusal to commit even a token British contingent to Vietnam rankled President Johnson.
 
Strain Over Bosnia
 Despite the tandem between Mr. Major and Mr. Bush, strains were becoming evident in their relationship, too. The biggest stumbling block, now and probably in the future, is Bosnia, where the British have resisted stepping up military pressure on the Serbs, as the United States has urged. The British, with 2,400 troops on United Nations peacekeeping duty in Bosnia, are reluctant to put their soldiers at risk.
In the end, Ambassador Seitz says, the strains in the American-British relationship have little to do with changes in American administrations. The larger issue is the shifting structure of European politics itself, since the end of the cold war has erased the central fact of the trans-Atlantic alliance: the specter of a large, hostile, military, anti-democratic power in the center of Europe, embodied first in the Nazis and later the Communists.
In both countries, perspectives are shifting. Mr. Clinton intends to focus inward, to secure America's economic security, and Britain is increasingly distracted by a debate over its role within the European Community. The more troubling question for the future is whether Britain and the United States will be able, jointly, to continue to look at the new world in the same way.
David Reynolds, a historian at Cambridge University, says that for now Britain and America share the same strategic goals as "status quo powers," particularly since the British, unlike the Germans, are willing to project their power. "Like most alliances, the cement has always been an external threat," he said, referring to the special relationship. "The cement now is a general and alarming threat of global instability."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Business Is Losing Patience With The Cold War's Export Police

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
IN the twisted skein that is the post-cold-war world, a big tangle is Cocom, the 17-nation Western trade organization that polices high-technology exports to Russia.
Western companies complain that Cocom -- short for the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls -- continues to fight the cold war. It is also being cautious to a fault, they say, in guarding against sensitive technology being resold to unintended recipients like Iran or Syria. 
 As a result, company officials say, Russia and other former Soviet republics aren't getting technology that could be immediately useful in jump-starting their collapsing economies.
Cocom officials argue that caution is justified precisely because the former Soviet republics are so unstable, leaving great uncertainty about how the technology will be used. Also very much in mind is the lesson of Iraq, which thanks to lax Western export controls was able to import technology for its nuclear arms program.
Cocom, founded in 1949 at the outset of the cold war to stem sensitive exports to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, is made up of all the NATO countries except Iceland, plus Japan and Australia. Over the years, Cocom's Paris headquarters has seen many diplomatic battles, with the United States usually succeeding in blocking exports to the Soviet bloc by its European allies.
Last November, acknowledging that the world had changed after the collapse of Communism, Cocom's member countries announced what they called a sweeping relaxation of export controls.
But two months later, companies like A.T.&T., Sun Microsystems, Cable and Wireless of Britain and Siemens of Germany say little has changed: a group organized to say no cannot bring itself to say yes.
Barred for export are computers like many of those found on American desktops that could help Russian managers convert military factories to civilian use. Also, Western companies have been blocked from modernizing a telephone system that dates to the Russian Revolution. Such an overhaul could lead to more efficient distribution of all kinds -- for example, dispatching trains and trucks when and where they are needed and thereby preventing huge grain losses.
 
Hold the Phones
 Sun Microsystems, the computer maker, says that since the November Cocom announcement it hasn't applied for any potentially controversial export licenses. Innocuous computer-test programs have still not been approved for export nearly a year after application. "Why even try something controversial?" asked David R. Ditzel, director of advanced systems for the research arm of Sun Microsystems.
Christopher A. Padilla, government-affairs manager for A.T.&T, said, "Practically speaking, we've yet to see any results." Cocom pronouncements about liberalization "are almost always a snow job," he said.
Cocom's regulations are administered by each member country, rather than its Paris-based staff. In the United States, the rules are overseen by the State Department, but others reviewing applications are the Commerce Department; the Defense Department and its intelligence arm, the National Security Agency; the Energy Department; the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and occasionally the President's national security adviser.
The cold war still shadows Cocom decisions. Because Russia and the other former republics are in turmoil, intelligence agencies want to monitor potential threats to Western interests there. One way is listening in on phone conversations, and the more primitive the telephone system, the easier it is to eavesdrop with spy satellites and other devices.
For example, Cocom allows A.T.&T. to sell the Russians the world's best-selling advanced computer for routing telephone calls -- a device called the 5ESS switch -- but not the hard-to-wiretap software capabilities that make it useful.
A few years ago, U S West, the American regional phone company, and Cable and Wireless of Britain each proposed installing fiber-optic lines across northern Russia. Such high-capacity lines are essential for installing large numbers of neighborhood telephone lines that work. .
But both projects were scuttled by Cocom because of objections by the National Security Agency, experts both inside and outside the Government say. The American agency feared that Russian military commanders could evade eavesdropping by connecting into the fiber-optic lines that would pass near Russian missile fields. The N.S.A., the nation's largest intelligence agency, declined to comment.
The fiber-optic lines would have entailed one of history's most ambitious construction projects, with crews laboriously chipping through more than 5,000 miles of land that is either ice or swamp. In most countries, such work would take many years and several billion dollars. But in Russia, either project would have taken two years and cost $500 million, primarily because of cheap and plentiful Russian labor.
Cocom rules have also prevented Sun Microsystems from selling work stations, or high-powered desktop computers, to two large auto and truck factories in the Moscow area. Its $20,000 work station, about the size of a pizza box, is defined by Cocom as having the power of a multimillion-dollar supercomputer, the kind used to design nuclear missiles.
Even if Sun could sell the computers, it may have to comply with more than 30 State Department restrictions, including a 24-hour guard around the computer and bans on computer networking and on moving the machine anywhere, even across the street, once it is installed.
Some experts think Cocom should be abolished and replaced with a more unified organization to help stop the spread of nuclear and other weapons.
"I'm a hard-liner on export controls," said Stephen D. Bryen, the former Pentagon official who helped write Cocom export restrictions during the Reagan Administration. "But the world has changed and Cocom doesn't make sense anymore."
Others say that Cocom will still be needed. "A lot of people think Cocom is a cold war dinosaur," said a State Department official who, like other Government officials, asked for anonymity as a condition for being interviewed. "Maybe it is and maybe it isn't. But there are some nitty-gritty decisions ahead for the Clinton Administration. Security concerns have to be high on his list."

HEADLINE: Increasingly, 2-Career Family Means Illegal Immigrant Help

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
The hiring of illegal household workers appears to be so commonplace that licensed employment agencies in an immigrant haven like New York routinely violate the law by recommending undocumented immigrants for hire, usually at lower wages than legal workers would be paid.
Even the controversy over Zoe Baird's employment of illegal immigrants, which led to her withdrawal Friday as President Clinton's nominee for Attorney General, did not push employment agents to hide their practices last week. Thirteen of 18 agents who were called acknowledged without hesitation that they represented both legal and illegal immigrants, with illegal workers earning as little as $175 a week and legal ones as much as $600. 
 "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would have to stay home and mind their own kids," said the owner of a Manhattan nanny agency, who, like many others, spoke on the condition of anonymity since he regularly places illegal immigrants.
 
Furtive Encounters Not Needed
 The employment agents' matter-of-fact admissions about illegal activity clearly indicate that this part of the country's growing underground economy does not depend on furtive encounters or discreet advertisements. Rather, the public spotlight on Ms. Baird's household situation has brought to light a pervasive phenomenon: the pragmatic, above-ground relationship that links illegal immigrants and middle-class homes in gateway cities across the country for decades. Caribbean women gravitated to the New York area, and Latin American women to Miami and the West Coast. In the 1980's, as more American women with young children moved into the workplace, the demand for housekeepers increased exponentially, satisfied by greater numbers of West Indians and Latin Americans and by new illegal migration from the Philippines, China, Ireland and Poland.
As this informal economic network grew more entrenched, Congress passed a law in 1986, aimed at large companies, that created penalties for employers who knowingly hired illegal immigrants. But the web of relationships was so established and the law so sporadically enforced that the illegal housekeeper and child-care business, which employs hundreds of thousands of immigrant women, continued to thrive.
Since immigration officials did not check employment agency records or raid the apartments of professional couples, parents continued to hire illegal immigrants, who they said were easier to find, less expensive, and, in some cases, more loyal. And they continued to pay their household workers cash, regardless of their immigration status.
"It all comes down to money," said Nedra Kleinman, who runs the All Home Services Agency on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. "No matter how you slice it, the reason that people hire immigrants without papers is that they're looking to save. If they want legal, they can get it, but it costs."
Families with incomes like that of Ms. Baird and her husband -- $600,000 a year -- tend to pay the extra money for legal workers since they like having the option of taking their nannies on trips abroad, many agents said.
 
Slave Job to Most Americans
 And rarely does an American-born worker apply for a nanny job, they added.
"These days, most Americans see it as some kind of slavery," said Dorothea Grant, a Jamaican nanny who received a green card last summer after seven years without working papers.
Mrs. Grant's career has followed a typical path, a hierarchy of household jobs. When she arrived from the town of Ocho Rios, she started by working as a baby sitter for her cousin, a legal nanny. The cousin later recommended Mrs. Grant for her first live-in job, where she earned $125 a week. With two references, Mrs. Grant next found a Brooklyn Heights couple who paid her $200 a week and sponsored her for legal residency. In early January, green card in hand, she gave notice to the Brooklyn couple, who could not match the $500-a-week salary she was offered for a live-out job on Park Avenue.
"Now I will be my own master," Mrs. Grant said Friday morning, bragging to the other baby sitters, almost all illegal, in a Brooklyn Heights playground.
 
Most Rely on Network
 Most families in the New York area do not find their baby sitters through agencies, which charge about $600 to $1,250. Instead, they rely on the nanny network, collecting names from friends' employees, or on the nanny shopper, the nickname given The Irish Echo, a New York weekly.
Susan Serota, a tax lawyer who has two teen-age sons, placed one of the rare ads in The Irish Echo that specify "U.S.A. citizen or green card only."
"My husband and I are both lawyers, and we never wanted to do something that might come back and haunt us," she said.
Professor Moss predicted, only half-jokingly, that hiring an illegal baby sitter would become the young professionals' new sin, and that sinners by the score would come forth with public confessions. "Now that sex and drugs have become acceptable, yuppies will be judged by the immigration status of their baby sitters," he said.
In fact, two candidates for the Republican nomination for New Jersey governor, Christine Todd Whitman and Cary Edwards, disclosed on Friday that they, too, had employed illegal aliens in their homes and failed to pay their Social Security taxes.
 
Baird Couple Faces Hearing
 After her nomination for Attorney General, Ms. Baird paid a $2,900 fine to the immigration agency and $8,000 in back taxes and interest. The agency then declared its intention to deport Victor and Lillian Cordero, the Peruvian couple who used to work for her.
Mr. Cordero has gone into hiding, but Helene A. Pepe, his lawyer, said yesterday that he would try to stay in the United States. "He doesn't understand why he's being singled out," said Ms. Pepe, an immigration lawyer in Stamford, Conn. The Corderos have separated, and it could not be determined where Mrs. Cordera was.
Critics of the new sanctions against employers, like Michael Fix of the Urban Institute, argue that the law is largely symbolic of a tough stance against illegal immigration, but has done little to control it. Many say, at the least, that household employers should be exempt, or that household workers should get a special visa.
"A law that forces thousands of illegal immigrants and middle-class families to engage in criminal activity desperately needs to be reformed," said Philip Kasinitz, a sociologist at Williams College and an authority on Caribbean culture in New York.
Most household employers rarely thought about breaking the law or getting caught until Ms. Baird was forced to withdraw. Some said they would start paying Social Security taxes this year, although they feared creating a paper trail leading to their illegal housekeepers. Other said they would not change the way they lived.
 
Housekeeper Before Politics
 "After Zoe Baird, my husband and I discussed whether it was now an issue for us, and decided that neither of us will ever run for office," said an Upper West Side mother of three, who said she would continue to employ an illegal Peruvian housekeeper.
Despite the controversy, a woman in Floral Park, Queens, said she was specifically looking to hire a newly arrived, illegal immigrant to care for her newborn triplets. "I want someone who cannot leave the country, who doesn't know anyone in New York, who basically does not have a life," the woman said. "I want someone who is completely dependent on me and loyal to my family."
Many agencies describe their illegal immigrants euphemistically, as "girls looking for sponsorship situations." Like Ms. Baird, some employers agree to sponsor immigrants for legal residency, but the process now takes up to a decade and the employees remain in an illegal status during that time. Some illegal immigrants say they feel like indentured servants during that period.
One such housekeeper, a Guyanese woman who live and works in Woodmere, L.I., said she paid a lawyer $2,500 to file her application for residency six years ago. Meanwhile, she earns $200 a week and is expected to be available around the clock to the family sponsoring her.
"You're trapped in this situtation, very trapped," the woman said.
But Naomi Victor, a Haitian immigrant, said she had thrived in the years she worked for a family that was sponsoring her. "Yes, there are vicious people out there," she said. "But there are also women like my Blossom Unger, who taught me to speak proper English, and sent me to school for word processing and found me a $275-a-month apartment on Amsterdam and 94th."
Jon Lukomnik, who hires only legal baby sitters "for peace of mind" and because he is the Assistant Commisioner of New York City's Department of Finance, called the required government paperwork a disincentive to those who want to abide by the law. After securing a fFederal tax identification number and completing an I-9 immigration application proving the worker's legal status, household employers must file 28 other forms a year, four of them yearly and six quarterly.
Ms. Kleinman of All Home Services noted that the Government never once checked the immigration records she had meticulously kept for six years. She said it was lonely being a "goody-two-shoes."
"You have no idea, the frustration, sitting here, knocking your head against the wall, trying to do what's right," she said. "And then you have a Zoe Baird who exposes the fact that everybody else is breaking the law."

HEADLINE: Rare in Ivy League: Women Who Work As Full Professors

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Phoebe S. Leboy did not set out to change the academic world when she joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine in 1967. She was a young scientist eager to become a full professor of biochemistry because it was one measure of achievement in her field, even if it was a position no woman had ever held at the school.
Today, Dr. Leboy is chairwoman of the dental school's department of biochemistry, a faculty member for a quarter of a century and the only female professor the dental school has ever had. 
 Eight other women are on the 51-member faculty of the school, but none are full professors. "I would like some company," Dr. Leboy said.
After more than two decades in which the nation's most prestigious universities have pledged to overcome the shortage of women on their faculties, Dr. Leboy's experience is far from unusual. In the Ivy League -- an elite group of eight universities that presumably can have their pick of the most talented candidates -- women make up 7 percent to 13 percent of professors, excluding those in the medical schools. Many departments do not have a single female full professor.
Whole schools in the Ivy League, like Penn's dental school, have few or no female professors. Harvard University's dental school has nine male professors but no female ones (six women are on track for tenure); its John F. Kennedy School of Government has 20 male professors and one female, with four other women working toward tenure, a system intended to insure academic freedom by making it very difficult to dismiss professors.
Inequity continues after women are hired. In general, women at every step of the tenure ladder still earn less than men, sometimes substantially less. At Harvard, for instance, male professors earn $93,600 on average while women of equal rank earn $79,900 on average.
 
'Much Worse in Universities'
 "What it comes down to basically is a reluctance to believe that women are as good as men," said Mary W. Gray, professor of mathematics and statistics at American University in Washington who is also a lawyer. "Generally, it's much worse in universities than in the corporate world because academics are so arrogant we don't think anyone can tell us what to do."
Members of minorities are also not represented in anything like their numbers in the classroom -- about 11 percent of the faculty members nationwide are minorities, as against 19 percent of all college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
The outlook for hiring more women has been dimmed by university budget problems and competing demands to hire faculty members from under-represented racial and ethnic groups. And the situation could get worse next June when professors will no longer have to retire at age 70, leaving fewer openings in senior faculty positions. After Congress passed legislation in 1986 outlawing mandatory retirement based on age for most workers, the protection was later extended to professors.
The Ivy League is not alone in its lack of female professors. While women make up more than half of all college students, they make up just 27.6 percent of faculty members.
 
Inroads Where Pay Is Lowest
 And even that figure is misleading. The more prestigious the institution, the fewer women there are. And the higher the rank, the lower the likelihood that a woman will hold it. Thus, women make up only 11.6 percent of full professors nationwide and have made their greatest inroads at community colleges, where the pay is lowest. Women hold 38 percent of all faculty positions in those colleges.
A sampling of the nation's most selective universities shows that the percentage of female faculty members hovers around 20 percent over all. Looking at just the Ivy league, which has the prestige and scholarly opportunities to be able to attract the most talented candidates, shows how slow progress has been.
This is a sensitive area for the universities; some react defensively to queries about hiring, complaining that statistics are misinterpreted and that they have made progress in hiring women and minority faculty members.
"You can't expect academe to look like America instantaneously, if ever," said Daniel S. Hamermesh, an economist at Michigan State University who compiled an extensive survey of the nation's professors for the American Association of University Professors. "It takes a lot of time to feed through the academic process."
Professor Hamermesh's latest report shows that, on average, women make up 10 percent of the professors in the Ivy League. In the next two ranks -- associate professor, which also usually carries tenure, and assistant professor, which can lead to tenure -- women are much better represented, with an average of 30 percent of each of those positions. These figures lead universities to hold out hope that, in time, women will move into the most senior positions.
Besides the obvious issues of equity, this lack of representation causes concern because if minority students and women have trouble identifying with professors they may hesitate to consider becoming professors themselves, thereby prolonging the shortage. And especially in fields like mathematics and the sciences where minorities and women have historically not been present in large numbers, their absence is seen as doubly damaging.
"Having a field like mathematics viewed as the province or property of one segment of society is no better than having all gold and silver owned by one segment of society," said Deborah Hughes Hallett, a member of the mathematics department at Harvard for 20 years. "This is an intellectual kind of gold and silver."
Change has come slowly to the most tradition-bound of universities, the Ivies. Most of the eight institutions -- Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, Princeton and Yale -- did not accept female students, or worry about hiring female professors, until the late 1960's and early 70's.
Over the years since then, each Ivy League institution has started efforts to increase the hiring of women and members of minorities, commissioning studies and printing reports. Since 1968, Yale University has conducted 18 studies dealing with either female or minority faculty members. It has more than doubled the number of tenured women, to 33, on its arts and sciences faculty over the last decade, but that still represents just 10 percent of the positions.
The latest hiring report, in 1991, found that "Yale's position and its national image in this area remains precariously close to the backwaters of academic progress."
Judith Rodin, who, as provost of Yale, is the highest-ranking woman in the Ivy League, said universities needed to rethink their hiring policies to increase the number of female and minority faculty members.
 
'We're Trying Very Hard'
 "We're trying very hard," she said. "That's not a defense, it's an explanation. And if we're serious about having our faculty reflect the graduate pool, and more closely reflect what we see at the undergraduate level, we need to rethink our tenuring policies."
Yale and Harvard differ from most other universities in the way they hire faculty members. Senior positions, or slots, are filled with the best scholars that can be found, even if it means passing over younger faculty members already in the department and recruiting from the outside.
Life in the Ivies can be uncertain for those young scholars because if their term -- generally seven years -- ends and no position is available, they are let go.
Ms. Rodin said the traditional system had served Yale and Harvard well but may now be outdated. "The cost to individuals and the institution may now be too great," she said.
Considering what things were like 20 years ago, many Ivy administrators take pride in how things have improved.
For example, a Brown professor sued the university in 1977, asserting that she was denied tenure because she was a woman. This led to a class-action suit that was settled out of court with a decree that set affirmative-action goals and timetables that the university agreed to abide by. Last May, after 14 years during which Brown increased the number of tenured women to 67 from 12, and female faculty members over all to 128 from 52, a Federal District Court judge lifted the decree.
Pennsylvania has shown similar movement. In 1981, 5 percent of the university's professors were women. Today, 11 percent of the professors are women and four of the university's 12 deans are women.
But by their own accounts, the universities have taken too long and done too little. In part, they say, when the Ivies went co-educational and the push was on to hire more women, the baby-boom generation had already enrolled in college and the greatest faculty expansion was over. Still, many professors say hiring in their departments continued apace, but women got few of the jobs.
Another reason is that even when women are hired many leave before they are promoted to senior positions because they are often worn down by subtle discrimination and suspicion about their abilities. Many women in senior positions say this is worse in the Ivy League, where the stakes are so high and the pressures to perform, publish and win research grants so great that women, like some men, are driven to leave for more congenial campuses.
Universities are also highly decentralized. While deans and provosts can set policy guidelines on hiring, decisions are made by senior professors in academic departments, who are sometimes averse to change.
Then there is the pipeline argument, which says that universities would like to hire more women but that candidates are simply not available. Out-of-work Ph.D.'s and a whole generation of female scholars find that argument hard to swallow, since women receive 36 percent of the 38,000 doctorates conferred each year.
The bottom line, many Ivy League women say, is that the all-male tradition of the Ivy institutions still haunts them. Until women are in senior positions, and able to influence choices about hiring, they say, many areas of academe will remain hostile to women.

HEADLINE: SETTLING IN: Clinton's Departure;
The Reagan-Bush Era Is Left Behind In a Flurry of Executive Policy Moves

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Although his moves were partly obscured by the uproar over his Attorney General nominee, President Clinton in his first days in office actually did begin to carry out what he had promised: a fundamental shift in the role that the American Government will play at home and abroad and the values it will seek to encourage.
While trying to quell the political damage from the retreat on Zoe Baird's nomination, Mr. Clinton was also signing a series of executive orders and ordering up a series of foreign policy reviews, which are expected not only to alter 12 years of Republican policies but also to inaugurate a new era of Government action. 
 "What got lost in the controversy over Zoe Baird was that Clinton was initiating a radical change in the way that the President and the executive branch will approach public policy," said Michael Beschloss, a historian of the Presidency. "This is as sharp and genuine a change as Franklin Roosevelt's takeover from Herbert Hoover in 1933, or Ronald Reagan's takeover from Jimmy Carter in 1981 -- from a passive Presidency to an activist one, and from one ideology to another."
It is too early to predict how effectively Mr. Clinton will sustain what he has started, Mr. Beschloss said. And his biggest promises on providing more jobs and affordable health care will be far harder to deliver.
 
All at One Stroke
 But nevertheless, with the stroke of a Presidential pen this past week Mr. Clinton took these actions:
*Lifted restrictions imposed by Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan on abortion counseling at federally financed clinics, on the right to perform abortions at American military hospitals overseas and on the use of fetal tissue in federally sponsored research.
*Lifted the restrictions on extending American financial aid to United Nations programs sponsoring family planning and population control -- a move that will have a far-reaching effect in countries from China to India to Egypt, which have been short of money for such programs.
*Imposed new ethics guidelines that will bar senior Government officials from lobbying the Federal agency in which they work for five years after leaving the Government -- a move that should inhibit people from seeking Government jobs in the hopes of being able to cash in once out office. The old limit was one year.
*Moved ahead with plans to repeal the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces, despite intense opposition by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
*Abolished the Bush Administration's Council on Competitiveness, which gave business a way to obtain exemptions from Government regulations.
*Ordered his aides to review the Bush Administration policy toward Bosnia -- with an eye to taking a much bolder approach in opposing the Serbian attacks if the current peace talks in Geneva fall apart. Such steps could include lifting the American arms embargo on Bosnia, selective American air strikes against Serb gunners and war crimes tribunals against Serbian leaders.
In a sharp departure from the Bush Administration, Mr. Clinton has told aides that he will not tolerate an American policy on Serbia based purely on how it affects the global balance of power.
On other issues, Mr. Clinton is planning to prepare a new family-leave bill, like the one Mr. Bush vetoed, before Congress recesses in early February. The proposal would require employers to grant workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid family and medical leave, with continued health-insurance coverage. He also plans to introduce a bill that would require states to allow eligible citizens to register to vote when they obtain or renew their driver's, fishing or hunting licenses.
 
Comparison With 1981
 When Ronald Reagan came to office in 1980 he, too, ushered in an ideological changing of the guard, but it was different, and in some ways much simpler, than Mr. Clinton's. Mr. Reagan brought conservative values on issues from the family to abortion to taxes, but his general view of government was that it should be scaled back, that it was part of the problem, not an instrument for solutions.
Mr. Clinton brings not only liberal values on issues from family to abortion to taxes, but a general view of government that is active, not passive. What Mr. Clinton is seeking is not only a change in ideology, but also the rejuvenation of an active government for the first time since it was discredited under Lyndon B. Johnson.
"What we are trying to show is that Government can be an initiator, not a sink hole, that it can be a place where problems are solved, not where they are exacerbated," said Mr. Clinton's Communications Director, George Stephanopoulos. "These executive orders made a tangible difference in people's lives immediately. It is not like some lower deficit number or new tax. Women who go into abortion clinics Monday are going to be treated differently and that is something that is going to ripple through society."
But what is striking about the executive orders that Mr. Clinton signed in the afterglow of his inauguration, is precisely that they were the easy part: the ideological changes that can be done with a stroke of pen. They are not the test of whether this type of government can deliver.
 
Harder Jobs Ahead
 Michael J. Sandel, a political theorist at Harvard University, said: "That test will be the ability of Clinton to get through Congress his programs for economic renewal, affordable health care, job training, and national service in return for college tuition. The reasons that this is the real test is because there is more to gridlock than just the fact of divided government. Americans now wonder whether interests have become so entrenched, the economy so complex, the effects of policy so difficult to predict that government cannot be an effective agent of change.
"Changing abortion regulations is important, and has real consequences that touch peoples daily lives. But changing the health-care delivery system or educational system requires transforming massive institutions, not just issuing regulations. Doing that in a way that really touches people's lives for the better will be the true measure of whether activist government can succeed."
 
State of the Union Message
 Mr. Clinton is planning a State of the Union Message for mid-February that will include some proposals for action on these larger issues.
In the meantime, though, there is still last week's mess over the Baird nomination to be cleaned up. Sitting for his first photo session at work in the Oval Office, Mr. Clinton said he had already begun the process of selecting a new Attorney General and has told his aides to look at three or four people. Neither he nor aides would provide any names.
Despite his rather tumultuous first few days in office, Mr. Clinton said he rather liked his new job, and to underscore his links with another activist President of the past, he has retrieved the desk that John F. Kennedy used.
"So far I've liked it very much," Mr. Clinton said of the Presidency. "We just got started, you know, and I've got a lot to do."

HEADLINE: Fifth Horseman of Somalia: Stealing

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOGADISHU, Somalia, Jan. 23

 BODY:
On the hills of the city, the roofless, windowless buildings stand as a testament to war -- stucco shells that look like the remnants of bombing raids. But the truth is, most of the buildings were not bombed at all, but systematically stripped of their roofs, windows, wiring and contents during two years of civil war.
Marauding gangs, many organized by warlords and merchants, cut down telephone cables and dug up electric wires for the copper inside. They tore up the streets to steal the sewer pipes, leaving sewage to pour into the streets. 
 In a village near the port city of Merca, Somalis tell how an entire electric station disappeared overnight. In Berbera, a concrete factory disappeared and reappeared in Yemen, a United Nations official said. Statuary was spirited away, some later turning up for sale in the United Arab Emirates.
Economists, bloodlessly, call what happened disinvestment. But for the Somalis left to live in the ruins, it is both sheer physical devastation and a metaphor for how ruthless, destructive and short-sighted Somalis became, decimating their nation and continuing their war even as it brought hundreds of thousands to death by famine.
 
'Somalis Destroy Themselves'
 "I never thought Somalis could go down to this level," said Ahmed Jama, a former national police chief. "I thought I knew Somalis, but I was totally ignorant as to what could happen. I never thought Somalis would destroy themselves and all their services."
Plans are being made to undo that self-destruction and rebuild the country. Now that the Clinton Administration has taken office, the United States and United Nations will begin negotiating on when the American-led military force protecting food supply routes here will pass on its duties to a United Nations peacekeeeping force.
But the military intervention is only the first step. After the hungry are fed, Somalia needs to be rebuilt completely, both physically and psychically, because government, schools, homes and sanitation were destroyed along with personal hope and self-esteem.
Hundreds of thousands of Somalis have sought refuge in neighboring countries, and as many as 1.5 million are estimated to be living in squalid squatter camps like Camp 100 in Mogadishu.
The camp is a dusty lot where 1,600 people, many of them ill, live in beehive-shaped huts built from pieces of burlap ripped from relief food bags, scraps of linoleum, old rugs and donated green plastic sheeting. Packs of barefoot children race about, with open sores on their legs and flies covering their arms. When they become too unruly, pushing too close to peer at a visitor to the camp, the men simply cuff them to the ground.
 
Feeling Bad About Themselves
 Philip Johnston, the United Nations coordinator of humanitarian assistance in Somalia, said: "Not many people feel very good about themselves because of what Somalis have done to Somalis. Many Somalis want to demonstrate they are not ruthless uncaring human beings, that in fact they have been victims of a minority with guns."
The warring clans with the guns agreed to a cease-fire in the civil war after days of meetings on the neutral territory of Addis Ababa, and are to meet in a full-scale conference on political reconciliation in March. But a United Nations spokesman said talks to prepare for the conference broke off after the Somali National Army charged that the cease-fire had been violated by heavy fighting near Belet Uen.
Somalis say fighting has continued in Mudug and Galguduud in the north, where there are no international troops, between the forces of Gen. Mohammed Farrar Aidid and the Daroud clan of Mohammed Siad Barre, the deposed dictator.
 
Interested in Spoils of War
 Diplomats and development officials who have met with the factions still find them mostly interested in the spoils of war and in patronage, worrying about who gets to control revenue from the port, or demanding international assistance to rebuild government bureaucracies for them and provide money for government salaries.
"If you think about who went to Addis, you had the assembly of mass murderers and looters of this country," a United Nations official said. "They should have been arrested on arrival."
The peace talks the United Nations is sponsoring are tenuous, and many Somalis believe any settlement could collapse the moment international troops are pulled out.
As part of the effort to fill the power vacuum, the United States and United Nations have been reaching out to develop leaders among tribal elders, women's groups, intellectuals and religious figures, prodding them to become more active in the face of anarchy.
An American official predicted that Somalia could evolve into a decentralized country with regional decision-making. "How long it will take, and who comes out on top and how many interim steps there will be, I don't know," he said.
 
Donors to Be Sought
 Despite the uncertainty over who will run the country, the United Nations is drawing up a multi-million-dollar rehabilitation plan for the next year. Donors will be sought when the plan is presented at a conference in February.
"To do certain things you need a government, but if we don't stabilize this society, all of the money that has been spent and all of the X-number of lives given by the international community will have been wasted," said Mr. Johnston, who is on loan to the United Nations from the relief agency Care. He wants to create regional administrations and regional police forces, job programs, a food security system, garbage collection and a system for providing drinking water.
One of the most crucial tasks is to create employment, so as to end the banditry and looting by which many people survive, particularly the young men from the bush who once herded camels but were brought into the cities and armed to provide militias for the clan leaders.
"People who never worked in their lives, who were shepherds, have found a way of living with their gun," Mr. Jama said. "They will lose their business. They will be desperate."
Even with American marines checking vehicles for guns and patrolling Mogadishu, the city remains lawless. The few Somalis who have found work try to hide their employment from their neighbors, dissembling about their absences from home and hoping they will not become targets of people who think they have money.
 
Aid Vehicles Attacked
 On Friday, in separate incidents, cars belonging to several relief agencies were attacked by looters firing machine guns, and several people were wounded. Earlier in the week, a Chinese journalist was wounded and his driver shot dead when bandits tried to steal their pickup truck.
Despite the promise of education, health care, jobs and millions in aid, violence and banditry remain the daily realities for a country that is fighting for survival.
A typical survivor is the 12-year-old boy whom marines caught stealing a radio at the port. They brought him to the commanding officer, who told him he would be released if he promised not to steal.
The boy replied through an interpreter that his mother and father had died in the civil war and that he had to steal to stay alive.

HEADLINE: Bush Sets Out to Prove He Can Go Home Again

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Riding up in the elevator to work Friday morning, the new ninth-floor tenant at the pink-granite office building on Memorial Drive turned to the lone photographer riding up with him and said politely but firmly that he could come to his office door but no further.
"I've been in public for more than 20 years," said George Bush, who was wearing a windbreaker, checked shirt and running shoes and was lugging a briefcase and three duffel bags. "Now I just want a little time to myself." 
 With the stark finality of the American transition, Mr. Bush this week began his cold-turkey readjustment from the world of state dinners at the White House to tacos al carbon at Molina's Mexican Restaurant, and Houston began readjusting to having both Mr. Bush and his longtime cohort, James A. Baker 3d, back as residents.
Neither man has announced many precise plans, no doubt because neither has yet formulated them. Mr. Baker probably spoke for Mr. Bush as well as for himself on Friday when he was asked about his plans at a press conference at Rice University.
 
Future Is Fuzzy
 "I'm still trying to decide what I'm going to do when I grow up, and that's going to take a little while," Mr. Baker said. He plans for now to split his time between Houston, where he will join the governing board of Rice University and work with the university's proposed James A. Baker 3d Institute for Public Policy, and Washington, where he will return to law practice.
Back in the city where he started his political career, the 68-year-old Mr. Bush began his first days in 12 years as a private citizen with a flurry of routine activity.
Mr. Bush, who flew here Wednesday after President Clinton's inauguration, arrived early at his new office on both Thursday and Friday mornings. He is occupying the top floor of a pyramid-topped office building with a bubbling fountain in the lobby. The 154,000-square-foot building was built in 1986 as the headquarters for a savings and loan that failed. It later housed offices of the Resolution Trust Corporation, charged with cleaning up the S.& L. debacle.
On Thursday Mr. Bush was driven home for lunch to the two-story white colonial house he and Barbara Bush are renting from their longtime friend, Jack Fitch, while they build their own in Houston's affluent Tanglewood area. On Friday Mr. Bush ate lunch at Otto's Bar-B-Q, which was decked out in yellow ribbons in honor of his return.
 
Visiting the Hardware Store
 He also went jogging and stopped in at Patterson's Hardware to pick up coffee filters and a stepladder.
Andrew Maner, an aide, said Mr. Bush had spent much of his first two days in his new office unpacking, fielding calls and getting organized.
"He's had calls from friends, Cabinet members, the Vice President," Mr. Maner said, then added quickly: "The former Vice President, I mean."
With Secret Service protection, an eight-person, full-time staff, travel in a three-or-four car convoy and an eight-room office complex with a 16-foot-high rotunda surrounded by eight Tuscan columns, Mr. Bush has not exactly been thrown out in the cold. He receives a pension of approximately $187,000 a year and has substantial income from other investments.
He will be involved with establishing his Presidential Library a hundred miles away at Texas A&M in College Station. There's the inevitable talk of writing a book, and Mr. Bush has often spoken of spending more time with his 12 grandchildren. But even those closest to him say he returns to private life with very few firm ideas of what he will do there.
 
Validating Houston Roots
 "I've asked him the question myself, and he said, 'I don't know,' " said George W. Bush, the former President's oldest son, who lives in Dallas. "I just don't think he's worked it out."
Mr. Bush returns to a neighborhood where he's lived on and off for more than three decades. The Bushes get their food from the Rice Epicurean Market and do their cleaning at Miller's Laundry and Cleaning. They eat at Otto's, Molina's and Hunan, worship at St. Martin's Episcopal Church and will probably be seen at the Bayou Club and the Houston Country Club.
Their return is something of a vindication for Houston friends who chafed for years at insinuations that Mr. Bush was a Yankee at heart whose ties to Texas had more to do with political convenience than reality.
"As a little girl I had a crush on him," said Betsy Parish, gossip columnist for The Houston Post. "I thought that's the cutest man I ever laid eyes on. I live in the same neighborhood as the Bushes, and people feel like it's old friends moving back."
Ms. Parish thinks Mr. Bush's adjustment to private life will be easier than some think. "I think he's from the old school, that you take victories modestly and defeat with a smile and get on with life," she said. "I think that which he was accused of being as President, being patrician, he will be admired for when he comes back."
 
And Then There's Maine
 But some of the attention clearly goes beyond mere affection. Hal Foster, whose public relations firm, Callas & Foster, works regularly with the city's elite, says there is wide speculation about everything from the possible economic benefits spawned by visiting dignitaries to which charities the Bushes will lend their names to.
"Most of the people I talk to are very excited," he said. "Everyone has the idea they'll be the chairmen at their ball. But I hear through the grapevine they'll head for Kennebunkport at the beginning of April, which takes care of all the spring balls, so they're all fretting."
Still, the return was not all warm and fuzzy. Neighbors on the cul de sac where the Bushes live glared balefully at reporters and fretted about the steady stream of gawkers driving by.
Some visitors had their own agenda. Richard Stonely, an autograph collector, said he had 18 Clinton autographs and only one Bush signature; Mr. Bush later made his day by autographing two baseballs for him.
 
Another Local Attraction
 Most were there either out of curiosity or to show their support for the Bushes. But even they were a reminder of how big a difference there is between being President and being one of the five living men who used to be.
"We skipped school to come see him," said Marshall O'Neill, a 17-year-old who showed up with his friend Mark Wright to try to catch a glimpse of Mr. Bush. "His living here gives the city an attraction."
Then, referring to a nearby town and its ageless pitcher, he added: "Alvin's got their Nolan Ryan, and now Houston's got George Bush."

HEADLINE: JACKSON, IN HAITI, CAUTIONS MILITARY

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in Haiti for a two-day visit, said today that he had come to warn the country's military rulers that they would face harsh action, perhaps even force, if they failed to cooperate with a plan to move toward restoring democracy here.
Mr. Jackson, who met on Thursday in Washington with Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher said he had not been officially authorized to carry a message to Haiti's military leaders. But he said the Clinton Administration had assured him that it intended to restore Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to power. 
 "The only question is whether they are going to cooperate in the transition toward democracy or resist," Mr. Jackson said of Haiti's military leaders in an interview here. "That transition is coming, and the only question is whether it will require force."
 
Pressure to End Crisis
 Mr. Jackson's visit comes as the Clinton Administration, working closely with the United Nations, is sharply increasing pressure on all parties to end Haiti's 16-month political crisis. Father Aristide was ousted in a military coup in September 1991, less than eight months after he took office as Haiti's first freely elected President.
A trade embargo was imposed against Haiti in late 1991 to step up pressure for Father Aristide's return. The country's economic misery deepened and military repression increased, prompting thousands of Haitians to flee in boats.
A special United Nations envoy to Haiti, Dante Caputo, announced this week that he expected negotiations to begin shortly that ultimately would be aimed at reinstating President Aristide. Mr. Caputo said that the United Nations would not allow Haiti's rulers to retreat from an agreement reached last weekend to allow the deployment of human rights observers to Haiti beginning in early February.
 
Haitian Generals Hedge
 After consenting to the deployment of the observers last Sunday, Haiti's military commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, seemed to hedge on the issue in a radio interview on Monday, less than 24 hours after Mr. Caputo's departure from Haiti. In the interview, General Cedras said the military was not legally authorized to sign international agreements of any kind.
The Haitian army's willingness or ability to pursue negotiations was cast further into doubt this week by a small-scale mutiny by soldiers on Wednesday. Diplomats said that retired officers had told the soldiers that General Cedras had reached a secret accord with Father Aristide and warned them that they would be sold out in any negotiated settlement.
Haiti's military-backed civilian Government, however, has said that plans to deploy the human rights observers here were proceeding.
"The first thing to be done is to establish a cease-fire, politically speaking," Haiti's de facto Foreign Minister, Francois Benoit, said in an interview. "We recognize the need to stabilize the patient and remove the fear. That is why we have accepted the sending of an observer mission."
 
Clinton-Aristide Agreement
 During his visit, Mr. Jackson also said White House officials had told him that President Clinton had an agreement with Father Aristide committing the United States to the exiled Haitian leader's return.
Mr. Jackson said the agreement would require the priest to help prevent his followers from taking revenge on his opponents after his return.
In a recent letter to the United Nations calling for the deployment of the observers, Father Aristide said he wished to "reassure all parties that the current political crisis will be solved only by eliminating violence and the systematic violation of human rights from whatever source."
Mr. Jackson scoffed at criticism of Father Aristide's human rights record in a recent State Department report, including a suggestion that the Haitian leader had ordered political killings.
"It is not unusual for those on their way out to fire a last salvo," Mr. Jackson said, in a reference to outgoing Bush Administration officials.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Agrees to Delay a Reactor Test in Space

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
Pentagon officials, responding to complaints by astronomers, have agreed to defer for at least six months any commitments to carry out a nuclear reactor test in orbit. The delay would give scientists time to assess the chances that the test might produce radiation that could interfere with astronomical observations.
The decision was reached last week after a meeting with astronomers, mission planners and scientists familiar with the Russian-made Topaz 2 nuclear reactor planned for use in the $150 million experiment. The reactor test is part of the military's plan to investigate new technologies for generating electricity for missile defense monitors in space and for long-distance propulsion systems. 
 The action raised hopes on all sides for an amicable settlement of the issue between astronomers and officials of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the antimissile defense-research arm of the Defense Department commonly called "Star Wars."
"We are committed to making sure the test does not interfere with any astronomy mission," said Maj. Frederick A. Tarantino, an Army scientist who manages the space power program for the missile defense agency. Major Tarantino made the comment in a telephone interview Thursday after the meeting, at the University of Maryland in College Park.
 
Rocket Purchase Delayed
 Until a more thorough study of potential problems can be completed, probably by the middle of the year, the project will not settle on any specific mission plans or sign any contracts to buy the rocket, Major Tarantino said. The rocket was to be purchased next month from an American concern. Once such commitments are made, it would be more expensive to alter the spacecraft and the mission to reduce or eliminate the risk of radiation interference on satellites studying the universe.
Steven Aftergood, a senior research analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, a Washington-based group that has opposed the space-based missile defense program, said the tone of the meeting suggested that the Pentagon "is going to accommodate the astronomers to one degree or another."
Dr. Don Q. Lamb, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago, said he and other scientists who had raised objections to the reactor test had come away from the meeting feeling that military officials "do want to do the right thing."
As chairman of the American Astronomical Society's high-energy astrophysics division, Dr. Lamb raised the first public objections to the proposed reactor test six weeks ago. He cited scientific studies and the experience with earlier Russian space reactors in warning that radiation would cause serious disturbances to the sensitive instruments of such satellites as the American Compton gamma ray observatory, the German Rosat X-ray observatory, the Russian X-ray and gamma-ray craft Granat and many others.
 
Higher Orbit Is Suggested
 In raising these objections, the astronomers emphasized that they did not necessarily oppose the mission but rather were concerned about the failure to take into account its possibly adverse effects on astronomy. They suggested that with a more powerful rocket, the initial altitude of the reactor's orbit could be raised to 3,700 miles from the 1,000 miles now planned. At the lower orbit, radiation interference would be especially strong, the astronomers said.
At a conference on space nuclear power in Albuquerque, N.M., two weeks ago, military officials and nuclear engineers indicated they were willing to discuss the issue and perhaps even modify the mission. The conference adopted a resolution that "nuclear technology should be used in a manner so that interference with space science objectives is minimized." The resolution also said that an acceptable solution to the problem was "clearly achievable."
Russian nuclear engineers sought to reassure the scientists that the reactor could be a good orbital neighbor. They have sold two test reactors to the American military and expect to sell at least four more, thus reaping sorely needed hard currency for the Russian economy.
But Major Tarantino and Dr. Lamb said that at the meeting last week it became clear that more research is required to determine if there is reason for concern about radiation and, if there is, how the radiation could be prevented from causing harm.
If preparations for the mission resume by mid-summer, it might still be possible to launch the first test mission in late 1995 or early 1996. But some scientists and space policy experts noted that the delay could give the Clinton Administration time to reconsider the priority of such a project and of the broader policy toward the "Star Wars" research, a legacy of the Reagan and Bush Administrations.

HEADLINE: Exposing Oceanfront Property and Human Folly

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WESTHAMPTON, L.I.

 BODY:
The December storm that carved two new inlets in the narrow barrier beach here and ripped acres of sand away from summer homes has also exposed a reality long buried in promotional fiction along the region's shore:
A rising ocean, part of a long geologic process, is relentlessly claiming parts of the coast faster than man can reclaim it. 
 And property owners long accustomed to building beach homes wherever they want -- in some cases demolishing protective sand dunes to expand their ocean view -- may be closer to a day of reckoning when the public will no longer pay the high cost of protecting them from future storms.
Scientists and coastal engineers have worried aloud for years about how much longer the ocean, which has risen nearly a foot in this century along the Atlantic coast, could be kept from destroying beachfront development. But four major storms in 16 months have reinvigorated a debate over where human structures can safely coexist with a surly ocean.
The outcome of the debate has enormous consequences on Long Island and in New Jersey, where for years home rule has allowed municipalities to ignore many of nature's laws and permit the construction of thousands of expensive homes on fragile sections of barrier beaches in places like Long Beach Island in New Jersey and Fire Island and the Hamptons on the southern shore of Long Island. Now there is growing pressure to let nature take its course and swallow beaches that are considered too costly to defend against storms and hurricanes.
The beautiful but fragile white sandy beaches of eastern Long Island and southern New Jersey -- some of the most expensive real estate in the world -- have long been minefields of explosive politics. When scientists and environmentalists call for a retreat from some vulnerable beaches, private and commercial interests object, citing the economic benefits of tourism and tax revenues produced by summer visitors.
"There's no question that summer homes and visitors are extremely important to the economy of our villages," said Arma Andon, Mayor of Westhampton Beach, a community that shares the barrier beach here with Westhampton and other south shore villages.
"Our merchants are already hurting because people can't reach their second homes next to us in Westhampton because of the storms," Mr. Andon said. "If that section is permanently closed it would really hurt the tax base.
"But local people keep asking me how many more millions of dollars have to be pumped to keep some stretches healthy."
The advocates of beach reclamation say the barrier islands are too critical to the protection of the inland bays and populated mainland shores to consider abandoning any of them.
In the four storms, including the Dec. 11 northeaster, homes were destroyed on Fire Island and protective dunes were washed away from Montauk Point to Cape May, N.J. Several seashore communities lost boardwalks and fishing piers in the widespread flooding.
But the storm damage is the most striking along what had been Dune Road in Westhampton. By the latest count, 87 structures have been destroyed since 1991 -- more than 40 in the December storm -- and scores more, held up by wooden pilings once sunk deep in sand, are stranded in the surf zone with ocean waves breaking beneath them, rolling into the newly opened inlets. Other houses are sunk deep in sand amid 200-pound slabs of asphalt and concrete washed away from Dune Road, broken telephone poles with snaking black power lines, smashed Jacuzzis and hot tubs.
 
Continuing Litigation
 The owners of the stranded houses have been involved in litigation against Suffolk County and the United States Army Corps of Engineers for nearly two decades. The owners claim that environmental pressures forced the abrupt halt of a beach protection project before a series of rock jetties -- being constructed to reduce beach erosion -- reached them. The cancellation, they said, caused drifting sand that moves from east to west along the Long Island coast to pile up along the completed jetties, unable to reach their beaches, hastening the erosion process in front of their cottages.
In Westhampton Beach, where the jetties were finished in the 1960's, houses sit high and dry in luxuriant sand dunes.
But the western end of Dune Road and some sections of the Fire Island barrier beach are among those that a new task force that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo formed this month will investigate as probable targets of the new thinking on retreat.
With local and state governments facing deficits, it is hard to argue that public money should be spent on what is increasingly seen as a losing effort to protect vacation cottages and second homes, said Kevin McDonald, vice president of the Group for the South Fork, residents at the eastern end of Long Island involved in environmental issues.
"This is a tax issue, not environmentalists aligned against private landowners," he said. "What is of concern are the absurd public costs of keeping the beaches safe for private ownership."
But the Dune Road property owners insist that it is an environmental issue. The state has to plug up the new inlets and build the beach back up, they argue, to keep ruinous amounts of salt water from pouring into Moriches Bay.
"Everyone has always assumed the property owners only talked out of self-interest," said Merle Debuskey, a New York theatrical press agent who owns a threatened beach house here. "But now that two new inlets have cut through there, the repairs have to be made to protect the bay and the mainland shore."
 
Pressure on a Project
 The property owners are also pressing the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with a project agreed to two years ago to rebuild the beach and taper the jetties immediately to the east to allow drifting sand to reach their property. But the project's original cost estimate of $45 million is expected to grow by 50 percent or more because of the December damage, state officials said.
Fred W. Thiele Jr., Supervisor of the Town of Southampton, said $60,000 in local money was spent two years ago to repave parts of Dune Road and the work was almost immediately wiped out by flooding from a major autumn storm. An additional $25,000 was spent last year to provide a trail passable only by four-wheel-drive vehicles, he said.
"This situation," he said recently, standing at the edge of the 500-foot wide gash carrying the ocean into Moriches Bay where the island is only 200 feet wide, "speaks to the issues of development on coastal barriers and should be a question for the public to decide.
"One thing is for certain: Only the Federal Government has the money to do the repairs and I'm not sure Washington is going to want to pour money into the ocean as things get worse."
What is almost certain is that the Dune Road property owners will seek and get some form of public compensation if they are prevented from rebuilding or from occupying homes that are still standing, state officials said, because governmental action contributed to their problems. But Fire Island property owners are unlikely to get a similar break.
 
'A Natural Progression'
 "There's no reasonable view that we owe the Fire Island owners compensation," said William W. Daley, chief of coastal erosion management for the State Department of Environmental Conservation. "It has been a natural progression of the shoreline and there comes a time when the land is submerged and can no longer stand the onslaught of the ocean."
But the 4,000 Fire Island property owners, like those on Dune Road, are prepared for a fight. They, too, contend that rebuilding the beaches is necessary to protect the ecology of Great South Bay.
Any move to exert more state control over the shorelines will pit legislators against the wishes of local interests that derive income and prestige from coastal development.
"There is strong resistance to state intrusion on traditional prerogatives of local government when it comes to beaches," said Gail S. Shaffer, the New York Secretary of State. "The result is we have a tremendously fragmented patchwork of authority."
Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, said: "Local officials, not the county or the state, decided if beach houses were built on the dunes, behind the dunes or if the dunes were bulldozed to get them out of the way of the ocean view." He said that since 1965 the board has initiated many environmental programs like preserving open spaces and farmlands but that its recommendations on coastal preservation have seldom been heeded.
Suffolk County's only regulatory control of beach development is limited to health matters like sewers and septic tanks, he said.
 
A Profitable Arrangement
 From the point of view of local government, the trend that brought wealthy New Yorkers to the Hamptons as summer residents was a profitable one. Construction on the beach created jobs for local workers and increased property tax revenue relieved year-round residents of much of the burden.
"The summer people also were affluent, sophisticated and politically well connected and not afraid to use those connections at all levels when necessary," Dr. Koppelman said. He contended that state and Federal officials have consistently "caved in" behind the scenes to special interests rather than give firm support to beach preservation policies they have publicly endorsed.
Representative George J. Hochbrueckner, a Democrat who represents the First Congressional District, which includes Westhampton, said the time had arrived for new thinking about beach development and protection. "The barrier islands are clearly rolling toward the mainland and I see a tendency to allow some of the undeveloped beaches to erode without help," he said. "But in areas like Dune Road where government and man have intervened in the past we are going to have to protect the beach and plug those inlets."
Mr. Hochbrueckner said he was not satisfied with the Army Corps's estimate that it could not begin work on closing the new inlets until May and said he was working with other members of Congress to accelerate it.
Gilbert Nersesian, senior coastal engineer in the New York District office of the Army Corps of Engineers, acknowledged that political pressure could revise the Corps's timetable.
"Politics tend to govern decisions about the coast," the engineer murmured. "Always have, always will."

Inside Cuomo's Budget: A Discreet Fee or Two

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
With budgets, as with life, the devil is often in the details.
And with the 1993-94 budget proposed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last week, the details were sometimes buried far beneath the surface. 
 It took some digging through the hundreds of pages of budget documents and bills, for instance, to discover that Mr. Cuomo proposed giving 4 percent raises to his agency heads at a cost of $400,000. The raises would be equivalent to those negotiated last year with a variety of state workers' unions.
The raises, which were referred to briefly on page 55 of an appendix to the budget, were not mentioned in the 15-page news release issued by Mr. Cuomo.
Neither was the $17 fee that Mr. Cuomo wants to impose to pay for the state's mandatory program of genetic testing for newborns. The state has paid for the program in the past. The fee would be imposed on hospitals, which presumably would pass the cost along to patients.
The Governor also did not highlight his proposal to eliminate a state program that compensates crime victims for up to $100 in stolen cash and property.
 
Negotiating in the TV Age
 The union representing New York City's public school teachers, having already taken their search for a new contract with the Dinkins administration to Albany for arbitration, opened a second front last week -- this time on the television airwaves.
The United Federation of Teachers, which represents about 65,000 teachers and 20,000 other school employees, began a six-week advertising blitz intended to pressure the administration into reaching a new contract. Union officials said they plan to spend about $1 million on the campaign, which highlights the difficulties of teaching in schools they describe as overcrowded and undersupplied.
Two versions of the 30-second ad started running last Tuesday on virtually every station in the city. Each opens with a quick succession of scenes showing teachers dealing with jammed classrooms, packed hallways, and ill-equipped science labs. They also show teachers breaking up fights, working with students on a play and talking at a faculty meeting about a shortage of textbooks.
In one ad, a teacher says: "It's a tough job teaching in New York City schools and it keeps getting tougher. What I don't understand is given the conditions and how important education is to New York's economic future, why won't this city offer its teachers a decent contract? It's just not right."
Whether the commercials alter the prolonged negotiations over the teachers' contract remains to be seen. After intermittent talks with the city failed to produce a settlement, the union sought state mediation late last summer. Mediation also did not produce an accord, and so, two weeks ago, both sides began nonbinding arbitration with the state.
 
Same Old Names, New Faces
 Although President Clinton has made "change" the political watchword of the year, there will not even be nominal change resulting from the Feb. 16 special election for the 112th Assembly District in St. Lawrence County.
The seat became vacant Dec. 10 when Assemblyman John G. A. O'Neil, a Republican who was first elected in 1980, died in an automobile accident.
His widow, an elementary school teacher, Chloe Ann R. O'Neil, is running as the Republican candidate to complete his term. Her Democratic opponent is June F. O'Neill, who is on unpaid leave from her job as director-designate of the state's Office of Rural Affairs.
May the best O'Neil(l) win.
 
Solarz Waits and Hopes
 With choice jobs in the Clinton Administration dwindling by the day, former Representative Stephen J. Solarz of New York still held out hope late last week that there might be a spot for him in the State Department.
"I honestly don't know what is going on," Mr. Solarz said. "I hear a lot of things and I read a lot of things. But I'm not sitting at home waiting for calls from Little Rock, or, I suppose now, from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."
Mr. Solarz had been considered a strong contender for Deputy Secretary of State, the No. 2 spot. But his name has not been among the stream of appointments announced since Mr. Clinton took office on Wednesday.
Mr. Solarz, whose bid for a 10th term in office ended abruptly last September when he was defeated in the Democratic Primary, was arguably one of the most knowledgable members of Congress on foreign affairs.
But what may be standing between him and the State Department job he covets is the House banking scandal that involved 269 of the 435 House members and contributed to a wave of retirements and election defeats. Mr. Solarz was among 17 members identified in a House ethics committee report as among the worst abusers of the bank, with 743 overdrafts in three years.
But Mr. Solarz said that was no cause for the Clinton Administration to pass him over. "They nominated someone for Attorney General who admitted violating the law," he said. "My position is that I haven't done anything improper or illegal."

Justice Delayed Is Bitter Justice for Carter

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 23

 BODY:
With his one good eye, his left, still piercing out from behind steel-rim glasses, the black man, the onetime middleweight contender, half-blind because of a botched operation in prison, stood Friday night at the lectern and looked out over an audience of some 400 people in the Austin Hall auditorium here at Harvard University.
For nearly 19 years he had looked out from behind steel bars, until, in 1985, a Federal judge in New Jersey determined that he had been unjustly and wrongly convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for a triple murder he did not commit. 
 "It's a long way from Trenton State Penitentiary to the Harvard Law School," Rubin (Hurricane) Carter said Friday with a smile that combined irony, humor, pain, anger and even warmth. "A very, very long way."
 
The Keynote Speaker
 Carter, now 55, a free man for the last seven years, living in King City, Ontario, near Toronto, had been invited to give the keynote address in a two-day conference on "The Future of Habeas Corpus" at the Criminal Justice Institute at Harvard. Carter is an expert on the subject, and a subject of prominence to the experts, because it was the Great Writ, as the Federal review is known, that became Carter's passport to freedom from a New Jersey state verdict.
Habeas corpus -- the requirement that a detained person be brought before a court to determine the legality of the detention -- has been under attack in recent times, primarily by conservatives who contend that the process clogs up the courts, Carter said. But Carter, who fervently studied the doctrine in his cell, was at Harvard to defend it, to talk about it as an American "birthright," and did so with understandable conviction, in a strong, almost clipped speaking style.
Carter, at 5 feet 7 inches and close to his fighting weight of 160 pounds, wore a dark suit and a blue tie. His hair is full on his head and he has grown a mustache. This is not the way many remember Hurricane Carter. Sports fans recall him in the ring with a shaved head, sometimes a goatee, and a look that was baleful at best. In a middleweight championship fight in Philadelphia on Dec. 14, 1964, Carter lost a controversial 15-round split decision to the reigning champion, Joey Giardello. "I lost because I didn't knock him out," Carter said.
 
No Chance to Avenge Loss
 He was convicted of murder in 1967, when, reaching his prime as a prizefighter, he had signed and was in training to fight again for the middleweight title, against Dick Tiger, who had dethroned Giardello. Carter had lost a 10-round decision to Tiger -- "he beat me up pretty bad" -- and had hoped to avenge that loss. He never got the chance.
In 1966, Carter and a friend, John Artis, were arrested for the murder of three white people at the Lafayette Bar and Grill in Paterson, N.J., in June of that year. They were convicted on the testimony, later recanted, of two criminals. They were convicted even though identifications by eyewitnesses varied, and despite the fact that both of them had strong alibis -- and even though two separate grand juries had refused to bring indictments.
Carter and Artis were finally released because, said Judge H. Lee Sarokin 19 years later in his statement to the writ of habeas corpus brought by Carter and Artis, "the extensive record clearly demonstrates that (the) petitioners' convictions were predicated upon an appeal to racism rather than reason, and concealment rather than disclosure."
"To permit convictions to stand which have as their foundation appeals to racial prejudice and the withholding of evidence critical to the defense," Sarokin continued, "is to commit a violation of the Constitution as heinous as the crimes for which these petitioners were tried and convicted."
 
Much to Address
 Carter's talk here, with Judge Sarokin in the audience, ranged wider than just the importance of not allowing habeas corpus to erode. He spoke movingly of the root causes of crime -- "it is not genetics, but economics," he said -- and added that serious commitment by government to educate and to provide jobs is what is needed, "and not the building of more prisons."
As for prisons, he said they are in need of monumental reform, from medical care (his eye operation for a detached retina was performed in the prison and not in a hospital) to general treatment.
"They take away your dignity, your humanity, your goodness, your meat and bones," Carter said. "And then when they release inmates into society, people wonder why the recidivism rate is so great."
At a reception later, Carter was asked about Mike Tyson, the former heavyweight champion, who is in prison in Indiana on a rape conviction.
 
'One They Had to Break'
 "I feel sorry for Mike Tyson," said Carter. "I'm sure his problems in prison will be magnified because he was somebody when he was outside. He probably won't have difficulty with fellow prisoners -- I never did -- but with the administration. The warden and the guards, they want him and the other inmates to know, 'Hey, he's not the champ in here. He's not a strong black man. He's just a number, like everybody else.' I was the one they had to break, to put in line, as an example for the other prisoners.
"I was the prizefighter, the man making $100,000 a year, which in those days was like the millions some fighters are earning today.
"And my difficulty was compounded because I refused to go along with anything the administration wanted from me in prison. I was innocent and I didn't recognize their authority. When I first walked into prison, I refused to wear prison clothes. They threw me into solitary confinement for four months, with nothing to eat but bread and water."
On the other hand, Carter said, being a boxer helped him get through those 19 years in prison.
"It's very individualized -- a boxer has to be dedicated, disciplined and learns to live with loneliness," he explained. "You're basically alone as a fighter, and you learn to talk to yourself, laugh with yourself, and in training camp you bear up under being alone."
Carter clearly bears resentment for what he went through. "The state wants inmates to show remorse and rehabilitation," he said. "They want us to repent. But they do none of that. They never gave me anything back when I was released and when it was proved I was wrongly confined. They never even said, 'Look, man, it was a mistake.'
"And I still had some good years in boxing left."
 
No Time for Boxing
 He said that he stopped following boxing because his fight for freedom took up all of his time.
"I have no interest in boxing these days," Carter said. "I'd like to have the money they're making. If I can have that without getting my brains rattled, I'd be glad to accommodate."
These days, he earns a living primarily by lecturing. His book, "The 16th Round," has just been reissued in Canada. He has also sold his life story to a Hollywood movie company.
At the Harvard reception, a woman serving hors d'oeuvres extended her tray to Carter. He picked up something and bit into it. "Quiche," he said. He smiled, but looked slightly uncomfortable.
"Well," he said, "it's better than prison food."

'Chris' And Aspin And Lake

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Almost 30 years ago in the U.S. Embassy in Saigon, the lives of a young Army lieutenant -- Les Aspin -- and three very junior Foreign Service officers in their mid-20's -- Anthony Lake, Peter Tarnoff and Frank Wisner -- touched one another. Today, the four sit at the pinnacle of power and, together with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, form two interlocking triangles that will command America's national security machinery.
In the top triangle, two rumply policy intellectuals -- Defense Secretary Aspin and Mr. Lake, the national security adviser, will vie with each other to shape strategy, while Mr. Christopher essentially counsels and reacts. 
 In the second triangle, the three old pals -- Mr. Lake, Under Secretary of State-designate Tarnoff and Under Secretary of Defense-designate Wisner -- bureaucratic black belts all, will control interdepartmental deliberations and tamp down internal conflicts.
Policy fights will not split these triangles into the usual hawks and doves, conservatives and liberals. Instead, the five will maneuver in ever-changing coalitions of activists and cautioners. One mix might want to get tough in Iraq; another, in Bosnia. The question mark in the picture will be President Clinton.
As a history buff, Mr. Clinton will discover that his senior triangle will resemble the Robert McNamara, Dean Rusk and McGeorge Bundy team of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations.
Defense Secretary McNamara was the activist and conceptualizer, trying to run foreign policy out of the Pentagon -- and often succeeding. He generally called the tune not only on Vietnam, but also on arms control and European and Asian policy.
Mr. Bundy, the national security adviser, mainly played the honest broker and remained almost out of public sight. From time to time, he would strike with his own policy memo and carry the day -- but few knew about it.
Secretary of State Rusk was not out to change the world. He did have some strong views and sometimes objected to the goings-on around him. Mostly, however, he said "O.K.," or "O.K. but . . ." He saw himself primarily as the President's adviser. He rarely took the bureaucratic lead on policy-making and generally let the State Department bureaus fend for themselves.
In Mr. Clinton's senior triangle, Mr. Aspin -- an idea machine of staggering proportions, judging from his paper deluge over his last 20 years as a Congressman -- will want to be the driving force. Just like his old idol and Pentagon boss, Robert McNamara. In the McNamara mold, he is building a high-I.Q. team of activists who soon will be launching lightning bolts on everything from defense policy to democratization in Russia to economic policy.
Mr. Lake will want to be the main idea-man himself and, from inside the White House, is better positioned to press his case than Mr. Aspin. In any event, he will be the one who personally shapes the consensus on most issues. He will be more activist than Mr. Bundy was, but like him, he will play an inside game -- often presenting an opaque exterior.
Mr. Christopher, like Mr. Rusk, has no burning policy agenda. If Mr. Aspin and Mr. Lake agree, he will likely go along, adding stylistic cautions and warnings. If troubled, he can appeal to Mr. Clinton, with whom he forged a close and avuncular relationship over the last year. His power will rise or fall on that relationship.
Behind the scenes, the Lake-Tarnoff-Wisner network will often be as important as the top triangle. These three are quite capable of working out policy lines themselves, then selling them to their respective bosses. All three are also first-class operators, able and eager to do deals with Congress and manipulate the press.
Their power rests on their mutual trust, which goes beyond their shared Vietnam experiences. They also worked together intimately in Cyrus Vance's State Department. All are pragmatists. Mr. Wisner is the most conservative, Mr. Tarnoff a curious amalgam of liberal and skeptic, and Mr. Lake ranges in between.
Whether the two power triangles produce cautious or activist policy lines will depend on Mr. Clinton. President Kennedy handled his advisers with self-confidence and assertiveness. Lyndon Johnson was tentative about foreign policy. Mr. Clinton could turn out to be either -- or both.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Presidents Ask a Place in Posterity; Posterity Keeps Rearranging Them

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
AS Bill Clinton begins to seek a place in history, and George Bush wonders what his will be, they need to remember that those places are fixed not just by their accomplishments and their failings, but also by the values of the time when they are judged.
For most of the 19th century, for example, Andrew Jackson was dismissed as a backwoodsman whose populism wrecked the economy and as the forefather of the spoils system whose excesses civil service was meant to cure. But in this century, new times called forth different values. Old Hickory was seen by the first Roosevelt as the exemplar of a strong Presidency, and by the second as a great upper and lower case Democrat, and the histories have reflected those shifts. 
 In the business-oriented 1920's, and in histories published in that decade and the next, progressives like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were devalued. Their stock soared when the country, in the New Deal, revalued their approach.
But changing Presidential reputations are more than just a function of historians following the election returns. Stephen E. Ambrose, biographer of Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon, offers two more thoughtful reasons.
One is "how things turn out." He said Mr. Wilson was considered a disaster in foreign affairs when he left office. By the late 1930's, he said, "the common wisdom became World War II started because we didn't enter the League of Nations" and his standing improved. Now, he said, history may turn again, watching the bloodshed in Bosnia and wondering if Wilson's commitment to self-determination in the old Austro-Hungarian Empire was at fault.
The second reason is that historians can actually learn more about the President they study than people knew at the time, especially with the development of serious Presidential libraries for every President, except Mr. Nixon, since Herbert Hoover.
"The image of Eisenhower as the mumbling, grinning empty-headed President who played golf and let Foster Dulles run the world had to give way once the Eisenhower Library opened up," Mr. Ambrose said. For example, when Mr. Dulles wanted to reject North Korea's proposal to resume armistice talks in 1953, the President squelched him.
 
The Public Counts Hope
 But the judgment of history is not the exclusive property of historians. The American public claims a say. For example, it regards John F. Kennedy as an ideal President even if recent histories have argued that he accomplished little and have stressed his sex life, emphasizing his successes in domestic liaisons more than his triumphs in foreign relations.
David McCullough, Harry Truman's biographer, says that by now Kennedy is "too far down -- it's almost as though he had no ability at all." But the public's view is not based on a contrary reading of the same evidence. The public focuses on the inspiration he provided, starting with the stirring words of his inaugural address. The hopes he raised then in young Americans, recalled last week when one of them, Mr. Clinton, visited his grave, are too imprecise for many historians to weigh, but the public counts them in the balance.
There was a similar disconnect on Mr. Truman when he left office. His last Gallup Poll approval rating was 31 percent, lower than that of any who followed him except Mr. Nixon. And he was widely scorned and disliked. But at the same time there was a strong element of respect from the internationalist community for his firmness against the Soviet Union.
Mr. McCullough says the rise in Truman's popularity since then has come about partly for the wrong reasons. Merle Miller's "Plain Speaking" made him come across as "kind of a cosmic hick," Mr. McCullough said. "The real man was much more complicated, far more intellectual, sentimental, sensitive and certainly much harder-working than he was generally perceived." Politically, Truman is dragged out every four years by whatever candidate hopes to replicate his comeback victory in 1948, with hardly a reference to the liberal domestic program he ran on.
His reputation seems settled, and perhaps most of all by the first test Mr. Ambrose offered, "how things turn out." For in his farewell address, on Jan. 15, 1953, Truman told the nation: "As the free world grows stronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron Curtain -- and as the Soviet hopes for easy expansion are blocked -- then there will have to come a time of change in the Soviet world. Nobody can say for sure when that is going to be, or exactly how it will come about, whether by revolution, or trouble in the satellite states, or by a change inside the Kremlin. I have not a doubt in the world that a change will occur." And he was right.
Lacking that sort of historic anchor, most of his successors' images seem less firmly fixed. For example, Mr. Nixon's floats up, bit by bit, though his disgrace is indelible.
 
The Vietnam Albatross
 So is the Vietnam War's legacy to Lyndon B. Johnson. But the temper of this time may affect his status. If Mr. Clinton seems a successful, activist President, Johnson's reputation may rise. The public may come to remember him more for the domestic successes of his first years in the White House -- a record it has largely dismissed as it focuses on the war.
Historians have hardly started in on Ronald Reagan, thus far the subject of more partisan scribbling than of serious history. Mr. Reagan, as a two-term President of often staggering popularity, has a chance for major Presidential stature in the future. Ultimately, his standing may come to depend fundamentally on whether he gets credit for the end of the cold war or blame for the awesome budget deficits he left behind. And that in turn may depend on which seems more salient when histories are written.
As George Bush begins to write his own memoirs, a genre usually so trivial and self-serving that it hardly ever has significant impact on a President's lasting reputation, he goes with decent poll ratings. The last Gallup Poll measured approval of his handling the Presidency at 56 percent. The only post-war President with a distinctly higher rating was Mr. Reagan, at 63 percent.
But Mr. Bush seems almost certain not to be ranked above the middle range of Chief Executives. One-term Presidents seldom are. The public viewed Mr. Bush quite well on foreign policy, but as it made clear in the most important poll of all, last November's election, it didn't care about foreign policy all that much. And it is hard to foresee how the Gulf War could come to be thought of as a central moment in the nation's history.
Mr. Bush is relatively old at 68 to expect to read the measured judgment of history on his Presidency. But if it seems to sour, to him or his followers, they have a consolation to contemplate: it is likely to change. As Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the Jackson, Roosevelt and Kennedy biographer, put it in 1986 in his "The Cycles of American History":
"Revisionism is an indispensable part of the historical enterprise. 'The one duty we owe to history,' said Oscar Wilde, 'is to rewrite it.' But second opinions are not necessarily wiser than the first. Time in due course revises the revisionists."

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday with an article about the Presidents' places in history illustrated the 1992 approval ratings of two former Presidents incorrectly. The numbers, a 50 percent approval rating for Jimmy Carter and 48 percent for Ronald Reagan, were correct, but the bars showing the values were not proportioned correctly.

HEADLINE: A City That Sunshine Built

BYLINE: MICHAEL DRINKARD's new novel, "Disobedience," to be published in June by W. W. Norton, is set in southern California.
<BYL>By MICHAEL DRINKARD

 BODY:
AFTER the icy monochrome of New York, winter in Pasadena can make the most skeptical Easterner understand why 120,000 people put up with traffic and smog-choked summers to live here. And those of us who are ex-Westerners may pause to wonder why we ever left. People say southern California has no seasons, but on a recent December afternoon in Pasadena, I sampled the delights of several: a fragrant orange tree, roses in bloom, a maple dropping one flame-colored leaf at a time -- all against the background of the snow-powdered San Gabriel Mountains.
Occupying 23 square miles in the San Gabriel Valley under Mount Wilson, Pasadena slopes gently south from an elevation of 1,200 feet to 700 feet. Thousands of trees -- palms, oak, Italian cypress, willow, olive, avocado, walnut, banana and eucalyptus, to name a few -- make the landscape a bewitching blend of the exotic and familiar. You've seen each of these trees before, just not all in the same place. 
 Pasadena owes its birth -- as well as a current popular and economic resurgence -- to the climate. It was founded as an agricultural community called the Indiana Colony in 1874 and, according to the Pasadena Cultural Heritage Commission, took its present name from the Chippewa word meaning "crown of the valley." Another version says the etymology is Spanish for "passage to Eden."
In the late 19th century, the pure, dry winter air was promoted as a cure for respiratory ailments, particularly tuberculosis, which was then reaching epidemic proportions in Eastern urban centers. Farming gave way to development as health seekers and tourists flocked into town. After the completion in 1885 of a rail link to downtown Los Angeles, about 10 miles away, and connection by Santa Fe Railroad to Chicago and the East two years later, Pasadena became not only a vacation mecca, but the winter home for Eastern industrialists.
Many of the mansions and resorts are still standing. On Orange Grove Boulevard (once nicknamed Millionaires' Row) is the Wrigley Mansion, headquarters for the Pasadena Tournament of the Roses. The Castle Green Apartments, at the corner of Green and South Raymond Streets, is a former hotel built in a Moorish adaptation of Mission Revival with prominent domes and a bridge arcade. Slightly rundown, its grandeur now has a haunted, wistful edge. The stunning Ritz-Carlton, Huntington Hotel was opened in 1914. Seismic problems closed the hotel down in 1985, but it has since been reinforced and refurbished.
AWAY from Millionaires' Row (now primarily luxury condominiums), away from other wealthy enclaves -- the palatial estates on San Rafael Avenue hidden behind walls and private security systems, the opulent homes to the south bordering San Marino -- are Pasadena's less conspicuous but equally representative neighborhoods. The flatland south of Colorado Boulevard, between Arroyo Boulevard and Lake Avenue, is quintessential southern California suburbia, with bungalow courts and Spanish-tiled stuccos, bougainvillea, oleander, palm trees and rose bushes. Areas north of the 210 freeway have grim blocks of tract houses. The terraced hillsides, wide curving streets, stone and mortar retaining walls of Linda Vista, of the east bank of Arroyo Seco and of the city's southwestern ridges provide the setting for ranch styles and split-levels, including dramatic residences designed by the likes of Frank Lloyd Wright, Richard Neutra and Irving Gill. The Greene brothers, Pasadena architects, also left an indelible stamp on the community with their many "craftsman bungalows" of the early 1900's.
Early in the 20th century, Pasadena's growing, affluent population needed a commercial center. Railroad promotion and land speculation prompted development along Colorado Boulevard. This strip, now known as Old Town, displays a splendid, chaotic mix of buildings. As with the city's tree species, perhaps you've seen the styles before -- Revival, Deco and Spanish Colonial -- but not cheek by jowl. Rambling two-story edifices (some sharing the same facade) feature Victorian details, projecting bays, brickwork and articulated cornices.
The city is served by three freeways and, with the exception of a few residential neighborhoods, the streets are laid out in a straightforward grid. And though a car is essential in exploring the outlying parks, neighborhoods and attractions, Old Town is one of the rare places in Los Angeles where the sidewalks bustle with pedestrians.
Even as other parts of Los Angeles are mired in economic recession, business here is brisk. In shops and restaurants, boutiques and bookstores, antique marts, cinemas, jazz and billiard bars, we continually heard comparisons being made between Old Town and Westwood, a district 20 miles west known for its restaurants, movie openings and the University of California at Los Angeles.
I LIKE (and once lived in) Westwood, but Pasadena has something it lacks: a history. Route 66 (a stretch of Colorado Boulevard) intersects the Santa Fe railway at the heart of Old Town. Stand at the crossing while a locomotive chugs by and you can almost feel the ghosts of those led west by dreams of the Golden State.
Old Town does have the trappings of trendiness, especially on weekend nights, when street musicians, clowns and performers appear. Crowds come from all over Los Angeles for its restaurants, sampling the wild boar at Parkway Grill on Arroyo Parkway or the ginger catfish at Shiro in South Pasadena. In Old Town, Mi Piace and Roxxi particularly attract the young and fashionably attired.
But things here have not always been so rosy. After the Great Depression stopped the heady westward flow of tourists, the Crown City slid into decay. Later, the rise of automobile traffic and resulting smog was a blow to Pasadena's blue sky reputation. (In summer its air pollution index is still among the county's most hazardous.) As the business and cultural focus shifted to South Lake Avenue -- still a lively commercial center -- Colorado Boulevard hit the skids. Home to bars, single-room-occupancy hotels and pawn and porn shops in the late 70's, the old structures were scheduled for razing to make way for high-rise office buildings. Instead, the city designated Old Town an Urban Conservancy Zone, which made available Federal tax credits, and today it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Virtually every structure on Colorado Boulevard -- as well as those on the quaint side alleys -- has been recently renovated, with seismic fortifications against earthquakes. Still, in other areas of Pasadena there is much work to be done. Northern and eastern business districts and neighborhoods continue to suffer from blight, neglect and poverty.
As one would expect given the climate, Pasadena offers plenty of opportunities for outdoor recreation. Brookside Park, bordering in part on North Arroyo Boulevard, is Pasadena's largest. Brookside covers 520 acres, including the Rose Bowl grounds, lighted ballfields, a swimming pool compound, a golf course, a picnic area with barbecues, and free tennis courts. A short walk south, under the concrete-arched Colorado Street Bridge, is the Arroyo Seco Park, a classic Southern California chaparral ravine threaded with hiking and horse trails.
My wife, Jill, and I spent many pleasant hours in the parks with our racquets, running shoes and sunscreen, until a storm hit. Yes, it does rain in southern California. On the average, Pasadena gets 20.03 inches a year, although so far this month the Los Angeles area has received six times its normal allotment. But when three straight days of downpours and squalls put an end to our athletic pursuits, we found plenty of indoor attractions.
Just west of Old Town, near the corner of Colorado and Orange Grove Boulevards, is the Norton Simon Museum. It has an international reputation for a collection featuring works by Old Masters, Impressionists, Post-Impressionists and 20th-century artists. The museum itself is wonderfully casual. Airy and sprawling, the two-story, 1969 building has curvy walls and floor-to-ceiling windows that look out onto sculptures, fountains and eucalyptus trees. It's not large enough to get lost in, but there's always another surprise around the next corner -- Lewis Baltz's black and white photographs of southern California tract houses, for example, or a looming Henry Moore bronze. Complementing the Western art is the dramatically spotlighted Asian sculpture from the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The Pacific Asia Museum, a few blocks east on 46 North Los Robles Avenue, displays Chinese ceramics, Tibetan rugs and oriental art. Constructed as a private mansion in 1924, the Chinese Treasure Style building and its art were later donated to the city by Grace Nicholson. In San Marino at Pasadena's southern edge, the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens is a merging of three disciplines on the former ranch of Henry Huntington.
A DRIVE on the 210 freeway to the northwest city limit brought us to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a NASA facility operated by the California Institute of Technology that studies the solar system with automated spacecraft. Once we got beyond the tour guide's monotone recitations, and the slide show's heavy-handed public relations-speak, we were captivated by the finely detailed photos of Venus and Jupiter. Even better were life-sized models of the satellites themselves. Galileo, no bigger than a mobile home, was launched in 1989, and is due to arrive at Jupiter on Dec. 7, 1995. The twin Voyagers, launched in 1977, have already explored Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, and, traveling at 66,000 miles per hour, are expected to leave the solar system in the year 2000. I found myself lingering at the exhibits of moon rocks, plasma-wave antennas, orbit trajectories and images of outer space.
Perhaps Pasadena's most famous landmark is the Rose Bowl. The 70-year-old stadium seats 103,000 and, in addition to being the site of the Rose Bowl football championship and Super Bowl XXVII next Sunday, will play host in 1994 to World Cup soccer.
About 30,000 Angeleno browsers and 1,500 vendors know a secret side to the stadium: On the second Sunday of each month from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. year round its parking lot is transformed into a massive flea market.
Everyone knows about Pasadena's proudest event: the Rose Parade, which rolls through Old Town on New Year's Day. Since its inception on Jan. 1, 1890, it has shown the nation that even in the middle of winter the Pasadena climate produces roses and oranges.
A southern California original, the Crown City has its own distinct mythology.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 24, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 24 about the resurgence of Pasadena misstated the location of the Roxxi restaurant. It is near the California Institute of Technology, not in Old Town. A map with the article showed the Rialto Theater incorrectly. It is in South Pasadena; the site shown on the map was actually the Raymond Theater.

JOE BRAVO'S young life changed in the space of a few seconds. When he was 12, he was struck in the chest by a sniper's bullet while riding his bike near his home in the Bronx. Mr. Bravo remembers being a tough street kid back then, a boy who held his own in a gritty neighborhood. After being shot, he said, he was paralyzed from the waist down, forgoing his bike for a wheelchair.
Mr. Bravo is now 38, and he still thinks of himself as tough -- but he is fighting a different kind of battle. 
 As executive director of the Westchester Independent Living Center in White Plains, one of 35 nonprofit centers for the disabled in the state, Mr. Bravo is an advocate for others like him -- people who use wheelchairs, crutches, guide dogs or the arms of friends in conducting their everyday business.
According to statistics from the County Office for the Disabled, there are 149,000 Westchester residents with disabilities, a category that includes not only those with physical impairments but also those who have a learning disability or are mentally ill or who have AIDS or any ongoing illness that might make it difficult to work or to get hired.
Throughout the county, people like Mr. Bravo and Kenneth B. Hill, an advocate in Yonkers, are fighting to remove barriers preventing full implementation of a new Federal law guaranteeing the rights of the disabled.
"Unfortunately, we have a long way to go on this front," said Mr. Hill, a paraplegic who works for Disabled on the Move, another independent living center. Mr. Hill, 27, who was shot in the back as he fled from a robber eight years ago and now uses a wheelchair, works to find housing for people with disabilities and to resolve complaints about discrimination in the workplace.
Although it has been almost 20 years since the first Federal law was passed making it illegal for publicly financed programs to discriminate against the disabled, most advocates agree with Mr. Hill that not enough changes have taken place.
It has also been almost three years since the Americans With Disabilities Act was signed into law. But two deadlines for complying with the most recent law have passed, and another is quickly approaching.
"It was a big deal on the South Lawn of the White House when the law was signed," Mr. Bravo said. "Wow, I thought, we've finally come of age. It took years of advocacy to get that to happen."
Recently, though, Mr. Bravo has begun to temper his initial enthusiasm. "It was naive to think that everything would change just because there was a new law on the books," he said. "It's like what happened with civil rights."
 
Still a Long Way to Go
 The Americans With Disabilities Act, which was passed in the summer of 1990, says employers cannot discriminate on the basis of a disability; public transportation must be accessible to all; places of public accommodation, like restaurants and retail stores, may not discriminate; services by state and local government must be accessible to all, and companies offering phone service to the public must also offer services for the deaf and hearing impaired.
In other words, Mr. Bravo said, disabled people sought through the law a "user-friendly environment that would not separate us out."
By Jan. 26 last year, places of public accommodation were required to comply with the provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act. By July, all private employers with 25 or more employees had to comply. All public buses ordered after Aug. 26, 1990, were to be accessible to the disabled. And this July 26 key rail stations are to be accessible to all, although some exceptions allow deadlines to be moved ahead to July 26, 2020.
At the State Office of Advocate for the Disabled, Robert J. Boehlert, a lawyer, said that although many retail establishments, hotels and restaurants are beginning to comply with the law and there is a growing awareness among employers and local governments that changes must be made, full compliance may be a long way off.
For example, accessible public transportation is a key issue for many in the county, where Westchester Paratransit, a curb-to-curb van service, is the only comprehensive source of public travel for people with disabilities.
And although Metro-North has developed a plan for upgrading some train stations to make them accessible for the disabled, the plan falls far short of the mark, said Terence J. Moakley, associate executive director of the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association.
Mr. Moakley's organization -- an advocacy group representing 2,000 members in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, which is based in Jackson Heights, Queens -- attended Metro-North public hearings last year on plans for upgrading about 10 stations. But the group, along with other advocacy organizations, recommended that 30 stations in the county be upgraded.
Meanwhile, the Federal Transportation Department is reviewing Metro-North's proposal, and many advocates are worried that full access to train service may elude them for many more years.
 
Personal Barriers
 But not all hurdles for the disabled come in the form of architectural barriers, like inaccessible entrances to buildings and train stations or bathrooms that don't accommodate wheelchairs, Mr. Boehlert said from the Office for the Disabled in Albany.
"People's attitudes," he said, "are the biggest stumbling block."
Richard Manley, director of the Westchester County Office for the Disabled, agreed. "It's sad," he said, "but we still hear some very chilling stories."
"When I was a kid," recalled Mr. Manley, who suffers from a congenital bone deformity, "if you ever saw anyone with a disability on TV, the movie either ended with them jumping out of their wheelchair and running away laughing, all cured, or they died. There was no in between."
"Clearly," he said, "some of those stereotypes are fading."
Mr. Manley, who also lectures in classrooms about disabilities, said that a decade ago, students would ask him questions like, "Do you have to sleep in a wheelchair?" or, because he is four feet tall, "Do you live in a little house?"
"Now," he said, "they ask me things like, 'Do you play basketball in a wheelchair?' or 'Can you drive a van?' I do see signs of progress."
While the progress heartens some advocates, it is not enough for others, who say that many businesses and local governments -- concerned about the economics of implementing mandated changes to buildings, for example -- are delaying action.
"Everyone is crying about the costs," Mr. Bravo said. "They make it a low priority because it represents a financial burden."
Mr. Boehlert said, "We may need one or two court cases in the future to point people in the right direction."
But for now, Mr. Bravo and others are employing the power of the boycott, choosing not to frequent restaurants and stores that are not fully accessible. In December, after years of holding their annual Christmas party at a restaurant that did not have accessible restrooms for the disabled, employees in Mr. Bravo's office agreed to go elsewhere.
"That's what it's going to take," Mr. Bravo said. "With 43 million Americans with disabilities, our power as consumers can hit home. It's our numbers that will finally make the difference."
People who want more information about the Americans With Disabilities Act or who are concerned about possible violations of the law, can call the Justice Department at (202) 514-0301.
Blind and visually impaired people can call Richard M. Keller at the Independent Living Center in White Plains. Mr. Keller runs support groups and counseling sessions and has information about new communications technology, including computers, which are available for the visually handicapped. His telephone number, and Mr. Bravo's, is 682-3926.
In Yonkers the number for Disabled on the Move is 968-4717.
The County Office for the Disabled also provides information about the new law and acts as a referral agency for services. That telephone number is 285-2957.

HEADLINE: After-School Centers Fill a Gap in Students' Lives

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

DATELINE: ARDSLEY

 BODY:
AT an hour when most elementary school students are still rubbing the sleepy dust from their eyes and scrambling to make the school bus on time, 10-year-old Tracy Green and her 7-year-old brother, David, are already engrossed in a board game at the Ardsley Children's Center at the Concord Road Elementary School.
Several children are reviewing the previous day's homework assignments as they sprawl on a rug in front of a picture window, while others sit quietly and read in a brightly lighted corner. 
 Down the hall in the cafeteria, eight boys from second through fourth grade are playing Frisbee with soft foam disks, while a cluster of kindergarten and first-grade girls compare the toys they have brought in their backpacks.
 
More of the Waking Day at School
 During a time when educators, industrialists and politicians debate the benefits of expanding the school day and increasing the academic year, many children are already spending a significant part of their waking day at school, albeit not always in academic pursuits.
The school day may officially start at 8:30 A.M. and run until 3 P.M. in most districts, but for increasing numbers of Westchester youngsters, it is not uncommon to be at school from 7:30 A.M. to nearly 6 P.M.
"Sometimes we assume that a child is grown-up if he goes to school," said Sally Ziegler, executive director of the Child Care Council of Westchester, based in White Plains. "School-age child care is an essential family support, and it's wonderful to see how it has grown in the last 10 years. As the economy got crunchier, more people had to work. Once women had the freedom to use these centers, even on a drop-off basis, they could move into a working life."
In even the most affluent Westchester bedroom communities, two-career couples are becoming increasingly the norm rather than the exception.
The cost of a full-time housekeeper may be prohibitive for many families, and even those who can afford weekly salaries of, say, $200 to $300 often prefer to have their children spend their time in the more social setting of an after-school center.
For other parents, after-school center fees, which range from about $190 to $250 a month for a five-day program, are reasonable enough to justify their staying on the job.
 
Constantly Increasing Enrollment
 Parents who have to catch the 7:57 A.M. train to Manhattan or return home two hours after the school day ends may be reluctant to rely on baby sitters or neighbors to get children to school in the morning or meet a school bus in the afternoon. In most cases grandparents or other family members are not available to help with child care.
"I have found that the enrollment is constantly increasing," said Julie Fraitag, executive director of the Ardsley Children's Center, which has served as a model for other centers. "There's a great need. We started with 10 children in 1981 and now have 140 children registered."
The Ardsley Children's Center serves students in kindergarten through fourth grade, and last fall it started a program in the district's middle school for fifth and sixth graders.
Whether these centers provide before-school and after-school services, operate on school holidays or during vacation breaks, they are often necessary to fill in the gaps between a parent's work schedule and the school calendar.
The programs serve families with a wide range of incomes and include private school programs like the Hackley School's in Tarrytown. They offer children a structured afternoon of recreational and educational activities as well as providing a safe and quiet place to be until parents return from work. Some centers will escort children to and from after-school clubs or meet them at churches.
In several communities with half-day kindergartens, the centers also offer parents an opportunity to have their children in a full-day setting with stimulating activities. For example, the 10-year-old Chappaqua Children's Workshop has 83 percent of enrolled kindergartners in its program, said Jill Stewart, executive director of the workshop. "We definitely felt the need for an all-day program," she said. "First and foremost, we are here for working parents who need to have their children in an enriching educational program for more than two and a half hours a day. There's a symbiotic relationship between the kindergarten program and our program; we reinforce the skills of the Chappaqua kindergarten program."
Jane Arcaya, director of the Dobbs Ferry After-School Center, said, "Society and the community have to catch up with the fact that parents are working."
 
The Reliability Factor
 And because both are working, parents must be able to count on their children's being taken care of.
"For parents, the biggest factor is reliability," said Shelly Levin, director of the Children's Corner in Larchmont, which serves 150 children in kindergarten through sixth grade. "The biggest anxiety is that the sitter won't show up," she said. "Some parents also don't like it if the kids are at home with a sitter, watching TV and playing Nintendo, and not learning how to use their leisure time in a healthy way."
Other families are concerned about having their children in a social and stimulating environment. "A lot of parents want their children to have other children to socialize with," Ms. Fraitag said. Like many other centers, the Ardsley Children's Center offers special events and a family evening, possibly a karaoke sing-along or a square dance, to foster a community feeling among those using the program.
With their mixture of cooking and crafts, homework help, sports and recreation, board games, puzzles and other activities, the centers offer children an alternative to the "What'll I do?" syndrome. "We like to give freedom of choice for kids," Ms. Fraitag said. "There's encouragement to try different activities, but it's not high pressure. This is a recreational program, where we try to enrich a child's life."
 
Most Are School-Based
 Anne-Marie Terrone, director of Kids Extended Educational Program, known as Keeps, which serves school-age children in the Rye Neck and Mamaroneck school districts at a building not on school premises, added, "We try to make it like home, where kids feel comfortable, with a quiet, supervised area for them to do homework."
Although the programs are usually run by independent, nonprofit organizations that rent space from school districts, the fact that most of them are based at a school is an advantage. "There's a great deal of comfort for parents, because they know where their child is at all times," Ms. Fraitag said.
Georgiene Dempsey, principal of the Springhurst Elementary School in Dobbs Ferry, said: "We don't want this to be just day care. We want it structured to help children. There's a nice connection where children have a comfortable feeling because their regular teachers work in the After-School Center. There are a lot of adults here, which adds to a parent's feeling of security. For parents, the fact that the children are here with us means that if a child had a problem that day in the lunchroom, someone knows about it."
The programs offer supervision for children who might otherwise spend their afternoons in unsupervised settings. The Kids Bridge program, which started at the Oakside Elementary School in Peekskill last fall and is sponsored by the Peekskill Area Health Center, serves 20 school-age youngsters in kindergarten through sixth grade from 3 to 5:30 P.M.
"There's really a paucity of services, with a lack of well-organized child care," said Roberta Marcus-Leiner, director of Women and Youth services at the Peekskill Area Health Center. "Too often, kids are left to their own devices, especially in the fifth and sixth grades. Everyone at all levels feels the impact of diminishing resources. We're providing consistent daily after-school care, including homework help, indoor and outdoor recreation, games, snacks and arts and crafts." Added Anne Nolon, president of the Peekskill Area Health Center, "We have a terrific opportunity to impact these kids in a holistic, comprehensive way."
 
Fun for the Children
 For children in after-school centers, the experience is fun and carries none of the punitive connotation of being made to stay after school. "I like being with the other children, and I like being here with my brother," said Tracy Green, a fourth grader at Ardsley's Concord Road School. "I like to do the cooking." Added David Choyne, another fourth grader who attends only morning sessions, "I have friends here, and I like to go to the cafeteria and play games."
For parents, the programs are more than merely an affordable alternative to baby sitting. "It was a lifesaver and one of the reasons I bought in the district," said Harrel Morris, a special education department head in Yonkers and a member of the Ardsley Board of Education. "I would have had a problem without it because I wanted to be independent. I was very impressed with the quality of supervision, and my children enjoyed it. It's a definite asset to the community."
Allyson Funicello, a teacher in New Rochelle whose 7-year-old son attends the Mamaroneck Keeps program, said: "It was a godsend to me. I get out of my school later than he does and otherwise would have had to pay a baby sitter. It was very important to me that he had it, because Mamaroneck has half-day kindergarten, and I felt that he was ready for a more social situation. The fees are reasonable, and I like the stimulation of it."
No matter how enthusiastically parents endorse the programs, as districts struggle with expanding enrollments, space at schools is becoming more scarce. "No matter how much the community loves it, the reality is that it's the first to be pushed around when there's a space crunch," Ms. Ziegler of the Child Care Council of Westchester said.
Most parents who depend on the centers are reluctant to contemplate the alternatives. "The Irvington Children's Center is the only way I could be a part-time working mom," said Robin Dellabough, a writer and editor. "You don't have to sign up for full time, and they offer very gracious amounts of flexible time. They bend over backward to accommodate working mothers. I feel totally secure because my children are in a quality environment where they are nurtured and well cared for and not plopped in front of the TV. I don't have to worry about a baby sitter calling in sick because the children's center is always there."
 
 
Extending the School Day
 AFTER-SCHOOL centers are generally open only to residents of the immediate community or school district, and they adhere to the school calendar, although some open their doors on half-day conference days and during school vacations. Fees vary by program and attendance. The fees given here are for the month for one child attending five afternoons a week.

HEADLINE: FORAGING;
Where Treasures Wait to Be Wanted

BYLINE: By Cara Greenberg

 BODY:
GOODWILL INDUSTRIES' thrift store on Ditmars Boulevard in Astoria, Queens, is different things to different people.
To those who can't pay department-store prices, it's a place where they can get decent, wearable clothing for a few dollars. 
 To antiques dealers, it's a place where they can stop on Monday and Thursday mornings, when deliveries arrive from Goodwill's nearby headquarters.
And to Kim and Mike Bratland, a couple who live in the neighborhood, and their friend Lisa Perez, all in their early 20's, it's a place for whiling away a Sunday afternoon indulging in their passion for 1970's synthetics.
"One hundred percent polyester," said Ms. Perez, a secretary at the Ayer advertising agency in Manhattan, holding up a shiny black button-down shirt ($4) with a large pointy collar. "It'll go with my platform shoes," she said. "Gotta get a pair of bell bottoms. I'm going for the dated look."
Ms. Bratland, an aspiring actress who also works at Ayer, chose a painfully gaudy yellow ruffled blouse ($4). "It's the whole 70's thing going on in fashion," she said. "Ruffles are happening; and clashing colors."
Mr. Bratland, a long red ponytail sticking out from under his turned-around baseball cap, said: "It's like a treat for me to come in here. I come once a month with $20, $30." Holding a pair of maroon velvet bell-bottom jeans ($5), he added: "I buy anything that flares on the bottom. They're my stage clothes." Mr. Bratland, who works in a music store by day, plays in a heavy-metal fusion band called Naked Sun.
A practiced thrift shopper, Mr. Bratland is convinced that the Astoria Goodwill is "the best one in the city -- they don't overprice things." Ms. Bratland agreed, adding, "This stuff in the Village vintage-clothing stores would be five times as much."
The 2,500-square-foot Astoria store is one of the largest of 18 Goodwill thrift stores in the five boroughs. The shops are owned and operated by Goodwill Industries of Greater New York Inc., a nonprofit organization that gets its goods from individual and commercial donors.
Goodwill Industries also operates an array of vocational and rehabilitative programs for people with disabilities, the unemployed and disadvantaged youth.
The store in Astoria sells primarily clothing and toys, in addition to occasional pieces of furniture, some housewares and a few antiques.
Barbara Dorry, a bookkeeper who lives in the neighborhood, said, "I snoop out the good stuff, like Liz Claiborne and Calvin Klein."
"My daughter saw a sweater I bought here for $6 that was $48 at the Gap," Ms. Dorry said. "She asked where I got it, and I told her. She said, 'Oh mother, how could you?' But still, she was impressed."
Two sisters, Spiredoula and Marika Viglis, who grew up in the still largely Greek neighborhood, said they check the store periodically for books and classical-music recordings. "The old thick ones, recorded in the 50's," said Spiredoula Viglis, a sophomore at the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan. Marika Viglis, a student at Columbia Teachers College, added, "We like the pops and scratches."
On this occasion, Spiredoula Viglis bought what she called "an old lady's handbag" for $3. She swung the large leather rectangle by its sturdy strap. "If somebody bothers you, you just slug them with it," she said.
The Goodwill thrift store, at 31-20 Ditmars Boulevard in Astoria, Queens, is open Monday through Saturday from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M. and Sunday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Telephone: (718) 545-8875.

HEADLINE: New York Post Finds a Reprieve In Investor Who May Buy Paper

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
On the brink of announcing a suspension of publication, The New York Post found temporary reprieve last night in a wealthy investor who said he might buy the embattled newspaper. The Post, meanwhile, declared that it would publish today and fight on for survival.
"Contrary to what everybody has thought or said, The New York Post is not dead," Peter S. Kalikow, the owner, said at the end of a day of tabloid-style brinkmanship in which the newspaper's workers agreed to steep temporary pay cuts and a Governor, a Senator, a Cardinal and other prominent New York figures joined the fray to keep the paper afloat. 
 Chomping on a cigar, clad in a sweater and jeans, looking relaxed for the first time in three days of round-the-clock crisis, Mr. Kalikow met reporters in his office and announced that he had struck a deal with Steven Hoffenberg, chairman of the Towers Financial Corporation and a multimillionaire investor and businessman, to rescue The Post in the next four weeks.
"Within that period," Mr. Kalikow said, "we hope to execute a contract of sale to Mr. Hoffenberg and Towers." He said the last-minute reprieve by Mr. Hoffenberg had been unsolicited, and suggested that it had come just as The Post prepared to throw in the towel.
Mr. Kalikow did not spell out the details, but others familiar with the deal said that Mr. Hoffenberg, while not flatly agreeing to buy The Post, had expressed avid interest and had in effect agreed to guarantee the paper's expenses while he investigated the possibility of buying it.
Mr. Hoffenberg, in a statement last night, was less oblique, indicating that he would buy The Post and would sign papers today to set the process in motion. He said he intended to resurrect it as a force on New York's newspaper scene and at a profit. He said he would put his own 1,000-member sales force to work selling ads, offer the unions equity in the paper and strive for a cooperative relationship with the workers, who he said had sacrificed greatly.
"The New York Post does not deserve to die," Mr. Hoffenberg declared. "But more than just a New York tradition, I believe it can be made to be an economically viable newspaper that can successfully compete in the New York marketplace for its share of readership and advertising."
The deal was approved by Bankers Trust, which was unwilling to sink any more cash into the money-losing Post and had precipitated the crisis on Friday by cutting off its credit. The bank had resisted appeals by Mr. Kalikow and others to relent all weekend, until Mr. Hoffenberg entered the picture.
Mr. Hoffenberg will virtually take the bank's place, giving The Post loans against its accounts receivable -- insiders said some $7 million to $8 million was owed the paper by its advertisers and subscribers -- and said he would provide the cash-starved paper an immediate infusion of $300,000 to $500,000 to help get it through this week.
Mr. Kalikow, looking as ebullient as a Dickensian character released from debtor's prison, was lavish in praise of his employees and a host of prominent figures who had helped him through a difficult weekend, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, John Cardinal O'Connor, and the state's Economic Development Commissioner, Vincent Tese.
"Mario Cuomo worked literally with me day and night for the last three days," Mr. Kalikow said. "It's been a rough three days, I will admit."
Asked about his employees, who had voted to accept his demand for a 20 percent pay cut for four weeks, he declared: "I would say that without those votes there would be no New York Post."
And what will today's Page 1 headline be in The Post?
"It will cost you 50 cents to find out," Mr. Kalikow beamed.
The front-page banner of a 60-page Post, which hit the streets just after midnight, declared: "Never Say Die." And The Post's editor, Lou Colasuonno, said in an early-morning interview: "We're still here." He said the mood in the newsroom was buoyant after "an incredible roller-coaster of a day."
Another fact of life for The Post's readers was a 10-cent price increase on the city edition, to 50 cents, effective today. The price increase affects 280,000 copies in the five boroughs. The rest of The Post's 440,000 copies go to the suburbs, where the price remains 50 cents.
The transaction that brought Mr. Hoffenberg to The Post was put together through a series of calls involving William Fugazy, the limousine magnate, Governor Cuomo, Mr. Tese, Cardinal O'Connor and Howard J. Rubenstein, the public relations consultant, who has represented Mr. Fugazy, Mr. Hoffenberg and The Post for years.
And while Mr. Hoffenberg had expressed interest in The Post late last week, according to Mr. Rubenstein, the deal almost went awry because Post officials had the wrong telephone number for him -- one digit off. Governor Cuomo at one point called the State Police to locate Mr. Hoffenberg, and a police check found that the number was wrong. Finally, contact was made and Mr. Hoffenberg called Mr. Fugazy, then The Post.
Five hours were lost in the confusion, and the call came only minutes before Mr. Kalikow was to announce that publication would be halted. "We thought we would die because we knew he was interested," Mr. Rubenstein said.
There is no guarantee that Mr. Hoffenberg will ultimately rescue The Post, or that other potential buyers in the wings will step forward in the coming month. But the fast-breaking developments gave an aura of fresh hope to what had been a weekend of gloom and frustration, especially for workers facing the loss of their jobs at The Post.
"It's great," said George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, representing seven of The Post's 11 unions. "We're delighted for the union members and for the people of New York. We hope it means that The Post will continue to be the oldest paper in the country."
But several staff members, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, expressed concern that Mr. Hoffenberg had been reprimanded by the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to register a $34 million securities offering.
 
Bank Credit Gone
The Post, its cash till empty, its bank credit gone, its owner bankrupt and unable to help pay costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars a week, according to executives at the paper, had decided late yesterday to suspend publication, despite agreement over the weekend by its 716 unionized workers and its management executives to take the 20 percent pay cut.
The savings from that cut were expected to reduce The Post's weekly outlay for wages and benefits by about $170,000, to $680,000 from $850,000. And the increased revenues from the 10-cent increase in the newsstand price, when wholesalers' costs and other expenses were deducted, were expected to provide another $100,000 a week.
But the total of $270,000 in savings and increased revenues -- while probably sufficient to enable The Post to break even, or perhaps turn a small profit -- were not enough to keep the paper afloat because the money would be realized slowly, and the paper's cash needs were immediate.
That meant that Bankers Trust, which had already sunk millions into the paper, would have to supply more cash in the coming month if the search for a new owner was to go on, and the bank's officials were simply unwilling to do that.
As the clock continued to tick, a doomsday announcement was prepared, saying that today's issue of The Post would not come out.
But late in the day, a ray of hope developed. Governor Cuomo and Mr. Tese, in separate interviews, said Mr. Kalikow had found an investor and potential buyer whose interest was sufficient for him to put up a large sum to solve the paper's immediate cash-flow problems.
Mr. Hoffenberg, whose Manhattan-based nationwide financial services company does $1 billion to $2 billion in business a year, has holdings in medical centers and other businesses.
"He's a serious potential buyer in the sense that he's putting up serious money," Mr. Tese said.

HEADLINE: Fighting for Custom House, Boston Appeals to U.S.

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Towering 500 feet above the tourist-packed Quincy Market and only blocks from Boston Harbor, the gray granite Custom House sits dark, dank and empty, waiting for better times.
Plate-size paint chips hang off the walls of the yellow Counting Room, where, beginning in 1847, seafaring merchants once lined up to pay their taxes. Light from the security desk filters weakly into a cavernous room under a grand dome, which formed the original roof before a 30-story tower was added over it in 1915. 
 Elsewhere, rows of clunky fluorescent lights extend from majestically high ceilings, remnants of a hodgepodge of Federal offices housed there until the General Services Administration locked the doors, declaring the building surplus property in 1986.
Built at a time when Boston's port collected one-fifth of the customs tax for the nation, the Custom House has long since seen its glory days pass. But now, after a five-year struggle to develop the property on their own, city officials are taking the fight to Washington in an effort to open the building's doors again.
 
Sale to City in 1987
 Seeking to protect one of its most valuable landmarks and the symbol of Boston's port, city officials bought the Custom House from the Federal Government in 1987 for $11 million -- $1.1 million immediately and the remaining $9.9 million in a 10-year mortgage.
But that was just before the recession sent real-estate values plummeting. Developers working with the Boston Redevelopment Agency complained that there was not enough usable space in the slender tower to justify the renovation costs. A plan to turn it into an office building was abandoned.
Since then, the Beal Companies and Inter-Continental Hotels have received preliminary approvals to build a glass bridge that would connect the Custom House with a historic brick building across the street, using both buildings as a 336-room luxury hotel.
But without a drastic reduction in the mortgage, city officials and the developers say, no lender will put up the money to allow the project to proceed.
Recently, the Custom House was appraised at $2.5 million, less than the $3.5 million the city has already paid on the property since the 1987 purchase, said Paul L. Barrett, director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which owns it. "We've already paid more than the property is worth," he said. "No project can carry the kind of mortgage that the G.S.A. is requiring on the property."
 
Plan to Seek U.S. Gift
 Mr. Barrett said he would ask the Clinton Administration to give the building to the city under the Historic Monument Act.
But to change the terms of the sale now would be unfair to taxpayers, argued Earl E. Jones, Commissioner of the Federal Property and Assets Management Service of the General Services Administration. Mr. Jones said the city stopped its quarterly payments in April 1991 and had not resumed them, even though his agency agreed last summer to reduce the interest and extend the mortgage to 30 years from 10.
Mr. Jones said it was unusual for the General Services Administration to finance the sale of a Federal property, and even more unusual to renegotiate the terms.
"We have never stretched it just this far," he said. "This was a great effort on our part to try to help the city."
If the city does not resume payments, Mr. Jones warned, he will have to consider other applicants to buy the property, including organizations that house the homeless.
He said there was no guarantee that the Federal Government would give the city the building under the monument act.
"We're willing to take that risk," Mr. Barrett replied. The city is paying $20,000 a month in security and maintenance costs alone, he said, whereas the hotel would create 450 permanent jobs and tax revenue. "I think a new Administration will take a fresh look at it," he said. "They are talking about growing the economy; that's why they won the election."
 
Need for Economic Stake
 People following the case are not surprised by this latest turn of events.
"To be protected, the Custom House needs to be a part of the ongoing economy of Boston," said Ellen Lipsey, executive director of the Boston Landmarks Commission.
Philip Bergen, the librarian of the Bostonian Society, fondly remembers being taken to the 25th floor observation tower as a child. "For many generations, that was where you went to get a good view of the city," he said. "It's sad to think it's still there, but it's not open to the public."

HEADLINE: BENTSEN SUGGESTS BROAD ENERGY TAX WILL BE PROPOSED

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen suggested today that the Clinton Administration would propose a tax on all forms of energy to help lower the budget deficit and encourage conservation.
In a television interview, Mr. Bentsen, whom President Clinton has made the Administration's chief spokesman on economic matters, also indicated that a tax cut for the middle class was not in the offing. In addition, he did not take issue with a questioner who asserted that an energy tax would fall most heavily on the middle class. 
 On the NBC News program "Meet the Press," on which Mr. Bentsen was interviewed, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the chairman of the Finance Committee and thus one of the most important voices in Congress on tax legislation, said he would support an energy tax.
 
'Some Tough Choices'
 Mr. Bentsen's statements amounted to a concession by the new Administration that the only way to bring down the budget deficit is to take the politically difficult steps of raising the taxes of ordinary Americans and cutting Government programs.
"Some tough choices will have to be made that haven't been faced up to in the past," the Treasury Secretary said. He said that spending reductions would provide a large part of what the Administration hoped to cut from the deficit by 1997.
Mr. Bentsen seemed to rule out a tax on gasoline alone and spoke of the benefits of a "broad-based" energy tax. Broad-based normally refers to a tax on all forms of energy, including petroleum, natural gas, coal, hydroelectricity and nuclear power.
 
Impact on Many Products
 For a family spending $100 a month in utility bills and $60 for gasoline, a 5 percent increase in fuel costs would total $8 each month. In addition, the prices of many products and services, like air travel, would rise as the higher cost of fuel was passed along to consumers.
In his campaign, Mr. Clinton had maintained that lowering the deficit could be accomplished rather painlessly by raising the taxes of wealthy individuals and foreign companies and by improving the way Government programs were managed. He promised a tax cut for the middle class.
But since the election, he has begun to talk of the need for some bitter medicine to get the deficit under control. "It will not be easy," he declared in his Inaugural Address last week. "It will require sacrifice."
Mr. Bentsen said the main reason for the change in attitude was that the budget deficit in the middle of this decade had been projected to be much higher than was estimated six months ago. That is because the economy is expected to be weaker, the cost of Government medical programs is rising faster than expected and the timetable for spending for the savings and loan bailout has changed.
 
Falling Behind Schedule
 Other officials who have been working on the economic package said that the deficit-cutting measures offered during the campaign were always insufficient and that the difficulty in reducing the deficit had been underestimated.
Before the election, Mr. Clinton had promised that he would present an economic plan to Congress on Inauguration Day. Officials now say that the plan will not be ready until the middle of next month and that a complete budget will not be submitted until March.
"Four years from now or three weeks from now, people are going to judge President Clinton on the effectiveness of his program and not on whether it was presented a few weeks late," Mr. Bentsen said in a brief telephone conversation on Friday.
On television today, he said that the economics team was working on the matter night and day and that material was sent to him at home as late as 10:30 Saturday night. He noted that Ronald Reagan, the last President to take office determined to turn the Government's economic policies around, did not announce his plans until Feb. 18, 1981, almost a month after his inauguration.
 
Awaiting Political Decisions
 The biggest decisions to be made, officials said, are not so much economic judgments as political ones that can be made only by President Clinton himself. "What it all boils down to is who's going to take the hit," a Presidential adviser said.
In other words, who is going to end up paying higher taxes? Who is going to have their benefits reduced? Which claimants for new Government money will be rejected? Which politicians will be denied projects for their constituents?
During the campaign and the transition and his first few days in office, Mr. Clinton has avoided making those judgments, at least publicly.
Mr. Bentsen argued that Americans were willing to pay the price to cut the deficit and strengthen the economy. "The American people are ready for it," he said, "as long as they think those sacrifices are equally shared and the investment is in our future for the increase in the standard of living of our people."
 
'Our Budget Deficit Now'
 Senator Moynihan said the Democrats in Congress would support unpopular measures. "Look, it is our budget deficit now," he said. "We were partners in creating it. It wasn't our idea, but it's our deficit. And it will paralyze our Administration and our country if we don't get it out of the way."
As for Republicans, they favor consumption taxes like energy taxes over taxes on income or wealth.
Mr. Bentsen emphasized that the plan was still being developed. He avoided most questions about its contents and did not say specifically that the Administration favored an energy tax. But the positive way he responded to a question about such a tax left little doubt about where the Administration stood.
"A broad-based energy tax is certainly one of those that is on the table as an option to be considered, because it does a couple of things," he said. "One, it raises revenue. On the other point, it helps lead to some environmental objectives that we're trying to bring about by conservation of the use of energy. See, at the present time, we're importing almost a billion dollars a week of oil, and that certainly adds to our trade deficit."
 
Emphasis on One Promise
 The imported oil, he went on to say, often comes from "unstable political areas."
Mr. Bentsen also suggested that the Administration might favor higher taxes on alcohol and tobacco and restated the Clinton campaign pledge for higher income taxes on families with incomes of more than $200,000 a year. He said that if additional deficit spending was proposed for this year to stimulate the economy, the stimulus would be smaller than the $50 billion that some economists have recommended.
Vice President Al Gore said last week that he supported an energy tax. Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary said in her confirmation hearing that she opposed new energy taxes, but that is probably evidence that she is not a central figure in overall economic policy-making within the Administration.
Middle-class Americans would bear the brunt of an energy tax because they pay a much larger portion of their incomes for fuel than do the rich. Congress would probably provide some form of rebate for the poor to offset the additional cost of essential fuel.
Mr. Bentsen said a gasoline tax would affect some regions of the country much more severely than others. Senator Moynihan said he agreed with that judgment, even though westerners, who drive longer distances, would be affected much more by a gasoline tax than New Yorkers.
An energy tax could be based on the cost of fuel consumed, on units produced like barrels of oil or tons of coal or on the heat content as measured by British thermal units. Some economists favor a tax based on carbon dioxide emissions, but that does not seem to be what the Administration has in mind.
 
Energy Tax May Have Support
 A broad-based energy tax could be collected by retailers like power companies or filling stations or it could be imposed at an earlier stage of the distribution process.
The Congressional Budget Office has calculated that a 5 percent tax on energy consumption would raise $18 billion a year.
An energy tax might be more politically palatable than other taxes that would raise a similar amount of revenue. All regions of the country would be affected more or less evenly. And one form of energy would not be favored over another, meaning that important lobbies might be held at bay. In addition, it would have the strong support of environmentalists.
The public might be sold by the arguments that fuel prices have not risen as fast as other prices in recent years and that Americans generally pay less for energy than do people in Europe and Japan.
The biggest price difference is in gasoline, which is much more heavily taxed abroad than it is here. In the United States, the Federal gasoline tax is 14.1 cents a gallon, while state and local taxes add 10 cents to 20 cents a gallon. France, by contrast, places a tax of about $2.80 a gallon on gasoline. In Italy the tax is more than $3.50 a gallon, and in Japan it is about $1.70.

HEADLINE: Mayors Press Clinton on Promise to Rebuild Nation

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Pressing President Clinton on his campaign promise to rebuild America, the nation's mayors have given Administration officials a list of more than 7,000 "ready to go" construction projects that would cost $27 billion and create 400,000 jobs.
The projects, in more than 500 cities, have already received all the local approval necessary and need only Federal money to begin. They include the building and renovating of schools, jails, housing, streets and highways, bridges, police and fire stations, as well as sewers and waste-water treatment plants. The mayors estimated that $13 billion would be needed to begin these projects, most of which would take more than a year to complete. 
 At the midwinter meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, the mayors gave a list of these projects last week to Henry G. Cisneros, the new Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and to Federico F. Pena, the new Transportation Secretary.
"All we need is money," J. Thomas Cochran, executive director of the mayors conference, said in an interview. "The President has talked about an annual increase of $20 billion to rebuild America, and the mayors believe that this promise should be kept."
 
'We Must Do Both'
 But the campaign promise now faces the scrutiny of Mr. Clinton's budget officials, who have set deficit reduction as their priority. The Federal budget for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1 provides $50.4 billion for major physical-improvement projects, compared with $46.5 billion last year. About half of that money is for transportation projects.
Asked Friday whether there was a conflict between stimulating the economy and reducing the deficit, George Stephanopoulos, the President's spokesman, replied, "The President has said we must do both, and he will."
The mayors look hopefully to Washington after 12 years of Republican government, during which the cities saw direct Federal aid drop to $23.4 billion in the current fiscal year from $44.2 billion in the 1981 fiscal year.
Along with the mayors, some lawmakers have told the Clinton Administration that they believe public-works spending will generate private investment that will create more jobs and thereby help reduce the deficit.
"This is not a case of having to choose between economic investment and deficit reduction," Representative Norman Y. Mineta, the California Democrat who heads the Public Works and Transportation Committee, said at a hearing last week. "If we do not invest in economic growth, we will not achieve deficit reduction."
 
New York's Wish List
 Last week, Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York gave Mr. Pena a list of 519 New York projects costing a total of $1.7 billion. They included $268 million for new and renovated housing; $190 million for schools; $171 million for streets and highways; $164 million for sanitation projects; $142 million for buildings; $123 million to renovate correctional institutions and $110 million for piers and terminals.
But New York's wish list, like that of every other city and every state, will be competing with those of the transportation industry. According to surveys, the industry would have no problem spending most of the $20 billion annual increase suggested by Mr. Clinton, and the American Road and Transportation Builders Association has already begun soliciting financial support from its members for a campaign of advertising, publicity and lobbying.
The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, after surveying officials in all the states, said it could spend an extra $8.5 billion in Federal highway money in 1993 beyond the $19.2 billion already provided by Congress. The American Public Transit Association said the easiest way to spend money would be to buy new buses, vans and subway cars.
 
Projects Elsewhere
 Other cities that have submitted lists of "ready to go" projects include these:
*Boston, which is seeking $277.5 million for projects that include $167 million for a water- and sewer-treatment plant, $47 million for public housing and $11.7 million for road and bridge improvements.
*Newark, which wants $175 million in new public-works spending, including $44 million for two garages for city vehicles, $12 million for neighborhood family recreation centers and $7.5 million for sewers.
*Chicago, which is seeking a total of $145 million, including $28 million for a recycling plant, $20 million for street resurfacing, $10 million for a crime laboratory and $9 million for sewers.
*Detroit, which is asking for a total of $577.4 million, including $266 million for public buildings and plants, $94 million for streets and $83 million for environmental improvements.
*Los Angeles, which is seeking a total of $214 million, including $59 million for traffic surveillance and control, $52 million for street improvements, $27 million for new parks and $15 million for housing rehabilitation.
Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston has also made a special pitch to the Administration for $92.7 million in the projects, which he said would create 4,000 construction jobs. "There is work to do in our cities, and unemployed workers to do it," said Mr. Cochran, the mayors conference director. "Investment in public works will lead the cities out of recession, and the cities will lead the nation."

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
42d Street Project Remains on Track

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
While signs of 42d Street's long-planned redevelopment remain overshadowed by the area's boarded-up stores, bureaucratic delays and a lingering recession, business and government leaders say the project remains in full gear -- albeit on a smaller scale -- and that indications of a new commercial vitality are starting to emerge.
The evidence ranges from an uptick in sales for some of the businesses that remain open to the flowering of new enterprises adjacent to the project and a surge of interest in leasing new retail space. Those involved in the redevelopment project say there is an increasing awareness that there is gold to be mined on 42d Street, and that the prospecting has already begun. 
 "There's a great deal of untapped spending power in the area," said Faith H. Consolo, senior vice president of Garrick-Aug Associates, hired by the developers to lease their retail space.
 
20 Million Tourists
 The reason is pure numbers. Perhaps as many as 20 million tourists a year come to Times Square. Some 190,000 commuters a day pass through the Port Authority and 250,000 through the subway station.
Under the redevelopment plan, two developers -- the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty -- agreed last August to spend around $20 million to refurbish existing buildings for use as retail establishments. They did this to retain their right to build four giant towers when the market for office space improves.
A design plan for the scaled-back development is expected to be completed by March, with a five-month comment period to follow. Construction could begin by year's end.
But the displaced merchants, ranging from coffee shops to a seller of scuba gear to tiny groceries, will not come back. More upscale merchants are the stated goal.
"We can have one of the best and most exciting shopping streets in America," said Miss Consolo, who added that leasing deals may begin to be signed within 60 days.
 
Eager Shoppers
 A battery of marketing studies indicate that the tourists and commuters who pass through the area are eager to spend money. In one random sample paid for by the project organizers, 45 percent of the people said they would definitely shop in Times Square if there were new shops. A survey of 100 potential retailers revealed that 90 would like to be on 42d Street, Miss Consolo said.
One indication that such optimism might not be misplaced is that not all merchants say business is off, even with the street's dreary appearance. Paul Rosenthal, assistant manager of Modell's Sporting Goods at 243 West 42d Street, says sales have risen recently. "And with spring coming, we're going to do even better," he said.
A more telling indication is the success of the Gap store at 42d and Broadway, which opened last May in space that had been occupied by an O.T.B. parlor. Though the company will not discuss individual stores, public officials and other retailers say it has been startlingly successful. Most days, one can hear a cacophony of languages in the store.
 
Improvements to Terminal
 At the other end of the block, the Port Authority Bus Terminal is brightening up in promising ways. A 7,300 square-foot Duane Reade drugstore is planned for the southwest corner of 42d Street at Eighth Avenue, awaiting only approval of the Port Authority's board.
"Not only is it an anchor for the bus terminal, but also an anchor for retail activity on 42d Street," said Jack Brendlen, the manager of the Port Authority's real estate and property division.
The change in atmosphere at the terminal -- with its classical musical and social services for the homeless -- presage a new 42d Street, optimists say. Their hopes are further buoyed by the success of the Times Square Business Improvement District at cleaning up local sidewalks. The city Sanitation Department rated 88.9 percent of sidewalks clean last summer, compared with just 54.8 percent nine months earlier.
 
Reduced Crime
 This heightened cleanliness combines with a lesser crime rate to make for a better commercial environment. Though William H. Daly, director of the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement, thinks it unlikely that last year matched 1991's 54 percent drop in crime in the area, he said, "We're very optimistic about the street."
But some say the redevelopment effort has actually hurt business because so many buildings have been condemned and there are fewer people on the streets.
"Business is terrible," said Ezra Grazi, owner of J & W Gift Imports at 245 West 42d, which is slated for condemnation. "It's a disaster on the block."
 
Problems May Arise
 Things could still go awry with the redevlopment plans. For example, officials and business owners are watching to see whether the design study shows that the buildings that are to be renovated for the new stores are in worse shape than envisioned.
But even as plans for a new overall commercial environment are completed over the next month or so, retailers from around the world are already pounding on the door of the agent hired to do the renting.
"They're chasing us, we're not chasing them," Miss Consolo said of her efforts to lease retail space. "This is not broker talk. There's really true, serious interest."
Moreover, there is no shortage of ideas for new attractions to bring yet more people. Rebecca Robertson, the president of the 42d Street project, said suggestions include a miniature amusement park with rides zipping between buildings, a country music park and all manner of computerized "artificial reality" games.

NEW YORK POST GETS A REPRIEVE
On the brink of announcing a suspension of publication, The New York Post has found a temporary reprieve in a wealthy investor who may buy the embattled newspaper. The paper declared that it would fight on for survival. "Contrary to what everybody has thought or said, The New York Post is not dead," Peter S. Kalikow, the owner, said at the end of a day of tabloid-style brinkmanship in which The Post's workers agreed to drastic temporary pay cuts and political leaders joined the fray to keep the paper afloat. Chomping on a cigar, clad in a casual sweater and jeans and looking relaxed for the first time in three days of round-the-clock crisis, Mr. Kalikow announced that he had struck a deal with Steven Hoffenberg, a multimillionaire investor and businessman, to rescue The Post. A1.
 
FROM FINANCE TO NEWSPAPERS
Steven Hoffenberg, the businessman who has emerged as the latest potential savior of The New York Post, is a 48-year-old self-described workaholic who built a small credit business into a $1 billion-a-year enterprise. B3. 

42D STREET REDEVELOPMENT
While signs of 42d Street's long-planned redevelopment remain overshadowed by the area's boarded-up stores, bureaucratic delays and a lingering recession, business and government leaders say the project remains in full gear -- albeit on a smaller scale -- and that indications of a new commercial vitality are starting to emerge. B3.
 
DISCOURAGING WORDS FOR SLUDGE RANCH
Since July, trains have been arriving at a ranch 85 miles east of El Paso, bringing an average of 225 tons a day of treated human waste that New York used to dump at sea until that was prohibited last July 1. From the start the project pitted neighbor against neighbor with small-town ferocity. Coloring all the arguments was a sense that the wastes were arriving from a metropolis so alien and far away that it might as well be from another planet. B2.
 
MEDIA STRATEGIST JOINS GIULIANI TEAM
David Garth, the political impresario, has joined Rudolph W. Giuliani's campaign team as media strategist. Mr. Garth's decision in 1977 to help Edward I. Koch in his bid for mayor lent legitimacy to the congressman's campaign. Metro Matters, B2.

CONSEQUENCES OF HIRING IMMIGRANTS
Political professionals vary in their assessments of how badly damaged Christine Todd Whitman and Cary Edwards, two leading Republican candidates for Governor, have been by their admissions that they both hired illegal immigrants. But the judgment of the voters appears more severe: those who violate such laws are not qualified to hold office. "I wouldn't trust them," said Denise D'Amato of Nutley. B5.
 
THE MYSTERY OF TRANSITCHEK
Subway riders puzzled by those advertisements trumpeting "the Biggest TransitChek in History" and showing a man with an inexplicably oversized cardboard check under his arm: don't worry. Nobody else gets it either. If the advertisements are puzzling, the idea behind TransitChek is actually quite simple: to promote the use of mass transportation by workers through tax breaks for their employers. And for subway, bus and train riders, it could add up to $60 in savings on commuting costs each month. The program itself, slightly less simple, works like this: If a company is willing to give its employees a monthly benefit to cover commuting costs, it can write off 40 percent of the total expense as a standard business deduction. For the employee, it amounts to tax-free carfare. B5.
 
MURDER TRIAL'S STRANGE TWIST
On the dance floor in the local V.F.W. hall, prosecutors set out to prove that Dr. Daniel Pack, a neurologist from Armonk, N.Y., was killed in a baseball-card deal gone bad. But by week's end, the unusual scenario and unlikely surroundings -- under a mirrored silver ball -- were eclipsed by the testimony in the increasingly bizarre murder trial. In a courtroom scene reminiscent of Perry Mason, 17-year-old Chad Gordon was accused by the defense lawyer, William M. Kunstler, of committing the killing for which his father, Joseph Gordon Jr., is standing trial. Carmel Journal, B4.

HEADLINE: On the Menu, Steak Bucks Trend

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The general manager was proud to report that Dan Quayle had once eaten in his restaurant, and so had George Bush as Vice President. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, he said, was a regular, and these days so is James Carville, the Clinton campaign strategist.
John Norris wasn't necessarily name-dropping. Morton's steak restaurant in Georgetown has been a magnet for years to Washington's leading political figures. 
 But when Richard L. Willey of tiny Hurlock, Md., turned up, negotiating one of those 16-ounce rib eyes, as he did the other night, it appeared to be news of, well, man-bites-steak variety. Mr. Willey is a vice president of the Perdue company.
"It was not something I do on a regular basis," said Mr. Willey, who eats his share of chicken, of course. "But when I'm in Washington or Chicago or New York, and I want to treat myself, I'll go for a steak. It's the flavor. I still enjoy the flavor."
 
He's Not the Only One
 As it turns out, Mr. Willey is hardly the anomaly he seems. He and the three friends who dined with him are part of a growing culture in the United States, people eating expensive steaks despite a sluggish economy and continued warnings by health officials to reduce the intake of foods high in cholesterol, like red meat.
If anything, as hard times have forced more families to eat less meat at home, a steak dinner out has become more of a special occasion.
As a result, restaurants that specialize in steak, like Morton's, have bucked the larger trends of stagnant growth in the restaurant industry and the steady decline of beef consumption in the United States for more than 15 years.
For instance, since it bought Morton's in 1989, the Quantum Restaurant Group Inc., has doubled the number of units, to 20, and the gross revenues, to $42.7 million. Quantum's president, Allen J. Bernstein, whose plan is to position Morton's as "the Tiffany and Four Seasons of steak restaurants," said the company planned to open nine more restaurants this year to generate revenues he projected would reach $65.7 million by year-end.
 
Steak Sales Hold Up
 While gross sales of traditional eating places, defined as all but fast-food outlets, have increased by no more than 1.5 percent in any of the last five years, according to Technomic Inc., a restaurant industry consulting firm, steak sales have remained healthy.
The trend seems especially true for steak restaurants with moderate-to-expensive prices, where steak meals can account for as much as 85 percent of all entrees, as they do at Ruth's Chris restaurants.
Ralph Giardina, president of Ruth's Chris, said that sales last year increased in all but 2 of its 34 units, with an overall growth of 8 percent in gross sales last year. In Beverly Hills, "the health capital of the world," as Mr. Giardina called it, Ruth's Chris increased gross sales by 15 percent in 1992 over 1990. A fire had closed the restaurant for three months in 1991.
In other signs of steak-restaurant strength, Amy Rubenstein, the treasurer of the venerable Peter Luger Steak House, a high-end restaurant in Brooklyn, said she had detected "no downturn" from the industry boom years of the 1980's. "We're almost at capacity all the time," she said.
Also, Outback Restaurants, a chain of moderately priced steak houses with a sort of Crocodile Dundee motif, opened its first restaurant five years ago in Tampa and now operates 86. "We anticipate opening our 100th restaurant this year," said Bob Basham, the company president.
 
Victims of Whims
 Dangers lurk, however. Growth and expansion can saturate any market, and restaurants are especially vulnerable to the whims of fashion and change. Ten years ago, low-end steak outlets like Bonanza and Ponderosa were immensely popular and so was steak on the menus of many family-style restaurants. More recently, seafood restaurants were in favor. Then tastes changed.
"To respond, family restaurants began revamping their menus to reemphasize meat as consumer eating habits shifted," said Ron Paul, an analyst with Technomic. "There was a time Red Lobster was going gangbusters. Now, seafood restaurants are not doing so well. There is a cycle, and consumers will always seek variety."
For now, a juicy steak is hot, and the rationale is hardly a surprise, said Dr. Lionel Tiger, a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University who specializes in the evolution of human behavior and fails to see why the pattern of growth should not continue.
Citing "the importance of meat in human dietary evolution," he said habits developed more than 10,000 years ago were genetic and sociological reasons that humans crave red meat. He sees little difference between a cave man sharing food with his tribe after a successful hunt and a modern wedding party, where steak tartare might be served.
"It provides us an opportunity for celebration," Dr. Tiger said of meat eating. "That's one of the things we really like as a species. In our culture, having meat is a sign we're doing well. Even though it's not supposed to be good for us, we seek more and more public certification for how good our lives are, and one way, is to go to a steak house."
 
Recalling Family Dinners
 Anthropological explanations aside, the success of pricier steak restaurants in the United States has also evolved amid what could easily be interpreted as hostile conditions for growth. They include not only concerns over heart disease and the pinched economy but also fewer 1950's-style families in which Mom stays home and cooks.
Typically, baby-boomers like Mr. Willey of Perdue, who is 42, and Mr. Bernstein of the Quantum Restaurant Group, who is 47, recall childhoods in which they ate meat for dinner most days of the week, as many as six in Mr. Bernstein's case.
As a result, steak dinners reminiscent of those days, served by restaurants with salad, baked potato and gooey dessert, have taken on psychological aspects that make them enticing for nostalgic reasons to some but mystical to others, including those with weight problems or dubious cardiovascular profiles.
In any event, a lavish steak dinner has become elevated far beyond the ordinariness of chicken, pasta or leftovers, to the point where a meal built around prime aged filet or sirloin, available only at better restaurants, now often celebrates a happy occasion or becomes the occasion itself.
That notion has become an intrinsic part of Morton's marketing strategy, the "wow effect," in Mr. Bernstein's words. Morton's is the jewel of Quantum's holdings, which also include 11 Mick's, moderately priced family-style restaurants in the Atlanta area, and 11 other higher-priced restaurants known by various names in Atlanta and Washington.
Besides the expensive cuts of beef and efforts to standardize price, serving style and ambiance at all locations, Morton's tries to create indelible memories by magnifying other aspects of the eating experience.
 
Cuts Are Displayed
 It begins with a "presentation" of the menu, during which the waiter wheels the offerings to the table on a cart and holds aloft each cut of beef, wrapped in cellophane. A live lobster (unwrapped) is also raised for consideration and is not always happy about it. A printed menu is also available but is not as much fun.
Each item is sold a la carte, and some seem expensive. But they appear at the table as much as items of curiosity as of cuisine. Steamed asparagus ($6.50) have stalks as wide as tennis racquet handles. Baked potatoes ($3.95) might fairly be billed as mutant ninja taters, and the menu says the dessert souffle ($9.25) feeds two. Six is more like it.
Morton's growth reflects an attitude that more is better, regardless of price, which Mr. Bernstein said had led to an average dinner check of $53 a person. Although higher than the average at Ruth's Chris (about $40) or The Palm ($45 to $50), which has a dozen restaurants, the formula is working, and the overwhelming attraction is the steak.
"We find that excitement works," Mr. Bernstein said, looking not very far for a reason Morton's is succeeding. He agreed totally with Dr. Tiger's view of things and even questioned the degree to which Americans heed their doctors' nutritional advice.
"The total consumption of certain items, like eggs, pancakes and desserts are down," he said. "The total number of times people eat out is down. But health-food restaurants are not always successful. So in reality, people are not following what they're being told. People still love steak; we're proof of that."

HEADLINE: Lately, More Antiquities Can Go Home Again

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
An ancient bronze-and-silver model of a leopard, which was a shadowy presence in the art market for years before it wound up in the hands of a leading New York City art collector, is going home, to England.
Last fall a group of 48 sacred, centuries-old textiles, which have adorned the walls of a California dealer and a New York collector for the last few years, were returned to the Coroma Indians who live high in the Andes of Bolivia. 
 Many art experts believe that these and similar repatriations -- in settlement of long-drawn-out lawsuits and negotiations -- are a clear indication that pressure is mounting on dealers, collectors and museums to diligently investigate the ownership of ancient treasures before attempting to buy them.
"It's definitely a trend," said Constance Lowenthal, the executive director of the International Foundation for Art Research, which monitors stolen art. "These settlements will encourage a greater level of care before purchasing art."
To be sure not every Greek bust or pre-Columbian stele is contraband. However, a great many such artworks are stolen property. The opposition to the illicit trade in such objects began to gather force in 1978 when the American Association of Museums adopted a code of ethics requiring that members "not support" the illicit trade in antiquities. Five years later ethical restrictions were given the force of law when the United States subscribed to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization treaty on cultural property. The treaty made it possible to ban the import of cultural patrimony that is jeopardized by the pillaging of archeological or ethnological sites.
 
An Influential Policy
 In 1989 the Smithsonian Institution voluntarily began to return human remains, sacred objects and other cultural property to American Indian and other ethnic groups when such property was requested, a policy that has influenced institutions throughout the world.
In the past collectors with an itch for antiquities could acquire them with impunity, whether directly or indirectly, from an international black market supplied by illegal excavators, tomb robbers, corrupt guards and unscrupulous dealers. The rightful owners of these objects -- usually the governments of third-world nations -- were frequently unable to recover them through lawsuits because of the expense and the difficulty of coming up with precise documentation.
In 1989 for example, a Federal court in California denied a suit by the Government of Peru seeking to recover 89 pre-Columbian artifacts seized by the United States Customs Service from an American collector, Benjamin Johnson. The judge, while expressing "considerable sympathy" for the Peruvian claim, explained his decision by citing the testimony of Dr. Francisco Iriarte, Peru's foremost authority on pre-Columbian archeology. Dr. Iriarte had identified the artifacts as being of ancient Peruvian "style and culture," yet he had to admit that they could have been excavated in Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico or even Polynesia.
The black market in antiquities is still active, but several relatively new factors are beginning to favor those from whom the objects were taken illegally.
First, with the price of antiquities soaring, lawyers do not hesitate to summon expert witnesses like Dr. Iriarte from around the world. As a result of such elaborate procedures, the cost of litigation is rising sharply. A legal bill of $250,000 in such cases is not unusual.
 
Pressure of Expenses
 Steven Berger, a major dealer in South American textiles, said in an interview that he had agreed to surrender a large number of Coroma Indian garments chiefly because his legal expenses were getting out of hand.
Bill Verick, an Oakland lawyer who worked for the Coromas, who regard their textiles as having religious significance, said: "If the case had gone to trial, it could have been devastatingly expensive for Mr. Berger, and he knew it. The Indians could have won damages not just for the textiles but for the loss of their god. A jury would be very sympathetic to such suffering, and there's no telling what the damages might have come to."
Furthermore, because lawsuits involving artworks tend to attract public attention, many law firms are willing to donate their services, or work for reduced fees, in representing the plaintiffs. Morrison & Foerster, one of San Francisco's largest law firms, represented the Coroma Indians on a pro bono basis.
Thomas R. Kline, a Washington lawyer who has specialized in art law cases, said that he represented on a contingency basis -- not his usual practice -- John and Rosemary Browning of Icklingham, England, who claim that the second-century bronze-and-silver leopard -- 1 of 16 so-called Icklingham bronzes -- had been surreptitiously removed from Roman ruins in their wheat field in the winter of 1981-1982.
The second factor favoring repatriation is that moral pressure or the threat of public embarrassment has helped persuade some dealers and collectors to relinquish contested cultural property.
Michael Ratner, a lawyer for the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit civil rights organization that also represented the Coroma Indians, said he had been involved in a case in which such pressure worked.
"Nobody today wants to be caught with somebody else's sacred objects," Mr. Ratner said.
Third, persistent efforts by plaintiffs have recently demonstrated the possibility of convincingly identifying previously undocumented antiquities.
In the case of the Icklingham bronzes, Leon Levy and his wife, Shelby White, the New York collectors, have bequeathed all 16 objects to the British Museum. Dr. Marion True, curator of antiquities of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., has called the Icklingham leopard "one of the most important finds of the last 50 years." In addition Mr. Browning said they had been compensated for legal fees, although neither Mr. Levy nor the British Museum would confirm or deny the report.
Torkom Demirjian, the proprietor of Ariadne Galleries Inc., the New York dealer through whom the Levys purchased the artworks between 1988 and 1989, would say only that he had acquired the bronzes "with the utmost care."
 
British Police Investigation
 Mr. Kline impressed lawyers for the Levys and Ariadne Galleries by making use of an investigation by local British police that brought to light several individuals -- including a New Jersey coin dealer -- who testified that they had seen the bronzes and were told they had been dug up from the Brownings' wheat field. Some of this testimony might have been dismissed as hearsay, but some of it promised to hold up in an American court.
"If you're willing to spend the time to look hard enough," Mr. Kline said, "you can often find people who know where the objects came from."
Another out-of-court settlement brought to an end a long-drawn-out legal battle when Mr. Berger, the dealer, and the Rev. Ledlie Laughlin, formerly rector of the Church of St. Luke-in-the-Fields in lower Manhattan and now the rector of St. James Episcopal Church in Florence, surrendered to the United States Customs Service a total of 48 finely woven ceremonial garments resembling tunics, ponchos, capes and kerchiefs believed by the Caromas to have a profound religious and magical significance.
Mr. Berger and Mr. Laughlin insisted that they broke no law, but the Indians claimed that the textiles had been stolen from their village.
Lawyers for the Coroma Indians were able to identify the Indian textiles because they had been in continuous ceremonial use by the tribe for several centuries.
After the Customs Service seized a large quantity of the textiles from Mr. Berger, lawyers for the Indians had them photographed and sent blowups to Coroma, Bolivia, where members of the tribe made tentative identifications. Later, four Coroma Indians and a Bolivian scholar were flown to San Francisco to make more precise identifications of the actual garments, noting such details as repairs with which they were familiar.

HEADLINE: Don't Duck Welfare Reform

 BODY:
The Health and Human Services Department administers hundreds of programs ranging from early childhood education to public health. But nothing the department does will be more important this year than overseeing the nation's welfare and health care systems -- both of which need major overhaul. That is why Secretary Donna Shalala's testimony during Senate confirmation hearings was dismaying. She displayed knowledge of neither subject and, in the case of welfare reform, shocking indifference.
Mr. Clinton has turned health care reform over to a White House-run task force on which Ms. Shalala will play an important but supporting role. That is only proper. The new President has made health care reform a top priority, worthy of White House direction. 
 But welfare reform is fading. In the five-page statement of goals she gave the Senate, Ms. Shalala devoted a grand total of one limp sentence to the subject. The oversight invites suspicion that President Clinton intends to backtrack on his campaign pledge to "end welfare as we know it."
Candidate Clinton proposed giving the needy education, training, and child care for up to two years, then requiring "those who can work to go to work either in the private sector or in community service." The proposal embodied the notion that government has obligations to the needy, but the needy also have obligations to society. The theme figured prominently in Mr. Clinton's speech at the Democratic convention and his Inaugural Address.
Americans have a right to hold him to his lofty promises. The welfare system isn't working very well. Many poor have become long-term welfare recipients -- doing them and their children little good. States, forced by Washington to pick up much of the tab, have permitted the value of welfare payments to shrivel over the last 20 years. Even communities that want to offer generous help shrink from raising taxes, fearing they will drive away well-to-do families.
Under Presidents Reagan and Bush, aid to cities was cut an astonishing 60 percent after adjusting for inflation. New York City now spends a crippling 20 percent of its revenues on Medicaid, foster care and other programs for the poor.
Mr. Clinton could start quickly to reverse this sorry record. There is a fine welfare law -- the 1988 Family Support Act -- already in place. It calls for states to phase in programs that require welfare recipients to participate in education and training. Mr. Clinton was a leading proponent of the '88 law. A noteworthy opponent was the Children's Defense Fund, whose leaders included Donna Shalala.
In practice, the law has been weakly implemented. Congress provided only $1.5 billion a year, matched by state funds, which is about a fourth of what's needed. And states, during recession, have been slow to tap what Congress provided. The reluctance is maddening because where reforms have started, welfare rolls and outlays have fallen.
Ms. Shalala's first obligation is to push Congress to put more money behind the '88 law. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, an architect of the act, has proposed lowering the contribution states are required to make and raising the percentage of welfare recipients states must enroll in education and training.
Ms. Shalala's second obligation is to take an even bigger portion of the welfare burden off city and state governments. If Washington paid for the public-sector jobs Mr. Clinton's welfare reform plan would require, state and local governments would get the budget relief they desperately need. If his plan proves too costly or unworkable, then Ms. Shalala needs to propose a sounder one.
The poor and homeless who roam the streets of New York are not New York's poor. They are America's poor. Presidents Reagan and Bush ignored them for the last 12 years. Mr. Clinton promised to do better.

HEADLINE: Chelsea Clinton Can Transfer to Public Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Choosing a School for Chelsea" (editorial, Jan. 7) is correct in saying that President and Mrs. Clinton have every right to send their daughter to the school they think is best for her, but that they should have given the public schools serious consideration before deciding. 
 The reputation of the Washington public schools as troubled is deserved, but there are exceptions, which were available to the Clintons. They could, for example, have chosen Alice Deal Junior High School and then Woodrow Wilson High School, which our children have attended.
One of the great strengths of these schools is that the student population includes many minority students from poor homes in neighborhoods ridden with violence and drugs, as well as significant numbers of students with well-educated, professional parents representing all races and ethnic backgrounds.
Our son's experience may indicate the challenging academic opportunities. He graduated from Wilson High School two years ago and was far from unusual in his class in qualifying for advance-placement college credit in six subjects. He and many of his classmates were accepted by colleges ranked among the most selective in the country. Clearly, at least some of our public schools are doing something right.
The Clintons said they chose the private Sidwell Friends School in part because of its requirement for public service. The opportunity for community service exists at all schools, whether or not it is required. Our daughter, now a senior at Wilson High School, spends time each week participating in and coordinating service activities at soup kitchens. This work is, we believe, far more meaningful for her and her classmates who join her precisely because it is not required. In any case, beginning with the class of 1995, Washington's public school students will be required to perform 100 hours of community service to graduate.
Each year students transfer from private schools into Deal Junior High School and Wilson High School because they prefer the racial, ethnic and economic diversity and the real life atmosphere they find there. If, after a semester or two, Chelsea Clinton and her parents find the expensive private-school experience limiting, they will be more than welcome in the public schools of Washington.

HEADLINE: Chelsea Clinton Can Transfer to Public Schools;
A National Tragedy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The decision by President and Mrs. Clinton that no Washington public school is good enough for their daughter may mean that ultimately Chelsea loses. I will cite only two of many possible examples from my son's academic experience at Alice Deal Junior High, one of many public schools the Clintons did not bother to visit. 
 My son studies and respects Chinese language and culture through a program unmatched in Washington, and one-third of his seventh-grade class will take the Scholastic Aptitude Test in two weeks because they scored above the 97th percentile on national standardized tests.
Just as important, I believe that my son will not fall prey to mindless stereotypes about people of other ethnic groups, and I do not expect to hear him mouth platitudes about the poor. Deal, like other public schools in the District, treats many kinds of students with respect. The public schools offer a shrinking oasis, where people representing true economic and racial diversity come together in search of a civic good. The resource-starved District schools offer hope that integration can work and that under extreme deprivation people will take responsibility for public education.
The Clintons are just one of many affluent families to abandon the public schools, and many say the same thing: they will not sacrifice their children's education to make a political statement, and this is a private, not a public act. But choosing a private school is an intensely political act with grave consequences. To me it represents the pursuit of class advantage and the desire to avoid those who are different.
The danger is that these students will emerge sheltered, prejudiced, inept at understanding or coping with a complicated world, convinced that they won a fair race. This is a national tragedy.

HEADLINE: Explaining the Check in 'TransitChek'

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
To New York City subway riders puzzled by those advertisements trumpeting "the Biggest TransitChek in History" and showing a man with an inexplicably oversized cardboard check under his arm: don't worry. Nobody else gets it either.
"Transit Chex? It sounds kind of like a breakfast cereal," said Jeffrey Gartner, a graphic artist who was confused by the poster even after re-reading it a few times on the No. 3 train one recent morning. "Is there some hidden prize? Where can I get one?" 
 If the advertisements are puzzling, the idea behind TransitChek is actually quite simple: to promote the use of mass transportation by workers through tax breaks for their employers. And for subway, bus and train riders, it could add up to $60 in savings on commuting costs each month.
The program itself, slightly less simple, works like this: If a company is willing to give its employees a monthly benefit to cover commuting costs, it can write off 40 percent of the total expense as a standard business deduction. For the employee, it amounts to tax-free carfare.
 
'A Month's Free Ride'
 Begun in 1987, TransitChek is named for the vouchers, or checks, that the companies can buy and that their employees can then exchange for bus or subway tokens or for rail tickets, like those of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, the Long Island Rail Road and the New Jersey Transit. As of Jan. 1, under a law passed by Congress last October, the tax-deductible amount a company can grant each employee almost tripled, to $60 a month from $21.
Advocates of the program point out that the maximum amount is now large enough to pay for a month's worth of subway tokens, or about half the commutation ticket of a typical Metro-North commuter.
"At $60, you're talking about real money," said Larry Filler, executive director of Transit Center, the agency created in 1987 to run TransitChek. "That's a month's free ride on the subway, or the bus, or the PATH train."
He is unsure how many companies, particularly large ones, will sign up for TransitChek. About 2,000 companies were buying vouchers regularly when the tax-deductable benefit was raised to $60, including a few large ones, like Price Waterhouse, Swissbank and Colgate-Palmolive.
But most participants are smaller companies for whom the initial outlay for the voucher is less than for companies that have more employees. Even with the 40 percent tax deduction, buying $60 vouchers for 100 employees, for example, would cost a company about $46,000 each year, or $460 an employee, including a 10 percent processing fee regardless of the number of employees.
Mr. Filler said that a few dozen new companies have joined TransitChek since Jan. 1, and that he expects the number to rise gradually.
 
Lobbying May Come Later
 Executives at some large corporations that are considering the program, including American Express and Chemical Bank, declined to discuss the criteria they are using to weigh the program, apparently concerned about raising expectations among their employees before they decide whether to offer the benefit.
Senior executives at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey describe themselves as major boosters of the program. They have no definite plans for organized lobbying for the kind of large companies that are the hardest to convince of the program's benefits. They say they may do such lobbying eventually.
The executive director of the Port Authority, Stanley Brezenoff, said a major selling point for TransitChek is that during difficult economic times, money for commuting costs is an affordable alternative to a salary increase. Mr. Brezenoff also noted that under the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990, companies with 100 or more employees will be required in the coming years to reduce the number of employees who drive to work.
"A lot of these companies have a stake in reaching clean-air requirements, and this could be a big step in that direction," he said, adding that the Port Authority introduced the program for its nonunion staff this month, partly for that reason.
Promoting mass transportation as an alternative to driving was the rationale behind the Federal law that created the tax-deductible benefit, and that increased it to $60. The amount was $15 when the program started in 1987, and rose to $21 last year.
For years, companies have been able to write off parking expenses for their employees, calling them a legitimate business expense. Congress was persuaded that it would make sense to allow similar tax advantages for commuters using mass transportation, and to limit the amount a company could write off for an employee's monthly parking expenses to $155.
The law, which took effect on Jan. 1, was signed last October. There are similar programs in Boston, San Francisco Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Chicago, and their success varies with the city.
In New York's program, employees exchange vouchers for individual tokens or tickets.
"It would be much easier to take advantage of TransitChek if we had a monthly pass," as in some of the cities that have similar programs, said Gene Russianoff, Senior Attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, a commuter-advocacy group. The Transit Authority has promised to introduce some kind of monthly pass when automated fare cards are introduced in December.
How many new riders the program will attract is also an open question.
At a half-dozen companies already using TransitChek, executives said their employees were overwhelmingly positive about the program, but added that it seemed to be used only by those who already ride mass transportation, rather than by drivers who have been persuaded to switch to a train or a bus.
 
Tax-Free Vouchers
 At Alitalia's New York office, an employee can choose between cash or TransitChek vouchers for an annual or semiannual bonus, and last year only 4 percent chose the vouchers, which are tax-free.
Mr. Russianoff said that the reduction in tax revenue from companies taking the TransitChek deductions was expected to be offset by the increased tax revenue from the limit on parking expense deductions. He said he was interested to see, in the next year, whether companies comply with the new parking-expense limits and how strictly the Internal Revenue Service enforced them.
Mr. Filler said he thought that interest in the program among employees would eventually be followed by participation among companies. He said he was pleased with the response to the 800 number listed on subway advertisements for the program, which now receives 300 to 400 calls a day, several times what it received two months ago. He expects $9 million worth of transit vouchers to be sold this year, up from last year's $5 million worth.
As for the subway advertisements, Mr. Filler conceded that it might take time for the message to sink in, but said he was pleased with the way they looked. So were some riders.
"I like it visually," said Trudy Cheney the other morning on the No. 1 train. "The mix of black and white with subtle coloring is nice, and the big check that guy is carrying looks interesting. But what does it mean?"

HEADLINE: Saudis Call For Cuts By OPEC

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
In a move that could substantially lift sagging oil prices, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and exporter, has called on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce its overall output of oil production by more than a million barrels a day.
The move signals at least a temporary end to Saudi Arabia's policy of maximizing production, which has increased its output to more than 8 million barrels a day, from 5.5 million barrels a day in 1990. That is more than a third of OPEC's production, and gives the Saudis enormous clout. 
 But OPEC has had singularly little success at persuading all its members to adhere to their production quotas, and it is far from clear that the other 11 nations will go along with Saudi Arabia. Nigeria and Kuwait in particular are regarded as most determined to produce as much oil as they can.
 
 
Falling Prices
 The Saudi decision is a sign that it and Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, have decided that OPEC's production has gotten out of hand. An oversupply of oil and weak demand has knocked roughly 20 percent off oil prices since October, sharply reducing revenue for all OPEC nations. On Friday, the price of Arab light crude oil was $14.95 on the spot market, down from nearly $19 in October.
"This is a very significant change in the direction of things -- particularly as it comes from the largest producer of OPEC, Saudi Arabia," Walid Khadouri, executive editor of the Middle East Economic Survey, a weekly oil industry newsletter based in Cyprus, said in a telephone interview. "If it turns into a credible and lasting agreement it is bound to boost oil prices."
Some oil analysts said the move could raise prices by as much as $4 a barrel over the next few months, which would lift prices at the pump for many consumers in industrialized countries.
Gasoline prices have been stable in the United States in recent months and have been determined more by Federal mandates to reduce air pollution than by the supply of crude oil.
 
 
Paris Meeting
 It seems likely that at least 10 members of OPEC will go along with the agreement.
The Saudis' decision was communicated by their oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer, to Allirio Parra, the current president of OPEC and Venezuela's oil minister, at a meeting in Paris on Saturday.
OPEC is currently producing close to 25.4 million barrels a day, well above its official ceiling of 24.9 million barrels.
The Saudi offer to cut from the official ceiling of OPEC rather than actual production, if accepted by other members of OPEC, would in effect reduce the oil cartel's total output by as much as 1.5 million barrels a day.
The policy would reduce Saudi Arabia's own production to about 8 million barrels a day, a drop of 400,000 barrels a day from its current level.
Mr. Parra has begun a tour of OPEC's 12 members, trying to find a way to stabilize oil prices. In a telephone interview from Paris, he said: "We are calling upon OPEC to reduce production from the official ceiling of the organization by one million barrels a day. If it is adhered to in a proportionate way by all members of OPEC, it should have a considerable impact on oil prices -- in my opinion -- in the second quarter."
The Saudis and the Iranians, who have been locked in a production race, appear to have concluded that it is time to coordinate policy and force other members of OPEC, particularly Kuwait and Nigeria, to moderate their runaway output of oil. OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on Feb. 13 to fashion its production and pricing policy for 1993.
 
 
Nigeria and Kuwait
 OPEC's biggest problems will be Nigeria and Kuwait, and it is far from clear that either will adhere to any agreement to reduce production.
Nigeria has repeatedly promised to trim production but has kept it at nearly 2 million barrels a day, 200,000 barrels over its official quota. Kuwait, which has made huge strides in rebuilding oil production -- halted after the Iraqi invasion and damages to its oilfields -- has pushed its oil output to 1.6 million barrels a day this month and says it is heading for 2 million barrels a day by the end of the year.
The Kuwaitis argue they are entitled to pump oil without limits to make up for their huge losses of revenues and the damage caused to their oilfields, set on fire by Iraqis as they withdrew from Kuwait in 1991. Persuading Kuwait to rein in its output at present levels for the rest of the year may prove very difficult -- even for Saudi Arabia.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Jan. 25 about Saudi Arabia's proposal to reduce oil output misattributed a quotation. It was Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer, not Allirio Parra, the president of OPEC, who said: "We are calling upon OPEC to reduce production from the official ceiling of the organization by one million barrels a day. If it is adhered to in a proportionate way by all members of OPEC, it should have a considerable impact on oil prices, in my opinion, in the second quarter."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Re-examining the Fine Print On Clinton's Tax Promises

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
At a time when the public has repeatedly shown its distaste for the maneuvers and machinations of politics, President Clinton's White House is banking on a five-word loophole to save it from voter outrage should Mr. Clinton propose a broad-based energy tax.
During the campaign, Mr. Clinton promised tax cuts for the middle class. Now Mr. Clinton and his chief economic advisers are backing away from the tax cut and strongly hinting that an energy tax will hit the middle class the hardest. 
 "They campaigned on a middle-class tax cut and then four days into a new Administration the chief economic spokesman is talking about a middle-class tax increase," said Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group. "That's a flip-flop."
Although Vice President Al Gore and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen have mentioned the possibility of an energy tax in recent interviews, the President and his advisers insisted today that their economic plan was still under discussion and that no decision had been made.
Still some Clinton advisers say they are not worried about public outrage. They say the President built himself an escape hatch a little less than a month before Election Day.
"Every time Clinton said 'I'm not going to raise taxes on the middle class,' he always added the phrase "to pay for my programs," said a chief political adviser to the President, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "He never, never, said just, 'I will not raise taxes on the middle class.' He always said 'I will not raise middle-class taxes to pay for my programs.' "
By this logic, the adviser said, Mr. Clinton's legalistic construct was a "distinction with a difference" that allows him "the opportunity he now has" to raise taxes without incurring voter wrath.
But of late that sort of politics-by-loophole has not been playing well.
In 1990, President George Bush signed an agreement with Congress that obliged him to break his "read my lips" campaign promise of 1988 not to raise taxes. Mr. Bush and his advisers reasoned that voters had never taken his promise seriously in the first place and would forgive its being breached. The voters reacted with far more anger than understanding, and Mr. Bush never regained their trust when the economy turned sour.
In recent weeks, the gulf between Washington's view of what constituted acceptable behavior and that of many voters was again demonstrated in the matter of Zoe Baird. Mr. Clinton pressed forward with his choice of Ms. Baird as Attorney General despite the disclosure that she had once hired illegal aliens. Mr. Clinton and his advisers figured voters would forgive Ms. Baird what they considered a small transgression in an otherwise impressive career.
The voters, recalling Mr. Clinton's emotional promises to run a Government for the "people who pay their taxes and play by the rules," saw him as trying to give a break to a rich woman who had done neither and forced Ms. Baird's withdrawal.
 
Some See a Liability
 Mr. Clinton's aides know full well that Mr. Bush's mistake helped cost him his job. But they still contend that Mr. Clinton is protected by his escape clause. "People won't get away with saying Clinton promised that he was not going to raise taxes and then did," the adviser said. "He had many opportunities to make a 'read my lips' statement, and he did not."
Some outside the Clinton camp disagree strongly with that logic, however.
Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst who charted the rise of middle-class anger in the late 1980's and spared no criticism of Mr. Bush's broken promises, said: "At the most recent count, only 800,000 Americans were lawyers, and I don't think the 248 million or so who are not lawyers are going to buy a caveat stuck on in the middle of a passionate plea to the middle-class voters that they should vote for him because he was going to save them. Talk about reading his lips."
Mr. Clinton introduced the escape clause on taxes for the middle class before a national audience in an Oct. 19 Presidential debate in Richmond. "I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs," he said.
 
'Very Conscious Decision'
 Listeners without the benefit of law-school training might have taken that as a pledge to not raise taxes on the middle class. But the President's adviser said Mr. Clinton had purposefully used, and reiterated, the phrase "for these programs" to allow himself a way out of what careless voters might have thought they had been promised.
"It was a very conscious decision on his part," the adviser said. "I can tell you this from strategy sessions and debate prep sessions. The idea of a flat-out promise of 'I will not raise taxes on the middle class, period,' was rejected by the President. He refused to allow himself to be boxed in that way."
The matter of the escape clause illustrates a larger point about Mr. Clinton that has become increasingly obvious: It is always wise to read the fine print. The fine print of Mr. Clinton's promise on the tax cut for the middle class was quite different from the broad thrust of his oratory on the subject.
For a year, the Democrat campaigned on a platform of economic renewal in which the Federal deficit could be halved in four years rather painlessly by raising taxes on rich people and foreign corporations and by improving the way Government programs are managed.
In "Putting People First," Mr. Clinton's often-touted plan for American renewal, the candidate promised: "We will lower the tax burden on middle-class Americans by asking the very wealthy to pay their fair share. Middle-class taxpayers will have a choice between a children's tax credit or a significant reduction in their income-tax rate."
On July 13, speaking to reporters in New York, Mr. Clinton said flatly, "I'm not going to raise taxes on the middle class," according to reports by The Chicago Tribune and the Reuters news service. On the same day, in an interview shown by Cable News Network, he said, "I don't think we should raise middle-class individuals' taxes, because their income went down and their tax rates were raised" in the 1980's.
But in the fall campaign, when his words were scrupulously followed by a larger audience, Mr. Clinton took more care. After the Richmond debate, he regularly re-stated the position that his promise to the middle class was only that he would not raise their taxes "to pay for these programs."

HEADLINE: Navy Seeks Data on Lung Disorders

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Fearing that unsafe work conditions might have exposed thousands of deckhands to lethal dust clouds in the 1970's, the Navy has asked a Federal health agency to conduct a major review of naval personnel records.
At issue is whether hundreds of sailors who have a lung disorder for which Navy doctors could find no cause may instead have a job-related illness. Such a determination could cost the Navy millions of dollars in damages. 
 The job in question involved grinding nonskid adhesive off the decks of aircraft carriers in preparation for resurfacing, sending clouds of tiny silica shards into the air. Although regulations in the 1970's required deckhands to wear masks, Navy officials acknowledge that most supervisers did not enforce the rule.
Navy work rules have now been tightened and a new, less hazardous nonskid adhesive is being used. But as a growing number of Navy veterans around the country compare notes on their lung problems, service officials have agreed to investigate their claims. They say that what Navy doctors diagnosed as sarcoidosis, a rare lung disease with no known cause, may in fact be silicosis, a fatal lung disease caused by airborne silica.
 
Navy Asks for Help
 In a letter last month Vice Adm. Donald F. Hagen, the Navy Surgeon General, asked the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "to determine the relationship, if any, between the risk of silicosis and sarcoidosis, our active-duty members, and the Navy work environment in the early 1970's."
If the Federal health agency finds that the Navy misdiagnosed the documented sarcoidosis cases, legal experts say, the Navy may have to pay millions of dollars in damages to the stricken sailors. Moreover, since the silicosis symptoms can take more than 20 years to develop, health officials say thousands of other Navy veterans may soon be seeking relief.
Dr. Gregory R. Wagner, director of the health agency's Respiratory Disease Studies division, said his technical experts and Navy officials would soon meet to determine what naval personnel records were available. The review will probably take at least three months, a Navy official said.
The Navy's unusual request for help from Federal health experts stems from the efforts of a 39-year-old sailor, Jerry Cochran, who was medically discharged in 1975. Since then, he has been fighting to overcome a Navy bureaucracy that first accused him of malingering and then diagnosed his condition as sarcoidosis. The Veterans Affairs Department recognized Mr. Cochran's illness as silicosis in March 1991, but so far the Navy has stuck to its original diagnosis.
 
Hot and Dirty Work
 Mr. Cochran also urged the Navy to check if any of his former shipmates on the aircraft carrier Independence were suffering from lung disorders. In the ship's hot, poorly ventilated hangar deck, the cavernous storage area for planes, sailors wearing no masks pushed pneumatic-powered machines that cracked worn nonskid adhesive into pieces, kicking up clouds of dust. The work sometimes lasted nine hours a day, three or four days a week.
The Navy refused to investigate Mr. Cochran's concerns until Acting Navy Secretary Sean O'Keefe read an article in The New York Times last September about Mr. Cochran's troubles and ordered Navy medical officials to review the matter.
Sharon Trussell, 35, a legal assistant at a Houston law firm specializing in asbestosis and silicosis cases, also read about Mr. Cochran's plight, and shuddered. Her husband, Dean, 27, did deck-grinding work during his three years on the amphibious assault ship Nassau, and now coughs up black phlegm.
Mrs. Trussell contacted Mr. Cochran, and within several weeks established the Jerry Cochran Veterans Outreach Foundation, a not-for-profit organization to help veterans suffering from silicosis or other related lung problems find proper medical attention, obtain their Navy records and process claims.
 
Medical Records Sought
 The foundation has a toll-free number, (800) 876-3901, and has persuaded two respiratory specialists -- one in Atlanta and one in Houston -- to donate their time to examine Navy veterans who fear they may have the symptoms.
The foundation is now helping about 25 Navy veterans nationwide to obtain their medical records to determine if their conditions were misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all, Mrs. Trussell said.
According to Navy medical records, there were 947 cases of sarcoidosis diagnosed from 1965 to 1988, the last year for which records are available. The figures are within the national rate of incidence. There also were 88 cases of silicosis in that period, but silica exposure levels aboard ships were not accurately measured until the mid-1980's.
The foundation is also filing Federal tort claims on behalf of the sailors, and is threatening a class-action lawsuit if the Government does not establish a compensation fund to supplement the sailors' veterans benefits.
For many of Mr. Cochran's former shipmates, the pending health inquiry has suggested answers to nagging questions about chronic lung problems.
 
Jogger With Health Problem
 Lucious Felton, 38, a former marine, used to jog through the hangar deck when Mr. Cochran and the grinding crews were working. Mr. Felton was given an honorable discharge in 1975 after a health problem he had was diagnosed as sarcoidosis. Since then he has worked as a janitor, a carpenter and a mail carrier but cannot hold a steady job because of his failing health. He said he had asked for his naval medical records to check his diagnosis.
"I can't imagine the number of people who might have this," said Mr. Felton, now an unemployed artist in Orlando, Fla. "I'm just glad this is all coming out."
Harold Timmons, a 43-year-old cattle farmer from Scotia, Neb., who served on a carrier, said his doctor told him 10 years ago that he had "brown lung" and blamed his livelihood for it. Now Mr. Timmons says he not so sure. "I'm short of breath, but you learn to live with it," he said.
Some of the former grinding crewmates whom Mr. Cochran has tracked down say they are fine and shrug off any worries. Keith Nelson, 40, a packaging inspector in York, Pa., says he jogs seven miles a day.
But for others, the Federal inquiry has raised new fears. Walter Myers, 39, a press operator in Columbus, Ga., has wondered for years why he gets winded so easily. "I'm getting checked out now," he said.

HEADLINE: Christopher Vowing Change In Selection of Ambassadors

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher made his debut before State Department employees today, pledging that the Clinton Administration would not appoint ambassadors solely because of their political connections and assuring them that he would bring career Foreign Service officers back into the State Department's decision-making.
"Recommendations for ambassadorships will be based upon qualifications that extend beyond campaign participation and will require some real expertise with respect to the appointment," he said, to the applause of a standing-room-only audience. 
 The Bush Administration was criticized on Capitol Hill for handing out ambassadorships to close friends and wealthy Republicans who had contributed $100,000 to the Bush campaign. A number of senators, particularly Paul Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat, have said they intend to hold the new Administration to a higher standard.
During his Senate confirmations hearings two weeks ago, Mr. Christopher said ambassadors from outside the career Foreign Service "have to bring something to the post: some piece of background, some language skill," or "something else that gives assurance that they will make a real contribution as well as having the right temperament and the right attitude."
 
Relationship of 'Trust'
 Mr. Christopher's getting-to-know-you session today, which included questions and answers, was an indirect way of signaling that his tenure will be very different from that of James A. Baker 3d, President Bush's Secretary of State. While Mr. Baker relied on a handful of hand-picked advisers in making policy decisions, Mr. Christopher, who served as Deputy Secretary of State in the Carter Administration, promised that he would establish a relationship of "trust" with the hundreds of officers who will work for him.
He also said he would name both political appointees and career Foreign Service officers to key positions in the State Department, telling the employees they will be "more reassured" when the next round of secondary appointments is named.
Of the 14 appointments announced so far, only two -- Edward P. Djerejian, who will continue as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, and George E. Moose, the nominee for Assistant Secretary of African Affairs -- are career Foreign Service officers. Peter Tarnoff, named as Under Secretary for Political Affairs, left the Foreign Service more than a decade ago.
Mr. Christopher still has not filled a number of other senior posts, including the director of the Agency for International Development, and the assistant secretaries responsible for Latin America, human rights and United Nations affairs.
 
Doubt on Latin Affairs Post
 Particularly painful is the Inter-American Affairs post. As of last week, Mario Baeza, a Cuban-American lawyer from New York, was the leading contender, but he was roundly criticized by conservative Cuban-Americans in Miami for what they perceived as his insufficient opposition to Fidel Castro.
Today's encounter also revealed much about Mr. Christopher's style, a mix of down-to-earth charm with extreme reserve. He seasoned his remarks with both humor and lavish praise, and called for a new era of "openness" inside the building and in the State Department's relationship with Congress.
The White House has also moved forward to fill a number of the top national security jobs.
Jennone Walker, who served in the Carter and Reagan Administrations, will oversee European affairs; Tobi Gati, vice president of the United Nations Association, will handle the former Soviet Union; Rose Gottemoeller, a strategic analyst at the Rand Corporation, will handle the dismantling of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union and related issues; Richard E. Feinberg, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, will deal with Latin American issues; Robert G. Bell, a senior staff member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will oversee defense and arms control issues, and George Tenet, the former staff director for the Senate Intelligence Committee, will be responsible for intelligence issues.

HEADLINE: SHIFT OF SPENDING SEEN AS A BENEFIT

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The Federal Government could generate more than 12,000 jobs by shifting $3 billion from military industries to state and local jurisdictions, according to a Government study released today.
Such a move, while eliminating 11,500 jobs in military industries, would create 23,600 new jobs, the study by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress found. 
 The study provides ammunition for many analysts who urge converting military spending into increased spending on domestic programs, rather than using it to help reduce the Federal budget deficit.
"Think of all the positive things we could accomplish by peacetime uses of this funding, and we wouldn't increase the deficit a dime," said Representative John Conyers Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Government Operations Committee and requested the study.
Mr. Conyers today reintroduced a bill to authorize such a $3 billion shift in spending. The committee approved the legislation in the waning days of the last Congress, but the bill was strongly opposed by President George Bush and never reached the House floor.
 
Change in Emphasis
 In his Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton pledged a shift in Federal resources to domestic uses from military ones. "The end of the cold war permits us to reduce defense spending while still maintaining the strongest defense in the world," he said at the Democratic National Convention, "but we must plow back every dollar of defense cuts into building American jobs right here at home."
In spite of those sentiments, the new President's top budget officials have placed deficit reduction at the top of the new Administration's economic agenda, so the extent to which military cuts will be shifted to domestic programs is uncertain.
The study issued today estimated a net increase of 4,054 jobs for each $1 billion shifted. "If the magnitude of the reallocation were increased by tenfold, then the job creation estimate would increase by tenfold," the study said.
If the spending was shifted, guided-missile producers would lose 1,280 jobs, radio and television communication equipment manufacturers would lose 1,819 jobs and 2,264 jobs would be cut in business services.
Industries that would gain more than 1,000 jobs involve construction or repair of highways and streets (4,174 jobs); new sewers (2,761 jobs); engineering, architectural and surveying services (2,334 jobs); maintenance and repair (1,270); and nursing and personal care services (1,140 jobs).

HEADLINE: SERBIA IS DENYING IT HOLDS BOSNIANS

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The Serbian and Yugoslav Governments denied today that prisoners of war from Bosnia and Herzegovina were being held in detention camps on Yugoslav territory.
The assertion that Bosnian prisoners may be detained in Serbia came in a document prepared by United States Government intelligence agencies. The document said that as many as 135 prison camps were being operated by Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Serbia itself, and that these camps held the vast majority of the total number of prisoners held by the Serbian, Muslim and Croatian factions in the Bosnian war. 
 The report's estimated total for all sides' prisoners, ranging up to 70,000, is many times higher than the 2,750 prisoners registered and visited by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Officials of international relief agencies said they had no knowledge of prisoners from Bosnia being held in Serbia, but they repeated an appeal to all sides in the conflict to open their detention camps to Red Cross representatives. The United States Government report said the Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats might be operating as many as 33 camps.
 
Red Cross Seeks Visits
 "We do not pretend that all sides in the Bosnian conflict are giving us the opportunity to visit all the prisoners they are holding," said a Red Cross official who insisted on remaining anonymous. "We want them to give us the facilities to carry out such visits."
United States officials said they had recently given the report to the United Nations special representative for the Balkans, Cyrus R. Vance, to officials of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Officials of the Red Cross confirmed today that they had received it.
Yugoslavia has been under stiff international pressure, including United Nations economic sanctions and threats of armed intervention, for supporting the Serbian rebels who have carved away about two-thirds of Bosnia and Herzegovina's territory in the nine-month-old war there.
The Yugoslav Government criticized an article about the intelligence report that appeared in The New York Times on Sunday, describing the article as an erroneous and "racist" attack on Serbia and the Serbian people.
"The State Department notified Yugoslav diplomats on Jan. 16," it said, that in early January the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, "cited a completely erroneous estimate of 70,000 prisoners on Yugoslavia's territory."
[The State Department said that if Red Cross officials found "the maximum number of possible prisoners in each and every possible site, the number could be as high as 70,000." Administration officials had said earlier that the estimate of 70,000 prisoners was based on an assumption that 45 of the camps might be occupied at one time.]
 
'Never Been Proved'
 The Serbian Government said in its statement that "the American daily The New York Times, relying on unidentified sources in the United States, has repeated earlier assertions on the alleged existence of prison camps on Serbia's territory which have never been proved."
The Serbian Government called the Times article a "contribution to a dishonorable campaign led by some American news organizations in recent days to apply media pressure on the new United States Administration and United Nations to decide to intervene militarily in the territory of the former Yugoslavia."
"Not one of the many international missions to visit Serbia recently confirmed the existence of such camps."
United States diplomats in Belgrade declined to comment on the report or the article in The Times.
In its list of "probable" camps in Serbia, the American report included a Yugoslav Army air base and a police station in the village of Batajnica, a federal prison in the town of Sremska Mitrovica, a military prison in the Belgrade suburb of Zemun and an undescribed site in the central Serbian town of Rudnik.
Accounts that thousands of Muslims from Bosnia and Herzegovina are being held at the Batajnica airfield have been circulating for at least seven months, but no proof of their existence has ever been turned up by international relief agencies or Western journalists in their visits to the base.
Officials of army and federal Government of Yugoslavia -- which now comprises the republics of Serbia and Montenegro -- did not respond to a request to visit the installations today.

HEADLINE: Mexico Fights to Stop U.S. Execution

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 25

 BODY:
In the decade since Ramon Montoya was convicted of murdering a Dallas policeman, most of his relatives have stopped visiting, his name has faded from the newspapers, and opponents of capital punishment have moved on to other cases.
But if the 39-year-old illegal immigrant is executed as scheduled early Wednesday morning in a Huntsville, Tex., prison, it will be in spite of legal aid that the Mexican Government has helped pay for, pleas for clemency that it has made to Texas officials and a modicum of public support that it has helped generate both in Mexico and the United States. 
 Challenging American criminal justice on human rights grounds, the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has engaged the United States in an increasingly public fight for the lives of 18 Mexican citizens now on death row in five states.
In only one of the cases have Mexican officials strongly challenged a convict's guilt. For the most part, they have asserted no circumstances more extenuating than the criminals' poverty at the time of the crimes or their disorientation in a foreign land. Their appeals have centered instead on the argument that capital punishment -- which was eliminated from the Mexican federal penal code in 1929 -- is simply inhumane.
 
Big Impact Predicted
 While the efforts have all been directed at state governments, Mexican officials also offer a broader political consideration: they say Mexicans would be outraged to see one of their countrymen put to death in the United States just as the two countries are moving to link their economic destinies in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"The day a Mexican is executed, it will impact enormously," the senior Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Andres Rozental, said in an interview last year. "Given Nafta, given the closeness of the relationship at this point, it would be very difficult to convince Mexicans why this would be done."
The head of the Foreign Ministry's consular affairs section, Eduardo Ibarrola, described the attempts to block the executions as part of a broader Government effort under Mr. Salinas to defend the rights of Mexicans who live and work in the United States.
That campaign has sought to reassure Mexicans that as they draw closer to a neighbor they have long been taught to mistrust, their Government will stand up for their fair treatment. It has also been intended to overcome the antagonism that many Mexicans in the United States have traditionally felt toward the Government they left behind.
But the death penalty issue is perhaps especially useful to Mexico as it prepares for the American Congressional debate over the trade agreement this year.
 
Abuses in the U.S. Noted
 Some opponents of the accord have asserted that the prevalence of torture and other human rights problems in Mexico are reason enough for American legislators to reject greater economic integration. Mexican officials have responded in part by drawing attention to abuses against Mexican immigrants by agents of the United States Border Patrol and other American officials.
Although nearly all of the consular involvement with Mexicans on death row in the United States dates from Mr. Salinas's administration, some Mexican officials say their efforts have been quickened not so much by a policy change as by the urgency of the cases themselves.
If Mr. Montoya is not spared at the last minute, they said, he will become the first Mexican to be put to death in an American prison in 51 years. The executions of three other Mexican citizens have already been postponed by appeals, and the scheduled death of at least one other is drawing near.
(Ruling on the appeal of a Mexican-American man also convicted of killing a policeman in Texas, Leonel Herrera, the Supreme Court held today that Federal judges may not stop the executions of convicts who bring forward new claims of innocence after exausting their appeals.)
The Mexican efforts have included everything from benefit soccer games to raise legal funds to a personal appeal for one convict's life by President Salinas.
Mexican officials have given money to help support the families of some convicts, and cooperated with the lawyers of others who have wanted to investigate the background of their clients in Mexico. And in at least several instances, the governments of the Mexican states where the convicts were born have also worked on their behalf.
 
Scant Influence in Texas
 But Mexican officials cannot do much more than ask that the death sentences be commuted. Mr. Rozental, the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs, said the 1977 agreement under which the United States and Mexico exchanged more than 50 sets of prisoners apparently did not apply to those facing capital punishment.
Even in Texas, where Salinas administration officials have enjoyed a warm relationship with Gov. Ann Richards, their influence in such cases is scant. David A. Talbot, the Governor's general counsel, said she could only act on the recommendations of the state's 18-member Board of Pardons and Paroles. On that basis, only a handful of death sentences have been commuted since capital punishment was reinstated in 1982.
In the most prominent case, the Government has repeatedly endorsed the claims of innocence of Ricardo Aldape Guerra, a 30-year-old former factory worker who was convicted of shooting a Houston police officer. Moves on Mr. Aldape's behalf by officials ranging from Mr. Salinas to the former head of the National Human Rights Commission brought an indefinite suspension of his execution last year.
But for Mr. Montoya, who was an unemployed laborer with prior convictions for weapons-possession and burglary when he shot a police officer during an arrest, the Mexican efforts have had no such effect.
"They have done everything you could ask a Government to do," Mr. Montoya's lawyer, K. Duff Lewis, said in a telephone interview today. "Unfortunately, to use the vernacular of Texas, Mr. Montoya is a wetback who killed a white cop."

HEADLINE: Olympia & York Liquidation Plan Advances

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The unsecured creditors of bankrupt Olympia & York Developments Ltd. today overwhelmingly approved an orderly liquidation of the Canadian operations of what was once the world's biggest property development company.
Out of the disintegrating empire will emerge a new property-management concern worth a tiny fraction of the $20 billion that the Reichmann family of Toronto had built over three decades in commercial real estate in Canada, the United States and Britain. 
 Debt-burdened assets in the United States remain intact. Assets in Britain have been placed under British bankruptcy procedures known as court administration.
 
Deep in Debt
 The privately held and secretly-run enterprise, which grew out of a Toronto tile company in the late 1950's, owes $6.7 billion on its Canadian office towers. Last May, an Ontario court granted the company protection from its creditors.
Olympia & York's troubles stemmed from a severe recession in commercial real estate and a heavy drain on resources from an ambitious office development in London's East End known as Canary Wharf, which siphoned off $6 billion.
After creditors in Canada rejected two restructuring plans, the company made an offer that essentially gives creditors the option of taking over the assets that secure their loans.
One of these institutions, the Prudential Insurance Company of America, has already seized its collateral, the 28-story Aetna Canada Center, in a separate arrangement.
Other buildings are expected to be taken over by creditors and held until the market for real estate improves. The Reichmann family's new entity, Olympia & York Properties Ltd., is hoping to be retained as the manager of these properties.
 
Some Dissent
 Over the past two weeks, most classes of creditors with security to back their loans have voted to approve the new plan, which includes provisions to protect the Reichmann family from future lawsuits and to give unsecured creditors a big stake in the new property-management business.
Of 34 classes of secured creditors, 8 have rejected the plan, which means they can take immediate steps to walk away with their collateral. Among the naysayers are the backers of O.& Y.'s flagship Toronto tower, 72-story First Canadian Place.
But the unsecured creditors who voted today could have vetoed the plan, which would have meant immediate dismantlement of Canadian operations.
Unsecured creditors hold the first claim on equity remaining in O.& Y. after the secured claims are satisfied. But O.& Y.'s liabilities far exceed its assets.
Alain Tuchmaier, a financial services analyst with McLean McCarthy Ltd., owned by the Deutsche Bank of Germany, said O.& Y.'s equity value last April, according to a study made by his firm, was more than $5 billion "under water."
Under the plan approved today, which will be submitted to the bankruptcy court for approval on Feb. 1, the largest interest in the property-management company will go to the unsecured creditors. The Reichmann family would own 10 percent and have the right to name at least one director to the board.

In a report that encourages the Clinton Administration to adopt a more aggressive trade policy toward Japan, the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan today listed dozens of business sectors that it said remained partly closed to foreign companies, despite years of arduous negotiations.
The report also said the Japanese still used numerous practices that hobbled foreign concerns trying to crack this market. 
 In some past reports, the chamber, a trade body, has sounded more conciliatory, suggesting that Japan was not as closed to foreign businesses as some supposed. But today's study, the chamber's "white paper" on trade, was tougher, detailing a network of discrimination.
While describing the problems in each sector, the American Chamber of Commerce recommended that the Clinton Administration quickly pursue new negotiations with the Japanese to strip away trade barriers.
 
Plea to Clinton
 "Despite Japanese Government actions to liberalize and internationalize, years of protection and export-driven strategies have shaped an environment inherently unfavorable to foreign firms," said Richard J. Johannessen Jr., president of the chamber and president of the Asia-Pacific operations of the Rockwell International Corporation.
Chamber officials said they planned to take their report to Washington and explain their difficulties to Clinton Administration officials, who are preparing a trade strategy.
Japan has indicated that it may not tolerate too tough an approach. Sozaburo Okamatsu, a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said today that Japan would consider retaliation if the United States imposed unilateral sanctions against Japanese exports.
The chamber's report, which was based on the experiences of the group's hundreds of member companies, said 34 business sectors remained at least partly closed to foreign concerns, even though some had been the subject of trade negotiations in the past. The sectors included agricultural products, automobiles, computers, computer software, financial services, glass and pharmaceuticals.
The report also criticized Japan's huge and growing trade surpluses with the United States, saying they reflected unfair practices.
"The continued imbalance and near-term trends remain 'politically' unacceptable, economically disruptive and a reflection of continued barriers to entry for U.S. products in Japan," it said.
The report explained how the Government's inclination to regulate every aspect of business life in Japan could impede a newcomer. For example, a dog food company could be prohibited from offering a "buy one, get one free" promotion or from hiring Japanese lawyers.
The report also cited 14 practices, including government procurement practices, tariffs and closed bidding procedures, that it said presented unfair obstacles to foreign companies.

HEADLINE: Weapons Shipment Intercepted On Way to Bosnia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
In a move that highlights the debate over the embargo on arms shipments to the parties in the Balkan war, Western naval forces have intercepted a large shipment of weapons bound for the Bosnian Government, American officials said today.
They said the ship, called the Dolphin One, was en route to Rijeka, Croatia, when it was intercepted by Italian warships. From Croatia, the cargo would have been carried overland to Bosnia. 
 The ship contained surface-to-surface rockets, Chinese-made pistols and ammunition for Kalashnikov rifles and Toyota jeeps, all believed to have been shipped from Iran. The vessel was taken into custody by Italian destroyers and ordered to steam to an Italian port, American officials said.
The State Department has said the Clinton Administration is rethinking the arms embargo, which has locked in the overwhelming advantage that Serbian forces have enjoyed over the Bosnian Muslims, particularly in heavy weapons. The Bush Administration initially supported the arms embargo on weapons shipments only to question it in the President's last weeks in office.
 
Eluding Economic Sanctions
 Supporters of the arms embargo say that it limits the intensity of the fighting in the Balkans. Critics say the West should provide the Muslims with the means to defend themselves.
At the same time, there have been continuing reports that United Nations economic sanctions on Yugoslavia are being circumvented.
American officials said that a Greek-owned vessel, the Dimitrakis, reached the port of Bar in Montenegro on Jan. 19 after the captain falsely declared that he was making an emergency stop for repairs, a Pentagon official said. The vessel was reported to be carrying 6,000 metric tons of petroleum coke, which officials said can be used in refining oil.
In addition, American officials said that several convoys of tankers traveling up the Danube, bound for Serbia, refused to yield when told to halt.
 
Enforcement on the Danube
 A convoy of six diesel fuel tankers, guided by the tugboat Bihac, refused to heed Bulgarian calls to halt on Jan. 21, officials said. The captain of that convoy reportedly threatened to blow up the fuel when told to halt.
A convoy of 24 barges loaded with fuel also refused to stop when told to do so by Romanian officials, Clinton Administration officials said.
While the Adriatic is patrolled by ships from NATO and the Western European Union, the sanctions are enforced on the Danube only by Romanian and Bulgarian river patrols.
There have also been reports that the supplies have been sent to the Greek port of Salonika and then shipped overland through Macedonia. American officials have been concerned about the possibility of sanctions-busting by Greek companies for some time because Greece has not allowed European Community observers supervise its compliance with the restrictions.
Adding to the pressure on the Clinton Administration to take firmer action is an American assessment that as many as 70,000 detainees are being held in Serbian, Muslim and Croatian detention camps.
The State Department said today that if Red Cross officials found "the maximum number of possible prisoners in each and every possible site, the number could be as high as 70,000."

HEADLINE: E. W. Kenworthy, 83, a Reporter Who Covered Capital With Flair

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
E. W. Kenworthy, a Washington correspondent for The New York Times who wrote about government and politics with flair and erudition for 20 years, died today at his home here. He was 83.
He died of complications from prostate cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. Kenworthy was 47, an advanced age to begin a new career, when he first arrived at the Washington bureau of The Times in 1957 at the start of Dwight D. Eisenhower's second term. But from the mid-1950's to the mid-1970's he covered Washington with a skill and scholarship that made him a force in daily journalism.
For example, on the White House beat in 1962, he wrote a news analysis article about the way President John F. Kennedy was twisting the arm of labor unions to support his anti-inflation program. The article began this way: "The man from Boston went up to Atlantic City this week and put on a performance for the United Automobile Workers that was one part Honey Fitz (blarney) and nine parts Ralph Waldo Emerson ('When duty whispers low, thou must')."
In addition to the White House, over the years Mr. Kenworthy covered the State Department, Congress and politics, and in the last years of his career he reported on the environment. He retired from The Times in 1977.
 
'Most Literate Reporter'
 Max Frankel, now executive editor of The Times, who was Washington bureau chief in the late 1960's and early 1970's, said Mr. Kenworthy was "simultaneously the most energetic and the most literate reporter in the Washington bureau, and there can be no more potent combination in journalism."
Edwin Wentworth Kenworthy (he used his initials in his byline and went by the nickname Ned) was born on Sept. 23, 1909, in Attleboro, Mass., and received undergraduate and graduate degrees from Oberlin College in Ohio.
He taught English at the high school level for several years and at Indiana University for several more. In World War II he worked for the Office of War Information, providing daily cables to overseas embassies about developments in the United States.
After the war Mr. Kenworthy worked briefly as an editorial writer at The Baltimore Evening Sun and then served as an information officer in the United States Embassy in London and worked for the Reporter magazine.
 
His Proudest Achievement
 In 1949 and 1950 he was executive secretary on President Harry S. Truman's Committee for Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services. The committee's report led to the racial desegregation of the military; Mr. Kenworthy always said he was prouder of the work he did on this issue than of any other professional accomplishment.
In the summer of 1950, after the committee had disbanded, Mr. Kenworthy joined The Times as a writer for The Week in Review. For seven years before moving to Washington, he wrote articles for the Sunday section on subjects ranging from the Korean War to science teaching.
In Washington, in what may have been the tour de force of his career, he covered the 1968 insurgent Presidential candidacy of Eugene J. McCarthy, providing unusual insights into this most complicated of politicians.
Take, for example, this paragraph: "His approach is not political, but moral and religious. The other day, when he offered his platform plank on Vietnam, he said he was not asking for 'repentance' from the Administration and the party. Perhaps not, but he was asking for confession. Confession may be good for the soul, but politicians have never believed it is good for the party."
Mr. Kenworthy's main beat in the 1970's was the environment, and he wrote about it with the same verve he had applied to other fields. Covering the political battle over whether to allow a power-project dam on the New River in North Carolina and Virginia, he began one article by quoting Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: "A river is more than an amenity; it is a treasure."
Mr. Kenworthy's first wife, Jane Elizabeth, died in 1977. They had three children: John, of Washington; Tom, of Vienna, Va., and Jane Schorsch, of Alexandria, Va. Besides his children, Mr. Kenworthy is survived by his second wife, Martha, whom he married in 1988, and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Republicans Lining Up to Challenge Cuomo

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 25

 BODY:
In May 1990, after being turned down by dozens of potential gubernatorial candidates, desperate Republican Party officials came across the name of Pierre A. Rinfret in a Manhattan district leader's address book.
Within a week, they had nominated the bombastic economist and political neophyte at their state convention. In an election that many Republicans consider a humiliating low point for their once grand old state party, Mr. Rinfret finished 32 percentage points behind Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and less than 1 percentage point ahead of the Conservative Party candidate, Herbert I. London.
 
A Potentially Large Field
 Less than three years later, more than a dozen Republicans from all corners of the state are considering the 1994 race for Governor. They include past and present members of Congress, legislators from both the Senate and Assembly, businessmen, lawyers and professors. 
 Those who are at least thinking about the race, some more seriously than others, include Evan G. Galbraith, a Manhattan investment banker and former Ambassador to France; Richard M. Rosenbaum, a Rochester lawyer and former state Republican chairman; Mr. London, a New York University humanities professor; Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., the Assembly minority leader from Norwich; James P. Buden, a Tarrytown real estate developer and grandson-in-law of Nelson A. Rockefeller; and Jon S. Fossel, the chairman of Oppenheimer Mutual Funds and a former Assemblyman from Westchester County.
Others include Ronald S. Lauder, an executive in the Estee Lauder cosmetics empire and an unsuccessful 1989 mayoral candidate in New York City; Lewis E. Lehrman, the unsuccessful 1982 gubernatorial candidate; J. Patrick Barrett, a Syracuse businessman and former state Republican chairman; Susan Molinari, the congresswoman from Staten Island; Gerald B. Solomon, a Congressman from Glens Falls; Senator Goodman; Bill Green, the former Congressman from Manhattan who lost his re-election campaign in November; and John R. Dunne, the former state Senator from Long Island and recently departed assistant United States Attorney General.
Without exception, they have been attracted by what they see as a rejuvenation of the Republican Party in New York, the anti-incumbency politics of 1992, the November victory of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the possibility that Mr. Cuomo will be tapped for the United States Supreme Court and, above all, the political vulnerability of the third-term Governor.
"In 1990, no one would touch this race with a 10-foot pole," said Senator Roy M. Goodman, a Manhattan Republican. "Now it's a stampede. It's a very different picture."
Many Republican strategists agree that no one in the current field has enough stature or name recognition to be considered an immediate threat to Mr. Cuomo. But hovering above the crowd is the state's junior United States Senator, Mr. D'Amato.
Within hours of winning re-election to a third term, he backed away from his campaign pledge never to run again for public office, saying he would "never say never" about running either for a fourth term or for Governor. If Mr. D'Amato chooses to run, Republican officials believe the rest of the field will dissipate quickly and unite around the Senator.
Many political analysts, including a number of aides to Mr. Cuomo, believe Mr. D'Amato would never subject himself to what undoubtedly would be a brutal battle against Mr. Cuomo.
But some Republicans are not so sure. They point out that Mr. D'Amato's ability to secure Federal dollars for New York and his control over Federal appointments in the state may diminish this year with a Democrat in the White House. If he becomes frustrated, and if his reputation survives the trial of his brother, Armand, on Federal fraud charges in April, Mr. D'Amato may well take a shot, they said. He would not have to resign his seat in the Senate to run.
 
Providing Few Hints
 Mr. D'Amato provided few hints about his intentions in an interview last week. "I know that there's going to be a race for Governor, but that's not anything that I'm looking at," he said. "I was just elected."
There are other possibilities on the Republican side as well. If former United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani loses this year's mayoral race, but finishes with a respectable showing, as he did in 1989, party leaders believe he could be a formidable statewide candidate.
The other major variable in the race, of course, is Mr. Cuomo. For the time being, the Governor is talking like a candidate, saying in interviews that he is planning to run for a fourth four-year term if President Clinton does not appoint him to the Supreme Court. He would start the race with a campaign treasury that now stands at $3.2 million.
Mr. Cuomo has said he probably will announce a decision by the end of the year. Because there will be no obvious Democratic heir apparent if Mr. Cuomo retires or leaves for Washington, the line of Democratic gubernatorial prospects may make the Republican queue look short.
But now, unlike 1990, Mr. Cuomo is not intimidating the Republicans. They were heartened that Mr. Cuomo, who won with a record 65 percent of the vote in 1986, took only 53 percent in 1990 against a pair of second-tier opponents.
Since then, they have watched his approval ratings in public polls decline steadily to well under 50 percent. An October poll by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion gave Mr. Cuomo a 44 percent approval rating, his lowest in 10 years. Seventy percent of those questioned said the state was headed in the wrong direction.
For the fifth consecutive year, Mr. Cuomo is preoccupied with eliminating a multibillion-dollar shortfall in the state budget, meaning persistent headlines about spending cuts and tax increases. When he gave a lackluster State of the State speech this month, Republicans charged that he seemed tired and bored, a contention Mr. Cuomo denies.
"He can deny it, but I think he's grown a little tired of it," Mr. Rappleyea said. "He's beginning to show a little flatness. He's run a little too long without a heavy tuneup. A lot of people believe he's going to be bailing out of here if he gets an opportunity. And if he's here, he's got a record that he's going to have trouble defending."
Few of those who say they are considering the race have run statewide campaigns, and none have done so successfully. Among the elected officials, Mr. Rappleyea may be the most prominent, but he comes from Chenango County and is concerned about his small fund-raising base. Many, like Mr. Lauder, who spent $13 million of his own money on his mayoral bid, are individually wealthy and capable of underwriting their own campaigns. Mr. Cuomo calls them "the Republican royalty."
Of those looking at the race, Mr. Rosenbaum may be furthest along. He said he has formed a campaign committee, raised $200,000 and hired professional consultants. Mr. Galbraith has formed an exploratory committee. Mr. Buden and Mr. London said they are virtually certain they will run.
Mr. Barrett, Mr. Fossel, Mr. Green, Mr. Rappleyea and Mr. Solomon said they are giving the race serious thought. Mr. Goodman, Mr. Lauder, Mr. Lehrman, Mr. Dunne and Ms. Molinari decline to rule themselves out.
 
 
 
THE NEW YORK GOVERNOR RACE: THE REPUBLICAN CHALLENGE
 In 1990, the Republican Party had trouble finding a candidate to run against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, choosing Pierre A. Reinfret, an economist and political neophyte. Mr. Rinfret finished 32 percentage points behind Mr. Cuomo and 1 percentage point ahead of the Conservative Party candidate, Herbert I. London. But with what they see as a resurgence in the Republican Party in New York State, the anti-incumbency politics of 1992, the November victory of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and the possibility that Mr. Cuomo will be tapped for the Supreme Court, at least a dozen Republicans are seriously considering a run against the Governor in 1994. The following six have expressed interest or have set up committee's to explore a possible run.
 
Evan G. Galbraith, a Manhattan investment banker and former ambassador to France
 
Richard M. Rosenbaum, a Rochester lawyer and former state Republican chairman
 
Mr. London, a New York University humanities professor
 
Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., the Assembly minority leader from Norwich
 
James P. Buden, a Tarrytown real estate developer and grandson-in-law of Nelson A. Rockefeller

HEADLINE: Domestic Vehicle Sales Rise 15% in Midmonth

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 25

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose 15 percent in mid-January compared with the period a year earlier, the nation's auto makers reported today. But the increase remained short of the robust gains the industry had been anticipating.
Accordingly, Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade newspaper, reported today that automotive production in January in the United States and Canada would fall short of planned volume by nearly 6 percent, to 785,000 cars and light trucks. 
 Domestic light-truck sales remained strong in the Jan. 11-20 period at 105,730, a 32.6 percent increase from a year earlier. But car sales rose only 4.2 percent, to 136,462. The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for the period was 5.9 million, compared with 5.3 million in early January and 5.6 million in the period last year.
 
'Glacial' Improvement
 Tom Webb, an economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, described the recovery in automotive demand as "glacial." Analysts speculated that sales had slowed from December because auto makers were offering fewer discounts, like those available last month to stimulate sales of the Ford Taurus and Honda Accord, which were battling to be the top-selling car of 1992. The Taurus achieved that distinction.
"As we head into February, if you don't see the rate of sales start to pick up, you'll see discounts again," said Steve Girsky, an analyst for Paine Webber in New York.
The General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, posted a 3.4 percent drop in domestic car sales, to 58,667, and a 33 percent increase in light-truck sales, to 39,218. In cars, G.M.'s Chevrolet and Buick divisions showed large declines, but G.M.'s full-size pickup trucks showed particularly strong gains. Sales of the Chevrolet C/K series pickup were up 58 percent, to 11,400. But analysts theorized that sales a year earlier were unusually weak because of strong competition between Ford and G.M. in late 1991.
The Ford Motor Company's car sales rose 14.9 percent, to 39,753 for the period; light-truck sales rose 18.1 percent, to 33,592. Jack Swygert, new-car sales manager of Hub Ford in Atlanta, said the incentives in late 1992 raised demand then at the expense of current sales. "We don't have any inventory," he said.
The Chrysler Corporation's light-truck sales were estimated to have risen 45.7 percent, to 25,900; car sales were estimated at 15,700, up 18.3 percent. Chrysler announces sales only once a month; interim totals are estimated by Ward's.
The Honda Motor Company's sales of domestically made cars fell 28.2 percent, to 7,223. The Toyota Motor Corporation's sales of American-made cars fell 6.3 percent, to 5,935, and Toyota's light-truck sales were up sixfold, to 1,924. The Nissan Motor Company's car sales nearly doubled, to 5,090, largely on the strength of the new Altima midsize sedan.
"We can't keep the Altima in stock," said Jim Vullock, sales manager for David McDavid Nissan-Oldsmobile in Houston. "Our January allocation is 30 cars. We've received about 20, and we're down to about 5." The Altima competes with the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks To Reopen Japan Deal

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is looking for ways to undo a secret last-minute decision by the Bush Administration to approve a Japanese corporation's purchase of an American company that makes computer equipment, Federal officials said today.
The case, involving a unit of the Applied Magnetics Corporation of Goleta, Calif., is the first foreign investment issue to face the Clinton Administration, and is a top priority of the White House's new National Economic Council, according to Congressional and executive branch officials. President Clinton today formally created the council, which is meant to complement the National Security Council and will review questions of national economic security.
 
The Bush Legacy
 The Bush Administration encouraged foreign investment in the United States and approved almost all of the applications submitted to it by foreign businesses seeking to buy American high-technology companies. A notable exception came last summer, when the Administration barred the LTV Corporation from selling its missile division to Thomson-CSF of France. 
 While President Clinton has said little on the issue, some Democratic members of Congress have been pressing for years to curb such sales, contending that foreigners are buying American inventions cheaply and then producing them overseas.
Last Tuesday, on its final full day in office, the Bush Administration secretly ruled that Applied Magnetics could sell its optical products division to Nakamichi Peripherals Inc. of Japan, said the officials, who insisted on anonymity. The division is the only American company producing the main component for computer laser disk drives in the United States, and it has just developed a new generation of laser disk drive technology.
 
Missile-Guidance Device
 The Defense Department has recently completed the testing of the new gear in the guidance system of the Patriot missile. The new generation of equipment results in faster and more durable laser disk drives and could improve the missile's performance against other missiles, like the Iraqi Scud. After the Persian Gulf war, controversy arose over the effectiveness and accuracy of the Patriot against the Scud.
"This technology is about the best there is," said Bruce E. Thompson, the chairman of Mountain Optech Inc., which is based in Boulder, Colo., and assembles military laser disk drives that use Applied Magnetics components together with special shock absorbers and insulation. "You just can't break it under very harsh conditions," he said. The high acceleration of a missile launching requires very sturdy electronic equipment.
The Bush Administration's decision, made by an interagency committee on foreign investment that is headed by the Treasury Department, is already beginning to stir criticism in Congress. Representative Cardiss Collins, Democrat of Illinois, sent a letter to the Treasury Department today protesting that Congress had not been informed about the ruling and asking that the decision be reconsidered.
Ms. Collins heads the Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and Competitiveness, which oversees Federal policy on foreign investment.
People with a detailed knowledge of the case said the staff of the National Economics Council began seeking to reopen the case immediately after President Clinton took office last Wednesday, even before formal creation of the agency, which is headed by Robert Rubin.
Federal law on the sale of American companies to foreigners allows such a reopening only if the Government finds a "material discrepancy" between the truth and information provided by participants in the transaction during the initial review of the case.
A material discrepancy is defined in the legislation as either inaccurate information or the omission of relevant information. The Treasury Department and the council are now reviewing whether Applied Magnetics provided all relevant information about the military applications of its product, officials said.
The Treasury Department declined to comment on the case, citing a Federal law that bars disclosure of information about foreign investment cases unless the companies involved have already publicly discussed the case.
Applied Magnetics announced last Tuesday that it had signed a letter of intent to sell the laser disk division, but it did not disclose the buyer. Andrew M. Kearns, the director of investor relations at Applied Magnetics, declined to comment further today on the sale, citing routine legal restrictions associated with the company's planned sale soon of four million additional shares of stock.
The company's shares closed at $12.65 today, down 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Laser disk drives resemble phonographs, in that the disk spins around while encoded information is read from it. A small laser replaces the stylus of the phonograph.
Typically, laser disk drives move the laser and all of its associated equipment across the surface of the disk. But Applied Magnetics has developed a new technique in which the laser is mounted at the edge of the disk and shines a beam into a tiny lens that moves around the disk and reflects the beam downward, reading the information, Mr. Thompson said.
Because the tiny lens is so much smaller and less bulky than the laser, it can move around the disk faster and the whole disk drive is quicker and more durable, he said.

Rally Drops Long Bond Yield to 6-Year Low

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to its lowest level in six years yesterday in a bond-market rally touched off by comments of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten over the weekend that raised hopes of deficit reduction.
Appearing Sunday on NBC News's "Meet the Press," Mr. Bentsen said the Clinton Administration was likely to propose increased taxes on energy consumption. He suggested that a broad-based tax on energy was the leading option. 
 Yesterday, President Clinton told reporters he thought Mr. Bensten had done a good job on television. The President did not back away from the notion of a consumption tax, but he added, "No decision has been made."
The rally in bonds had a positive effect on the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average gained 39.39 points, to 3,292.20. [D10.]
Traders said yesterday's bond market rally was also fueled by speculation that the Government would shift more borrowing to shorter maturities, which would shrink the supply of long-term bonds. That pushed long-term prices up yesterday, they said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32 , to 1055/32 , pushing its yield down to 7.20 percent by late in the day. That was the lowest yield since Aug. 26, 1986, when it was 7.19 percent. A rise of one point is equivalent to $10 for every $1,000 of bonds held.
In when-issued trading, the two-year note to be auctioned today was trading at a price to yield 4.25 percent, down from 4.29 percent on Friday. The five-year note to be auctioned tomorrow was trading in the when-issued market at a price to yield 5.67 percent.
William H. Pike, head of United States Government trading at Chemical Bank Securities, said the market was definitely reacting to the Treasury Secretary's comments. He said the comments added to rising hopes that the Administration would develop concrete plans to reduce the deficit.
Analysts at MMS International, a research firm, noted that although Mr. Bentsen had said he wanted to work with the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low and perhaps bring them down, they did not expect the Fed to cut rates in exchange for promises of cuts in the deficit. They said that with signs indicating a strengthening economy and a fiscal-stimulus package forthcoming from the Administration, the Fed was expected to hold rates steady.
Traders said the market also reacted yesterday to reports of only moderate growth in the rate of domestic vehicle sales in mid-January. The release today of the January consumer confidence survey could add to the market's bullishness, traders say. Confidence in the economy soared after the Presidential election and through the holiday season, but the market has been sensitive to recent signs of a pullback, particularly in expectations.
Technical analysts noted yesterday that the Commodity Research Bureau's index, comprising 21 basic raw materials, broke below 200 for the first time since early November, adding to the bullish market tone.
They said the index had been driven down largely by agricultural components, while the energy component was up sharply, with oil the chief culprit. But the decline in the total index reinforced market perceptions that inflation was not currently a concern.
 
Corporate Bonds
 The rally in Treasuries provided grounds for higher corporate bond prices. Relatively low interest rates and strong investor demand continued to provide an excellent climate for new corporate bond issues as corporate treasurers move to refinance debt that was sold when interest rates were higher.
Three banks issued $500 million of notes yesterday: Society National, the PNC Financial Corporation, and Continental Bank N.A. Other corporations accounted for $300 million in new fixed-income debt, and federally chartered agencies like Freddie Mac accounted for $130 million.
Underwriters see a heavy backlog of companies waiting to issue debt in the corporate bond market. The Public Service Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey plans to price $250 million of first and refunding mortgage bonds today through competitive bidding.
High-yield corporate bonds also traded firmer yesterday. "Things had a better tone all around," one high-yield trader said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Clinton Says He Has Made No Decision on Energy Tax

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
As lawmakers and industry officials responded unenthusiastically to suggestions of a new energy tax, President Clinton said today that he had not yet decided whether to support the idea.
Mr. Clinton said that he had not selected any of several proposals to reduce the Federal budget deficit. "We have a lot of options under consideration, but no decision has been made," he said as he signed an order establishing a National Economic Council. 
 Aides said that Mr. Clinton's comments were not meant to suggest backpedaling on an energy tax. But after the tepid reaction to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's suggestion on Sunday that the nation needed some sort of energy tax, Administration officials know they are walking through a minefield in search of deficit-cutting programs.
Many senators said a broad-based energy tax would hurt several regions, while public-interest groups criticized the idea because it would hit the middle class hardest. Environmentalists were among the few groups to welcome the suggestion.
Facing annual deficits of more than $300 billion, Mr. Bentsen said on Sunday that a tax on coal, oil and other forms of energy would not only cut the budget deficit, but would also conserve energy, reduce oil imports and cut the nation's trade deficit. He said the Administration was looking at a wide range of consumption taxes.
"As a pollution proposal, a broad-based energy tax makes a lot of sense," said Roger C. Dower, director of climate, energy and pollution studies at the World Resources Institute.
Although many lawmakers said they were eager to cooperate with the new President, several seemed wary of supporting an energy tax, fearing the public response.
Senator David L. Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat, said such a tax would hurt his energy-producing state and harm efforts to trim the deficit. "If we start dividing the country by region, putting heavier tax burdens on some regions of the country than others, I don't think we'll succeed," he said.
Some Republican senators vehemently attacked the proposal. "At the very moment the economy is beginning to move, we're talking about heaping on huge tax increases," said William V. Roth, Jr., the Delaware Republican who sits on the Senate Finance Committee.
 
Approval Could Be Won
 But Congressional leaders said Mr. Clinton could probably win approval of such an energy tax if he heavily lobbied legislators. According to calculations by the Congressional Budget Office, a 5 percent tax on energy would collect $18 billion a year. For a household that spends $100 a month on utilities and $80 a month on gasoline, a 5 percent tax on energy would cost $9 a month.
The loudest cries against an energy tax came from heavy industries, like steel and aluminum, which feared that such a levy would cripple them against foreign competition by increasing the cost of production.
Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's lobbying group, said a broad energy tax "will hurt the economy short term and long term and will have a disproportionate effect on us compared with other countries."
 
Patience Is Urged
 Administration officials cautioned today that it would be premature to focus on any one tax proposal, asserting that people should wait for the President's overall deficit-reduction plan to see how well the sacrifice is spread around.
Administration officials said they were studying several energy tax options, including a gasoline tax and an oil-import fee. A gasoline tax would hit families in the West hardest because they drive long distances, while New England would be hurt worst by an oil-import fee because much of its energy comes from imported oil. Energy experts said a broad energy tax would hurt the Midwest most because it gets much of its energy from coal and utilities that burn coal, which might face the highest tax increases.

Dollar Off Across the Board As Foreign Rates Stay High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined in an across-the-board selloff yesterday touched off by worry over high foreign interest rates.
Gold prices rose modestly after declining in Europe. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $328.80 a troy ounce, up 20 cents from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold added 30 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $328.80. 
 The dollar declined overseas, and heavy selling continued in domestic markets. The dollar was off sharply against several key currencies, particularly the Japanese yen and the German mark.
While there was no specific fresh news to influence trading, the dollar was hindered by "changing perceptions of interest rate differentials," said John McCarthy, foreign exchange manager at the ABN-AMRO Bank.
It has become increasingly apparent to traders that overseas "interest rates are not going to narrow in favor of the dollar as some would have hoped," he said.
 
Expected a Rate Cut
 Dealers had expected both Japanese and German monetary officials to trim their interest rates. The Japanese lowered one rate last week, but it had little effect in the marketplace, and officials of the Bundesbank have been insisting that they will not lower rates despite a weakening German economy.
Lower interest rates abroad make dollar-denominated securities more attractive in comparison, thereby increasing investors' need for the United States currency.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.05 yen, down 0.10 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.25 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 123.45 yen, down from 125.10 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5589, from $1.5345 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.5565 to buy one pound, more expensive than Friday's $1.5305.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.5675 German marks, down from 1.5905; 1.4465 Swiss francs, down from 1.4580; 5.3305 French francs, down from 5.3800; 1,452.50 Italian lire, down from 1,463.25, and 1.2790 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2808.

Groping for the Future as the Modern Age Ends

The End of the 20th Century
 And the End of the Modern Age
 By John Lukacs
291 pages. Ticknor & Fields. $21.95.
 The year 1989, when the Berlin Wall came tumbling down and Eastern Europe emerged from the shadow of the Soviet Union, not only marked the end of the 20th century but also the waning of a great historical epoch, the passing of the Modern Age, which witnessed the rise of liberalism, humanism and bourgeois culture throughout the Western world. So argues the historian John Lukacs in his provocative new book. 
 The 20th century was a short one, he says, having begun in 1914 with World War I and having ended well short of the millennium. It was a century indelibly shaped by the legacy of two world wars, a century whose central developments (from the Russian revolution to the collapse of the old colonial empires to the emergence of a balance of power between the United States and the Soviet Union) were direct consequences of those two pivotal wars. Today, Mr. Lukacs says, the consequences of those wars no longer dominate the historical landscape as they used to; an uneasy new era lies ahead.
Unlike its predecessor, Mr. Lukacs predicts, the 21st century will not be an American one, the decline of American power reflecting, in his view, both specific shifts in the country's fortunes and the fading of "the age of superpowers, superstates" in general. The gradual retreat of American influence in Europe, coupled with the more spectacular collapse of Communism, he adds, will leave "a large vacuum of power in the heartland of the world." In his view, this vacuum will not be filled by a "United Europe," a chimerical vision that will fail to materialize in any meaningful way, but will "most likely be filled" by a resurgent Germany, which will probably exert more and more influence on small countries from the Baltics to Croatia.
A Hungarian-born scholar who fled Budapest in 1945, Mr. Lukacs has written a dozen other books, and "The End of the 20th Century and the End of the Modern Age" draws heavily at times on ideas laid out in previous works like "The Duel: 10 May-31 July, the 80-Day Struggle Between Churchill and Hitler," "A New History of the Cold War" and "The Great Powers and Eastern Europe." His book also echoes William Pfaff's impressive study, "Barbarian Sentiments: How the American Century Ends" (1989), in several respects, most notably in its focus on Europe as a locus for change and in its emphasis on nationalism as an influential and potentially dangerous force.
As Mr. Lukacs sees it, nationalism -- that is, the love of "the myth of a 'people,' justifying everything" -- was the principal factor in this century's two world wars, and nationalism continues to be the world's most potent political force. Nationalism destroyed the Hapsburg Empire and monarchy, and nationalism helped end the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. Hitler, in Mr. Lukacs's opinion, was not a racist but an extreme nationalist, and Stalin, too, understood nationalism only too well.
"Populist nationalism," Mr. Lukacs writes, "as distinct from the now almost extinct variety of the liberal nationalisms of the 19th century, is a modern and democratic phenomenon. Populist nationalists are self-conscious rather than self-confident, extroverted, essentially aggressive and humorless, suspicious of other people within the same nation who do not seem to agree with some of their populist and nationalist ideology. Hence they assign them to the status of minorities, suggesting -- and at times emphasizing -- that such minorities do not and cannot belong within the authentic body of the national people."
Given the rise of this new kind of nationalism, what does Mr. Lukacs foresee for the 21st century? A proliferation of small states or statelets, perhaps "a bubbling new Levantine world, a subcivilization ruled by brigands and traders -- another reversion to something that existed before the Modern Age." Although he suggests that the era of great revolutions and great wars is very likely over, he also notes that new questions are raised by the "growing evidence of a New Barbarism all around us."
"When life is endangered," he writes, "when everyday life may be punctuated by instant and incalculable attacks of savagery, by tribal battles or by mob riots, no less dangerous than were wars that we still remember or can imagine -- is that way of life preferable to an era when wars, with all of their dangers and horrors, were confined to definite periods of time, with a marked beginning and end, and when a definite distinction between armies and civilians corresponded to the definite distinction between war and peace? The answer to this question is not yet. History does not repeat itself. The new barbarians are not like the barbarians of 1,600 years ago (well, the latter had at least some virtues, whereas the present ones . . . at least, not yet); and the United States and/ or the Western world at the end of the 20th century is not really like the Roman Empire."
Certainly readers will not agree with all of Mr. Lukacs's predictions and assessments. His aristocratic suspicion of democracy and egalitarianism, his arbitrary dismissal of Communism's consequences, his tendency to overemphasize the intangibles of a country's national "character" and ancient historical imperatives -- all are subject to debate. For instance, his suggestion that a spiritual "Russian sense of guilt" played a significant role in the breakup of the Soviet empire seems overly romantic, even naive; it fails to take into account the fierce economic and political realities that existed and continue to exist in that part of the world.
There are other limitations to "The End of the 20th Century" as well. Mr. Lukacs virtually ignores developments in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, and he pays no attention at all to shifts in America's international role, galvanized by recent developments like the Persian Gulf war.
Because of such shortcomings, Mr. Lukacs's book fails to offer a comprehensive or thoroughly persuasive portrait of "the end of the 20th century" (much less "the end of the Modern Age"). Still, the volume is well written and well argued, and it makes for stimulating reading, the sort of reading that sends one rushing to the bookstore in search of other books on related subjects.

A Vision That Goes Beyond 100 Yards

BYLINE: By Thomas George

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Solomon Wilcots offered the most memorable line about the riots in the Overtown section of Miami that jolted the National Football League and its annual January bash, this one Super Bowl XXIII in 1989 that featured the San Francisco 49ers and the Cincinnati Bengals. Wilcots, now a Pittsburgh Steelers safety but then with the Bengals, said: "We went to the movies to see 'Mississippi Burning.' We came out and we saw Miami burning."
The riots began after a Cuban-American police officer was charged with fatally shooting a black motorcyclist in a predominantly black section of Miami a few days before the game. The N.F.L. spun on its heels in the days that followed, bombarded with questions. 
 What responsibility does the league have to the communities that it uses to be host to its big show? Sure, more than $120 million is generated for host cities from simply having a Super Bowl, but how do the inner cities directly benefit? Is the Super Bowl simply an event of bold economics and prime entertainment for the privileged?
After the civil strife in Miami, the league tarnished its image even further by awarding the city of Phoenix and the state of Arizona the 1993 Super Bowl even though the state was divided over the failure to adopt Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a holiday. The N.F.L. owners' decision was a personal affront to many and particularly to the black athletes who constitute 65 percent of the league's players.
Of course, the decision was eventually reversed, which brought this year's Super Bowl to the Rose Bowl and to Pasadena, Calif., instead. But at the time of the first vote, only one N.F.L. owner, Norman Braman of the Philadelphia Eagles, stood up and spoke out about potential boycotts and the possibility of a need to rescind the '93 Phoenix bid.
The other owners -- and N.F.L. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, too -- either could not undertand what the fuss was about or simply, initially, refused to fully address it.
My, the N.F.L. has come a long way.
Starting in Miami, after the riots, the league began offering minority scholarships for youths in Super Bowl cities and developed a program to insure that minority businesses large and small would gain a share of the enormous Super Bowl economic pie. Now the league has made a gigantic leap with its N.F.L./Y.E.T (Youth Education Town) idea, a $1 million, multifaceted educational and recreational facility being built in South-Central Los Angeles.
This facility speaks to the heart of problems particulary in the Compton/Watts area where it will be built, an area that has gained worldwide attention since the riots in South-Central Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict last April. The facility will give something back to the area where 104 N.F.L. players past and present grew up, including two from this year's Super Bowl, receiver James Lofton of the Buffalo Bills and safety James Washington of the Dallas Cowboys.
The facility will include four primary arenas -- library, classroom, physical conditioning room and Astroturf recreational field. The goal is for its completion between May 1 and April 1. Many businesses have offered a helping hand; Sports Illustrated has offered to coordinate the acquisition of books and creation of educational programs, book donors include Random House and the Trumpet Club/ Bantam-Doubleday Dell Publishing, and Sony has offered 50 mini-disk electronic encyclopedias.
Everyone from quarterback Vince Evans of the Los Angeles Raiders to the Football Hall of Famer John Mackey to Roy Roberts, the executive director of the Watts/Willowbrook Boys and Girls Club, has given time and input. Country singer Garth Brooks will donate the proceeds from two concerts here this weekend.
But the driving force behind the project is Reggie Williams, the former Bengals linebacker, former Cincinnati city councilman and former general manager of the New York/ New Jersey Knights of the now-defunct World League of American Football.
"I was on the city council in Cincinnati and a Bengal getting ready for the game when the riots in Miami broke," Williams said. "You could see the fires burning from our hotel. After the motorcyclist was killed, the police closed off the area and let an implosion take place. Well, this program will tear down those type of blockades. We're going in and we're trying to make a difference."
Williams was hired by the N.F.L. last fall as director of community affairs for Super Bowl XXVII.
"The first thing I did was come to Los Angeles in October and November and spend a few days just listening," Williams said. "Commissioner Tagliabue made a commitment for us to identify a community project in connection with the Super Bowl and the Rebuild L.A. Project. He made a commitment and backed it up. Listening to the people here was important. But really, all you had to do was drive through Compton and you could see the many problems on the many faces."
And one trip to the Watts/Willowbrook facility was all Williams needed to crystallize his idea.
There he saw a run-down, tired facility that was a refuge to more than 1,000 youths. The ceilings were full of holes. The basketball courts were full of long, ugly holes, some covered with gray masking tape, others just left bare. No showers. A trailer that served as an educational center was dark and ugly brown outside with few resources inside. And yet there was immense pride in the work being done there by Roberts and his assistants.
"I felt like maybe I have lived a spoiled life, but still, it was hard to believe," Williams said. "The standards had to be raised. What more basic promotion of self-esteem is there to have a facility that at least includes showers and an emphasis on personal hygiene?"
Williams knew what needed to be done. He began marshaling forces. He met some resistance.
"The politics of putting together something this massive calls for perserverance, and Mr. Williams had it," said Roberts, who has worked at the Watts/Willowbrook facility for 18 years, who grew up in a housing project in South-Central L.A. and who has lived in the area for 43 of his 49 years. "I don't know if it would have happened without Mr. Williams. He is leaving a legacy here. So is the N.F.L."
N.F.L. players, especially from the Raiders and the Rams, will be asked to visit the center and work with youths. This facility cannot solve all of the deep, sweeping problems of South-Central Los Angeles, but it makes a tremendous effort where effort is needed most -- among youth.
Williams makes special mention of former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, who died Sunday. Marshall's impetus that sparked the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, which ended the "separate but equal" system of segregation in American schools, came in the year in which Williams was born.
"He always played a unique role in my life," Williams said. "He paved the way and issued a challenge for me. I'm trying to do the same with these youth. In a small way, a door is open for opportunity. The hope and the expectation is that the N.F.L/ Y.E.T facility will not be a goal unto itself but a catalyst for creative ways to assist youth. We tell them to stay in school and get an education, but this is a vehicle that goes beyond the advice. It puts deeds behind the words. The youth must act and seize the opportunity."
Will they?
"I don't think very much is going to change," said Amos Harris, an 18-year-old who lives five minutes from the facility and who worked at the center setting up the sound system for the N.F.L. news conference today that was to announce the facility plans. "Some people have changed, but not a whole lot has changed. But I have to look at it in the way that every little thing that is done here is good. I've never heard of the N.F.L. doing anything like this. It's a great start. They should continue."
One final thought. The site on which the facility will be built is part of a shopping center that serves as a nerve center for the area. In fact, the new facility is being built on ground where stores were burned to ashes during the L.A. riots.
This is how ashes can, indeed, be turned into beauty.

HEADLINE: Gay Couples Also Need Economic Benefits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We appreciate your coverage of Mayor David N. Dinkins's announcement of executive orders to allow domestic partners in New York City to register their relationship with the city clerk, which confers certain noneconomic benefits (news article, Jan. 8). Yet we are dismayed that you omit mention of the suit filed the same day by a group of city employees demanding precisely what the executive orders lack. 
 The Coalition of Lesbian and Gay City Employees, four named city employees and four pseudonymous complainants, filed a complaint with the the city's Commission on Human Rights. We seek full spousal benefits for all full-time city employees living in domestic partnerships, namely the same health, dental, retirement and death benefits conferred on the spouses of our heterosexual counterparts. This is the first suit by city employees to demand the full spectrum of economic benefits.
For the thousands of lesbian and gay city employees with uninsured partners, these economic benefits matter most. The executive orders permit bereavement leave, family leave without pay, visitation rights in municipal hospitals and correctional facilities, and provide that a registered domestic partnership is evidence of family for occupying or succeeding to rights in city housing.
Although these measures are welcome, they are noneconomic.
Without health benefits, domestic partnership registration for many is simply too risky. Indeed, based on experiences with employment discrimination, many lesbian and gay employees fear retaliation for declaring their domestic partnerships, notwithstanding the confidentiality provisions. However, if registration included nondiscriminatory qualification for benefits, more city employees would be motivated to take that step.
Contrary to the Mayor's position, nothing prevents the city from providing full health benefits now. Other employers, such as Seattle, Montefiore Hospital, the Lotus Corporation and The Village Voice already offer such benefits to the domestic partners of employees. To deny full spousal benefits to lesbian and gay employees is to deny equal pay for equal work.

HEADLINE: Gay Couples Also Need Economic Benefits;
Undermining Marriage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Time will tell whether or not Stanford University and the University of Chicago have yielded unwisely to the political correctness ideology in giving gay partners the same benefits as married couples. 
 As one who became a college president in 1951 and served as president of the American Association of Presidents of Independent Colleges and Universities (1969-72), I offer the perspective of an educational philosophy now sidelined, but not without success in supporting the American experiment in self-government.
Until World War II the colleges and universities of America had rules and customs that reflected the common beliefs about what is a good society. Among the many givens of campus life in those days were regulations that prohibited students from being in the dormitories of the opposite sex overnight. These proprietary rules, as they were called, placed the full majesty of the intellectual community on record as favoring marriage and the ideal of premarital chastity as critically important features of American civilization.
In this era of the triumph of sexual liberation, lawmakers and policy makers focus on the sexually active generation and relegate children and grandparents to the status of encumbrances. The new policies of Chicago and Stanford follow the pattern and drive one more nail in the coffin of marriage as a civilizational norm.
Since it is now beyond dispute that a child raised in a family with a father and a mother has a substantially better chance than other children do for emotional stability, success in school and employment, and for avoiding delinquency and suicide, one has to wonder if these two universities know which direction is forward.

HEADLINE: Gay Couples Also Need Economic Benefits;
Clinton Should Proceed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Gays in the Military: Cancel Reagan's Ban" (Op-Ed, Jan. 14), James T. Bush appears to draw a distinction between declaring one's homosexuality and engaging in homosexual acts. Such a distinction promotes a double standard between heterosexuality and homosexuality. 
 Our society permits, even encourages heterosexuals to participate in sexual activity when both parties are consenting adults. To allow members of the armed services to state they are homosexual without fear of disciplinary action, while continuing to prohibit them from exercising their sexuality by engaging in consensual homosexual activity, is hypocritical.
President Clinton should stand behind his campaign promise to sign an executive order overturning the 1982 ban on gays in the armed services. Only such a high-profile act will send the message that discrimination has no place in our Armed Forces. Mr. Clinton's order should also revise military regulations to provide equal treatment for all servicemen and women, regardless of sexual orientation.

HEADLINE: River Life Through U.S. Broadly Degraded

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
TWO decades of Federal controls have sharply reduced the vast outflows of sewage and industrial chemicals into America's rivers and streams, yet the life they contain may be in deeper trouble than ever.
The main threat now comes not from pollution but from humans' physical and ecological transformation of rivers and the land through which they flow. The result, scientists say, is that the nation's running waters are getting biologically poorer all the time and that entire riverine ecosystems have become highly imperiled. 
 Dams disrupt temperature and nutrient patterns on which organisms depend. Countless river and stream channels have been straightened, eliminating the meandering course on which rivers depend for their ecological variety. Repeated diversions of water from a river's flood plain can decimate populations of fish that spawn there. Sediments from farming run into streams and suffocate many small forms of aquatic life. Vacationers who cut down trees to improve the view in front of summer homes may erode stream banks. The stream then carries more sediment and becomes wider, shallower and warmer, making the water unfit for many vital organisms.
"If you take a drive out into pretty, rolling farm country, nobody thinks of the farming activity as habitat destruction," says Dr. J. David Allan, a freshwater ecologist at the University of Michigan. "But the transformation of the landscape by agriculture is taking its toll" on life in rivers and streams, as are urban and suburban development and the spread of exotic, disruptive species of aquatic life.
The transformation, says Dr. Allan, is far more destructive to aquatic life than are spills of oil or toxic chemicals. For all the one-time harm they may cause, these spills have relatively little long-term impact. And because the transformation is so much a part of deeply entrenched patterns of land and water use, it is also far harder to deal with.
Dr. Allan lays out the threat to riverine organisms and ecosystems in an article in the current issue of the journal BioScience.
A 1990 study by Larry Master of the Nature Conservancy found that in North America, 28 percent of amphibian species and subspecies, 34 percent of fishes, 65 percent of crayfish and 73 percent of mussels were imperiled in degrees ranging from rare to extinct. The comparable figures were 13 percent for terrestrial mammals, 11 percent for birds and 14 percent for land reptiles.
In the West, where dams and the introduction of exotic species are common, the situation is particularly acute. Of 30 species of native fish in Arizona, 25 are listed as threatened or endangered, according to Dr. W. L. Minckley, a zoologist at Arizona State University.
The biotic impoverishment goes beyond the loss of individual species, however. Many rivers, Dr. Allan wrote, contain few or no endangered species, yet there are so few representatives of each species present that the ecosystem's functioning is impaired. Scientists do not know at what precise point this thinning of life causes an ecosystem to disintegrate. But "it's like an airplane wing," said Dr. John Cairns Jr., an environmental biologist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, explaining, "if you keep pulling rivets out, the wing is going to go."
Among other benefits, riverine ecosystems create breeding grounds for commercial fisheries, carry nutrients to them and support multimillion-dollar recreational activities. In concert with wetlands, they regulate the flow of water, releasing it more slowly in flood times so that more will be left for dry times.
Few if any major river systems are unaffected by the threat to ecological integrity.
Sediment from farm fields, for instance, has clouded the mighty Mississippi, making it more hostile to many organisms. Levees prevent the sediments from settling out naturally on the Mississippi Delta. Instead, they are channeled directly to the continental shelf. This contributes to a sinking of the land in southern Louisiana and releases so many river-borne nutrients into the Gulf of Mexico that plankton growth is stimulated. The plankton use up oxygen when they decay and die, and scientists fear this oxygen depletion may harm Gulf fisheries.
 
Loss of Native Fish
 The Colorado River south of Lake Mojave has been so altered by disruption of water flow and the introduction of exotic fish species, Dr. Minckley said, that it has become the first major river in North America with no native fish left.
Dams on the Columbia River have so interfered with salmon migrations that one variety of Columbia salmon has been listed by the Government as endangered. Another has been declared threatened, and five more have been proposed for listing.
All three of these watercourses appear on a 1992 list of North America's 10 most endangered rivers compiled by American Rivers, a Washington-based conservation organization. Others include the Alsek and Tatshenshini river system in Alaska and Canada, the Great Whale River in Quebec, the Everglades, the American River in California and the Penobscot in Maine.
The list is rounded out by the Beaverkill and the Willowemoc, legendary Catskill trout streams where American fly fishing was born, and Montana's Blackfoot, the putative setting of the current hit movie, "A River Runs Through It."
Habitat in lower stretches of the Beaverkill-Willowemoc system is threatened by developers' cutting of streamside vegetation. The Blackfoot has become so degraded by timber cutting, agriculture, water diversions and mining activities that the movie makers were forced to move to another location.
 
'Four Horsemen' of Destruction
 Kevin Coyle, the president of American Rivers, describes "the four horsemen of river destruction" as dams, diversion of water, alteration of channels and land development.
Dams trap nutrients and keep them from flowing downstream. Perhaps more devastating, they alter the temperature of downstream water, making it either too cold or too warm and thus annihilating whole populations of insects vital to the riverine food web. One dam might not be so bad, but many dams on the same river, as is common in the West, repeatedly interrupt the river's natural functioning.
Diversion of water for human use, also widespread in the West, has simply dried up many rivers and streams for much of the year, with the result that their ecosystems are, in Mr. Coyle's words, "ghosts of what they used to be."
The straightening, diking and redirection of river channels, common across the country to control floods and convert flood plains to cropland, housing and highways, reduce the variety of habitats critical to biological diversity.
Land development often denudes stream and river banks of vegetation, eliminating the vital transition between the river and the uplands. Draining land for farming or development causes water to flow more rapidly into the river channel than it naturally would. This leaves less water to percolate into the river in drier times.
If the river channel has been straightened as well, water draining from the land moves more efficiently, producing more powerful floods. These carry the increased sediments from farming and development farther, choking organisms and ecosystems well downstream.
On top of all this, legions of exotic species have been introduced into running waters. Some, like the zebra mussel slowly spreading across the country, have appeared by accident. Others, like fish imported to provide sport or to clean vegetation from the waters, have been introduced on purpose. Together, Dr. Allan said, they have significantly reduced biological diversity through predation, alteration of habitat, introduction of diseases or parasites and interbreeding with native organisms.
 
Tinkering With Nature
 Such ecological tinkering can unexpectedly cascade through the water, onto the land and into the economy as well. In one instance, fishery managers in Montana introduced opossum shrimp into Flathead Lake and its associated river systems, hoping the shrimp would provide forage for kokanee salmon that were the basis of a thriving tourist industry.
Instead, the shrimp consumed zooplankton that were the staples of the kokanee diet. The kokanee population collapsed. Bald eagles and grizzly bears that once congregated at the rivers to feed on salmon disappeared, as did tourists who had come to see them.
Once invasive species have established themselves, said Dr. Allan, it may be impossible to eliminate them. The other main causes of biological impoverishment seem only a little less intractable. Even so, Dr. Allan, Mr. Coyle and others say much can be done.
 
Strategy Is Proposed
 American Rivers advocates a three-pronged strategy: saving the headwaters of the major rivers, which for the most part are already publicly owned; protecting and restoring riparian zones by replanting green strips along rivers; and working with governments to regulate water discharges from dams so they disrupt ecosystems less. Federally controlled dams are also being examined for their environmental effects as their hydroelectric licenses come up for renewal.
A number of scattered efforts to restore rivers and streams are being undertaken. Restorationists have become expert at restoring streams for game fish like trout, Dr. Allan noted. What is needed now, he said, is a comparable effort to restore habitat for the full panoply of riverine organisms.
An ambitious effort along these lines involves the Kissimmee River in Florida. To control flooding, the Army Corps of Engineers basically turned the twisting, 103-mile-long river into a straight canal, largely destroying the riverine-riparian ecosystem. Now, after a successful demonstration project, the State of Florida and the corps hope to restore the river's twists and turns -- and its ecosystem.
Broader restoration of this sort is still in its infancy. But as fragile as riverine ecosystems are, Dr. Allan points out, they are also remarkably resilient. They tend to repair themselves once the causes of their impoverishment are removed.
So, he says, all is not lost.

Diagram: "Flowing waters, dynamic ecosystem"
As rivers and streams meander, overflow their banks and create shortlived oxbow lakes, they fashion a patchwork of plant and animal habitats, both aquatic and terrestrial. Altering their courses over time, they achieve a long-term rhythmic balance among current, shore and floodplain that adds up to a single, indivisible ecosystem.
 
Eddies, riffles and pools
Patches of small environments occur in the riverine-riparian system as a result of differences in temperature, water velocity and dissolved nutrients. Organisms become specialists, adapted to life in shallow riffles with swift water, deep pools or warmer streambeds.
 
Stresses spread throughout the system
Changes in the channel, banks and water quality disrupt the finely meshed details of the aquatic ecology, endangering the health and fertility of many species. If a streambed silts up or a channel is widened, the water chemistry, temperature, depth and movement are all modified. Farming and overgrazing lead to destructive erosion of banks and runoff into the streams.
 
Silting up of streams diminishes aquatic life
Fine particles that remain suspended in water reduce sunlight and plant productivity, with a ripple effects all along the food chain. Predatory fish require good visibility to hunt.

Chart: "Stresses on the Aquatic Environment of Rivers and Streams"
 Five major classes of factors that affect the river environments of living things and how human activities affect them.

Energy Source
The type and amount of organic material entering a stream from the riverside, versus primary production in the stream; seasonal patterns.
 
Water Quality
Temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and nutrients, natural and synthetic chemicals, heavy metals and toxic substances, acidity.
 
Habitat Quality
Spawning, nursery and hiding places; substrate type; water depth and velocity; diversity (pools, riffles, woody debris).
 
Water Flow
The volume of water and the timing of floods and low flows.
 
Interactions of Living Things
Competition, predation, disease and parasitism.
 
CHANGES THAT RESULT FROM HUMAN-INDUCED ALTERATIONS:
Coarse particles of organic matter decrease; silt and fine particles increase; algal production increases.
More extreme temperatures; more suspended solids, nutrients and turbidity; altered daily cycle of dissolved oxygen.
Destabilization of substrate and banks by erosion and increased sediment; less habitat variation and vegetation; more uniform water depth; less habitat area.

HEADLINE: Israel Faces New U.N. Pressure Over Deportations

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Accused of allowing the United Nations to adopt a double standard in its dealings with recalcitrant nations, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called today for the Security Council to take "whatever measures are necessary" to make Israel obey the Council's demand to re-admit 400 deported Palestinians.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali's recommendation led immediately to a call for sanctions against Israel by the Palestine Liberation Organization, which circulated a draft Security Council resolution to ban Israel from human rights meetings and to prevent foreign companies from doing business with some Israeli enterprises in the occupied territories. 
 The P.L.O.'s draft, which is likely to receive considerable backing, seemed to set the United Nations on a collision course with the Clinton Administration, which fears the crisis will derail the Mideast peace talks but wants it resolved by diplomacy.
 
History of U.S. Vetoes
 The United States has always exercised its veto on the Security Council to block sanctions against Israel, but has sometimes joined in votes condemning Israeli actions or abstained.
The Administration today indicated its readiness to block sanctions again, but such a veto would open Washington to charges that it seeks United Nations punishment against countries like Iraq, Libya and Yugoslavia for defying Security Council orders while shielding Israel from similar treatment.
A United States veto would also end a two-and-a-half-year period when no vetoes have been cast. The last veto was cast on May 31, 1990, when the Bush Administration blocked a resolution it considered unfair to Israel.
Israel angrily rejected the Secretary General's recommendation and, hoping to buy time, urged all parties to do nothing until after the Israeli High Court decides whether the deportations were legal. That ruling is expected later this week. [Page A8.]
The United States also asked for more time. The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said, "We believe there is an opportunity to resolve the issue through active diplomacy. We would like to see those efforts exhausted before the Security Council considers taking action."
Mr. Boucher said the Administration "wouldn't see any constructive purpose in a Security Council debate" on sanctions. He noted the impending court ruling and said Washington's "top priority" was to secure "the advancement of the Middle East peace talks."
 
Accusation by Israel
 Israel edged closer to a confrontation with the United Nations when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin accused Mr. Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian Christian, of employing a double standard by allegedly ignoring the "extremist Islamic terrorism" that made the deportations necessary.
Other Israeli officials reacted strongly to a separate proposal by Mr. Boutros-Ghali for the United Nations to start monitoring Israel's treatment of the 1.8 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, saying monitoring was unnecessary because Israel has responsibility for the Palestinians under international law.
The head of the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks, Haidar Abdel-Shafi, praised the Secretary General's report, saying it was "high time that the U.N. asserts its authority" and that it would be shameful and ridiculous if Washington were to use its veto to block tough measures against the Israelis.
In his report to the Security Council, the Secretary General said his Middle East mediator, Chinmaya Gharakhan of India, had failed to persuade Israel to take back the deportees, who have now spent more than a month in a makeshift camp in a no man's land in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese Government says the deportees are Israel's responsibility.
 
Interpreting His Responsibility
 Thus, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said, "I would be failing in my duty if I did not recommend to the Security Council that it should take whatever measures are required to insure that its unanimous decision, as set out in Resolution 799 (1992), is respected." The resolution orders Israel to take back the deportees.
The Secretary General said his mediator also rejected Israeli claims that the Council's criticism of the deportations was damaging the Mideast talks.
The Secretary General's recommendation was seen by diplomats here as an open invitation to the P.L.O. and its Arab supporters to demand mandatory sanctions against Israel, and the P.L.O. promptly circulated its draft.
 
What the P.L.O. Wants
 The resolution would bar Israel from attending any meeting organized by the United Nations or any member state devoted to human rights issues or the legal instruments that govern them. This would prevent Israel from being represented at the world conference on human rights that the United Nations plans in June in Vienna.
The draft resolution would also prohibit all "trade and financial dealings" with Israeli establishments involved in the activities in the occupied territories that violate the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which establishes the rights of civilians caught in occupied areas. This means, for example, that foreign companies could not supply Israel with goods used in the construction or maintenance of Israeli settlements in the territories; the Geneva Convention prohibits changing the ethnic composition of occupied territories.
The draft resolution also threatens unspecified "further measures" if Israel fails to comply with Resolution 799, which was adopted unanimously by the Council on Dec. 18. The draft calls for the Council to meet on Feb. 9 to review Israel's response.
 
Britain Opposes Sanctions
 The British Government joined Washington in saying it opposes any move to impose sanctions on Israel, arguing that this would only lead to a United States veto. But the 12 European Community countries are expected to tell the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, when he meets with them on Monday that Israel's request for closer economic ties with the Community will be put on hold until the problem of the deportees is resolved.
Some Western diplomats also criticized the P.L.O.'s plan to ban Israel from attending human rights meetings, arguing that the point of such meetings is to shame countries into improving their behavior by confronting them publicly with evidence of abuses.
But many countries on the Security Council are worried by the accusations that some are applying a double standard. In order to maintain credibility, many diplomats say, the Council must at least try to punish Israel for defying its orders, even if the United States vetoes the resolution.
This feeling is particularly strong among the seven developing countries with seats on the Council. These include three Muslim states, an unusually high number. They are Morocco, Pakistan and Djibouti.

HEADLINE: 3 Aircraft Companies Announce Big Job Cutbacks as Orders Fall

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Squeezed by fewer orders for military aircraft and commercial jet airliners, three major aerospace companies announced cutbacks yesterday that will result in layoffs of thousands of workers in coming months, with Connecticut and Washington State losing most of the jobs.
Pratt & Whitney, the jet engine manufacturer with headquarters in Hartford, said that 6,700 jobs at its Connecticut plants would be eliminated during the next 24 months, including 1,800 this week. 
 The Boeing Company, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, said it would cut back production of every model of jet airliner that the company makes -- from jumbo jets to 737's. Analysts said this could result in as many as 30,000 lost jobs through layoffs, attrition and retirement.
 
1,500 Jobs at McDonnell
 And the McDonnell Douglas Corporation announced that 1,500 white-collar jobs would be eliminated at its St. Louis headquarters. On Monday, the company had said that 8,700 jobs, or 10 percent of its remaining work force, would soon disappear, most of them production jobs at its California factories that make commercial airliners.
Responding to Pratt & Whitney's announcement, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. asked the Clinton Administration to reregulate the airline industry to end the air fare wars that have weakened the industry. [Page B1.]
"God almighty, I wish the Federal Government would get off the dime," the Governor said in calling for a restoration of the regulations that until the late 1970's gave the Federal Government the power to set air fares and distribute routes among the airlines.
The latest announcements of job cutbacks came just 24 hours after Sears, Roebuck & Company announced plans to reorganize, eliminating its famous catalogue, 113 stores and 50,000 jobs.
The flood of new job cutbacks could weaken the economic recovery that appeared to be gaining strength in last year's fourth quarter -- renewing pressure on President Clinton to try to stimulate the economy through job-creating public works projects.
Boeing was not precise about its layoffs, declining to say how many jobs might have to be eliminated as production slides to 340 new aircraft this year from 441 in 1992. But analysts estimated that the company's payroll of 130,000 employees would probably be trimmed by 30,000 people in coming months. Most of the layoffs will be in the Seattle area, where Boeing has its headquarters and has most of its factories, and in Wichita, Kan., where it also has plants.
"I had been anticipating some more cuts, but not of this order of magnitude and not this soon," said Bill Whitlow, a Boeing analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Seattle.
The latest layoffs and job eliminations are part of a broad-gauged shrinking of the aircraft manufacturing industry, which has declined from 1.3 million jobs in 1990 to 1 million today and probably 700,000 by mid-decade, said Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with UBS Securities.
"We're about halfway there right now," he said. "And currently we are at the fastest rate of aerospace industry job cuts."
Boeing, like McDonnell Douglas, had already trimmed staff, forced to do so by fare discounts and sagging travel that has weakened airlines here and abroad. As a result, many airlines have canceled or delayed orders that had been placed for new jetliners, among them such industry giants as American Airlines, which announced yesterday that it had reached agreement with Boeing to delay delivery of eight airliners worth $500 million. They were to have been ready starting late this year.
 
Optimistic on Long Term
 The aircraft companies put the best light they could on the new cutbacks. Dean Thorton, president of Boeing's Commercial Plane Group, said that while "the present reality is sobering," the company "remained optimistic about the longer-term prospects."
Similarly, Barbara Anderson, a McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman, predicted better days ahead. "We think this will be a pivotal year for the company in that it will establish our financial strength and viability," Ms. Anderson said, according to The Associated Press.
Only Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies, with six factories in Connecticut, a state still suffering from hard times, sounded gloomy.
"Last year, Pratt & Whitney lost approximately $500 million -- these losses cannot continue," said Karl J. Krapek, the company's president, in a letter to employees. "Our goal is to make ourselves recession proof."
The stock prices of the three companies suffered yesterday. McDonnell Douglas shares fell $3.375, to $63.50; Boeing fell $1.375, to $35.50, and United Technologies slipped 12.5 cents, to $47.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Military Cutbacks Cited
 While the companies stressed the weak economy, some Defense Department officials said that many of the aerospace industry's job cuts in recent months were a result of cutbacks in the manufacture of military aircraft, although actual dollars spent by the Pentagon for aircraft had barely fallen.
"The unit costs of new planes are rising through the roof because of inefficiencies at the manufacturers," said A. Ernest Fitzgerald, a Defense Department analyst. These inefficiencies inevitably infect the commercial divisions of the aircraft manufacturers, he said, helping to force production cutbacks as costs rise beyond what the airlines can afford.
Whatever the reasons, Boeing announced that fourth-quarter earnings before an accounting charge for retiree health benefits fell 7 percent, to $377 million, or $1.11 a share, from $403 million, or $1.17 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue fell 3 percent from the 1991 fourth quarter, to $7.5 billion.
For all of 1992, Boeing said that net income before the accounting charge rose 4 percent, to $1.64 billion, or $4.81 a share, from $1.57 billion, or $4.56 a share, in 1991. Revenue increased by 3 percent, to $30.18 billion.

b-After charges of $20 million and $81 million for the quarter and year, respectively, from a change in accounting for FASB rule 106 on retirees' health benefits. The year also included a charge of $1.002 billion from a one-time cumulative adjustment for retiree health-care costs attributed to previous years.
 
Boeing Co. said it had elected to record a one-time cumulative adjustment for the cost of retirees' health benefits rather than amortize the adjustment over the current and future years. Therefore, results have been restated for the first, second and third quarters of 1992.

HEADLINE: Job-Stimulus Plan Begins to Take Shape

 BODY:
Aides to President Clinton said that he would probably propose $15 billion to $20 billion in new Federal spending this year to stimulate employment.
The likelihood of such a proposal was confirmed by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who acknowledged that the figure was a modest one, given the context of a $6 trillion economy. 
 But he insisted that it would have an important psychological impact, sending "a very clear signal that we have got to get the growth back."
It would also be a signal to the financial markets that the new Administration intends to be restrained in spending on jobs, so that the deficit is not seriously worsened or inflation spurred.
Both Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the White House budget director, Leon E. Panetta, have urged restraint in the development of any stimulus package, and their advice seems to have won the day.

HEADLINE: Asking 'What Can I Do?' And Giving to Neediest

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
New Yorkers sometimes feel that to survive in their city, they must steel themselves to the poverty that spills onto the sidewalks. Perhaps they force themselves to tune out pleas for spare change or to ignore a haggard woman sleeping in a box near their apartments. But every so often an experience may pierce that armor.
At that point, when they no longer can turn away, they might ask: "What can I do?" For some, the answer is to contribute to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which rescues thousands of people every year who might otherwise spend their days suffering and devoid of hope. 
 "I sent one check earlier this year -- never as much as I'd like," wrote a Manhattan woman who asked that her name not be used. "Then I saw a very presentable, clean older lady searching in a Dumpster outside a supermarket. I didn't have much with me to help her then, but it haunts me." The woman gave $75 as her second donation to the Neediest Cases.
Alan H. Vorchheimer of Manhattan gave $600, explaining that he and his wife, Leslie J. Lane, were dedicating their donation to the homeless. "My wife sees a homeless woman on the subway each day on her way to work," Mr. Vorchheimer wrote. "Hopefully, our gift can make these peoples' lives a little less hurtful."
 
'Look of Total Despair'
 With her check for $1,100, Pilar Crespi of Manhattan sent a note describing how sad she felt when she walked past people living on the streets. "I will never get used to the sight of the many homeless wandering around this city with a look of total despair," she wrote.
And Jane Bender of Manhattan gave $35. "As a social worker, I see the ravages that poverty, homelessness, drug abuse and illness cause and thus hope I can help a little," she wrote.
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund supports seven charities that are coming to the aid of newly unemployed people whose lives have been thrown into turmoil because of the recession. The Times pays the fund's expenses, so all contributions go directly to the charities. This year's campaign, the 81st, ends on Feb. 28.
Jane and Bill Stubenbord of Manhattan gave $100 to the Neediest Cases in honor of their two daughters, who volunteer in homeless shelters in New York and San Francisco. And Rose M. Lucas of Flushing, Queens, sent a letter explaining that she tried to think of ways to end homelessness.
"I see so many pathetic things that no one seems to be able to handle," she wrote. "I often wonder where are the friends and relatives of the homeless. If a homeless person has seven friends and each one takes him or her in for one night until other arrangements can be made, that would get the person off the street."
"I wonder," she added, "if anything can help."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Tells Legislators Of Burdens

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 26

 BODY:
With more assertiveness than in past visits to Albany, Mayor David N. Dinkins today charged the state with shifting its financial problems onto the city in recent years, and pleaded for "a change of posture in Albany."
The Mayor, who plans to unveil his proposal for filling a $2.1 billion budget gap on Friday, said the city had absorbed "an astonishing $1.1 billion in shifted costs since 1990." 
 Speaking at a hearing on the state budget held by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Dinkins asked legislators to reverse that trend by refusing to pass any budget that does not include a plan for the state to assume Medicaid costs currently paid by local governments.
Mr. Dinkins minced few words in blaming the Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for imposing both budget cuts and tax increases that he said have had a disproportionate impact on the city.
 
'Deficit Shifting'
 "Time and again the state has asked local governments to carry a heavy fiscal load," Mr. Dinkins said. "And after we have done so, we have been asked to carry even more."
Mr. Dinkins and his aides provided only partial substantiation for the Mayor's calculation of $1.1 billion in shifted costs. They said the number included reductions in unrestricted state aid for local governments, cuts in probation spending, caps placed on state reimbursement for foster care and other social-service programs, cuts in school transportation spending and programs for handicapped preschoolers, and cuts in state aid to the City University of New York.
Cuomo administration aides were quick to dispute Mr. Dinkins's arithmetic and to charge that he omitted mention of state initiatives that had saved the city money, including Medicaid cuts and fiscal reforms that have reduced debt payments.
Mr. Cuomo canceled a meeting and news conference with Mr. Dinkins scheduled to follow the Mayor's appearance at the hearing. The Governor's press secretary, Anne W. Crowley, said Mr. Cuomo had to attend to other business and had not even heard about Mr. Dinkins's remarks when he scrapped the meeting.
The argument that the state has shifted costs to local governments during the recession is not a new one, either for Mr. Dinkins or for county executives. Just as Mr. Cuomo has complained that the Federal Government has shifted an undue burden to the states, local officials have maintained that the state has passed the burden to cities and counties.
But what was new today was Mr. Dinkins's tone. While he spoke in the formal idiom that defines his political persona -- "one has to look at whence cometh," he said at one point -- his message carried the indignation often shown during budget hearings by his predecessor, Edward I. Koch.
The change may have less to do with any personal transformation than with election-year politics. In a year when he faces a tough campaign against both Democrats and Republicans, Mr. Dinkins is saddled with a budget shortfall that his aides said is now $2.1 billion.
Until today the Dinkins administration had projected the gap to be $1.6 billion, but that figure did not reflect the cost of a recent labor settlement with municipal unions or the impact of declining property tax revenues.
When Mr. Dinkins proposes his budget on Friday, he will seek about $600 million in help from the state.
The issue that the Mayor chose to focus on today was taking over Medicaid. Mr. Cuomo first suggested the takeover in the fall of 1991, proposing that the state would assume all local Medicaid costs by the year 2000 in exchange for the revenues generated by the city's personal income tax and up to 1 percentage point of the sales tax in counties outside the city.
The plan has been greeted warily by the Republicans who control the State Senate. They have proposed an alternative that would require deeper cuts in Medicaid but would not call for the state to take taxing authority from local governments.

HEADLINE: Russian Sensitivities;
As Choices Become Harder, Moscow Grows Skeptical About U.S. Policies

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 26

 BODY:
For Russia the conflicts in Iraq and Yugoslavia have posed an increasingly wrenching choice between traditional allies and a longing for a new partnership with Washington and the West.
It is a predicament that has stoked a bitter political struggle at home. Abroad it has made Moscow increasingly sensitive to Washington's intentions and methods abroad and has set the stage for an open dispute over any increase of force against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq or the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 Russia's smoldering annoyance with United States policy broke into the open on Monday, when President Boris N. Yeltsin accused Washington of a tendency to "dictate terms" in regions like Iraq and Yugoslavia and expressed the hope that President Clinton would be more open to a dialogue.
Mr. Yeltsin's comments seemed not only to reflect frustration at being taken for granted by purported "partners" in Washington, about whose strikes on Iraq he learned only from news reports, but also irritation over the ammunition that his many political foes have derived from the air strikes on Iraq and the ostracism of the Serbs.
Mr. Yeltsin said Russia would seek to maintain a "balance of political interests," hinting that he may be moving away from the staunchly pro-Western foreign policy championed by the liberal Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev.
 
New Sharing of Roles
 That impression was strengthened today, when Mr. Yeltsin signed a decree assigning coordination of foreign policy to the Security Council, which includes military and security officials in addition to the Foreign Minister. Three months ago Mr. Yeltsin assigned the leadership role in foreign policy to the Foreign Ministry.
According to Russian officials and Western diplomats, however, the actions were probably not so much a turn against Washington as they were more of the vacillations that have marked Russia's foreign relations as a result of the bitter institutional and political struggles over what place Russia should seek in the post-Communist world.
The vacillations have not been limited to Russia. The United States and the West also have yet to sort out the complexities of a world suddenly wrenched from the rigid discipline of two power centers.
If the collapse of the Soviet Union initially seemed to promise a "new world order" supervised in partnership by East and West, the reality has been an eruption of pent-up feuds and a multiplication of new challenges. Yugoslavia would never have indulged in internal feuds as long as it feared for its tenuous neutrality between East and West, and the United States would not have dared bomb Iraq as long as it was in the Soviet sphere of influence.
 
'New Thinking' by Gorbachev
 It was also inevitable that the loss of influence and power would be bitterly resisted by those who took pride or drew sustenance from Soviet might like generals, Communist stalwarts and military contractors.
The struggle began long before the collapse of the Soviet Union, when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev proclaimed a "new thinking" in foreign policy and pulled Moscow away from the arms race, East Europe and Afghanistan. Already die-hard Communists inveighed against what they perceived as surrender to the ideological foe.
In the first action against Iraq two years ago, Mr. Gorbachev took an ambivalent stance, backing the American-led alliance while sending a personal ally on an independent and ultimately futile mediating mission.
With the disintegration of the Soviet state, Mr. Yeltsin proclaimed principles that went beyond Mr. Gorbachev's, seeking rapid integration into the institutions of the "civilized" world, partnership with the United States and a military doctrine of "minimum sufficiency." He named as Foreign Minister Mr. Kozyrev, who sought from the outset to link Russia's foreign policy to Washington and the West.
 
New Muddle Injected
 But instead of uniting behind the new policy, Russia fell into an even angrier debate. The rise of 14 neighbors out of the former Soviet republics, all confused, bankrupt and ambitious, injected a new foreign-policy muddle that neither Moscow nor any of the other republics has sorted out.
Beyond the new cordon, there were equally perplexing and often humiliating questions. Was Russia the successor to Soviet superpower and strategic interests or was it simply a bankrupt landmass saddled with a defunct empire's missiles? Was it moving toward rapid integration in the democratic, market-oriented West or was it fated to remain aside, a vast land ever balanced between East and West but part of neither? What was Russia's "national interest" in the new world? Was it necessary or useful to maintain strategic parity with the United States?
There were other questions. In the absence of Communist control, who ran foreign policy? Furious turf battles broke out almost from the outset. The Foreign Ministry, the Parliament, Mr. Yeltsin's aides, the military and other institutions plunged into the fray, accusing one another of surrendering Russia's interests, of plotting fascist coups and of kowtowing to America.
It was inevitable that Yugoslavia and Iraq, and relations with the United States, would become major battlegrounds.
 
The Washington Romp
 It was not so much that Russia's "national patriots" were enflamed by sympathy for their fellow Orthodox Slavs in the Balkans or for a wily former arms client in the Middle East. It was more the sense of humiliation in the spectacle of Moscow's currying favor with the West while Washington was romping around the world without any regard for Moscow's traditional ties or sensitivites.
Not only the hard-liners were irritated. A proud man who put great stock in having Russia treated as a great power, Mr. Yeltsin also gave hints before this week of his resentment. Many mainstream politicians and academics joined in urging a more conservative foreign policy than Mr. Kozyrev was espousing, especially when it became evident that the United States was not rushing to embrace Russia or to shower it with investment and aid.
In the Parliament and in the press, the polemics often became frenzied. Last month Mr. Kozyrev gave an extraordinary speech to a stunned international forum in Stockholm in which he compiled the demands of the hard-liners into what he pretended was his own position.
The Parliament, for its part, has assailed Mr. Kozyrev at every opportunity. On the far right, the newspaper Den has mercilessly criticized Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Kozyrev and their "occupation regime."
In its current issue Den published what it said was a transcript of private conversations between President Bush and Mr. Yeltsin at their meeting in Moscow on Jan. 3 under the headline "Your Commands Have Been Fulfilled, Mr. Bush." Among the passages that the newspaper underlined as especially onerous was one in which Mr. Yeltsin said to Mr. Bush, "You asked that we keep Kozyrev in place, and we met your request."
In the political center, meanwhile, the notion is taking hold that in foreign policy, as in politics and economics, Russia will have to sort out its own priorities and problems before it can expect to join the "civilized world." It will also have to be more cautious, as the United States and the West determine their courses.
At the low-key start of a USA-Russia Foundation to promote understanding, the director, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, once Mr. Gorbachev's partner in perestroika, declared that it was for Russia to sort out whether its national interests lay with the United States, with Europe or in a balance between East and West. For the present, he said, "we need to watch carefully the development of the new administration in the U.S."

HEADLINE: Israel Rejects U.N. Chief's Proposals on Deportees

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Israel, edging closer to a confrontation with the United Nations, today angrily rejected Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's recommendation for Security Council measures to force the return of roughly 400 Palestinians deported to Lebanon six weeks ago.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, responding to Mr. Boutros-Ghali's move, accused the Secretary General of employing a double standard by "completely ignoring extremist Islamic terrorism" that he said had made the deportations necessary. 
 Other senior officials reacted sharply to a proposal by Mr. Boutros-Ghali for United Nations' monitoring Israel's treatment of the 1.8 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. That was not needed, the Foreign Ministry said, because under international law, responsibility for the Palestinians' "safety, peace and welfare" fell to Israel as the ruling power in the territories.
 Although the Rabin Government struck a combative stance, it was clear that it had lost ground in its fight to head off sanctions for violating Security Council Resolution 799. Approved unanimously on Dec. 18, it demands the return of the hundreds of expelled Islamic fundamentalists and sympathizers.
 
Report on Monday
 Hoping to buy time, the Government has also urged all parties to do nothing until after the High Court of Justice here decides whether the deportations were legal, a ruling that is expected this week. Israeli newspapers have speculated about possible compromises that would shorten the announced exile of up to two years, but all actions have been delayed until the court acts.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali, who gave a report of his findings to the Council late Monday night, did not recommend specific measures against Israel. But some officials here expect the next move to be a United Nations timetable to return the Palestinians from their tent camp in southern Lebanon. The move may be accompanied, they say, by a threat of sanctions, which Israel has never had to face despite having flouted many Council resolutions.
As in the past, the Israelis are counting on the United States to stand by them, even though the United States, too, had voted for Resolution 799, which called the deportations a breach of international law, specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.
The Israelis were encouraged today when the American Ambassador, William C. Harrop, said in a radio interview that it was "most unlikely that the United States would want to see sanctions" imposed. But Mr. Harrop quickly added: "We've not used our veto for two years. We don't want to do that, either."
 
Reluctance to Exercise Veto
 The Ambassador said the Clinton Administration wished "to continue a very close relationship with Israel."
Mr. Rabin echoed those sentiments, telling a parliamentary committee: "Until now, no American Administration has allowed sanctions against the State of Israel. I hope this will continue."
From Mr. Harrop's remarks, it seems that Washington wants the deportation crisis to be resolved before it is forced to choose between voting against Israel and exercising its veto in the Council, an action that has gone out of fashion as the United Nations has become an important vehicle for American foreign policy.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali's report caught the Israelis somewhat off guard. Not that it was a complete surprise, especially after three missions by United Nations emissaries had failed to budge Mr. Rabin from his positions that the expulsions stand and that to bring the exiles back now would be to hand a victory to his primary target, the Hamas group of militant fundamentalists.
The Secretary General warned that the Israeli refusal challenged the Security Council's authority. And he seemed to endorse the arguments of Arab states and some other countries that a double standard had been created in the way resolutions against Iraq were enforced, but not those against Israel.
In the last few days Israel has turned the double-standard argument around, saying that it is the victim, because the United Nations and other international bodies have solely condemned the deportations, and not the Hamas violence that led to them, including the killing of Israeli servicemen in December.
"They are completely ignoring extremist Islamic terrorism, completely ignoring the aim of this terrorism to bring about the end of the peace process," Mr. Rabin said. "The report is an example of double standards." The demand that the Security Council adopt new measures, he said, was almost unprecedented.
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said, "If the United Nations wants to control Israel, it must answer how they're going to control the dangers which are facing Israel." Mr. Peres repeated warnings that stern action against Israel could imperil the peace talks by forcing the Arabs into added hard-line positions. But Mr. Boutros-Ghali's report quoted a United Nations emissary, Chinmaya Gharekhan, as having said Israel would be responsible if the talks broke down.

Chrysler stock is on the rise despite threat of dilution.

BYLINE: By Doron P. Levin

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THE Chrysler Corporation's rebound has been nowhere more evident than in the vitality of its common stock. The shares rose steadily in the last week despite the auto maker's decision to try to raise perhaps as much as $1.5 billion by offering 40 million new shares.
Although the new common stock would cause a 12 percent dilution for current holders of Chrysler stock, and after an initial drop in price following the announcement, the shares closed yesterday at $40 each, up 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. That compares with $36 before the announcement on Jan.11. 
 From Main Street to Wall Street, Chrysler is being applauded as an ugly duckling-turned-swan. After years of producing mediocre cars, a period when the mini-van was Chrysler's mainstay, a parade of hits has suddenly arrived: the Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicle, the L/H midsize sedans and the new Dodge Ram pickup, which isn't in production yet but attracted effusive praise from reviewers at the North American International Auto Show early this month.
According to Zack's Investment Research, among 19 analysts, 11 rated Chrysler a strong or moderately strong buy, 7 were neutral and only one recommended selling.
For investors, the relevant question is: Can Chrysler shares go much higher? Automotive analysts won't discuss this question for the record, since most brokerage firms are part of -- or wish to be included in -- the syndicate that will sell Chrysler's new shares within a few weeks.
 However, trading by the auto maker's top officers, which is reported publicly under Federal securities law, shows that Chrysler officers were invariably sellers as the stock climbed from $20 to $30 a share during the summer and fall.
That could show that officers believe the company's fortunes have peaked. David Coleman of the Vicker's Stock Research Corporation in Washington, D.C., calls insider selling "a reliable indicator that share prices are peaking or leveling off."
However, because of Chrysler's poor financial performance "executives haven't had bonuses in three years," said Arthur C. Liebler, Chrysler's vice president for public relations, who was among the sellers. He said most of the sales were connected to exercise of executive stock options, which previously were "under water" because Chrysler's share price was low.
In any case, most financial analysts have been watching the reception of Chrysler's new models, recognizing the company's limited exposure in the deteriorating European market, factoring in the slowly strengthening economy and raising their estimates of 1993 earnings.
Still, Chrysler faces risks. First is the state of the economy and economic components like employment and personal income, whose weakness could choke off the slow but steady recovery in automotive demand since October.
Second is the auto maker's financial condition, which is better than it has been for several years but is still weak. The credit rating agencies expect Chrysler to use some of the proceeds from the stock offering to cut back its $4 billion unfunded pension liability.
Finally, because so much is riding on the L/H sedans, Chrysler must avoid any problems like those that occurred early in 1991 with the Ultradrive transmission, resulting in a warning against Chrysler vehicles from Consumers Union. The L/H already has experienced some minor glitches, like the failure to install antilock brakes in some cars in which the equipment was ordered and paid for by customers.

HEADLINE: $15 Billion Jobs Effort Is Called Likely

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, confronting a new round of huge layoffs in some leading American industries, said today that the President was likely to propose $15 billion to $20 billion in additional Federal spending this year to stimulate job growth.
Since the election Mr. Clinton's economic advisers have been debating how much new spending and what tax credits they should propose to create jobs and how that increased spending should be coupled with longer-term measures to shrink the budget deficit. 
 In the campaign Mr. Clinton and his advisers talked about a stimulus in the range of $20 billion to $30 billion. But since the election there has been pressure from some quarters to raise that figure and, from others, to lower it.
Some of the more liberal economists close to Mr. Clinton, like the Nobel laureate James Tobin, have advocated $60 billion in increased spending. Other advisers, pointing to signs of recovery and estimates of bigger deficits than expected, have suggested reducing the stimulus or foregoing it altogether.
Mr. Clinton himself has been very careful not to tip his hand. But in the most clear indication yet of the shape of the new Administration's economic package, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview on the ABC News program "Good Morning America" today that there would probably be a stimulus package and that it would probably be "in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion."
Mr. Reich acknowledged that this was a rather paltry figure in the context of a $6 trillion economy, but he insisted that it would have an important psychological impact, sending "a very clear signal that we have got to get the growth back."
It would also be a signal to the financial markets, though, that the new Democratic Administration intends to be restrained in spending on jobs, so that the deficit is not seriously aggravated or inflation spurred in ways that could frighten the bond markets.
Both Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the budget director, Leon E. Panetta, have urged a modest stimulus package, and their advice seems to have won the day. The package will probably consist of accelerated Government spending on highway, rail and fiber-optic projects, plus investment tax credits for companies spending on new equipment.
 
No Jobs, No Recovery
 "On the job front, we still have a problem, and we can't have a genuine recovery, a real booming, buoyant recovery, until we get those jobs back, so we may have to have a little bit of a stimulus," Mr. Reich said. "But in the longer term, that is, beginning next year right on through 1997, we are going to have to tackle the budget deficit and also public investment. Those are the twin deficits that President Clinton has promised the American public we are going to tackle, and we will be tackling them."
Mr. Reich's remarks, which appeared to be calculated to see how Wall Street and businesses react to the modest stimulus numbers, were immediately reinforced at the noon briefing by George Stephanopoulos, the White House Communications director.
He confirmed that the Administration would offer a stimulus package, but he said it was likely to be even a little higher than the figures mentioned by the Labor Secretary. Mr. Stephanopoulos said the full package would be outlined by Mr. Clinton in his State of the Union Message on Feb. 17.
A senior Administration economic official said Mr. Clinton was opting for a modest stimulus, as opposed to either a large one or none at all, for three main reasons.
First, he said, is the fact that while the economy now appears to be recovering to some degree on its own, without any additional Government help, it is a "jobless recovery." Unemployment, which was at 7.3 percent in December, has actually gone up as the recession has ended. This state of affairs was underscored this week when a string of corporate titans, including Sears, I.B.M., Boeing and United Technologies, all announced large-scale layoffs for 1993.
The second reason, the official said, was a fear that even the current recovery is more of a "feel good" recovery. Consumers have increased their spending in the hope that the new President will turn the economy around, but it is money taken from their savings, not from higher incomes. This increase in spending could turn out to be short-lived unless industry starts investing more money in new plants or equipment and creating large numbers of jobs.
The third reason was called insurance. Even if there is only a 25 percent to 30 percent chance of the economy slipping back into recession, the official said, $20 billion in additional Government spending right now, even at the cost of a higher deficit, is a small price to pay to insure against that.
In addition, the official observed, the financial markets have come to expect some sort of stimulus, and if the Administration retreated from that idea entirely it could create a lot of negative expectations.

HEADLINE: Clinton Choice for Latin Post Stirs Feud Between 2 Groups

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Early indications that the Clinton Administration was moving to select a Cuban-American lawyer for the State Department's senior Latin America post have provoked a bitter fight between two constituencies the Clinton Administration had hoped to please with the nomination: Cuban-Americans and blacks.
For the last week, the formal nomination of Mario L. Baeza, a Wall Street lawyer who has specialized in privatization in Latin America, has been held up by the protests of conservative Miami-based Cuban-American groups, backed by influential Democratic lawmakers, who say they suspect Mr. Baeza of softness toward the Government of Fidel Castro. 
 After having reportedly been the only person interviewed for the job of Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, the candidacy of Mr. Baeza, a Cuban-born American who is black, collided with the strenuous objections of Cuban-American lobbyists, supported by members of Congress from New Jersey and Florida.
 
Name Dropped From List
 On the eve of Mr. Clinton's inauguration, Mr. Baeza's candidacy appeared doomed when his name was crossed out on a list sent to Congress of Clinton Administration appointees to senior State Department positions. The Bush Administration's appointee, Bernard W. Aronson, remains on the job.
But in the last several days a defense of Mr. Baeza has been mounted by black lawmakers who have expressed resentment for the treatment of the 42-year-old lawyer. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has written the Clinton Administration in support of Mr. Baeza's candidacy, have angrily denounced assertions that the lawyer is a sympathizer of Mr. Castro.
"We have to appeal to the Clinton Administration to explain to us why this guy is not acceptable," Rep. Charles B. Rangel said. "If there is some flaw in his credentials, tell us. If not, put the nomination forward and let the man be heard."
Opponents of Mr. Baeza's candidacy have cited a half-day trip to Cuba he took last July to participate in a seminar on Cuba's fledgling efforts to privatize parts of its economy as evidence of Mr. Baeza's softness toward Havana.
"According to participants, he spoke openly about promoting American investment in Cuba," said Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey.
Mr. Baeza has declined to speak directly about his candidacy, but on Monday, he denied the allegations.
"My purpose in attending that meeting was seeing how soon Castro is going to fall, what are the consequences and whether the privatizations there involving Spain, Italy and France had had any success," he said. The seminar was attended by executives from many United States corporations.
Since Mr. Baeza's name was scratched from the list of nominees sent to Congress, Clinton Administration officials have declined to speak about him. But Administration officials say that attention has turned to another candidate for the job, Sally Shelton Colby. Mrs. Colby, who is white, is a specialist in Latin American affairs and a former ambassador to the Eastern Caribbean under the Carter Administration.

Drug Giants Show Gains In Earnings

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Two large drug companies, Merck and Warner-Lambert, announced double-digit earnings growth yesterday, but investors seemed preoccupied with national trends that may limit future pharmaceutical profits. Drug stock prices have been declining on reports that the Clinton Administration expects to produce a national health-care program by May.
Trying to stave off price controls, Merck and eight other drug companies -- not including Warner-Lambert -- have promised to limit their increases to the general inflation rate. Industry executives told the Clinton transition team that drugs should be included in a standard health package for American families. But some companies remain wary of proposals that might involve deep discounts for elderly Medicare patients, who buy 40 percent of prescription drugs. 
 Merck & Company, based in White House Station, N.J., said earnings rose 17 percent, to $618.9 million, in the fourth quarter of 1992, before noncash accounting charges. After the charges, earnings in the quarter were up 15 percent, compared with the comparable period a year earlier.
 
 
Full-Year Earnings
 Profit for all of 1992 was down by 6 percent, after the charges, which recognized future health-care and disability costs and made a change in tax accounting. It was Merck's first decline in 12-month earnings since it was hit by unfavorable foreign exchange developments in 1981.
Merck sales increased 12 percent in the quarter, to $2.6 billion, from $2.31 billion in the 1991 period. Earnings per share were 53 cents, up from 46 cents.
The company told analysts that earnings would rise by 14 percent to 16 percent in 1993, down slightly from last year's 17 percent growth. Neil B. Sweig at Capital Institutional Services in New York said the costs of promoting Proscar, Merck's new prostate treatment, might be $150 million by December. But he said Proscar could have $250 million in 1993 sales, up from $55 million last year.
 
Warner-Lambert
 The Warner-Lambert Company, based in Morris Plains, N.J., which had made similar accounting changes in 1991, said earnings in the quarter increased 14 percent, to $138 million, excluding the one-time charges a year earlier. Sales were a record $1.47 billion.
Quarterly earnings per share rose 13 percent, to $1.02, compared with 90 cents in the final three months of 1991.
Warner-Lambert said sales increased 11 percent, to a record $5.6 billion for all of last year.

Northern Telecom's Earnings Increase 23%

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Partly by taking business away from A.T.& T. and other telecommunications rivals, Northern Telecom of Canada was able to report a 23 percent gain in fourth-quarter earnings, to $255.6 million, or $1.02 a share. Quarterly revenue rose 10 percent, to $2.54 billion, from $2.306 billion a year ago. All figures are in United States dollars.
"We've been gaining market share from many of our competitors," Paul G. Stern, Northern Telecom's chairman and chief executive, said . 
 For years, Northern Telecom had been an also-ran in the sale of telecommunications equipment to the world's telephone companies. Its rival equipment manufacturer, A.T.& T., dominated North America; Alcatel of France and Siemens of Germany led Europe; Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and its longtime suppliers had locked up Japan.
But as the company helped pioneer new versions of switching equipment, the huge computers that route millions of telephone calls a day, its business has prospered. Northern Telecom is the leading supplier of fully digital telephone switches.
Sales of such equipment began to take off as the world's telephone carriers, especially those of the United States, switched to digital machines.
Increasing privatization also helped. In the United States, carriers like MCI, rivals to American Telephone and Telegraph, made it a practice of buying non-A.T.& T. equipment. In Europe, because A.T.& T.'s main business is selling long-distance telephone calls in competition with European carriers, these phone companies have also tended to buy from non-A.T.& T. vendors.
As a result, Northern Telecom has prospered despite a dour world economy. Four years ago, the company's business outside North America was only 8 percent; today, the proportion is 25 percent.
Northern Telecom said that some business was drummed up with discounts. "Although competitive pricing pressures in our central office switching business led to lower gross profit margins," the company said in a statement, "we were able to offset this with cost controls."

HEADLINE: Data Show Region's Slump Among the Worst in the U.S.

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
With their economies battered by some of the worst construction slumps in the nation and the loss of thousands of armaments jobs, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York have been among the slowest states to recover from the recession, according to figures released today by the Commerce Department.
The statistics for total personal income showed Connecticut making the poorest showing in the region, with 3.2 percent growth over the 18 months that the nation was pulling out of the recession. 
 That placed the state 48th nationally; only Florida and Hawaii fared worse, and officials attributed their low numbers to major storms late last year.
Avice Meehan, a spokeswoman for Connecticut's Governor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., said the numbers squared with their expectations. "I don't know if it would take a rocket scientist to predict that this was the case," she said.
New York ranked 39th nationally, with 3.9 percent growth in personal income, while New Jersey was 41st with 3.8 percent.
 
Slower Than Annual Rates
 Nationally, incomes grew at an annual rate of 4.4 percent from the first quarter of 1991, the low point of the recession, through last September, when figures showed that the recovery was fully under way.
Nationwide, prices rose at an annual rate of 3.2 percent during the six-quarter recovery period.
Personal income is the income received by people from all sources before the deduction of income taxes and other taxes. Therefore, it is a reliable and highly accurate gauge of an economy's performance. Federal and state governments use the figures to forecast income and to help develop their budgets.
Montana led the nation with a 7.3 percent growth rate in personal income.
The New England region, which includes Connecticut, and the Mideast region, which includes New York and New Jersey, were rated at the bottom in income growth at 4.0 and 3.6 percent respectively.
 
Problems Facing Connecticut
 Connecticut's problems are two-fold, the report said.
It is in one of the regions hardest hit by the recession -- which Federal officials say began in July 1990 and ended eight months later in March 1991. And cutbacks in military spending forced thousands of layoffs by some of the state's biggest employers, including a new round today at Pratt & Whitney.
In per-capita income, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York are among the wealthiest states in the nation. The annual per-capita income figures, determined by dividing a state's total personal income by the total population, are expected to be released in April. In recent years, Connecticut and New Jersey have finished first and second in per-capita income, masking the economic turmoil evident in today's report.
"They are affluent states, but that does not mean that there is no poverty," said Ms. Meehan, Governor Weicker's spokeswoman. "No single number tells an entire story."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
I.B.M. TO REPLACE ITS TOP EXECUTIVE

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. announced yesterday that it was starting a search to replace its chief executive, John F. Akers, within three months. The company also cut its dividend payments to shareholders for the first time in its 79-year history, reducing the quarterly payout to 54 cents from $1.21.
The moves, coming just a week after the International Business Machines Corporation reported the largest yearly loss in corporate history, are a recognition of the deep troubles at the world's largest computer company and its need for new leadership. 
 The pressure on Mr. Akers had been mounting for months, with large institutional shareholders became increasingly outspoken as they watched I.B.M.'s share price drop to half what it had been in the summer. Business magazines including Business Week, Fortune and The Economist called on Mr. Akers to step down. Rumors about his departure swirled daily within I.B.M.
 
Some Elements of Surprise
 Still, the timing of the announcement surprised many analysts and its details were a well-kept secret, especially for a company that has a sizable cottage industry of people who follow it, including many former I.B.M. executives. The plan for Mr. Akers to step down came together fairly quickly, although he had discussed it for weeks with a few board members, according to one outside director.
A small group of executives worked on the particulars over the weekend, and Mr. Akers formally presented the plan to the 18-member board on Monday during a two-day board meeting at I.B.M.'s former headquarters building in Manhattan, at 590 Madison Avenue.
There was "spirited debate" at the meeting, James E. Burke, an outside director and a retired chairman of Johnson & Johnson, said in an interview. But that debate, he added, was mainly about details of the proposal, which he declined to discuss, not about whether Mr. Akers should go.
"The basic decision was his, and it was made in consultation with the board," Mr. Burke said. "This wasn't a board room coup or anything like that."
Most analysts say that given recent events, Mr. Akers would have had to step down, with only the timing in question. "Akers recognized reality," said Dan Mandresh, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company. "There's no way he could have withstood the pressure for long."
The transition plan calls for a new chief executive to be named within 90 days. Mr. Akers will remain as chairman and chief executive during the selection process. But the choice will be made by a committee of outside directors, headed by Mr. Burke.
After a new chief executive is selected, Mr. Akers could stay on as chairman, a company spokesman said. But analysts and management experts say that seems unlikely because the board approved other changes yesterday that essentially clears out the top management team that Mr. Akers has headed.
Jack D. Kuehler, the president, will move out of that position to become a vice chairman and remain on the board. Frank A. Metz Jr., a senior vice president and chief financial officer, will resign in February. He will be replaced by Paul J. Rizzo, a one-time rival of Mr. Akers for the chief executive slot, who was called back to I.B.M. last month from his post as the dean of the University of North Carolina's graduate school of business.
 
Once a Model Company
 Mr. Akers, 59, became I.B.M.'s chief executive in 1985 at a time when the company dominated the world computer industry and its management was viewed as a business-school model of excellence. But its prowess and its image have deteriorated considerably. It has struggled, often unsuccessfully, to keep up with the pace of innovation in the fast-changing computer industry.
The company has particularly lagged in adjusting to the shift by its corporate customers away from big mainframe computers, I.B.M.'s traditional strength, and toward less expensive but increasingly powerful small machines, personal computers and work stations. Consequently, it saw more and more business slip away to personal computer makers like Apple, Compaq and Dell, and work station producers like Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard.
Mr. Akers came from the mainframe marketing side of the business, and critics say he and his team were slow to recognize the changes in the industry. Still, Mr. Akers did oversee a drastic streamlining of the company, cutting the work force from more than 400,000 people to 300,000 by the end of last year. He also tried to make the company more flexible and quick on its feet with a sweeping overhaul in late 1991, dividing the company into 13 businesses.
Yet the changes, though dramatic by I.B.M. standards, have not proved enough to stop the company's slippage. Last week, I.B.M. reported a loss in 1992 of $4.97 billion, though much of that was from huge accounting charges related to the efforts to cut the work force and streamline operations. Its stock price has fallen from about $100 a share in the summer to $48.875 yesterday, up 12.5 cents for the day.
"I.B.M. recognized some time ago the need for genuine change, and it just couldn't make it happen," said Jon Katzenbach, a director of McKinsey & Company. "It's a classic example of how difficult it is to change the practices and behavior in huge organizations."
The choice of Mr. Akers's replacement will be crucial for I.B.M.'s future. The board's nominating and executive compensation committee, headed by Mr. Burke, is just beginning that process and it says it will consider both I.B.M. insiders and people from outside the company.
Management experts say that the board must either choose an outsider or some younger member of the I.B.M. management corps who is not steeped in company traditions, a bit of a maverick.
"To come back, I.B.M. has to change its culture," said John Kotter, a professor at the Harvard Business School. "And the only way to do that is with truly new leadership, someone not wedded to the old ways."
In a statement and in an internal memo to company employees, Mr. Akers seemed to concede that point. In both, he stressed the achievements during his eight-year tenure, notably the reorganizing and streamlining of the company. Yet, he said in his statement, "It is the right time in I.B.M.'s business transformation to identify new leadership."
Under normal circumstances, Mr. Akers, who turned 59 last month, would have retired a year from now at age 60, the traditional retirement point for I.B.M. executives. Like any other retiree, he will receive benefits based on his salary and years of service. According to the company's proxy statement last year, that will be about $1.2 million a year.
Even with that, he has been dealt a double financial blow from the slide in I.B.M.'s stock price. The value of his personal holdings has declined and most of his stock options are probably worthless, since they become valuable only when the stock price rises."

HEADLINE: Canada Seeks an Exemption As U.S. Prepares Steel Duties

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
As the Commerce Department put the finishing touches on preliminary new steel import tariffs, Canadian officials said today that they were attempting to win an exemption for Canadian steel from the Clinton Administration.
Michael Wilson, Canada's Trade Minister, has called Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, to discuss ways to strike a separate deal, the Canadian officials said. The United States is expected to announce tariffs on up to 20 countries, including Canada, on Wednesday. 
 High-profile trade cases like the steel industry's current one are often settled through special deals, as foreign governments bring diplomatic pressure to bear on behalf of their industries. The result is usually a limit on the volume of imports or a minimum price for imports. Such deals deprive the Federal Government of tax revenues but provide some assistance for domestic producers and are less likely to generate consumer anger or a trade war.
 
A Complex Process
 Though the Commerce Department is widely viewed as simply ruling in favor of tariffs or against them, in reality its decision often has little to do with tariffs.
Washington trade experts and the Canadian officials said that Commerce Department civil servants would decide the level of tariffs based on complicated computer models of pricing practices, so that the rulings would not provide any indication of the Clinton Administration's trade policy. Federal trade law specifies the economic variables used in the model, but the civil servants have some discretion in whether they choose the importer's statistics for these variables or the domestic industry's statistics.
Political appointees can strongly influence the outcome of the computer models by ordering the civil servants who operate the computers to make certain choices about which statistics are used. But Mr. Brown, a former lawyer and lobbyist, has not yet assembled a team of subordinates with the experience in trade cases to make such decisions.
The Clinton Administration will have a chance to put its stamp on the steel case in June, when Federal law requires it to complete a review of the preliminary tariffs and decide whether to make them permanent. The preliminary tariffs can be paid by posting a bond that is forfeited if the tariffs become permanent.
 
Canada's Reasoning
 The Canadian officials said that their industry deserved separate treatment because of its close integration with American producers.
The domestic steel industry has forced the Commerce Department to review whether tariffs are necessary by filing a series of legal complaints at the department last summer. The complaints charged that foreign countries were violating Federal law by subsidizing steel shipments to the United States and by selling flat-rolled and plate steel in the United States for less than they charged in their home markets.
The Commerce Department levied preliminary import tariffs averaging 12.5 percent in November in response to the subsidy cases, and is expected to levy preliminary tariffs averaging up to 25 percent on Wednesday in the underpricing cases.
The domestic auto industry is preparing similar cases charging that foreign auto makers sell cars in the United States for less than they charge in their home markets. Such cases are commonly filed when industries think that the economy is improving because the cases require an ailing domestic industry to prove that imports are a significant cause of its troubles.

HEADLINE: The Gloom Deepens As Layoffs Increase;
More Job Losses at Pratt & Whitney

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 26

 BODY:
Pratt & Whitney's decision to shrink its Connecticut work force by one-third during the next two years promises to ricochet through an economy already battered by deep cuts in military spending and layoffs in the insurance industry. It will also mow down, at least for now, the hope for recovery from one of the worst local recessions in the nation, economists said.
But what has dampened spirits even more is that Pratt & Whitney, the state's largest private employer, had been seen as a leader among military contractors in reducing its dependence on Government contracts.
 
Away From the Military
 As military orders for jet engines declined with the end of the cold war, falling from a high of 800 a year in the early 1980's to 80 this year, Pratt & Whitney had sought to insulate itself by relying more heavily on sales to airlines. Dependence on the Pentagon fell from 50 percent of all sales through the last few decades to only 30 percent last year. 
 A steep drop in orders from the airlines has now dashed that plan, and with it the hopes of thousands of workers and their families.
Twice last year the company had announced layoff and reorganization plans that it said would solve its problems. Of the 6,700 job cuts announced today, 1,800 were included in those earlier plans and will take effect at the end of this month.
From the plant gate here to the State Capitol in Hartford, where Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. called for reregulating the airline industry to forestall further job losses, it was a day of anxieties, and suspicions that worse might still be ahead.
"Within the next two to three years, are we going to hear that they have to still cut more?" said Andrew D. Romegialli, a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 10,105 Pratt & Whitney workers.
Mr. Romegialli said that while the falloff in commercial orders was real, the company also had a hidden agenda to move jobs out of the United States and into cheaper foreign labor markets. "They should just be up front and tell everybody what's happening," he said.
Edward J. Deak, an economist at Fairfield University, said he was troubled by the announcement for two reasons: first, because he believes it will push back into late 1993 or 1994 the modest economic rebound he had forecast for Connecticut, and second, because the layoffs -- unlike corporate reorganization plans aimed at cutting middle management -- are being driven by a shrinking business.
"This is not a series of labor-force cutbacks forced by efficiency," he said. "What we're seeing is a decline in the demand for the products: engines, engine parts. We've got a different kind of animal here and probably in some ways a more serious problem."
Governor Weicker, who said he was briefed by company officials on Monday night and again this morning, said he thought that the region's entire aerospace industry was threatened.
"This is an aerospace-industry problem, and make no mistake about it, it's a statewide problem," Mr. Weicker said. "You're not just talking Pratt. You're talking the hundreds of subcontractors, and they're the greatest concern to me, throughout the state of Connecticut that are dependent on a healthy aerospace industry."
Pratt & Whitney, a division of Hartford-based United Technologies Corporation, has operations in East Hartford, Cheshire, Middletown, North Haven, Southington and Rocky Hill.
Outside the plant in North Haven, today's announcement deepened the malaise and uncertainty created by earlier layoffs. Many former Pratt workers said they could not find jobs that came close to paying as much as Pratt & Whitney. Many expressed hopes that they still might be called back to work at the plant.
"I've got two kids and a house," said one laid-off worker who is 35 years old and had worked at Pratt & Whitney for nine years. "I am looking for work, but if they offer you something for $5 or $6 an hour, you have to tell them no. You have to look for at least $10 an hour, something you have a chance to grow with. It's depressing, having to go out and start all over."
He said he would have been willing to take a pay cut to keep his job.
"These layoffs could have been avoided if they'd made a shorter work week or had furloughs. The company should have asked the employees, 'What can we do?' I think the company is putting profits before people. They're losing a lot of good help."
Claude Hanson, the bartender at Wallabies Cafe on Washington Avenue, said his daytime business is down since the layoffs last year.
"People don't have the money to spend anymore," he said. "We've served sandwiches here, but now the workers are bringing their lunches in with them instead of going out. Every package store from the North Haven Green all the way up to Wallingford has lost business because of Pratt."
Frank Porto, who owns Aircraft Package Store, directly across the street from Pratt & Whitney's North Haven entrance, said: "We're all holding on for dear life. On Washington Avenue, one deli has closed and two gas stations. When layoffs happen, everybody suffers. The Pratt guys who are still there, they are not jubilant anymore. Any moment they could walk in and find a notice on the bulletin board or a foreman might come up and say to them, 'Look, you've had it.'
At the headquarters of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local 707, near the plant's entrance, laid-off workers studied the bulletin board, which listed the names of employees who had recently been laid off. "I've been looking, but nobody pays," said one of the men, who until his October layoff had been making $13 an hour at Pratt & Whitney. "Somebody wants to pay you $8 or $9, you can't live on that, not in this state."
Nancy Waters, business agent for the union, said the mood in the plant and the union hall was "disheartening."
She said, "When people hear that the company is downsizing by another 6,700 people, they don't know where all those people will come from."

HEADLINE: Congress to Tell Greenspan To Keep Interest Rates Low

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
With economic growth finally picking up and short-term interest rates at their lowest level in three decades, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, might expect to be hugged when he testifies before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday.
He would be wiser to expect to be mugged. 
 Angry at the slowness with which the central bank has cut interest rates, Congressional lawmakers say they will warn Mr. Greenspan to keep rates low now so as not to block President Clinton's attempt to engineer a strong recovery.
Federal Reserve officials "say they're worried about inflation, but at the moment the more pressing issue is jobs and economic growth," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat who is vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
"Any notion that they would raise interest rates would be completely inappropriate," he said. "My own view is they should ease monetary policy further."
 
Blocking for Clinton
 By throwing some elbows at the Fed, Democrats in Congress appear to be running interference for President Clinton and possibly saving him the trouble of having to do some Fed-bashing of his own.
For his part, Mr. Greenspan is expected to sound an accommodating note when he appears Wednesday before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress and Thursday before the Senate Budget Committee.
Judging from interviews with other central bank officials, Mr. Greenspan is expected to say the Fed can live with a small, one-year increase in deficit spending in the $20 billion range.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said today that "it's very likely there will be a stimulus package." Appearing on ABC's "Good Morning America," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said the stimulus package would probably be "in the range of $15 billion to $20 billion."
But the Fed chairman will probably caution Mr. Clinton against too much stimulus. Fed officials fear that inflation could be reignited if there is a large stimulus package, perhaps $60 billion, and if it kicks in six months from now when growth might be stronger.
Mr. Greenspan and other Fed officials appear ready to go along with a modest stimulus package because they worry that economic growth does not have a strong foundation. Federal Reserve governors say the slowdowns in Europe and Japan could undermine the nation's recovery by hurting American exports. And they worry that the debt burdens weighing on American businesses and households are slowing growth, although those burdens are less strong than the 50-mile-an-hour tailwind that Mr. Greenspan described last year.
Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, angrily criticized the Fed today for cutting interest rates too slowly in recent years and causing the recovery from recession to be so anemic. "Over the past three years, the Federal Reserve Board wore its monetary policy like a hair shirt." he said.
Mr. Sasser added that as deficit reduction takes center stage "it is critical that we get assurances from the Federal Reserve that the White House and Congress will not be left dangling and twisting in the wind." In Congressional testimony today, Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, seconded that view, saying an easier monetary policy would be needed to offset the recessionary effects of cutting the deficit.
 
How Much Growth?
 When Mr. Greenspan testifies, he is expected to say once again that the Fed is seriously considering whether to lower its targets for money supply growth. In the past, he asserted that this would be a mere technical move that would reduce the target for M-2 -- the most closely watched measure of the money supply -- because less money growth appears to be needed to produce a desired level of economic growth. The current range for M-2 growth is 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent.
Mr. Sasser and Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the House Banking Comittee, have attacked this proposal, saying that if the central bank cuts its money supply targets, that could cause the Fed to raise interest rates sooner than with higher targets. Most economists say that when a central bank reduces its monetary targets, it is also setting lower goals for inflation.
Fed officials appear to be paying more attention to Congressional criticisms this year than last year, fearing that Congressional proposals to reduce the Fed's independence have a better chance of passing under President Clinton than under President Bush.
Mr. Sarbanes is sponsoring a bill that would strip the Federal Reserve's regional bank presidents of their right to vote on the central bank's main policy-setting committee. The 12 regional bank presidents are not nominated by the President, but are selected by bankers and business executives.
Mr. Gonzalez is sponsoring a bill calling for the President to nominate the regional bank presidents and the Senate to confirm them.

HEADLINE: U.S. Suspends Dredging Permit for Newark Bay

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 26

 BODY:
A permit allowing port officials to begin dredging container-ship berths in Newark Bay, a project vital to the survival of waterfront commerce in New York Harbor, was abruptly suspended this month by one Federal agency, only a week after it had been approved by another.
The issue is dioxin contamination in dredged sediment: how much is too much and how can it be disposed of? Until the agencies resolve their differences, officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who have been poised to begin dredging for almost three years, remain mired in frustration. So are many others -- fishermen, environmentalists and officials at other ports -- who see Newark Bay as a test case that could determine how dioxin, a cancer-causing industrial byproduct easily absorbed by fish and wildlife, can be safely dredged and disposed of. 
 The Port Authority, which is the first major port to confront the problem since scientists became aware of it here in the mid-1980's, contends that it has carried out every test and complied with every request of every Government agency during a prolonged hearing process, only to watch its berths in Elizabeth and Newark become so seriously clogged with sediment that some vessels have been forced to call elsewhere.
 
'Sort of the Guinea Pigs'
 "We are sort of the guinea pigs," said Lillian C. Liburdi, director of the port department for the Port Authority. "We're the first port required to go through this process. This delayed us significantly. Ships have chosen to call at other ports first, so a vessel can come in lighter. Some lines are saying that ships are not going out full. It's not a good competitive situation."
Normally, the authority would dredge each year, scooping out silt accumulations of six inches or more and keeping berths at depths of up to 42 feet to accommodate the enormous container ships that are a mainstay of the long-suffering shipping business that has only now begun to stabilize around the container industry.
In the mid-1980's, however, scientists became aware of the presence of dioxin in bay crabs, just down the Passaic River from the shuttered Diamond Shamrock plant that once manufactured the defoliant Agent Orange. When the time came for the port agency to renew its annual dredging request, the familiar search for such poisons as mercury, cadmium and PCB's had been augmented with a need to find out about a fresh and mysterious marine problem: dioxin.
Because testing for dioxin, its effects on ocean life and the development of a program for disposing of contaminated sediment were all relatively new issues, the Port Authority's dredging application, otherwise routine, became a test case that has been watched closely by other ports and scientists everywhere. Even now, the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington is trying to determine how serious a threat dioxin poses to humans, animals and the environment in general. A policy statement, perhaps with new standards for its presence in the environment, is expected in the spring.
 
Permit From Corps
 Eventually, the Port Authority got the go-ahead from the Army Corps of Engineers. But the permit issued by the Corps on Jan. 6 was put on hold by the E.P.A. on Jan. 13. A spokesman for the E.P.A., Herman Phillips, said that the agency had acted because the permit allowed for dredging of far more material than the amount in the original request, made in May 1990.
"Normally, we do act in tandem," he said of the Corps and the E.P.A. "But we had O.K.'d a different set of numbers than what was in the actual permit." The agency asked for additional data on the amount of sediment to be removed, and fresh statistics were delivered to the E.P.A. today.
If the E.P.A. is satisfied with the new figures, a permit could be issued within days. Or the agency could ask for more dioxin testing, delaying the dredging project indefinitely.
While dredging has been blocked for the moment, environmentalists are still calling for more information and more testing before hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of sediment are dug up and carried on barges to a site known as the Mud Dump, a disposal site in 90 feet of water about six miles east of Sandy Hook, N.J.
 
Another Round of Tests?
 The disputed dredging permit calls for removal of up to 500,000 cubic yards of material, not the 200,000 originally requested. If the Port Authority's latest soundings show that the dredged amount will be about the same or registers only a modest increase, the E.P.A. could conceivably grant the permit. But a much larger amount of sediment could set off yet another round of tests for dioxin, and a further delay. Of the 62 berths in Elizabeth and Newark, 29 were to be dredged under the permit being sought. The cost of dredging and dumping would be $5 million.
Not to allow the dumping at all would be unthinkable, said Ms. Liburdi of the Port Authority.
"We really don't have an alternative except for ocean disposal," she said. There are no land sites large enough or impermeable enough for hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of muck.
"Remediation technology would be impossible," she said. "There isn't any technology to handle the Port Authority's volume." The only other known option, building an artificial island, would cost $500 million to $1 billion, she said.
 
Alarm Over Review Process
 Environmentalists and fishermen have watched and participated in the review process with alarm, concerned not only about the standard chosen for gauging contamination but for the way the sediment would be disposed of.
Sarah L. Clark, a staff scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, said she was disappointed with what she called the inability of government agencies to work together.
She said she was not convinced that enough testing had been done on dioxin and marine life to determine whether the sediment could safely be dumped at sea. The test used worms to determine the amount of dioxin absorbed by marine life and the dioxin standard was the same as the New York State standard for dioxin in fish. That standard is 10 parts per trillion.
She also expressed concern with plans for capping the Mud Dump in the Atlantic. Under the plan, clean fill would be poured over the muck, essentially pinning the dioxin in place.
But this will not happen, she said, until all the dredged material is dumped there. "We're not satisfied there won't be exposure to marine organisms."
"This is likely to be the first time that a large dredging project will be permitted, knowing that dioxin is in the sediment," she said. "And if this permit is allowed to go forward under present conditions it will set the stage for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of cubic yards of material to be disposed of at dump sites. That's a grave concern considering the natural resources and the economics that are at stake."

HEADLINE: 2 Candidates for Governor to Pay Back Taxes for Aliens

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Saying they want to move ahead with their campaigns, two Republicans who hope to be governor announced today that they have agreed to pay back taxes for hiring illegal aliens.
Christine Todd Whitman said her payments would total $22,694 for Social Security and unemployment taxes to the Federal Government and the state of New Jersey for employing two undocumented workers for three and a half years to take care of her children. 
 She said $14,467 was paid today to the Internal Revenue Service. A check for $8,227 will be delivered to state tax officials on Wednesday, she said. Campaign officials said penalties and interest would be paid when they are determined by the tax agencies.
The second candidate, W. Cary Edwards, a former state attorney general, said he intends to make a payment totaling $2,820 to cover Social Security and state and Federal unemployment insurance taxes for employing a Portuguese woman without residency status as a housekeeper for about 18 months.
 
Additional Fines
 Both candidates could face additional fines from the Immigration and Naturalization Service if they are found guilty of breaking Federal law. John Gershkoff, who heads the New Jersey region's investigations unit for the immigration service, said today that the Whitman and Edwards cases were being reviewed.
Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Edwards disclosed their employment of illegal aliens on Friday following the furor over President Clinton's nomination of Zoe Baird as attorney general. Ms. Baird, who admitted that she and her husband employed illegal aliens to care for their son, withdrew her nomination.
Mrs. Whitman, who plans to announce formally her candidacy for governor on Wednesday, said she hoped the payment would "put these matters behind me." But she acknowledged that she did not believe the issue would go away.
"It's always going to be there, and it will be part of how people view me," Mrs. Whitman said. "But there are other things, such as the issues of the campaign. I expect this will be fully aired again, and I am willing to discuss it."
Mr. Edwards, whose admission of hiring an illegal alien came four hours after Mrs. Whitman's disclosure, said he would make the $2,820 payment "in order to get on with the issues of the campaign."

HEADLINE: Bank Rates Slide a Bit Across U.S.

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Yields offered on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the week beginning today dipped slightly, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a Florida-based newsletter.
In the New York metropolitan region, commercial banks adjusted yields on short-term C.D.'s while savings banks lowered money market account yields. Elsewhere in the nation, the declines were most evident in money market accounts. 
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, average discount rates declined modestly. Many traders and investors view results of Treasury auctions as harbingers of future deposit rates.
The average rate at auction yesterday was 2.98 percent, down from 3.03 percent last week. The weekly decline was the fourth in a row. The six-month bill, meanwhile, edged down to 3.09 percent from 3.13 percent.
"The direction of rates in the next few weeks depends on whether President Clinton and Congress can coax the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates a notch in exchange for deficit reduction," said Robert K. Heady, The Bank Rate Monitor's publisher. "Lower rates would help pump up the economy, but they would also drive low savings yields even lower."
 
New York Accounts Fall
 In the New York area, money market accounts are down one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to an average of 2.69 percent. The decline began seven weeks ago. The average yield for three-month certificates of deposit also fell one basis point, to 2.78 percent, while the average yield on a six-month certificate edged down two basis points, to 2.96 percent.
Commercial banks continued to make the steepest cuts in three-month certificates of deposit, shaving the average yield 3 basis points, to 2.68 percent. Savings banks cut their money market accounts 2 basis points, to 2.83 percent. In some of the biggest changes for New York institutions, the Republic National Bank lowered its six-month C.D. 11 basis points, to 2.94 percent, and its three-month accounts one-tenth of a basis point, to 2.79 percent, while Crossland Savings cut its money-market account 10 basis points, to 2.65 percent.
Around the country, yields at 20 large commercial banks also slipped. The average money market account dropped 2 basis points, to 2.66 percent, and the average six-month C.D. dropped one basis point, to 3 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, Jan. 26,1993. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimum vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Forget the Theories, Japan Puts Chaos to Work

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 26

 BODY:
In research laboratories around the world, chaos theory, a young scientific field that seeks to find order amid seemingly random behavior, is providing fundamental insights into the behavior of the weather, the inner workings of the human body and the ebb and flow of wildlife populations. In Japan, chaos theory is also being used to make a kerosene heater.
While new technology in the United States has often been developed for military or space efforts, Japan does not have a strong military program and so relies on consumer products to lead the way. 
 The Sanyo Electric Company's heater, introduced last year, lets the temperature and the speed of the fan fluctuate. It attests to the enthusiastic practicality with which Japanese companies are rushing to apply chaos theory, even as researchers in the United States study how the theory might be used in everything from medical care to forecasting financial markets.
The contrast is not new. About a decade ago, for example, researchers developed metal alloys that could return to their former shape after heating. The United States used them in fighter planes; the Japanese used them to make air-conditioner louvers and eyeglass frames. The United States used special ceramics to make tiles to protect the space shuttle from heat as it re-entered the atmosphere; the Japanese made ceramic scissors and ballpoint pens.
Now, Japan is looking to create customer orders from chaos. "I've given talks in Japan where all the electronics companies have been present," said Peter Davis, a chaos researcher at the ATR Institute, a research center in Kyoto that is partly financed by the Japanese Government. "You certainly don't get that kind of interest from manufacturers in other countries."
The rush to employ hot new technologies in Japan is partly a marketing response to the Japanese consumer's appetite for the latest gadgets. But there is a more fundamental economic motivation at work. The rapid adoption of technology has been a key to Japan's industrial success, with the simple applications helping to hone the technology and finance the development of more complex applications. The solar-powered calculator, for instance, helped speed the development of photovoltaic cells that now provide electricity to homes and factories.
Still, there are some who think the rush to simple applications can detract from basic long-term research. "Japanese engineers easily flow to superficial applications," said Kazuyuki Aihara, an associate professor of electronic engineering at Tokyo Denki University. "In the case of chaos, it is very profound, so we should study the fundamental theories."
 
Successor to 'Fuzzy Logic'
 A few years ago, the technological fad was fuzzy logic, a technique for making computers more adaptable that had been invented but virtually ignored in the United States. Japanese companies quickly produced fuzzy washing machines, fuzzy vacuum cleaners and fuzzy rice cookers that adjusted their operations to the condition of the substance being cleaned or cooked.
Now chaos is all the rage. Chaos theory is based on the idea that seemingly random behavior, like the turbulence in a river, the behavior of the stock market or the fluctuations of animal populations from year to year, might actually be caused by some simple underlying mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms might allow for prediction of now unpredictable phenomena and, possibly, better control of them.
As yet, the Japanese have no Government-backed research program in chaos engineering, as the application of chaos theory is sometimes called. But two committees, made up of university and industry scientists, are devoted to comparing notes on chaos. And this fall, Toyota will sponsor a conference with the theme "Toward the Harnessing of Chaos."
Applied-chaos theory can be divided into two broad areas. One involves using mathematical tools to analyze seemingly chaotic behavior in a search for patterns.
Stock market prediction is one obvious application, though many experts say it is far from clear that chaos theory will work here. Still, Hitachi has begun selling software that uses some mathematical techniques of chaos theory to help forecast market moves. Similar work is under way in the United States.
Yutaka Takeuchi, a researcher at Toshiba, is trying to analyze oscillating signals from a nuclear plant's monitors to detect conditions under which nuclear reactions might become unstable.
Computer Convenience, a company in Fukuoka, has developed a device that uses chaos theory to try to diagnose mental health by measuring the pulse in the capillaries of a finger. The seemingly random fluctuations are diagrammed by a computer.
The device's developers, led by Takashi Tahara, a doctor at the Hizen National Mental Hospital, and Ichiro Tsuda, professor of computer science at the Kyushu Institute of Technology, say there is a clear difference between the patterns produced by a healthy, relaxed person and those from someone who is mentally ill or under stress.
The other class of applications involves deliberately creating a state of chaos and then corralling it into some practical purpose. The Sanyo kerosene heater belongs to this category.
The typical kerosene heater, a popular appliance in Japan, where central heating is not common, burns the kerosene and blows a constant stream of hot air, using a thermostat to try to maintain a constant temperature. The Sanyo heater, by contrast, allows the temperature to fluctuate a bit. The company says this saves fuel and increases comfort.
An even simpler application, though it did not actually use the mathematical techniques of chaos theory, was an air-conditioner introduced a few years ago by Matsushita. Instead of a steady stream of cool air, the air strength fluctuated in a manner mimicking the variations of natural wind, providing what the company said was a more comfortable way of cooling.
Another area of keen interest for chaos researchers is computers. Many companies are developing computers known as neural networks that seek to mimic the behavior of the neurons in the brain and that can learn by trial and error. Work by Professor Aihara and others has shown that human neurons exhibit some chaotic behavior. Introducing chaotic fluctuations in neural networks might improve their performance, he said.
To encourage applications, the New Japan Radio Corporation is selling what it says is the world's first chaos chip, which generates various chaotic signals. True to form, several Japanese stereo companies have expressed interest in using the chip to generate chaotic images and light patterns to accompany music.
Takeshi Yamakawa, a professor at the Kyushu Institute of Technology and the developer of the chip's technology, sees such frivolity as a matter of course. "The practical applications," he said, "will be focused on amusement."

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
COUCH potatoes might have closed their eyes to a surprising development: the programs they watch are becoming somewhat less cluttered with commercials. That's because advertisers and their agencies are cooling to 15-second spots, once the fastest-growing phenomenon on television since Roseanne Arnold.
According to an annual analysis by the Network Television Association, 15-second commercials accounted for just 31.8 percent of all spots that ran during the 1991-92 season on programming broadcast by its members. That marked a sharp decline from a peak achieved as recently as the 1988-89 season, when 37.7 percent of all commercials on ABC, CBS and NBC were 15 seconds long. 
 Indeed, last season's figure was the lowest for 15's, as they are known in the industry, since they began a meteoric rise in popularity in the mid-1980's. At one time, it seemed they might even supplant 30-second spots as the industry standard, in much the same way that 30's superceded 60-second commercials in the 1970's.
"The numbers are dramatic," Peter Chrisanthopoulos, president and chief executive at the N.T.A. in New York, said yesterday. "A drop from 37.7 to 31.8 in just three seasons is significant."
Fifteen-second spots, which began appearing on network television during the 1983-84 season, were developed in response to the soaring cost of commercial air time. They are sold for about half the price of 30-second commercials, though sometimes premiums are charged.
At first, the networks sold them only in a "split 30" format, meaning an advertiser had to buy two 15-second spots that ran consecutively. Later, that stipulation was relaxed so that free-standing short spots -- stand-alone 15's, in industry parlance -- were also made available. Even so, the networks have placed limits on the frequency of 15-second spots, unlike their longer siblings.
Some advertisers have used the 15-second format creatively, producing so-called book-end spots or to-be-continued spots. Viewers, for example, watch a 15-second spot in which an actor, grimacing almost convincingly, complains about a headache and decides to take an Excedrin tablet. That spot is followed by one or two 30-second spots for unrelated products. Then the actor returns in a second 15-second spot, proclaiming that Excedrin has vanquished his pain.
Speaking of pain relief, as 15-second commercials fade in popularity, viewers should be less bothered by separate commercial interruptions, a problem referred to as clutter. The rise of 15's was a gamble. Advertisers hoped the savings achieved by paying for 15 seconds of air time, rather than 30, would offset whatever alienation might occur among viewers who felt beset by increasing clutter.
"No one knows at what point the clutter has a substantial negative impact on the medium," said David Marans, senior vice president of media research at J. Walter Thompson U.S.A. in New York.
"But a preponderance of evidence from many research studies over the years," he added, "has demonstrated there seems to be a definite relationship, and a negative one, between increased clutter and commercial effectiveness. Our concern is the effectiveness of the TV medium -- to not kill the goose the laid the golden egg."
Mr. Chrisanthopoulos called the shift from 15-second commercials "good news" for advertisers because "if there are fewer of them, there's a more favorable environment created." He said the networks feared that the increase in 15's would hurt the medium, but were willing to offer them "to accommodate the demands of the marketplace."
That marketplace has, of course, changed substantially in recent years. The weakness in the economy softened the demand for commercial time. That, in turn, broke the 1980's pattern of commercial prices ratcheting ever higher, a primary reason that 15-second spots were spawned.
Mr. Chrisanthopoulos said he expected "the downward trend in 15's will continue somewhat, but I don't see them disappearing."
"They're here to stay," he added, "but they will not be the dominant format used by advertisers."
In the 1991-92 season, according to the association's analysis of Arbitron Media Watch data, as 15-second commercials fell to 31.8 percent of all sports from 33.6 percent in 1990-91, 30-second commercials rose to 62.9 percent, from 62.5 percent. There was also a slight increase in the once-mighty 60-second format, to 2 percent, up from 1.6 percent.
More information about clutter is expected on Feb. 9, when the American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers are scheduled to release the next installment of their periodic Commercial Monitoring Study. The study, prepared by Thompson, is expected to report decreases in clutter, particularly during prime-time network programming.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
THE last vintage chart to appear in this space, on May 22, 1991, documented one of the more memorable periods in wine history. From 1981, the first vintage covered, through 1990, which had not yet been bottled, it was a period of unrivaled prosperity and success in most of the major wine regions of the world.
Most vintage charts -- and the people who follow them -- are primarily concerned with Bordeaux, and for Bordeaux the good times began much earlier. After the mysterious 1975 vintage, which still has not matured and, alas, probably never will, there has been an abundance of fine harvests and good wine. 
 The 1977, 1980, 1984 and 1987 vintages were all given relatively low ratings in their time, but except for 1984, all of them provided good, early-maturing wines at affordable prices.
Even 1984, which has been eliminated from this year's chart, provided a few decent wines. In France, the '84's still turn up on restaurant lists and are much beloved by caterers who pour them at weddings where people are curious about the bride's age, not the wine's.
This year's chart includes both 1990, whose anticipated success is now a fact, and 1991, which was not impressive in Bordeaux. The 1990 Bordeaux marked the third consecutive year of great wines from its region. The 1991's were mediocre but sold at relatively high prices. The 1992's, not charted here, are also expected to fall considerably below the highest standards. Heavy, unrelenting rains at harvest time seriously affected quality.
The talk is that 1992 will equal or slightly surpass 1987, the last problem vintage. The fact is that 1987 was not a bad year; it just did not match 1985 or 1986, or the three years that succeeded it. The 1987's, which still can be found in most areas, are still attractive wines to drink. And they are attractively priced.
It can't be emphasized enough that a good year in one part of the world is not necessarily a good year somewhere else. While 1991 and 1992 were not great years in Bordeaux, 1991 was a superb vintage in Beaujolais and both years were excellent in most parts of California.
The vintages are given a rating from 1 to 10, with letters indicating the drinkability of the wine. But bear in mind that even within a vintage, wine will differ from vineyard to vineyard, from cellar to cellar and even from bottle to bottle. A hard, tannic wine from St. Estephe in Bordeaux should need five more years' aging than the equivalent wine from St.-Emilion, which is also in the Bordeaux region.
Most of the romance surrounding very old wine is spurious. Most wine, even the very best, peaks after about 10 to 15 years. Some may improve for decades; most will not. Thus, the chart cannot explain how a wine of a lesser year may taste better right now than a famous wine that needs 10 years to mature.
Champagne has no drinkability rating on the chart because it is, or is supposed to be, ready to drink when sold; the winemakers do the aging for you, sometimes for as long as eight years. Once, Champagne hardly rated space on any vintage chart because it was almost entirely nonvintage wine, blended from wines of different harvests.
But vintaged Champagne is popular at the moment and it is possible that some houses are declaring vintages for purely economic reasons. There are no official vintage years. The ratings are given for those years when a sufficient number of producers have declared a vintage to make a rating meaningful.
As in the past, the chart offers no Beaujolais ratings earlier than the three most recent harvests. If well kept, the 10 so-called cru Beaujolais, such as Fleurie, Moulin-a-Vent and Morgon, will last for five years or more. But it is unwise to buy or order in a restaurant any Beaujolias more than two years old. It is a wine to be drunk young.
A word of advice: the 1991 vintage of Beaujolais will soon be giving way to the 1992's. The new vintage will be good but not as good as 1991. It might be worth snapping up some of the remaining 1991's if you can find them.
A vintage chart is only the vaguest of guides to good wine. Its advice on Bordeaux, for example, relates almost exclusively to the expensive classified growths, the most famous chateaux. Each year, Bordeaux produces millions of gallons of simple, delicious wine that is meant to be drunk young.
Similarly, the chart cannot easily take into account the poor weather in the southern Rhone in 1991. It was a disaster for Chateauneuf-du-Pape but a good year farther north at Hermitage and the Cote Rotie. The rating is an unsatisfactory compromise for the rater.
The California ratings refer mostly to the northern coastal counties of Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino. California stretches 1,500 miles, from the Oregon border to Mexico. No chart could cover all its wine regions.
Some day, perhaps, there will be a truly comprehensive wine vintage chart, one where it will be possible to look up the 1989 vintage in Hungary; the 1985 vintage in Mendoza, in Argentina, and the 1990 harvest in Temecula, Calif., near San Diego. It will be a rather large chart; it might even be called an encyclopedia.
 
TASTINGS
Jordan Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon, 1988; Alexander Valley, California; about $25.
 
If there were one word that summarized Jordan cabernets, it would have to be accessibility. Almost from the first vintage, back in 1976, Jordan wines have been rich, flavorful, fragrant and ready to drink when they were released. Given those criteria, the 1988 offers no surprises; it just happens to be a delicious wine. With his spectacular winery overlooking the Alexander Valley in Sonoma County and his great advance press, Tom Jordan would have to have been a miracle worker to have lived up to all the expectations. Instead he produced a quality wine that became an instant success and that has remained fairly high on the charts ever since. Some critics fault the wine, saying it lacks subtlety and ageability. The fact is that not every good wine needs to be subtle or to possess the ability to age. There is nothing wrong with having all that good taste right up front. And as for aging, it may be too soon to tell.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Philharmonic Reaches Pact

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Philharmonic, one of the nine orchestras affected by the strike of freelance musicians, which began on Saturday, reached a separate tentative agreement yesterday with Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, the union representing the players. The orchestra's musicians are meeting today to vote on the new three-year contract.
The orchestra's management, anticipating ratification, announced that it would perform its concerts on Friday and Saturday evening at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. 
 Maurice Edwards, the orchestra's artistic director, said the new contract gave the orchestra's players annual raises of 4 percent and proportional increases in health benefits. Mr. Edwards said that unlike the eight other orchestras in the Orchestra Managers of New York, the Brooklyn Philharmonic already has a side agreement covering tenure and peer review, which are among the sticking points in the negotiations.
"The Brooklyn Philharmonic joined the consortium to negotiate the economic issues," said Joseph Rosenthal, the lawyer representing the managers. "When the main point of contention turned out to be peer review, which they already have, they asked to withdraw and we did not object."
Mr. Rosenthal said that he expected the remaining eight orchestras to continue negotiating as a consortium.

HEADLINE: Metropolitan Diary

BYLINE: By Ron Alexander

 BODY:

DEAR DIARY:
I was on my way to work, heading uptown on Avenue of the Americas. At 52d Street, I stepped off the curb to cross just as a truck was making a sharp turn in front of me. I stopped to let the truck pass but did not step back on the curb.
Suddenly from behind me, I heard someone shout, "Hey, look out! Watch it!" I jumped back on the sidewalk and turned around to see who my protector was. 
 It turned out to be two rather large ladies. I was about to thank them for alerting me, when one turned to the other and said, "That's all I need first thing in the morning, somebody getting splattered all over my coat!" -- JULIA LIZZUL

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Dear Diary:
Despite incessant hints, no one presented me with "The Complete Beatles Chronicle" for Christmas. So the other evening, I walked over to the Barnes & Noble near Rockefeller Center. There, the following dialogue ensued.
Me: Where are your books on the Beatles?
Clerk: Look under the Rolling Stones.
Surely this signifies the end of civilization as we know it? -- JAMES SMITH

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
NOCTURNE
 
 I love to wake up in the dark of night
 surrounded by silence,
 the edges softened by moonlight slipping
 through cracks in the curtains.

 I love prowling the house
 while the town 'round me sleeps,
 curling up in an overstuffed chair,
 sipping cinnamon tea and catching
 the last five minutes of
 "Casablanca" on the TV.

 I love easing open
 the door to my son's room,
 seeing him sleep in a tangle of sheets.

 I love to wake up in the dark of the night
 seeing the clock reading quarter to four,
 knowing that I can sleep two hours more.

 I love to wake up in the dark of the night
 and I love knowing I can go back to bed.
 ALICE LAURANCE

 	 	 		. . .	 	Middle of a conversation overheard on Madison Avenue, between an irritated, well-groomed woman and an equally annoyed well-groomed man.
She: So self-important! Who does he think he is?
He: He's the brother-in-law of the King of Spain, and his wife is the King's sister, that's who!"
She: Oh.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Letter from a thrifty New Yorker:
"As a currently unemployed advertising account executive, much of my time is spent on the telephone. Today, for example, while dropping my resume off at countless personnel offices, I managed to stop at no less than 30 pay phones for what is arguably the city's finest freebie, directory assistance.
"Considering that such assistance is 45 cents a call when dialed from home, my savings for the day totaled $13.50. I celebrated with a $5 cab ride from my last appointment to my front door. Net income for the day: a whopping $8.50. That's more than I was able to save when I was working."

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Dear Diary:
The other day I started thinking about the time when signs announcing "Tea Leaves Read Gratis" dotted Manhattan's midtown landscape. It was the middle of the 1930's, we were in the midst of the Depression, and having tea leaves read was an inexpensive escape from reality.
I had missed my train back to Bridgeport -- I used to visit New York to see the French films of the day -- and with 59 minutes to spare until the next train, I walked along 42d Street. Seeing a sign -- "Gypsy Tea Room" -- near Fifth Avenue above Russell Stover Chocolates, I climbed a flight of stairs to a nondescript room and sat at a very small table.
My tea leaf reader was a man who looked to be in his 40's. He began by telling me my first name and went on to say that if pushed too far, I was capable of displaying a sharp tongue. (True.) He told me that I lived in a house surrounded by trees (also true) and described my living room, including the unusual window arrangement. He also described the office where I worked, including the placement of my desk.
He said that on the following day, a friend named Rose would fall from a horse and sustain fairly serious injuries. (Most of my friends rode, and three were named Rose.) It happened.
The last thing the reader told me: several people in my office would lose their jobs, but I would be kept on at a reduced salary. It happened.
I caught the next train to Bridgeport and never sought to have my tea leaves read again. -- ANN RAPOPORT

A Real Live Health-Care Drama

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Many a lawyer must be an actor manque. But Prof. Arthur Miller of the Harvard Law School is demonstrably not to the manque born. His thespiantic talents have been displayed in many upscale television discussions, and now, in "Who Shall Be Healed?," he has the hit of his performing career.
As the moderator and provocateur of tonight's "Fred Friendly Seminar," Mr. Miller takes the role of Homer Smith, a computer manager for a company in what he calls "the wonderful community of Appleville," somewhere in the middle of the United States. As the hour progresses, Smith's troubles accumulate. First, he can't accept a better job because the new company, a small one, does not provide health benefits. Then he comes down with severe headaches and his group-health doctor discourages him from being examined by magnetic resonance imaging because of the cost. And then his wife has trouble getting the best oncologist in town to treat her breast cancer. 
 "I realize," he admonishes the panelists who have been cooly discussing the need to keep costs down, "to you doctors, my apprehension about the tumor doesn't mean a damn thing. My wife's peace of mind and her ability to bond with the doctor doesn't mean a damn thing." Hath not a law professor passions?
Mr. Miller, whose only prop is a plastic-foam cup for waving, mixes his prosecutorial fervor with pathos, his indignation with incredulity. He is constantly on the move; if there were more scenery than the big table for the doctors and former government officials, the nurse, the hospital director, the businessman, the academic, the insurance specialist and the others who make up the symposium, he would assuredly shred it. His script and emotings are all in the service of bringing home the workings and misworkings of America's present health-care arrangements.
Dr. Arnold S. Relman, editor emeritus of the New England Journal of Medicine, needs no magnetic resonance imager to diagnose the cause of health-cost inflation: the person who receives the services does not pay for them. Prof. Alain Enthoven of Stanford University, a prominent exponent of "managed health care," agrees: "Today everybody has a personal interest in spending more money, or at least no interest in spending less money, because it's all paid for by a third party."
Demurring from the call by Rhoda Karpatkin, head of Consumers Union, for a version of the Canadian system, where the Government pays the bill, they and others on the panel favor some form of health maintenance organization that concentrates on preventive care and has incentives to keep costs down.
In the hour's testiest moment, Joseph A. Califano Jr., a former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, demands that Robert Laszewski, the panel's insurance representative, end his industry's "shilling for doctors, hospitals, medical equipment manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies." Mr. Califano, a practiced scene stealer, predicts early death for both Ms. Karpatkin's and Mr. Enthoven's favorite plans. Experience tells him that lobbyists for big political contributors will kill any proposed change that threatens their financial health.
Such, this pertinent program concludes, is the sort of reality confronting the new Administration as it goes about trying to live up to the campaign promise to keep down health costs (which are moving speedily toward a trillion dollars a year) while providing care for everyone. Maybe Hillary Rodham Clinton should hire Professor Miller, give him a cup and let him do his stuff for Congress.

HEADLINE: The Urgency of Aiding Russia

 BODY:
President Clinton has appointed a fresh team to handle the nation's most important foreign challenge: to help a disintegrating Russia move to democracy and markets without threatening the safety of its neighbors. Now the team needs to inject new urgency into an economic aid program that languished under his predecessor.
Russia is on the brink of disaster. The Yeltsin Government has lost control of the central bank, which has poured billions of excess rubles into dead factories. The result is inflation near 50 percent a month -- hyperinflation -- which if allowed to persist will virtually guarantee economic chaos and political breakdown. It was, after all, hyperinflation that helped bring forth Hitler. 
 Russia can still be saved. Indeed, it has started to heal itself. The Yeltsin Government is pushing privatization of state-owned enterprises. And last week it tried to put reform back on track by demanding tighter monetary policy and revoking a misguided decree to reimpose price controls. But the political battle over how fast and how far to push reform rages on. Western aid can buttress the reformers.
By yesterday's appointment of Thomas Pickering, an experienced Foreign Service officer, to be his ambassador to Russia, Mr. Clinton has given diplomatic strength to his policy. And by choosing Strobe Talbott, a columnist for Time magazine who is a close friend, to serve as ambassador at large, he has shown his personal stake in Russian policy.
Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, takes over responsibility for international economic policy at the Treasury Department. And Toby Gati, an expert on the Soviet Union, will spearhead Russian policy at the National Security Council.
Each of these appointees backs substantial Western aid to support the struggling economic and political reforms under way in Russia.
The Russians will have to do the major work of reform. But no country -- including West Germany after World War II and, more recently, Mexico -- has successfully undergone economic transformation without substantial external help.
In April the West promised Russia a $24 billion aid package. But it delivered virtually nothing. An invigorated effort is now called for. Russia needs Western money to create a safety net for the unemployed and elderly, to promote the growth of small business and to stabilize the value of the ruble so that it can open its borders to trade. It also needs Western money to import desperately needed food and medical supplies during the chaotic transition to a freer economy.
The package would still cost about $24 billion, only $3 billion of which would come from the U.S. The rest would come from the European Community and international lending institutions like the World Bank. But the West won't move until the Clinton Administration takes charge.
That won't be easy. Congress is reluctant to pony up funds for Russia while domestic needs cry out for help. It is Mr. Clinton's responsibility to explain the long-run consequences of letting Russia collapse from Western neglect. The few billions a Western aid package would cost may go to waste. But it would be a grievous miscalculation not to take the small risk.

HEADLINE: Baird Stands in Part for All Working Mothers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Sins of Zoe Baird," Anna Quindlen's excellent Jan. 20 column, doesn't go far enough. The blame placing in which the Senate indulged over Ms. Baird's child-care arrangements demonstrates a fundamental paradox. No one says she was right to ignore the law. But the issue is more profound than Ms. Baird's failure to pay the appropriate taxes. 
 Americans mythologize the concept of a happy childhood, yet our society provides no acceptable institutional child-care arrangements. A mother with a career like Zoe Baird and countless others is put in the untenable position of having to forgo the results of hard work -- a choice that few men have to make -- or to provide often heart-rending, makeshift child-care arrangements.
Too often these arrangements involve recent immigrants, unskilled, ignorant of English, but of good character and with a love of and care for children. How many second-generation, English-speaking women who can work in an office would even consider a housekeeper-governess position? In my experience, few.
The moralistic reaction to Zoe Baird's predicament reflects the low esteem given to child-rearing, which our society identifies with women. None of the articles I have read fault Ms. Baird's husband, Paul Gewirtz, for his role. Apparently, no one expected him to refrain from teaching constitutional law at Yale or to shoulder the arrangements!
Ms. Baird and Professor Gewirtz had options many others do not have because of income. But none of the law firms or corporations for which Ms. Baird worked so effectively provided satisfactory child-care arrangements that would have obviated the necessity of private, in-home help and would have allowed mother and child to be together at times during the day. We still regard the workplace as "masculine" -- all business -- and the home as "feminine," and the lines between are rigidly drawn. This rigidity is the source of Ms. Baird's 1990 dilemma.
Before the women's movement changed our perceptions, severe judgments were made about women opting for the career role. However, by closing our eyes to the need for child care and support for the parental function, we continue to penalize women (and children) for making those choices. That is the moral paradox in the Baird case.
I write from personal experience. I am a partner in a national law firm; my children are in college. But I have been divorced with custody of my two daughters since 1978; one was then 7, the other 3. Their schools let out at 3 P.M. and noon, respectively. Like any new associate in a law firm, I had to work long hours. I could do so only by hiring full-time help -- Mexican, Colombian and finally Barbadian. Their wishes on Social Security prevailed; I was entirely at their mercy.
No law firm at that time offered child-care arrangements. Flexibility permitting work at home was unusual and in the law, impractical. I could have taken a leave of absence, but economic need made that impossible. I did not want to leave my daughters for 10 hours a day, every day, but since it was necessary, I had to know they were cared for by trustworthy employees.
When will we admit our blindness to the needs of children for their parents and a flexible work style that adapts to those needs; our callous assignment of the burdens of making arrangements to women, and our unwillingness to finance decent, alternatives to bootleg domestic arrangements?

HEADLINE: Aspin Overhauls Pentagon to Bolster Policy Role

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In a sweeping overhaul of the Defense Department intended to strengthen the Pentagon's involvement in foreign and domestic policy, Secretary Les Aspin is creating posts on human rights, arms proliferation and the conversion of military industries.
Among the least traditional of Mr. Aspin's choices for the new jobs is Morton H. Halperin, a former official in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations who fought a lengthy legal battle with Henry A. Kissinger over wiretapping and who was director of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Halperin is Mr. Aspin's choice for Assistant Defense Secretary for Democracy and Human Rights. 
 In reorganizing the Pentagon, Mr. Aspin is forming a 1990's group of the "best and the brightest" to deal with the new agenda of foreign policy issues, drawing on specialists from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the Rand Corporation, as well as present and former Government officials.
Altogether, Mr. Aspin's plan and personnel choices are intended to forge a new approach and structure for dealing with the national security problems that the United States is facing with the end of the cold war. These include the possibility that democratic reforms in Russia might fail, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the surge in ethnic strife around the world and the need to retrain workers in the arms industry at home.
In developing his plan, Mr. Aspin is emphasizing diplomatic and military steps to prevent crises before they arise instead of responding to them after they erupt. A senior aide to Mr. Aspin described the plan as an effort to create an "operational design that matches the times."
But some critics assert that Mr. Aspin's plan is a power play to strengthen the Pentagon's hand on foreign policy at the expense of the State Department. They assert that the plan may divert the Pentagon's energies from its primary task of overseeing the shrinking of the military and maintaining and equipping the reduced forces.
 
Bureaucratic Politics
 "It is driven more by the bureaucratic politics of competing with the State Department than dealing with the essential functions of the Defense Department," said Zalmay M. Khalilzad, the Pentagon's head of policy planning in the Bush Administration. "It is ironic that at the time we are going to cut back the forces, the number of senior management officials in the policy domain is increasing."
Under Mr. Aspin's plan, the traditional civilian Pentagon functions will be handled by four branches: weapons acquisition, personnel and readiness, the office of the Pentagon comptroller and an office of national security policy.
The weapons acquisition branch is to be headed by John M. Deutch, a former Under Secretary at the Energy Department, and a professor and a former provost at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The personnel and readiness branch will oversee the military reserves, health affairs and the military readiness of the forces. The Pentagon comptroller will serve as the chief financial officer. These two appointments have not been disclosed.
The policy branch is to be headed by Frank G. Wisner, a former Ambassador to Egypt and top State Department official. He will assume the post of Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and his main deputy will be Walter B. Slocombe, an expert on arms control and nuclear forces who was a senior Pentagon official in the Carter Administration.
It is the policy branch that is being reshaped to deal with the new set of issues. The post of Assistant Defense Secretary for Democracy and Human Rights will address military assistance to foreign governments, the training of foreign military forces, American policy on peacekeeping and humanitarian operations undertaken by the military.
The position will give the Pentagon a high-level mechanism for considering human rights criteria in determining the extent of military cooperation with other countries.
Mr. Halperin, who served in the Pentagon and on the National Security Council staff, became known for his lawsuit against Mr. Kissinger. He accusing Mr. Kissinger of authorizing a wiretap of his home when Mr. Halperin worked for Mr. Kissinger when the latter was President Richard M. Nixon's national security adviser. This chapter left over from the Watergate scandal was closed in November, when Mr. Kissinger wrote a letter of apology and Mr. Halperin dropped the suit.
Another new post is that of Assistant Defense Secretary for Nuclear Security and Counter Proliferation. That official would be in charge of arms control, efforts to stem the spread of weapons of mass destruction and eliminate nuclear weapons in the former Soviet republicas, and policy on nuclear forces and anti-missile defenses.
The position is to be filled by Ashton B. Carter, director for the Center for Science and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government.
Mr. Carter has a doctorate in theoretical physics from Oxford University and has written on a wide variety of national security issues. During the Reagan Administration, he was a critic of the President's plan to build a space-based anti-missile system. More recently, he has devoted much of his energies to plans to remove nuclear weapons from the former Soviet republics and prevent those weapons from falling into the wrong hands.
 
Elevating Policy Planning
 A new Assistant Defense Secretary for Economic and Environmental Security will deal with converting military industries to civilian production and retraining workers.
The traditional Pentagon job of policy planning is to be raised in status. Graham Allison, the former dean of the Kennedy school and the advocate of the "grand bargain" plan to send billions of dollars of aid to Russia, is to be an Assistant Defense Secretary for Plans and Policy, addressing long-term strategy.
Edward L. Warner, a Rand Corporation expert on the Russian military and on arms control, is to be the Assistant Defense Secretary for Strategy and Resources under Mr. Aspin's plan. Mr. Warner will be responsible for preparing the classified Defense Policy Guidance, which is used to guide the military services in preparing budget plans. He will also play an important role in devising a new structure for the armed forces as Pentagon spending declines.

HEADLINE: Subway in Los Angeles To Open in Modest Step

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Years of debate, delay and construction turn into reality on Saturday when trains begin to roll under Los Angeles in a subway so different from others that passengers will pay their fares on the honor system.
Many in Los Angeles thought it would never happen, and skeptics call the project a boondoggle. But the opening will be a milestone for this sprawling city whose very name suggests cars and clogged freeways. 
 It is a modest start, just 4.4 miles of tunnels linking five stations across downtown. Two sleek Italian-made trains running in opposite directions will carry riders on the seven-minute trip between Union Station and MacArthur Park just west of downtown.
The Metro Red Line, as it is called, would hardly make New Yorkers feel at home. The stations are bright and airy and are filled with dramatic art; the automated trains glide by almost silently. Turnstile jumping has been eliminated, in one sense, by the doing away with turnstiles, though the police will spot check for tickets.
Transit officials said they concluded that the cost of building a fare-collection system would be higher than the amount likely to be lost to cheaters. They said comparisons with New York, where fare-evasion is rampant on the 469-station system, were inappropriate because the Los Angeles system was such a small and closely monitored one. Moreover, many of the subway passengers here are expected to be transfers from commuter rail lines and therefore entitled to ride the Red Line free.
There will be no barriers to the train platforms, a concept borrowed from European and Canadian systems. Sharon K. Papa, chief of police for the transit district, said officers planned to check about one of every four riders for valid tickets. Such a system has been in use on a small above-ground section of the overall rail system for two years, and the rate of noncompliance has been less than one-half of 1 percent.
On a first offense, violators will be removed from the train and given a lesson in how to buy a ticket from a machine in the station. Repeat violators could be fined up to $250.
 
'Freeway of the Future'
 To Los Angeles's visionaries, the opening will be a turning point for a far-flung checkerboard region, where it is difficult to find an urban core and the automobile serves as the chaotic instrument of personal independence.
"We have made public policy that for the next 30 years we are not going to add any more freeways," said Neil Peterson, executive director of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which oversees the subway project. "The freeway of the future is the rail system, tied in with tremendously expanded car-pooling and bikeways."
Transit officials have plans for a 22.7-mile subway system that will be the backbone of a 400-mile commuter rail system and expanded bus service. Such a system would give this area a transit system that would be larger than any other in the country, except New York City's.
Backers hope the system will alter helter-skelter development while reducing traffic congestion and smog. It is projected to cost $78 billion over the next 30 years and is the largest public works program in the United States today.
"The most important question is how this affects development patterns and does it encourage the kind of social and economic behavior we want," said Mark Pisano, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, a regional planning organization.
 
Critics Call It Outdated
 But skeptics argue that the rail project is a 20th-century solution to 21st-century urban needs and a huge waste of scarce dollars. They contend that buses and vans offer cheaper and more flexible transportation in a region with so many centers.
"Rail was an appropriate technology at one time, but now we have cities that are spread out massively, and most people do not live or work near a rail line," said Peter Gordon, associate dean for academic affairs at the School of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Southern California. "It doesn't compete with the convenience of the automobile, and everybody knows that."
Mr. Gordon said the decision to build the subway was a political one tied to creating jobs.
But no such negative voices are likely to rise Saturday when Mayor Tom Bradley and other leaders gather to dedicate the Red Line on the mezzanine of the Pershing Square station amid the dazzling neon art of Stephen Antonakos. The overall system, operated by the Southern California Rapid Transit District, is projected to create 1.4 million jobs over the next three decades. The first segment cost $1.4 billion to build.
The Red Line connects with two surface rail lines that opened recently, the Blue Line that carries commuters 22 miles from Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles, and Metrolink, three train lines from Ventura County, San Bernardino County and the Santa Clarita Valley to Union Station in Los Angeles. The subway will operate from 5 A.M. until 7 P.M. at the start and will be free for the first two months, after which the honor fare system goes into effect.
Under construction or planned are extensions of the subway to Hollywood and on to the San Fernando Valley, and another line that would run out Wilshire Boulevard, then toward West Los Angeles by a route not yet decided. A line to the southeast is also under consideration. In all, by the year 2001, plans call for 20 stations and 22.7 miles of subway at a cost of $5.3 billion in Federal, state and local money.
 
Part of a Vast Network
 The subway is the centerpiece of a vast system, to cost $183 billion over 30 years. It would also include more freeway lanes for car pools and expanded bus service, bikeways and park-and-ride sites. By 2010, the transportation commission estimates that 25 percent of Los Angeles County residents and 29 percent of the county's jobs will be within a half mile of a rail line.
Even so, no one claims that mass transit will replace more than a fraction of the automobile traffic. Today only about 6 percent of Southern Californians use mass transit to get to work, and the number is declining, according to the association of governments.
Mr. Peterson, the head of the transportation commission, said he hoped the figure for Los Angeles County could be raised to 20 percent, or 500,000 commuters a day, in 30 years. (New York City subways and buses, record 4.8 million fares on a typical weekday and carry 49 percent of city's residents to work. In Boston, 65 percent of the trips to downtown are on public transit.)
"We are trying to attract a portion of the population out of their own automobiles," Mr. Peterson said. "This is a very big geographic area. We are not able to use trains everywhere. The subway is just one step toward a transportation system that works in this day and age."
Skeptics doubt the rail system here will attract the expected ridership. They cite studies by Don H. Pickrell, an economist with the National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, Mass., that found the forecasts used to justify rail projects in Washington; Miami; Buffalo; Portland, Ore.; Sacramento, Calif., and other cities had grossly overestimated the ridership.
Among the chief critics is Martin Wachs, a former New Yorker who is professor of urban planning at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of California at Los Angeles. In New York, where subway service began 88 years ago, people "take it for granted the subway is a good thing," he said. "But L.A. has much lower population densities. Less than 5 percent of the employment is downtown. A subway is simply too expensive and will serve too few people."
Professor Wachs supports mass transit, but favors buses and vans, which he says can get closer to most people than rail lines.
Mr. Peterson counters that buses are not the answer for heavily traveled corridors like Wilshire Boulevard, where they can hardly move through traffic today. As for ridership forecasts, he said the two rail lines operating now had healthy patronage, with 36,000 a day on the Blue Line and nearly 4,000 on the three Metrolink suburban lines. Ridership forecasts for the Red Line are 7,800 passengers a day at the start with 12,000 by the end of the year and 350,000 after 30 years.
And he said that complaints about the huge cost of subway construction were shortsighted. "We are building something to last forever," Mr. Peterson said. "Who today wonders whether New York's initial investment in its subway was worth it? That was the best investment New York ever made."

GRAPHIC: Photo: Los Angeles may be trying to add to its list of legends, but this one would have nothing to do with Hollywood make-believe. The city is about to inaugurate a subway system where passengers pay their fares on the honor system. At the 7th Street/Metro Center station, final preparations were made.

HEADLINE: Guatemalan Chief Pushes for Accord With Rebels

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Convinced that the remnants of a guerrilla war damage Guatemala's image abroad and slow its economic development, President Jorge Serrano has begun an intense effort to get a peace accord or a cease-fire in the next few months.
"The truth is that although the conflict affects few people, it is affecting the reputation of the country," he said in an interview in the presidential palace on Tuesday. 
 The initial reaction of the insurgents, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union, was tentative approval of the basic points, but the exiled guerrilla leaders also introduced what Mr. Serrano said were new demands: the purge and reduction of the army. He said he was waiting for a further response from them that he hoped would be more flexible.
The President said that the conflict, whose roots go back more than three decades, involves very little actual combat today and that the armed guerrillas number fewer than 500.
"It's an enemy that doesn't appear," he said. "There are no battle lines, the guerrillas don't dominate any territory and are concentrated in the most remote areas of the country. The visible leadership lives in Mexico."
But he said the absence of a peace accord provided the excuse for human rights abuses -- most attributed to the Guatemalan Army or civil defense patrols -- and for the bombings of power stations, bridges and other infrastructure by the guerrillas.
Arguing that the insurgents achieve most of their successes in international forums and among supporters in Europe, the United States and Mexico, he said the conflict had become "5 percent military, 10 to 15 percent national politics, and 80 percent international."
Mr. Serrano, who has made the search for a peace accord a top priority since his election two years ago, first announced his initiative here two weeks ago, then went to New York last week to present it at the United Nations.
He proposed leapfrogging ahead in the intermittent negotiations under way since April 1991, with both sides committing themselves to a 90-day period of nonstop talks.
If a definitive accord could not be reached in that time, he proposed that both sides agree to declare cease-fires and that the guerrillas concentrate their forces in designated safety zones in the Guatemalan highlands, where United Nations forces would be asked "to guarantee that there is no provocation by the army."
He said the 90 days could begin as soon as the Government and insurgent leaders signed a human rights accord, which has already been negotiated. He said he was ready to sign the rights agreement and to accept international verification of it, if the guerrillas accepted the rest of his package.
 
A Visit to New York
 The seriousness of Mr. Serrano's peace effort was somewhat undercut here in recent days by press attention and public tittering over the visit he made, while in New York, to a restaurant and bar that features topless dancers. A freelance cameraman taped Mr. Serrano as he left the establishment, Stringfellows, and made it available to the Spanish-language television network, Univision, which broadcast it.
The President said he knew nothing about the place before his party arrived there. He said the group, which included the Defense Minister and the President's two college-age sons, went out in search of food one night and went to Stringfellows at the suggestion of Guatemala's delegate to the United Nations.
Mr. Serrano said that he decided to leave as soon as he saw the inside of the place but that his security people had asked him to wait until the rest of his party had arrived in separate cars. He said he had spent less than an hour there.
The President said that while he would never have intentionally taken his sons there, what they saw "was nothing more than any kid can see on television today."
He also said he had been to shows in Paris with his wife that were "probably more risque -- at the Folies-Bergere and the Moulin Rouge."

HEADLINE: Labor Secretary Says Extension Of Jobless Benefits Is on the Table

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In the face of huge layoffs at companies like Sears Roebuck, Boeing and Pratt & Whitney, the Clinton Administration is preparing to extend the unemployment benefits of the 1.7 million Americans now receiving them, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said today.
"I think that's likely," Mr. Reich said in an interview. "It's on the table. The President has not made a decision. But it seems to me that given the sluggish rate of job creation and persistently high unemployment numbers, it seems that emergency unemployment compensation will be extended and that the President will seek to do that." 
 Mr. Reich said the Administration was also considering extending the benefits of workers who had been without work so long that they had exhausted up to 59 weeks of regular benefits and extensions. A Labor Department official said 256,000 workers fell into that group.
Mr. Reich also reaffirmed two of Mr. Clinton's campaign promises: to raise the Federal minimum wage of $4.25 an hour and to prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacements for workers who strike. The striker-replacement issue is the highest priority for many labor unions this year.
 
Expectations on Spending
 Mr. Reich also elaborated on his disclosure Tuesday that the President favored spending about $20 billion to stimulate the economy. And for the first time he described how the Administration might distribute that spending: a third might be used for public works, like building roads and bridges; a third for job training and education, and a third to induce companies in invest in machinery and equipment to increase production. The last part represents the money the Government would lose by granting industry a 10 percent tax credit to make the investments.
In several appearances this week on television news programs and before Congress, Mr. Reich has been speaking harshly of many companies where, he says, workers are treated as costs rather than assets. This morning on the NBC program "Today," he called many recent large-scale layoffs in industry "a management failure."
He said the bill on family and medical leave was one of many "sticks" the Administration would use to try to persuade companies to treat workers more humanely. That bill was vetoed by President George Bush, but it is swiftly moving through Congress again. The Labor Secretary added that better treatment of workers would also be sought by stricter enforcement of health and safety regulations and laws regulating other working conditions.
 
Layoffs Spur Fuel Plans
 But Mr. Reich said he wanted to enlist "enlightened" management leaders, including those who allowed their employees family and medical leave without Government pressure, to work with him and organized labor in encouraging managers of other companies to treat employees as assets.
The Administration's interest in extending unemployment benefits, a possibility that Mr. Reich also mentioned on the "Today" program, was spurred by the latest announcements of layoffs. Despite the economy's continuing growth, Mr. Reich said the layoffs were evidence that "we're not out of the woods." He said, "Until you get jobs back, you don't have a genuine recovery."
After months of opposition by the Bush Administration, Congress enacted an extension of unemployment benefits in November 1991. After losing jobs involuntarily, workers normally receive up to 26 weeks of benefits, typically one-third to one-half of their prior wages. In its 1991 action, Congress granted them another 26 to 33 weeks of pay, depending on the level of unemployment in their states.
Congress later renewed the extension program twice. But workers were allowed no more than 59 weeks of benefits, so many who have been unable to find jobs for more than a year have now exhausted their benefits. Mr. Reich said the Administration was considering granting benefits to these people as well as to other workers who had lost jobs more recently.
 
Disagreement by Economists
 Economists are divided over the wisdom of extending coverage again at this time. Some say the added spending will be counterproductive, driving up the budget deficit at a time when the economy may be generating more new jobs on its own.
But others said that the last recession was unique because it drove many workers out of jobs permanently as companies closed or found ways to rely on fewer workers. They say the extended benefits will allow those workers more time to seek training for new kinds of work.
"All the forecasters are still talking about continued slow job growth," said Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a research group with ties to organized labor. "We're dealing with a job problem that makes this recovery unique."
Mr. Reich reiterated Mr. Clinton's campaign promise to raise the minimum wage by indexing it to the rate of inflation or letting it rise in line with increases in consumer prices, just as Social Security benefits do now. But he said that he first favored a straight increase in the wage, then indexing it from that point on. Mr. Reich said that he was speaking for himself and that the White House had not yet settled on a minimum-wage proposal.
Legislation to enact an increase is some months off, he said, because forcing an increase now may hurt companies that are still working their way out of the recession and discourage them from hiring as many people as they might otherwise. "Maybe you want to wait a little bit until the job situation improves," he said.

HEADLINE: Executive Brief: THE WHITE HOUSE;
Young Staff's First Steps Are Right Back in Time

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The staff members at the Clinton White House were still flush with victory from the campaign and recovering from a week of inaugural parties when they moved into their new digs last week. Then they saw the typewriters.
Most of the young staff had been reared on easy-touch computer keyboards, satellite dishes, voice mail and fax machines. They were horrified. 
 "This is the White House," said Dee Dee Myers, the press secretary. "It is a beautiful building, less posh than people would suspect and certainly with less space. But technologically, it's somewhere between Roosevelt and Truman."
At the Presidential campaign headquarters in Little Rock, Ark., Bill Clinton's aides could push one button and watch their candidate on satellite or pick up their phones and listen to him giving a live speech. News-service machines hummed on every floor, and the computers had three levels of electronic mail through which aides could communicate with each other and process requests from constituents.
To understand the culture shock, note this: One of former President George Bush's first tasks on retiring to Houston last week was to learn how to operate a computer, nearly a year after a first lesson in the White House was scheduled and then canceled.
Call the change generational. Call it cultural. The people at the White House are calling it "techno-shock."
"There is no technology at the White House," moaned a Presidential assistant as he left the Executive Mansion one night this week on his way to a working dinner.
Complaints about the White House by new occupants are a tradition dating from the 19th century. And most of the White House employees who are coping with adjustment hesitate to be quoted by name for fear that their criticism might be construed as kicking the Republicans when they're down.
"It's not nice to beat on them anymore, because we've already beat them," said one of these officials, who insisted on anonymity. But he added that by his computer-era standards the previous White House staff was "grossly inefficient."
Phone lines to the executive offices have been clogged for days, and one aide said he was shocked to discover that there were 65 phone systems feeding into the White House.
When senior aides want the latest news-service report, they have to hustle downstairs to the situation room in the basement of the West Wing, a paneled room that is a secure military command center full of classified material.
"The Republicans always said they wanted to run things like a business," said Paul Begala, a campaign consultant who will continue to help President Clinton under contract to the Democratic National Committee. "Instead, they were running it like Bartleby the scrivener."
The cost of preparing the White House for the 21st century might be prohibitive, and any changes would have to take into account the building's historical significance.
But White House officials said this was a hurdle that would be overcome.
"The first few days was complete techno-shock," Ms. Myers said. "But now we've had some therapy and are working through it."
 
Readying Work Space For the New First Aide
 At the West Wing, which houses the President's offices, workers are painting and hanging new drapes in the new second-floor offices of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the senior, unpaid domestic policy adviser who is also married to the President.
Mrs. Clinton's base will be the office that was last occupied by Janet G. Mullins, the aide to James A. Baker 3d who has emerged as a central figure in the investigation of Republican participation in the illegal search of Mr. Clinton's passport files.
A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton said she was unaware of the office's previous occupant.
Mrs. Clinton, a successful lawyer when she was in private practice, will be near the southwest corner office of the White House counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, and a few doors down from Carol Rascoe, the President's paid domestic policy adviser. Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, Maggie Williams, will move into an office used by a deputy White House counsel under Mr. Bush.
Mrs. Clinton's office, not one of the floor's cushier spaces, is being outfitted with new electrical outlets to accommodate a fax machine and a coffee maker. The bulk of her support staff will remain in the traditional East Wing offices of the First Lady.
 
From Cuba and Manila Bay To Caucuses in Des Moines
 Other changes on Pennsylvania Avenue: The White House's new tenants plan to re-create a highly successful and widely chronicled campaign tactic by opening a political "war room" on the first floor of the ornate 19th-century Old Executive Office Building.
The war room back in Little Rock served as a crisis clearinghouse, and it was there that political consultants posted the famous Clinton campaign mantra: "It's the economy, stupid."
The new version will be in the map room used in the McKinley Administration as a base of operations for the Spanish-American War. No word yet on a slogan for the wall.
Outfitted with televisions and fax machines, the room is expected to be less reliant on cutting-edge technology than the White House areas will become.
"The war room is more of a state of mind than a state of technology," said one White House official.

HEADLINE: Big Business in Turmoil

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
When the takeover raiders finally left the stage at the end of the 1980's, things were supposed to calm down in corporate America. But the steady stream of surprising announcements this week, from the departure of chief executives at I.B.M. and Westinghouse to the layoffs at Sears, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, underlines the continuing turmoil in America's corporate economy.
This time, instead of high-rolling financiers, the instability is being fueled by fast-changing markets. To be sure, there are a mix of forces at work at these name-brand corporations, including a sluggish economy, shifts in technology, new rivals, restive shareholders and suddenly uppity boards of directors. 
 "These cutbacks are largely the result of an intensification of competitive forces, so that companies can no longer make piecemeal changes," said Michael Porter, a professor at the Harvard Business School. "And most of the management changes are part of the same phenomenon. These are companies that didn't move quickly enough in the past."
For the Clinton Administration, the relentless attrition at big companies raises questions about the health of the economy and what policies to pursue. "Icon after icon in the American economy is falling," said Lester Thurow, an economist and the dean of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's graduate school of management. "That has got to hurt the economy by demoralizing workers and consumers."
Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich expressed a similar concern yesterday. In an interview on the NBC News program "Today," he noted some signs of strength in the economy, but added, "The employment picture is still very, very bad."
The consequences of the turmoil on so many factory floors and in executive suites are likely to extend well beyond the current economic cycle. Though it began years ago, the shrinkage of big companies now seems to be accelerating. That trend will affect the way companies are governed and how workers are treated in the future. Since World War II it has been large corporations that have set the standards for corporate management and labor relations.
Now, the notion that a person stays with a single company for decades, remaining loyal and receiving job security and ample benefits in return, is essentially a big-company concept that may be dying. In a fast-changing economy, where more and more companies try to remain small and nimble while farming out tasks to subcontractors, this old model of company-worker relations is far less prevalent.
"It becomes much harder in the modern world to guarantee things to employees for years and years," said Daniel Mitchell, a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles's graduate school of management. "That's okay for younger people, who no longer build their lives around stability. But that transition is very painful for someone who is 50 and has just lost a job at a company like I.B.M."
 
Domestic Competition
 In the past, when economists and business school professors spoke of competition, it was all but inevitably preceded by the word foreign, which usually meant Japanese. Today, the big companies being battered are more typically the victims of efficient American rivals, with novel approaches to their industries or innovative uses of technology.
Sears, Roebuck & Company, for example, has not kept up with retailers like Wal-Mart, Home Depot and others, in using computers to track sales, trim inventory and reduce costs. For its part, I.B.M. has been slow to adjust to the shift away from big mainframes toward increasingly powerful but less costly personal computers and work stations.
The companies that have created or successfully exploited shifts in technology, like the Microsoft Corporation, the dominant producer of operating software for personal computers, are producing jobs and wealth while the old-line firms are shrinking. By one estimate, the more than 2,200 people who have become millionaires -- on paper, at least -- by simply working for Microsoft and holding its stock outnumber the people who were made instant millionaires on Wall Street during the takeover boom of the mid-80's.
Whether the companies emerging as the new stars of corporate America will add jobs as quickly as some old-line giants are shearing them is doubtful. But a certain amount of turmoil is part of the cycle of renewal that is inevitable and ultimately healthy in a market economy, though undeniably painful for the workers affected.
All cutbacks are not necessarily a signal of management failure or proof that a company is locked in a cycle of inevitable decline. For example, analysts praised the Boeing Company's management for moving fairly quickly to cut back production of commercial jets in response to lower demand, a contraction that may eliminate as many as 30,000 jobs. And companies like I.B.M. are genuinely trying to change in order to regain their competitiveness, although their success is by no means certain.
 
Investor Pressure
 In the 80's, it was the threat of being taken over by a corporate raider that generated the pressure to change a company's strategy or its management team. But anti-takeover laws in some 35 states and reduced lending for corporate acquisitions has removed that threat for now.
Instead, the pressure for change is coming from large institutional shareholders, like pension funds and mutual funds, that lean on the outside directors on corporate boards. It was outside directors that played a prominent role in the top management changes at General Motors, I.B.M., Westinghouse and elsewhere.
"We're going to see more of that," said John Nash, president of the National Association of Corporate Directors, in Washington. "The board has always had the power to make these changes in theory, but now directors' feet are being held to the fire by the institutional investors."
Michael Jensen, a professor at the Harvard Business School, sees the active roles taken by big investors as the 90's version of the capital markets' trying to exercise some control over corporate America, serving as a kind of natural policeman over entrenched managements. In his view, it was corporate management excesses that created the opportunities for raiders in the 80's.
"Corporate changes are always driven by market forces," Mr. Jensen said. "It's just a question of whether the pressure comes from the capital markets or the product markets."

HEADLINE: U.S. Imposes Heavy Tariffs On Steel From 19 Countries

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In a victory for American steelmakers, the Commerce Department imposed steep, temporary tariffs today on steel imports from 19 countries, after determining that foreign companies were illegally selling steel in the United States for less than they did at home.
Today's rulings were the first big trade decisions under the Clinton Administration, although they were made by career civil servants following trade regulations rather than by Clinton appointees. 
 In a statement today, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown approached the issue gingerly. The rulings were not necessarily an indication of the Administration's trade policies, he said, but he added that "the Administration fully supports the rights of the domestic industry to obtain relief from unfair trade practices under U.S. laws."
 
Foreign Steelmakers Protest
 Foreign steelmakers protested today's decisions, but had already reduced steel shipments to the United States in anticipation. Industry officials said, however, that they did not foresee a shortage because of large inventories and overcapacity. But as foreign competition weakens, domestic steel prices have already begun to rise, and could eventually result in slightly higher prices for cars, refrigerators and other products made from steel.
The preliminary tariffs take effect immediately and the Commerce Department will set final tariffs, which may be higher or lower, by late spring. But before the tariffs become permanent, domestic steelmakers must also persuade the International Trade Commission, an independent United States agency, that steel imports are a significant cause of the industry's woes. Imports equal roughly a sixth of the United States market, which is also the amount of unused production capacity of the struggling American industry.
Domestic and foreign steel industry officials predicted that there would be tremendous pressure from foreign governments on the Clinton Administration to replace the tariffs with tonnage limits on steel imports. Foreign producers prefer the limits instead of tariffs because limits that restrict the supply of steel tend to raise prices, whereas producers pay tariffs themselves.
Tonnage restrictions, in place for nine years, expired in March and the Bush Administration refused to renew them, contending that tariffs would be better for world trade.
Today's rulings were in response to legal petitions by domestic steelmakers, which have been improving their productivity but have continued to lose money in a weak economy, especially as new factories open that recycle steel from scrap.
Foreign officials were quick to protest today's decisions. "This action is unwarranted and wholly disproportionate," said Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's Commissioner for External Economic Affairs. Steel from 7 of the community's 12 member countries came under today's rulings.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Japan said in a statement today that the American steel industry's problems were the result of domestic troubles rather than foreign competition. While the ministry did not provide any examples of these troubles, the American industry has been burdened with high pension and retiree health care costs, and has lagged its foreign competitors in developing cheaper ways to produce better-quality steel.
A senior Japanese official who insisted on anonymity said on Tuesday that while President Clinton was perceived in Japan as a supporter of free trade, aggressive remarks about trade policy by his Cabinet officials might be wrongly encouraging industries here to take advantage of American trade laws to seek tariffs on their competitors. The auto industry is preparing similar cases against imported cars.
The rulings cover $2.6 billion a year worth of imported flat-rolled and plate steel, which hold a sixth of the United States market for these products. The preliminary tariffs averaged 27 percent, while ranging from three-hundredths of a percent for plate steel from one Canadian steelmaker to 27 percent for corrosion-resistant flat steel from Japan and 109 percent for plate steel from Britain.
The tariffs imposed today are in addition to preliminary tariffs averaging 12.5 percent that the Commerce Department imposed last November on steel from 12 countries that were deemed to be subsidizing their domestic steel industries. The rule of thumb in the steel industry is that, at current price levels, a 15 percent tariff will price foreign steel out of the market.
"It's obvious that most imports will be suspended," said Yoshitaka Fujitani, the president of NKK America, the United States arm of the Tokyo-based NKK Corporation.
But the average level of tariffs disguises the fact that low tariffs were imposed on steel from Germany, Belgium and Canada; these countries may continue shipments.
The preliminary tariffs may be paid in cash or, more commonly, by posting a bond equal to the value of the tariffs owed. If the case is not settled, the next step will be for the Commerce Department to review the preliminary tariffs and set a final level of tariffs, which may be higher or lower, by late spring.
But before the tariffs become permanent, domestic steelmakers must also persuade the International Trade Commission of their case this summer. The commission is independent of Congress and the Administration and is composed of three Democrats and three Republicans.
If the commission rules against the domestic industry then the tariffs are canceled and all bonds are returned. The commission's rulings are commonly appealed to the courts.
If the tariffs today were calculated fairly then they are appropriate and legal, said William Cline, a free-trade economist at the Institute for International Economics. The world steel market is plagued by overcapacity and subsidized production by foreign, state-owned steel companies.
But Federal law for calculating the tariffs tends to favor the domestic industry, and the imposition of high tariffs today could result in overwhelming foreign pressure on the Clinton Administration to revive the old system of assigning different slices of the United States market to foreign countries, Mr. Cline added. Tariffs produce tax revenues, but are more likely to anger consumers and bring on trade wars.
William Lane, the trade specialist for Caterpillar Inc., a tractor producer and large steel user based in Peoria, Ill., said that the company did not object to the tariffs because it had long-term contracts with American producers already. But the company would object to market share deals, he said, adding that such pacts are, "nothing more than a plea bargain, where you allow the accused to participate in a price-fixing scheme."
The tariffs may never reach the final stage at the Commerce Department, as foreign governments begin lobbying the Administration for separate deals, which may include quantity limits on steel imports or minimum prices for them. Canadian officials said on Tuesday that Michael Wilson, Canada's trade minister, had tried in the last several days to persuade the Clinton Administration to make an exception for Canadian steel, which is closely integrated with the American industry.
"If you look at past history, no case involving a significant amount of trade has ever gone to finals -- this will be the first if it does," said Nicholas C. Tolerico, a former Commerce Department steel import administrator who is now the director of Federal relations of the LTV Corporation, a domestic steelmaker.
Mr. Fujitani said that the American tariffs poisoned the atmosphere for negotiations. "Nobody wants to negotiate with a counterpart who has a sword behind him and pretends to be friendly," he said.
Besides Britain, Canada and Japan, the other countries cited are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and Sweden.

HEADLINE: Blanche Bernstein, 80, Official Who Criticized Welfare System

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Dr. Blanche Bernstein, a prominent welfare expert and former government official whose criticisms of the welfare system provoked stormy policy debates, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.
She died of lung cancer, said Barbara Rulnick, a niece. 
 Dr. Bernstein argued that the welfare system's major failing is in fostering continued dependency for people receiving aid, instead of guiding them off the welfare rolls to independence.
"Reduction of dependency is the greatest unmet need in social policy today," she once said. "We have not gotten to the heart of the problem."
Her pronouncements often stirred opposition from other officials, experts and advocates. Some accused her of being unsympathetic to poor people and minorities, which she denied.
Supporters said her aim was to help the truly needy while paring cheaters and ineligible recipients from welfare and reducing erroneous overpayments.
 
High-Ranking Welfare Posts
 In 1978-79 she headed the nation's largest local welfare agency when she served as the city's Human Resources Administrator, with more than a million residents receiving aid. Mayor Edward I. Koch appointed and praised her as "terrific."
But during her term more than 100,000 people were pared from the welfare rolls. After she came under fire from a number of black officials, Mr. Koch named a deputy with superseding power over her, and she resigned. The Mayor's action was widely interpreted as a concession to soothe his frayed minority relations.
Dr. Bernstein also served as the State Social Services Department's deputy commissioner for income maintenance from 1975-77, under Gov. Hugh L. Carey. She was in charge of public assistance, food stamps and welfare job programs.
Later she recounted her battles and explained her policies in "The Politics of Welfare: The New York City Experience" (Abt, 1982), which Fortune magazine called "wonderfully instructive."
An economist, Dr. Bernstein earlier held policy posts in the State Department, worked for charities, was an educator and researched a wide array of social problems.
Among the issues she studied were foster care, the effect of welfare on family stability, obstacles to drug treatment for addicts, impoverished Jews, day care, obstacles to employment for welfare recipients, mental health care, welfare spending, family budgets and prenatal care.
 
Director at New School
 Dr. Bernstein focused increasingly on the growing and entwined problems of teen-age mothers, single-parent families, poor education, school dropout and unemployment. Unless society "breaks the cycle of dependency and poverty," she said, "we are in danger of creating a permanent underclass."
On leaving government in 1979, she became the director of the Social Policy Research Institute at the New School for Social Research. The institute studied welfare, housing, health care, child neglect and abuse and services for the aged.
After retiring from the New School, she remained in education as a trustee of the City University of New York.
Dr. Bernstein was born in New York City. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree and a doctorate in economics at Columbia.
Her survivors include a brother, Hilliard, of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
Timing Awry, Clinton Trips Into a Brawl

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Acknowledging that they underestimated the opposition in Congress and the Pentagon to homosexuals in the military, White House aides say the struggle has left President Clinton in an awkward test of wills on an issue that neither he nor gay-rights organizations had made a high priority.
As a result, at a moment when he is more interested in dealing with his economic agenda, Mr. Clinton has little choice but to expend precious political capital with Congress in pushing ahead on his campaign promise to end the military's ban on homosexuals. 
 Although the White House scrambled today to seek compromise with lawmakers, aides to Mr. Clinton made clear that he would not back down from his goal of reversing the ban and thus avoid being attacked either for breaking another campaign pledge or for abandoning his gay constituency.
But the course of events left some of Mr. Clinton's strongest supporters conceding that he miscalculated the political repercussions of his pledge from the start. Many argued that the President could have had an easier time if he had dealt with the ban last week, when he issued orders on abortion and other matters.
 
Wasting a Powerful Argument
 "If he had done it last week, it would have been one of five things," said Representative Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who sought to build Congressional support for Mr. Clinton's position. "There would have been some screaming about it, but not this media feeding frenzy."
She also said White House aides should have more convincingly argued to Congress that this was not only a civil rights issue but one of national security. "They didn't emphasize that it doesn't make sense for people who are handling the top secrets of the nation to be exposed to blackmail," she said.
Although the extent of public opposition to homosexuals in the military is impossible to judge accurately, there has been a far louder outcry in the past several days on the issue than there was during the campaign.
Mr. Clinton's move should have come as no surprise either to the military or to Congress: ending the ban was firmly and consistently listed as a campaign pledge, even if heraised the issue only sporadically on the trail.
 
A String of Misjudgments
 While gay organizations have long demanded that homosexuals be admitted into the military, their political efforts during the campaign were concentrated on raising money to fight the AIDS epidemic and on broader efforts to protect homosexuals against discrimination in housing and the workplace.
"I think it's something that we almost backed into," Mr. Clinton said when asked in an interview in August about his positions on matters important to gay Americans. While he said his proposal on homosexuals in the military would "frighten some Americans," he predicted that "if the American people will hear me out I have what I consider to be a basic, common-sense view of this."
What Mr. Clinton clearly did not anticipate then was that some people would try to expand his comments into a referendum on whether homosexuality is acceptable in America.
Nor did he appear to anticipate the eagerness with which Republican lawmakers seized on the issue to give him a political fight early in his Administration.
 
Powell as Antagonist
 Even more important, Mr. Clinton's advisers said, the President did not anticipate the depth of outrage among Democrats in Congress and the Joint Chiefs of Staff over an issue that to them was in many ways symbolic and, on its face, less complicated than practical matters like improving the economy. But the matter became so contentious that at a time of international crises, it dominated Mr. Clinton's first meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
In particular, said David Mixner, an adviser to Mr. Clinton on gay issues during the campaign, the new Administration never expected that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Colin L. Powell, would oppose the ban with such intensity, though his position has long been known.
"His failure to exert moral leadership has allowed this issue to grow into what it has grown into," Mr. Mixner said of General Powell. In the long term, he said, "I don't think it's going to hurt Clinton politically; people will respect that he kept to his word, stuck to his guns, standing up for unpopular issues. Isn't that a little bit of what Ross Perot was all about?"
But many gay-rights advocates complained that Mr. Clinton was naive in believing he could change people's minds on such a controversial issue, and they contended that he could have limited the debate by moving more quickly and forcefully.
 
'It's Killing Us'
 "This is an organized effort by the religious right to slap Clinton around in the first 10 days," said William W. Waybourn, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, a political action committee. "They've been beating it to death for the last 72 hours. It's killing us."
Marvin Liebman, a conservative who is a gay-rights advocate, said Mr. Clinton should have signed an executive order last week. "Clinton caused it to become an explosive political issue by inaction," he said. "The more you let these characters talk -- the military men like to flex their muscles -- the more trouble you're going to get with it. He's being pushed around by the military."
Mr. Mixner disagreed. "No politician," he said, "has used up more political capital on behalf of our community in the history of the country."

HEADLINE: Westinghouse Chief Steps Down

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Paul E. Lego, the 62-year-old engineer who presided over the collapse of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's finance subsidiary, announced yesterday that he was retiring after two and a half years as the corporation's chairman and chief executive.
The company's directors declined to name an immediate replacement and said it might look outside the company for one. But Richard M. Morrow, a member of the board and the retired chairman of the Amoco Corporation, was installed as the nonexecutive chairman. Gary M. Clark, head of the company's special operations group, was chosen president and acting chief executive and given a seat on the board. 
 Mr. Lego's decision to step down was but the latest in a series changes at the top of major American corporations. Just Tuesday, the International Business Machines Corporation announced that John F. Akers would soon step down as chief executive.
 
 
New Era
 And in recent months, Robert C. Stempel of the General Motors Corporation, Kenneth H. Olson of the Digital Equipment Corporation and Joseph (Rod) Canion of Compaq Computer have been ousted by directors.
The departures are indications, for one thing, of a new era in corporate governance, in which powerful institutional investors are putting pressure on long-passive boards to remove chief executives who do not meet their standards of financial performance. Other forces are at work, too, of course, such as the disappointing economic recovery and changing domestic and foreign markets.
At Westinghouse, Mr. Morrow said the board would commence searching for a permanent chief executive, pointedly saying that candidates outside the company would be considered along with Mr. Clark and other current Westinghouse executives. Westinghouse has traditionally promoted from within. Mr. Morrow said the board had not yet decided whether a new chief executive would be given the chairman's title as well.
 
 
Dividend Cuts
 As announced last fall, the board cut the common stock dividend 44 percent, to 10 cents a share from 18 cents. Last January, the dividend was reduced from 35 cents a share.
In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Westinghouse's share price gained 25 cents, to $14.
Mr. Lego, like Mr. Akers and the other chief executives under fire, was unable to reverse enormous losses. Whereas Mr. Akers's troubles lay in the rapidly changing nature of the computer business, Mr. Lego's were the legacy of a lending spree in the 1980's by Westinghouse Financial Services. The unit invested heavily in real estate, leveraged buyout securities and junk bonds, many of which have declined sharply in value.
As a result the company had to take a series of charges against earnings that produced losses of $1.096 billion in 1991 and $1.18 billion last year. In November, bowing to pressure from institutional investors, the company announced that it was getting out of financial services and would sell some of its profitable businesses to pay for the losses incurred by the unit.
The actions, which are scheduled to be carried out over a two-year period, will shrink the company by about one-third, to about $8 billion in sales from $12 billion.
At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Lego insisted that he had decided independently to retire and had not been asked to depart by directors. But he conceded that they had made no effort to persuade him to stay.
Analysts said whether he had decided to retire on his own or responded to signals from the board, Mr. Lego was affected by the recent willingness of large institutional shareholders to press for the ouster of chief executives of poorly performing companies.
"It is clear that Paul Lego is another casualty of the Westinghouse Financial Services problem," Kemp Fuller Jr., a vice president of RAS Securities, said. "He joins John Akers, Bob Stempel at G.M. and Ed Hennessy at Allied-Signal." Allied-Signal, in addition to the others, failed to satisfy investors that it was taking effective action to improve financial performance.
Analysts said Mr. Lego's departure was a positive development for the company, since Mr. Clark would be able to focus more on running Westinghouse's remaining businesses. The decision to name Mr. Morrow, an outside director, as chairman signals that the board intends to be more actively involved in evaluating management decisions, they said.
It was quite clear that Mr. Lego lost the power to designate his successor. Although he talked about "Gary Clark and his team" being in place to execute plans that Mr. Lego had made, Mr. Morrow made it clear in a separate statement that the board intended to look elsewhere for management talent as well. "Certainly Mr. Clark is a candidate," he said. But he said the board would evaluate "candidates outside the corporation."
 
 
'Full Support'
 Mr. Morrow said the board did not have a timetable for selecting a new chief executive, but expected to actively conduct a search. In the meantime, he said Mr. Clark had "the full support of the board."
Mr. Lego said Westinghouse decided to liquidate the financial services operation itself after negotiations to sell the portfolio to the GE Capital Corporation broke down last year. He said both sides agreed on the price, but could not agree on when Westinghouse's responsibility for the assets, some of which require additional lending, would end.
"It was like selling a hotel and then six months later asbestos is discovered," he said. "Who is responsible? It was that kind of thing." Mr. Lego said the company would realize greater value by selling the finance unit's assets by itself, rather than selling them as a package to GE Capital. However, he said such a package sale "would have looked better from the outside."
Mr. Lego said last year that he was all but forced to announce the liquidation of financial services when a relatively small, $55 million write-off in the third quarter brought protests from investors and sent the stock price plunging. He said the softness of the real estate market made it likely that there would be continuing charges, so he decided to announce all the bad news at once.
 The problems in financial services have dogged Mr. Lego almost from the day he took over as chief executive in July 1990. He spoke yesterday about "the problems I inherited when I became chairman." But he declined to blame his predecessor, John C. Marous, for the risky loans that pumped up profits when they were made, but which turned into financial disaster when the economy slumped. "History is history," he said.
Mr. Lego is a native of Johnstown, Pa.. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Pittsburgh and spent his entire career at Westinghouse, which has its headquarters in Pittsburgh.
He was named president in 1987 and was designated at that time as the successor to Mr. Marous, since the latter was due to reach retirement age in three years. Both executives spent most of their careers in Westinghouse's manufacturing operations and had little experience with financial services.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Backs Plan Of Clinton

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Giving his long-awaited blessing to the new Administration's program, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress today that he agreed with the "general thrust" of President Clinton's policies to speed growth with a modest short-term stimulus plan.
In his first public comments on the new Administration's plans, Mr. Greenspan said he did not believe the President's policies would overstimulate the economy, a move that could reignite inflation and push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to stop the economy from overheating. 
 Administration officials have been hungry for Mr. Greenspan's seal of approval because it would not only reassure financial markets but should also mean the Federal Reserve chairman will be in no rush to raise interest rates. On Tuesday, Administration officials said they were likely to increase deficit spending by about $20 billion this year to spur growth and create jobs.
 
Still Sees Problems
 Mr. Greenspan, often called the nation's most powerful economic policy maker, appeared to see room for some stimulus because he said there were still many problems preventing robust growth, including big corporate layoffs, consumer debt burdens and cuts in defense spending.
"Although a number of economic indicators are distinctly encouraging, this is not to say that we have clear sailing ahead," Mr. Greenspan told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
In a week when Pratt & Whitney, Sears, Roebuck and other large corporations have announced big layoffs, Mr. Greenspan said there was virtually no job growth during this recovery and forecast that corporations would continue large layoffs.
Noting that he had breakfast today with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Mr. Greenspan said he was heartened that the new Administration favored "maximum sustainable growth," a technical phrase that Federal Reserve officials use to mean growth that is not so fast that it will reignite inflation.
 
Stresses Common Ground
 Although Mr. Greenspan's remarks are often hard to decipher, he appeared to take pains to say that he saw eye-to-eye with the Administration on several issues.
"The general thrust of the policy of this Administration is not different from that which I expressed in my prepared remarks -- that is, to sustain maximum sustainable growth over the long run," he said. "What it is we do not want to do is get into the stop-go type of instabilities which have so characterized many of our periods in the past. I think neither we, nor President Clinton, would basically subscribe to that view."
 Several Clinton aides have voiced fears in recent weeks that the Federal Reserve might push up interest rates if growth picked up to well above its current rate of 3 percent. For their part, several Federal Reserve officials said privately that they had feared the Clinton Administration would embrace too large a stimulus plan of, say, $60 billion in increased deficit spending this year.
At today's hearing, the lawmakers welcomed Mr. Greenspan's cooperative tone, but several warned the central bank not to raise interest rates soon because that could crimp economic growth when job creation has been minuscule.
Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who is the new chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said, "It would be a sad irony indeed for the country to have voted to end the gridlock in economic policy between the Congress and the President only to find it replaced with a new gridlock between an Administration and Congress committed to stronger growth and a Federal Reserve restraining growth by keeping its foot on the monetary brakes."
 
Agreement on Deficit
 Mr. Greenspan appeared to give a subtle vote of confidence to Mr. Clinton's vague plans to cut the budget deficit. He noted that "the evidence that that President Clinton" has "very seriously focused on this long-term budget deficit has impacted" on financial markets and helped pull down long-term interest rates.
Cautious as always, Mr. Greenspan said that "economic activity has been increasing at a firmer pace of late," but he added that "we are still not out of the woods."
He was optimistic about inflation, noting that the underlying inflation rate, after excluding volatile changes in food and energy prices -- was 3.3 percent in 1992, a full percentage point below the 1991 rate.
Responding to a question from Mr. Obey, he said, "If you're asking me do I think that the inflation rate is likely to accelerate any time soon, the answer to that is, I will stipulate, probably not."
Mr. Greenspan said the cascade of large corporate layoffs could jeopardize the recent gains in consumer confidence. He added that further strong increases in consumer spending were "not very likely in the absence of a sustained pickup in income growth," which usually does not happen without job growth.

HEADLINE: Taxes on Household Employment

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Although Zoe Baird ran into political trouble principally because she hired illegal aliens as household workers, her other offense -- not paying taxes on their earnings -- is an even more common practice.
Anyone who pays a household employee more than $50 in a quarter is required by law to arrange for payment of Social Security and Medicaid taxes, which are shared by the employer and the employee. And if a household worker earns more than $1,000 in a quarter (or about $80 a week), Federal and often state unemployment taxes are due as well. Federal income tax need not be withheld from the worker's pay, although some employers do withhold it. 
 Employers could hire an accountant to handle the work for a modest price. Or they could take a few hours to learn the system and, by marking the calendar, could complete the task within an hour or two every three months and a few additional hours at the end of the year.
A simpler filing process, which was included in broader tax legislation that was vetoed last year, is likely to be enacted this year. Under the existing system, employers of domestic workers are supposed to file quarterly forms by Monday because the normal deadline, Jan. 31, falls on Sunday. Employees are also supposed to have received their 1992 wage statements, showing the amounts earned and withheld, by Monday.
People who have not been complying with the law might be hard pressed to meet that deadline, but I.R.S. officials said that it is a good time to come into compliance. The agency is taking a gentle approach these days to those who seek help with compliance. Although penalties may be assessed for past transgressions, the agency will often arrange to spread out the payments.
Calls to the I.R.S. toll-free number for assistance or problem resolution (it's listed in most telephone directories under United States Government) usually get a polite reception.
People who employ illegal workers can still obey the tax law, and in the meantime help the worker apply for legal status.
The employer must fill out all the tax forms and deposit all the tax payments. If the employee has no Social Security number, "SSA 205(c)" should be written in any space where the number is requested. That's legal shorthand for saying that the worker is not allowed to have a Social Security number.
If you get letters asking about this matter, simply write that the worker is not eligible under the law for a Social Security number. The Government will either drop the matter or issue a number, which doesn't make it legal for the employee to work but keeps the computers happy. Because of privacy rules, such correspondence should not result in prosecution of the worker or the employer.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Paying At-Home Help"
Anybody who pays a household employee like a a babysitter, caretaker, cook, gardener or maid, more than $50 a quarter must report the payments to the Internal Revenue Service and pay certain taxes. You do not have to withhold Federal income taxes, although you may do so if the employee requests it. Here are some of the forms involved in meeting the employer's obligations.
 
Application for Employer Identification Number.
 
The indentification number is required by the IRS used by the employer whenever forms are completed.You can apply in writing, ask for a number by phone, or simply mark "none" on forms that ask the number. The I.R.S. will then assign a number and notify you of it. Other forms will then be sent automatically.
 
Application for a Social Security Card.
 
If your employee does not have a Social Security number, he or she must obtain one using this form.
 
Employer's Withholding Allowance Certificate.
 
If you agree to withhold income tax from an employee's paycheck, the employee must fill out this form so that you can calculate how much to withhold.
 
Advance Payment of Earned Income Credit.
 
If your employee has a child, earns less than $23,050 a year, and requests this benefit, a Federal program that aids the working poor, you must obtain this form from the employee and pay the credit in advance with each paycheck. Every payday you make the advance payment to the employee from the withheld taxes that you would otherwise pay the I.R.S. The payments are reported on form W-2 at year end.
 
Employer's Quarterly Tax Return for Household Employees.
 
This simple, eight-line form must be filed four times a year. On it you record the wages paid to the workers and the taxes paidfor Social Security, Medicare, and the income taxes, if you withhold income tax for the employee.
 
Employer's Annual Federal Unemployment Tax Return.
 
This is a tax paid by the empoyer to help fund unemployment compensation. Most household employers can use the short version of this form, 940-EZ. For small amounts, this tax can be paid annually, but if the amount owed by the employer is more than $100 at the end of any quarter, it must be deposited then. Most states also have an unemployment tax -- and separate state forms are required -- but payments to the state can be credited against those to the Federal government.
 
Wage and Tax Statement.
 
This form must be given to the employee by January 31. It summarizes all wages paid and taxes withheld in the prior year.
 
Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements. This tells this Social Security program what the worker earned.y March 1, this must be sent to the Social Security Administration along with Copy A of Form W-2.
 
To Receive tax forms and publications, call the Internal Revenue Service at the toll-free number found in the U.S. Government listings in most telephone directories. Ask for Publication 926, Employment Taxes for Housefhold Employers, and Publication 937, Employment Taxes and Information Returns.

HEADLINE: Regulation Isn't Halting Loans, U.S. Aide Says

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The Government's top auditor today warned Congress and the Clinton Administration not to hastily loosen banking regulations to spur lending and stimulate the economy.
In testimony rebutting some recent arguments by banking-industry leaders that excessive regulation was crimping lending, the Comptroller General, Charles A. Bowsher, told the Senate Banking Committee that "the current system of bank regulation as a whole does not undermine the economic incentive for a bank to make sound loans." 
 President Clinton and his economic advisers have spoken favorably of the idea of reviewing banking regulations to see if relaxing them would reduce credit restrictions affecting small business.
And banking-industry lobbyists are mounting a vigorous effort to change regulations they consider most burdensome, like ones that help regulators verify that banks are lending to clients in the communities where they take in deposits.
 
Bankers Who Don't Lend
 Critics say that recent regulations, including those required by the bank deposit insurance law enacted in 1991, make it difficult for bankers to justify commercial and industrial loans to some customers, while rewarding the banks for investing in Government securities.
Mr. Bowsher, who heads the General Accounting Office, was instrumental in advising Congress as it tightened regulations in the wake of the widespread failures of some banks and of many savings and loan institutions. He said today that it was unfair to blame the new laws for the difficulties that some borrowers are having in getting loans.
"Congress, the Administration and the financial regulators should exercise great caution in considering short-term measures to encourage more liberal lending practices by insured institutions," he said in a written report submitted to the Senate panel.
Many banks are reporting record earnings, largely because the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates allows them to profitably invest deposits in Government securities. That has made banks' total investments in Government securities higher than in commercial and industrial loans, the first such occurrence in 27 years.
Mr. Bowsher cautioned that many banks still held problem loans. And he argued that there were factors other than Federal regulation behind the heavy bank purchases of Treasury obligations in preference to making business loans.
First, he declared, is relatively low demand for commercial loans, something he said had been induced by the recession.
Second is the trend among corporate borrowers and banks to correct "the excessive reliance on debt in the 1980's."
Third are more demanding standards being applied to real estate loans, which he called an appropriate response to "the disastrous experiences of many banks and thrifts with this type of lending in the 1980's."
Finally, he cited the continuing loss of market share by banks in the face of competition from finance companies and other sources of credit.
Bankers depict the situation differently. Leland M. Stenehjem Jr., president of First International Bank of Fargo, N.D., said at a Washington news conference on Tuesday that "the regulatory burden is costing banks a bundle, and it is hampering our ability to lend."
Mr. Stenehjem was presenting a study commissioned by the Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents smaller community banks, that found that the nation's 9,600 community banks spend about $3.2 billion a year to comply with 13 Federal regulations. The cost, the group said, was equivalent to nearly a quarter of pretax income.
Some of the Senate panel members expressed sympathy for the bankers' views. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, both berated Mr. Bowsher for not acknowledging what they said were serious problems with heavy regulation.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
A First Step Toward an 800-Seat Jet

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
The Boeing Company and the four leading European aerospace companies took the first step today toward jointly building a superjumbo airliner capable of carrying up to 800 passengers.
The five companies reached an agreement after several months of negotiation that calls for the European companies -- partners in the Airbus Industrie consortium, the world's No. 2 aircraft producer -- to conduct a one-year study with Boeing, the industry leader, of the demand among airlines for such a plane. 
 The trans-Atlantic joint venture, potentially the largest international deal by far in an industry rapidly seeking out global alliances, will also study the antitrust implications of the partnership, the technical problems of building an aircraft far bigger than the 400-passenger Boeing 747, and the ability of the companies to work together.
If the program goes ahead into full-scale development and production -- a decision the companies said would not be made for at least six months -- the new plane would probably come into service around the turn of the century. The main customers are likely to be airlines flying between the United States and Asia and between Europe and Asia.
 
Unlikely Partners
 Both Boeing and Airbus, which has grown rapidly in the last five years to supplant the McDonnell Douglas Corporation of St. Louis as the industry's No. 2, have been interested for years in building a huge new aircraft, although until recently they seemed unlikely to do it together.
Boeing and Airbus have been increasingly bitter rivals, with Boeing arguing that Airbus's success has been built on billions of dollars of subsidies from the Governments of France, Germany, Britain and Spain. The European companies are Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, British Aerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.
But Airbus and Boeing have been driven together on the superjumbo project by the immense costs involved. Developing such a plane could cost $10 billion or more, an amount that industry executives said no single company could afford, especially during a period of slack demand for new planes from recession-racked airlines. Boeing said on Tuesday that it would slash production of the 747 and its other planes because of a lack of new orders, cutbacks that will lead to an estimated 15,000 layoffs from the Seattle-based company.
The superjumbo program would be particularly risky because initial assessments by Boeing suggest that airlines would ultimately purchase no more than 600 of the planes, and perhaps as few as 300, small numbers given the necessary investment. By contrast, Boeing has sold nearly 1,200 747's and more than 3,000 of its smaller 737's.
"The limited potential market combined with the costs of developing a plane of unprecedented size makes it a riskier proposition than launching any other Boeing airplane," said John Hayhurst, a Boeing vice president who is in charge of the company's efforts to build a superjumbo. "Because of the limited market and because we think the market can only accommodate one airplane of that size, we thought it would be worthwhile to consider spreading the risk among a number of companies."
The study phase of the joint venture, which the companies said would involve only small expenditures, will be headed by Mr. Hayhurst and by Jurgen Thomas, the head of research and development at Deutsche Aerospace. The companies said they had made no decision on what ownership stakes they might take in the venture if it went forward. But analysts said the initial structure suggested that Boeing would like to own 50 percent, commensurate with its status as the industry leader, with the European companies splitting the remainder.
Boeing has close ties to the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan, and has been discussing their involvement in a superjumbo jet for some time. Mr. Hayhurst said those discussions were continuing, and he said he would not rule out participation by Japan or by other nations in either the study phase or in any eventual production.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Mostly Higher In Relatively Light Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose in listless trading yesterday against all currencies but the Canadian dollar.
Gold prices fell in domestic and European markets after rising in Asia. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $329.90 a troy ounce, down $1.20 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold lost $1.40 an ounce, to a late bid price of $329.60. 
 The dollar gained in Europe and continued to advance when trading shifted to United States markets. But analysts said the dollar was confined to a relatively narrow range against most currencies and that trading was uneventful.
"There was a lot of technical trading," said Kevin Lawrie, a dealer with Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "There's a lot of big positioning with fund managers, corporate dealers, and that's pushing the market rather than" interest rate differentials.
Mr. Lawrie said there was little reaction to the Congressional testimony yesterday by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. Mr. Greenspan said he believed the long-awaited economic recovery was gaining strength but warned of a host of problems that remained unresolved.
 
Dollar at 124 Yen in Japan
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.00 Japanese yen, up 0.10 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, it rose to 124.10 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 124.10 yen, up from 123.55 yen on Tuesday.
The British pound continued to drop after Tuesday's surprise one-point cut in interest rates by the Bank of England.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5145, from $1.5355 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.5105 to buy one pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.5380.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5865 German marks, up from 1.5770; 1.4630 Swiss francs, up from 1.4530; 5.3700 French francs, up from 5.3310; 1,485.50 Italian lire, up from 1,450.00, and 1.2683 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2713.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $330.40 a troy ounce, from $330.95 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $330.30 from $331.00. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.91 to close at $331.06.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money Market Fund Yields Were Mixed in Latest Week

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Yields on money-market funds were mixed in the latest week, reflecting a steady Federal monetary policy and the normal year-end effect on yields.
The average yield on tax-exempt funds rose, while the yield on taxable funds was unchanged. 
 According to IBC/Donoghue's Money Market Fund Report, assets of tax-exempt money funds fell by $2.4 billion, to $100.9 billion. The average number of days to maturity of securities held in tax-exempt fund portfolios was unchanged, at 55 days.
 
Tax-Exempt Yield: 1.87%
 The seven-day average compounded tax-exempt yield rose 14 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 1.87 percent. The simple yield rose 13 basis points, to 1.85 percent.
Over a 30-day period, the average compound and simple yields were both down 18 basis points, to 2.14 percent and 2.12 percent, respectively.
Not assuming state taxes, the taxable equivalent of the seven-day compounded tax-exempt yield of 1.87 percent is 2.60 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, while the equivalent for investors in the 31 percent tax bracket is about 2.71.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said that Dreyfus Basic Municipal was the best-performing fund, with a seven-day compounded return of 2.63 percent.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, said that the rise in tax-free yields reflected the outflow of assets from money funds.
"The yields have dropped so low that people are once again switching out of funds into higher-yielding long- term tax-exempt bonds." he said.
 
Taxable Fund Assets Up
 Meanwhile, yields in taxable money market funds were unchanged from last week, as assets increased by $6.4 billion, to $488.6 billion. The average number of days to maturity of securities held in taxable fund portfolios increased by one day, to 60 days.
The major reason for the assets increase was the continued return of institutional assets, which rose $9.2 billion last week. Meanwhile, noninstitutional fund assets fell by $2.8 billion from last week.
"It is normal for institutional investors to get back into taxable funds at this time of the year," Mr. Frank said. "But the public is switching to both bonds and stocks for higher yields."
Mr. Frank said that he expected rates to hold firm in the week ahead. "The immediate outlook is that yields have returned close to a level that we expect to hold for some time," he said.
 
Taxable Yield: 2.81%
 Both the seven-day compound and simple average rates for taxable funds were unchanged, at 2.81 percent and 2.77 percent, respectively. For 30-day average rates, both compound and simple rates fell one basis point, to 2.87 percent and 2.83 percent, respectively.
Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, distributed by Olde Asset Management Inc. in Detroit, remained the top-yielding fund with assets over $100 million. But its yield this week slipped to 3.71 percent, down four basis points from 3.75 percent a week ago.
By comparison, the average bank money account was 2.74 percent, unchanged from last week, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
If cars become trucks, the middle class may bear the freight.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHILE Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen acknowledged this week that the White House was agonizing about a middle-class tax increase to pare the deficit, Mr. Bentsen was not advertising the fact that the Treasury could soon impose a new tax aimed squarely at the middle class with the stroke of a pen.
The catch: Most of the revenue would end up in the pockets of Detroit's auto makers, which are reportedly pressing on a variety of fronts for a helping hand from Uncle Sam. Well, make that catches. The tax -- actually a tariff on imported mini-vans and Jeep-like sport utility vehicles -- would further sour economic relations with Japan and distract from the "strategic" trade issues in high technology. 
 The levy, on the agenda of the first meeting of President Clinton's new National Economic Council, which will most likely be held in early February, would come innocently packaged as a Customs Service reclassification of some 200,000 imported "multipurpose vehicles," like Toyota's Previa mini-van and Mitsubishi's Montero, as trucks rather than passenger cars. The resulting increase in the duty to 25 percent, from 2.5 percent, would add thousands of dollars to the imports' sticker prices. More ominous, it would give Detroit's Big Three, which already have more than 80 percent of this market, a freer hand to raise prices.
This tale, no joke, began with the Great Chicken War of 1962. When West Germany tripled duties on imported poultry to please its European Common Market partners, America retaliated with a batch of tariffs that applied to all countries, but were really aimed at the Europeans. The bird battle was settled long ago, and most of the retaliatory tariffs have been rescinded by Presidential order. But the 25 percent light-truck tariff, initially aimed at Volkswagen, is still on the books. And it gives Detroit an edge against Japanese rivals who were innocent bystanders in the chicken war.
Irony has since been piled on irony. As a favor to American makers of mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, Congress initially classified these newly popular vehicles as trucks in order to exempt them from strict auto emissions and safety regulations. And while hardly anyone -- certainly not the ad agencies -- thinks of Dodge Caravans or Ford Explorers primarily as commercial cargo haulers, Detroit has been using the break it got on safety and emissions standards as a wedge to demand that the Treasury reclassify the almost entirely Japanese competition as high-tariff trucks.
The Bush White House offered an arbitrary concession to Detroit in 1989, applying the 25 percent truck rate only to sport utility vehicles with just two doors. But the issue arose again in the 1992 elections. In September, Congress barely defeated a bill to do for Detroit what George Bush would not. And in the last week of the campaign, with polls tightening in Michigan, Clinton-Gore strategists ran a television ad deriding President Bush for giving "the Japanese an unfair advantage over our trucks, and our workers."
This is not a policy question that generates a lot of head-scratching among mainstream economists. "There is no argument for a developed country to protect old-line producers of middle technology with a 25 percent tariff," declares Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution.
Moreover, the 25 percent could mean real money for middle-class families, the sort that use their $15,000 mini-vans to cart around three tots, four bags of groceries and scads of old newspapers bound for recycling. Even "buying American" would not exempt consumers from the inflationary clout of the import reclassification. Citizens for a Sound Economy, a nonprofit Washington group that lobbies against economic regulation, used earlier academic studies of auto protectionism to project that Detroit would raise multipurpose vehicle prices by 40 cents for every extra dollar of tariff -- an average of $1,300.
Is the deal wired, as reports following President-elect Clinton's private Jan. 5 meeting with auto executives suggested? Maybe not. When pushed on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" on Jan. 17, Al Gore responded that "no commitment was made" at the auto meeting. And there are reasons to believe that Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the newly appointed chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, will oppose the change. Ms. Tyson, known as advocating "cautious activism" in trade policy, may want to take pains to differentiate the championing of American cutting-edge technologies from garden-variety protection of an influential industry undergoing hard times.
In the end, of course, the choice will be President Clinton's. His decision could say a lot about how he plans to cope with conflict between the old, blue-collar constituencies and the suburban pragmatists, who apparently voted Democratic this time because they were frustrated by stagnating living standards.
Mr. Clinton has long argued that globalization of the economy cannot be slowed, only better molded to American interests. That mold would be hard to fashion on the precedent of a long-forgotten food fight with Europe.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pay Gains in '92 Trailed Inflation Rate

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Americans' pay failed to keep up with rising prices in 1992, the Government said this week. Including benefits, however, overall compensation did outpace inflation.
The Labor Department said its employment cost index showed that total compensation -- wages, salaries and benefits -- rose 3.5 percent last year, the smallest increase since the Government began computing the index in 1982. 
 In 1991, total compensation rose 4.3 percent.
While 1992 compensation surpassed the 2.9 percent rate of inflation, wages and salaries did not, edging up 2.7 percent. That, too, is the smallest advance since 1982.
Wages and salaries, which represent about 75 percent of worker compensation, rose 3.6 percent in 1991, outpacing the 3.1 percent inflation rate that year.

NATO on the Brink

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Looking southward in 1876, Bismarck of Germany, borrowing a phrase from Frederick the Great, recoiled from Continental responsibility: "The Balkans are not worth the healthy bones of a single Pomeranian musketeer."
Many Americans today feel the same way. What the rapacious Serbs have been doing to the Bosnians is horrible, and what the Croats are now doing to the Bosnians as they get even with the Serbs is almost as bad -- but what do all these ancient hatreds have to do with us? 
 Our inclination is to translate Bismarck's isolation into Lyndon Johnsonese: "I don't have a dog in this fight."
But when television brings film of suffering into our homes, and rescue workers and journalists report rapine and genocide, Americans are moved to a more principled position. We say human-righteously: You Europeans ought to do something about the evil rampant on your own Continent.
So European leaders hold peace talks to legitimize current conquests. They loosely apply economic sanctions. They send in peacekeepers to provide humanitarian aid, treating the victims rather than confronting the perpetrators. The U.N. labors over imposition of meaningless flight restrictions.
Result: Aggression is rewarded and war spreads in the former Yugoslavia.
American public sentiment is now becoming prepared for another half-step: to allow the Bosnians to arm themselves and die for their country. We may even provide air cover and satellite intelligence for European troops, and threaten to bomb Serbian artillery now killing civilians.
Today, the essential American message to Europe seems to be: If you take the lead, we'll help, but our help has to be technological and not the sort that generates outcries of opposition.
This qualified offer to hold Europe's coat does not go over well with our allies. They much prefer that the superpower take the lead in the Balkans, which would give them political cover at home; barring that, they wish some hawkish Americans would stop talking about serious military response, because it may jeopardize the present conscience-salving treatment of the symptoms.
That's the state of play as the Clinton Administration takes its place at the world table. Here are three facts that face our new policy makers:
1. Collective security is no longer limited to defending national borders; a nascent understanding grows that ethnic minorities are entitled to international protection.
2. Europeans are capable of being shamed into taking action to enforce this new concept of collective security, but unless America does the active shaming, Europe's leaders will shrink from their responsibility.
3. America, if it is to have the standing to call for effective action, must be ready to share the risk. We should be prepared to help pose a threat on the ground as well as in the air -- perhaps as a symbolic part of a muscular NATO force that could be assembled in Macedonia, protecting that region as well as the ethnic Albanians who live in Serbia's Kosovo. This would not be a vulnerable contingent riding shotgun for the Red Cross; it would be a powerful deterrent ready to counterattack ethnic cleansers.
American public opinion is far from ready for this. Is President Clinton, so eager to begin domestic innovation, ready to begin preparing the ground for such a foreign commitment?
To do so, he must ask his aides: Why isn't the Pentagon working with allies to prepare a battle plan that might intimidate local aggressors into settlement without war? He must also ask France, Germany, Britain: Are the stable nations of Western Europe prepared to offer the carrot of economic incentives to the Balkans and to other impoverished peoples to the south and east?
We are entering the season that will decide whether NATO lives or dies. A misstep could cost lives; inaction will cost lives and an alliance. America cannot impose its ideals on its allies, but if the nations of Europe are unwilling to defend their innocents, those nations can hardly expect America to help defend their borders.

HEADLINE: Break the Billion-Dollar Congress

BYLINE: By Joseph A. Califano Jr.; Joseph A. Califano Jr., president of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, was Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare from 1977 to 1979 and President Lyndon B. Johnson's assistant for domestic affairs from 1965 to 1969.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The members of Congress elected in November join the first national legislature that private interests have paid more than $1 billion to put in place. So long as they need private financing for future campaigns, these elected officials are not likely to slap the wrists of the hands that delivered the money, much less get into a bare-knuckled fight with their political action committees.
If President Clinton and the Democratic Congress are serious about ending gridlock, the first law to pass is not an economic package or national health plan. It is legislation to provide public financing and set limits on spending in Congressional races. 
 Private interests and PAC contributors have acquired veto power in key committees over proposals that threaten them. They spent $314 million for the 1992 House elections and $581 million on the 1988, 1990 and 1992 elections that produced the current Senate. Back-door support and money raised by political parties added at least $100 million last year alone.
So long as private money clogs the corridors of power, any economic package President Clinton gets from Congress will include the same payoffs to PAC's that the House and Senate stuffed into the 647-page tax bill George Bush vetoed last year.
Campaign finance reform is also the first hurdle for any health-care legislation. Lyndon Johnson was the only President with the political strength and savvy to drive major health reform through Congress. But he had to pay the private pipers to enact it.
In 1964 Johnson couldn't get the Senate Finance or House Ways and Means Committees to move his bill. Late that year he mustered the votes on the Senate floor to attach Medicare to a House bill raising Social Security benefits. But the House would not accept the Senate bill. So shortly before the 1964 election, he killed the Social Security increase. He wanted popular pressure for the increase to help get Medicare through the next Congress.
Johnson then won by the greatest landslide in U.S. history, carrying into office a two-to-one Democratic majority in the House. Yet to cobble together a House Ways and Means Committee majority for Medicare and Medicaid, Johnson had to abandon the authority his bill gave the Government to set medical reimbursement rates. He was compelled to agree to pay doctors "reasonable," "customary" and "prevailing" fees -- something commercial insurers had refused to do because it gave physicians power to raise their own fees.
Almost immediately, Johnson pressed to change the payment system. Without action, he predicted, health costs would be $100 billion by 1975. Pressured by industry lobbyists, Congress failed to act. By 1975, health care costs hit $133 billion.
Compare President Clinton's situation, even with the help of his wife, whom he named to head the health reform task force this week. Mr. Clinton won a mere 43 percent of the vote. He faces a more sophisticated industry of well-heeled insurers, doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies, unions, H.M.O.'s and nursing homes. Health PAC's handed out an estimated $22 million in 1992 political contributions, evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. And the President faces a complex financing system, an aging population and a technological revolution that require a far more intricate legislative fix.
Mr. Clinton has the benefit of demand for reform from citizens and businesses. A shrewd and tenacious politician, he has the best shot to reshape the health care system of any President since L.B.J. What a shame it will be if he fails to clear out the PAC mines before he sets foot on the legislative battlefield.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Avoiding Carter's Mistakes

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Bill Clinton may not know it -- and certainly won't like to hear it -- but much of what he has said about foreign policy echoes Jimmy Carter's campaign themes and policies. This coincidence merits the new President's attention -- for voters booted Mr. Carter after four years, in good part because of his troubles abroad.
The rhetorical similarities are startling. Both Democrats courted the liberal vote by stressing a new agenda in world affairs: promoting human rights and democracy, curbing the spread of nuclear and conventional arms, emphasizing centrality of international economics, promising cuts in military spending, etc. 
 Both appealed to conservatives by preaching toughness: the Georgia Governor slammed Henry Kissinger for being too soft on Moscow about human rights and strategic arms; the Arkansas Governor repeatedly suggested that he'd be even harder on foreign outlaws than President Bush.
The big difference, of course, is that Mr. Clinton does not have to worry about the cold war. Mr. Carter stumbled badly in trying to downplay the Soviet-American rivalry at the very peak of its crescendo.
Mr. Carter failed mainly because of confusion and weakness in his Soviet policy. He faltered elsewhere not because his ideas were wrong, but because he never packaged them strategically and coherently. He also flopped because he never understood the politics of foreign policy.
Mr. Carter's most evident flops -- doing little to deter crises in Iran and Afghanistan -- were no worse than those of his Republican successors. Ronald Reagan sent the Marines to Beirut to protect U.S. "vital interests," only to withdraw them without explanation after 241 troops were killed in a terrorist attack. Against common sense and his stated policy, he traded arms for hostages with Iran. And George Bush coddled Saddam Hussein, flattering him and giving him grain credits right up to the moment he invaded Kuwait.
Meanwhile, Mr. Carter's successes were about as impressive as the Republicans' over the next 12 years. Mr. Reagan "conquered" Grenada and ushered in the Gorbachev revolution. Mr. Bush "vanquished" Panama, helped ease the death of Communism and earned a genuine triumph building the Desert Storm coalition.
Mr. Carter pulled off the Panama Canal treaties, full ties with China, a strategic arms accord with the Soviet Union and the invaluable Camp David peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. He also concluded a major free trade agreement and pushed human rights and democracy to the top of the U.S. policy agenda.
Yet these accomplishments never loomed as large as they should have. They seemed isolated and ad hoc, unilluminated by a grand design. Nor did he prepare Americans or allies for failure by spotlighting dangers ahead or explaining how his strategy would accommodate setbacks.
Unlike Mr. Reagan, Mr. Carter did not understand the need to smother fiascos with bold new action. The day after the terrorist attack in Beirut, the Old Gipper invaded Grenada. Unlike Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Carter did not know how to ignore his failures and exaggerate his successes.
In particular, Mr. Carter's farsighted new agenda for world politics lacked an anchoring overall strategy, and thus looked both radical and incoherent. He never laid out how he would press unsavory allies on human rights without undermining their regimes. He tried to halt the proliferation of arms without first laying the necessary groundwork. He failed to show how his innovative policies fit together and profoundly affected people's lives.
Mr. Carter's disinclination to be tough and appear tough also proved self-destructive. The arbiters of "toughness" -- principally Republicans, media stars and foreign leaders -- quickly portrayed him as weak. That reputation invited everyone's challenge. Worst of all, Mr. Carter rarely exacted a price from his detractors at home or abroad.
Like Mr. Carter's, Mr. Clinton's instincts seem to be conciliatory. But he insists that he appreciates the value of toughness. Many of his allies wouldn't mind a demonstration volley against a political adversary.
Unlike Mr. Carter, Mr. Clinton always talks about something he calls "strategy." But it seems more like general themes followed by lists. A strategy explains why something needs to be done -- and how.

HEADLINE: We Have to Break Persian Gulf Oil Habit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As an epilogue to Leslie H. Gelb's superb "Iraq Balancing Iran?" (column, Jan. 17), there is yet another cogent reason for decreasing, even abandoning, our dependence on Persian Gulf oil. 
 As unbelievable as it appears, several months ago when the spot price of oil oscillated between $20 and $21 a barrel, the real total price that it cost our country (now hold your breath) was $90 a barrel.
Just as the total price one pays for a mail-order catalogue purchase adds on postage and handling, the cost of maintaining our fleet in the Persian Gulf to insure safe passage must be prorated over every gallon we import.
This figure comes from the Center for Defense Information, which is headed by Rear Adm. Gene LaRoque of the United States Navy (retired) and staffed by other former top-level military personnel. Their expertise and patriotism are unquestioned.
Two of our closest allies, Japan and Germany, are much more dependent on Persian Gulf oil than we are. Their defense budgets over the years have been less than 1 percent of their gross domestic product. Ours have been five to six times greater. They are both creditor nations, while we have the unenviable distinction of being the largest debtor nation in the world.
Among the myriad problems confronting the Clinton Administration, the Department of Energy should make one of its top priorities a much more vigorous approach to conservation and alternate energy sources. Tens of billions of dollars are just begging to be saved to help reduce our deficit.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH -- Michael Lebron;
The Adman as Artist (Or Is It Vice Versa?)

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Michael A. Lebron wants to spend $100,000 of his own money to spread some of his most personal political beliefs across a 1,000-square-foot billboard at the mouth of Pennsylvania Station, in a piece of art that he has nurtured for more than two years. But he insists -- absolutely insists -- that he doesn't much care if anybody knows that he's the one behind it.
"I don't like to have my work personalized," said Mr. Lebron, 38, a freelance advertising art director, who for a decade has used the methods of Madison Avenue (and his credit cards and savings) to make political art in public spaces in New York and Washington. "I like to think of my work as being styleless, without any stylistic identity or trademark to it," he said. 
 If there is a trademark to Mr. Lebron's work, it may be that he wants to display it in places others don't want to let him use. In a case that went to trial yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, he is suing Amtrak over its refusal to let him use the 103-foot billboard in the lobby of Pennsylvania Station, known as the Spectacular, to lambaste the controlling owners of the Coors Brewing Company for their support of conservative political causes.
So far, this work -- a striking parody of a Coors beer ad, with 20 photographic images blended by computer into a high-gloss whole -- exists only as a three-foot backlit mockup in the bedroom of Mr. Lebron's loft in a former pet-food warehouse on Cooper Square in the East Village. Yet, to hear him talk about it is to see it hanging high, greeting -- and, he seems to hope, unnerving -- tens of thousands of commuters a day.
But unlike Gladys Glover, the aspiring celebrity played by Judy Holliday in "It Should Happen to You," who plastered her name on a billboard at Columbus Circle just to be noticed, Mr. Lebron is no mere self-promoter. This compact polemicist, whose baby face, pony tail and granny glasses make him look like a cross between John Lennon and Radar O'Reilly of "M*A*S*H," does not even sign his work. He just copyrights it in the name of ATW (for "Against the Wall") Communications.
"I like to think that I create work in such a way that I use whatever visual and textual elements are necessary to communicate an idea," he said one evening last week in his large, sleekly arranged living room. "And to the extent that it's possible, to reduce my identity or personality as an artist."
"There's something," he said, then paused, "facile, I guess, about trying to say that 'Well, I'm not important,' because obviously I'm the one who's doing it and not somebody else. But my personality should not be the issue." The next day he called his visitor to say the word he'd been groping for was "disingenuous," not "facile."
Mr. Lebron (pronounced luh-BRUN) calls his work social realism for a "consumer, corporatist society" in which advertising is the medium of mass idealization. He says his goal is to recreate previously available information in more visually arresting forms. He is nothing if not serious, about his work and himself, though it takes him such a while to warm to both subjects that an interviewer at first worries he is too laconic for productive conversation.
"He's very serious," said Gloria Phares, one of his lawyers. "He loves to talk -- especially about himself. I think he has a sense of humor."
But, she added, "I don't think he has a sense of humor about this."
Mr. Lebron's mission requires an ordered life. He stresses that he works 12- and 13-hour days in advertising to finance his art. He shares his tidy lair with two cats and a woman he will identify only as Sylvia.
At the center of his current artistic vision is a silver beer can, wrapped in flame and hurtling like a missile, propelled out of the heedless, smiling faces of American consumers into a street of huddled Nicaraguan villagers, under the words: "Is it the right's beer now?" -- a reference to some Coors family members' support for the contra rebels who fought the Sandinista Government and a play on the company's lite-beer slogan, "It's the right beer now."
But whether this vision will be shared with the public remains to be seen. Mr. Lebron had a contract with Amtrak's leasing agent, but Amtrak has the final right of approval and late last month, the railroad told him its policy prohibited political ads on the Spectacular, which now celebrates Levi's "Loose Jeans."
Amtrak is a private corporation, but because it gets about 20 percent of its budget from the Federal Government, and its directors are appointed by the President, Mr. Lebron contends that its billboard is more like public property than private enterprise and that it therefore cannot give preference to the commercial speech of Levi's over the political speech of Lebron. Oral arguments were heard yesterday by Judge Pierre N. Leval, who presided at the trial of Gen. William C. Westmoreland's libel suit against CBS.
Mr. Lebron has a few notches on his own belt. In 1984, he won the right to display in the Washington subway posters that used a photomontage of Ronald Reagan and his economic advisers at a table, with the President smiling and pointing at a cluster of dispossessed citizens (actually Mr. Lebron's friends, who posed on his roof); the caption said, "Are you tired of the Jellybean Republic?"
His champions in that case included a three-judge Federal appeals court panel of sterling conservatives: Kenneth W. Starr, who became Solicitor General of the United States; Antonin Scalia, who went on to the Supreme Court, and Robert H. Bork, who wrote the opinion upholding Mr. Lebron's right to show the work -- a blow for free speech that was cited by many of Judge Bork's defenders in the unsuccessful fight to confirm his nomination to the Supreme Court.
The current case is considerably more complex and involves reams of records and financial ganglia growing out of the bankruptcy of the old Penn Central Railroad that led to Amtrak's control of the station. Amtrak spokesmen declined to comment on the case, citing a policy of not discussing pending litigation. But in court papers, its lawyers contend that Amtrak is a private entity, with no obligation to display political advertising. Moreover, they assert that Mr. Lebron showed the content of the ad to the leasing company only after he had already signed the contract because he was concerned that they might never have signed it had they known.
Even if Amtrak is forced to let Mr. Lebron display the work, he would undoubtedly face more objections from Coors, which might sue for trademark infringement or libel. John M. Meadows, Coors's director of community relations, said it was awaiting the outcome of the current case before deciding what to do.
Of Mr. Lebron's contention that the work is an allegory on American power and not an attack on Coors per se, he said, "Well, it certainly is an attack."
Mr. Lebron seems discomfited at belonging neither fully to the world of art nor to that of advertising. Even most avant-garde galleries are uninterested in his art. "The response," he said, "has mostly been that it's too utilitarian, or looks too much like advertising.
"Or maybe, they just think I'm a bad artist."
This visual anarchist grew up in rural New Jersey, the son of an export-traffic clerk. After graduating from Cooper Union in the mid-70's, he spent three years as a calligrapher, engraving corporate testimonials and certificates (where he was paid "like a monk in an abbey") before working his way into advertising art direction.
For the last eight years, he has freelanced, mostly working on ads for prescription pharmaceuticals, a discipline that requires copious research and documentation -- which helps explain why footnotes speckle the text of his Coors parody. He said he "just sort of fell into" this field, but that "with hindsight, it probably wasn't an accident."
"I was probably instinctually gravitating toward it, because I'd be hard pressed to imagine myself doing ads for, you know, dog food and that sort of thing," he said. "And then the work is pretty regular and stable and pays pretty well."
That is an important consideration, since he has no patron. If this project goes through, he said, he will have spent about $170,000 over the last decade, more than half of it on his current effort. The two-month rental of the billboard alone would cost $36,000, while, he said, his income varies but is less than $100,000 a year.
"It's fair to say that I make enough to be able to do this," he said. "It's just that instead of buying a condominium or sports car or whatever, I do this."
Though he has received government subsidies for some projects, he has not this time.
"Unlike Amtrak," he said.

HEADLINE: Texas Bank Sold by U.S. To Chemical

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
In an indication that the nation's banking industry and the Texas economy are returning to health, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said yesterday that it had sold the 20 banks of the failed First City Bancorporation of Texas for far more than expected, mostly to the Chemical Banking Corporation.
The F.D.I.C. had estimated that the Bank Insurance Fund would lose $500 million rescuing the banks, which the Government seized on Oct. 30.
But the bids were so much higher than expected that the deal will not cost the fund anything. Indeed, uninsured depositors and possibly First City shareholders will get more money than expected -- potentially as much as $60 million.
 
Terms of Transactions
 Chemical's Texas Commerce Bankshares unit will pay $346.8 million for First City's banks in Houston, Dallas and three other cities, which have a total of $4.4 billion in deposits and $6.6 billion in assets. Eleven other companies will pay $87.6 million for 15 banks in smaller Texas cities. 
 The cost to the banks making the acquisitions will be higher because they will have to cover some or all the cost of future losses from First City loans. The buyers will also have to put fresh capital -- roughly 5 percent of assets -- into the banks.
For the Dallas and Houston banks, the F.D.I.C. has agreed to cover 80 percent of the losses from $2.1 billion in commercial loans, up to $82 million, and 95 percent of losses above that. Marc J. Shapiro, president of Texas Commerce, said he expected the losses to run higher than the $82 million level.
The Federal agency has been using this sort of loss-sharing arrangement on sales of failed banks for about a year. Before that, it covered all loan losses, including on the sales of the other major Texas banks in trouble.
The Government was able to get banks to accept a higher percentage of the loan losses here, and to bid more than expected, because of the improving economy and also because of a broad network of banking-industry contacts, said Harrison Young, director of the F.D.I.C.'s resolutions division said.
"We were not a forced seller," Mr. Young said. "We were able to generate an enormous amount of competition. We worked very hard at it. The timing turnout to be fortuitous. A lot of people think that it's a great time to expand in Texas."
The amount paid for the Texas banks was far more than in any previous Government sale of a failed institution. Chemical's bid, for example, represents 7.8 percent of First City's deposits. The winning bidders for Southeast Bank in Miami and the Bank of New England both paid less than 1 percent of deposits.
Frank Anderson, an analyst with Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, remarked, "I can't remember a bank paying this high a premium -- even 3 or 4 percent is pretty rich."
Chemical says the deal will improve its profits within a year because it will be able to cut costs by eliminating 1,700 of First City's 3,700 jobs and closing 24 of 58 offices.
Chemical's bid reflected the fact that First City was the largest remaining independent bank in Texas and presented an opportunity for Texas Commerce, the third largest in the state, to increase its market share. "This is the last significant transaction in Texas," Mr. Shapiro said.
Moreover, with the economy improving there, First City's assets may not have been as hard to sell as the F.D.I.C. expected. Some investment bankers who examined the deal said the price Chemical paid, while high, was fair.
"No one ever overpaid the Government and I don't think First City is any different," said Gerald Smith of Salomon Brothers, who specializes in banks. He said that Texas Commerce Bankshares, already the largest bank in Houston and the third largest in Dallas, has the economies of scale to make First City profitable.
That Chemical was allowed to make this acquisition is a sign that regulators are pleased with the improvement in the bank's condition after its merger with Manufacturers Hanover in 1991, Mr. Smith said. "This is a signal that Chemical is back," he said. Last year Chemical improved its capital position and earned $1.1 billion.
The outcome of the sale means that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is likely to avoid the politically embarrassing action of having to rescue First City depositors a second time. In September 1987, the agency committed $970 million in assistance to an investor group headed by A. Robert Abboud. But amid continued loan losses, regulators ousted Mr. Abboud two years ago, and in October took control of the banking network.
Uninsured depositors with more than $100,000 in accounts at three of the First City bank units -- in Dallas, Austin and San Antonio -- could recover all their money as a result of the higher bids, Mr. Young said. The original terms set by the F.D.I.C. put the recoveries at 80 cents on the dollar. The F.D.I.C. said today that it would increase that by 10 cents on the dollar. Uninsured depositors at the Houston subsidiary, however, are still likely to suffer losses because of large real estate write-offs charged against assets there.
Mr. Young said the surplus from the sales would be distributed to creditors and shareholders of First City Bankshares, which is now in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Jan. 28 about the sale of the First City Bancorporation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation misstated the circumstances of the dismissal of the bank's chairman, A. Robert Abboud, in 1991. He was dismissed by the bank's board, not by Government regulators.
