HEADLINE: Tiny Songbird Poses Big Test Of U.S. Environmental Policy

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA, Calif., March 12

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is facing the first test of its promise to save endangered species and serve economic interests. And the instrument of that test is a four-inch-long songbird that meows like a kitten and lives in what is left of the coastal sage scrub of Southern California.
The blue-gray bird, the California gnatcatcher, has emerged as a national symbol of a possible new method of saving such species while preventing what Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt calls "national train wrecks" like the dispute over the northern spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest.
 
Looking for Compromise
 In a rare arrangement, developers, conservationists and Federal and state officials are working together to preserve an entire ecosystem, rather than haggling over emergency measures prescribed by the Endangered Species Act to save single species. 
 They are trying to find a compromise in which developers would be allowed to destroy parts of the birds' habitat if they agree to set aside enough crucial land to sustain the bird and the ecosystem in which it lives. The theory holds that this approach will protect not only the gnatcatcher but also other associated plants and animals before they become endangered, thereby averting repeated legal battles over them. Last month, Mr. Babbitt told a Congressional hearing that he considered the California plan a model for the nation.
But before the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, part of the Interior Department, has had a chance to work out an agreement with the developers, it faces a Wednesday deadline to rule on whether the gnatcatcher is endangered or threatened. So the new Interior Secretary is likely to let the deadline pass, Federal and state officials say, allowing more time to study the delicate issue.
The success of the new method is crucial in this increasingly urbanized state, where the potential for environmental conflicts probably looms larger than anywhere else in the country. The gnatcatcher makes its home in about 250,000 acres of the most valuable real estate in America, prime housing land in Orange, San Diego and Riverside Counties. Thousands of construction and other jobs are at stake in the region, which is suffering its worst economic slump since the Depression.
While the sides are working out the details of the gnatcatcher plan, major landowners like the Irvine Company and the Santa Margarita Company in Orange County and Newland California in San Diego have voluntarily stopped further destruction of the parts of their land that sustain the gnatcatcher.
 
A Favored Alternative
 Federal wildlife officials have indicated that when they do reach a decision they would consider listing the gnatcatcher -- Polioptila californica californica to scientists -- as threatened, a lesser classification that could offer more flexibility to cooperate in the California plan than would be possible under the stringent rules protecting "endangered" species in the Endangered Species Act.
The concept of protecting the homes of multiple species is fast becoming the favored alternative to decades of conflict under the act over saving individual species. It is being studied to revive the Midwest prairie ecosystem, and already local governments in San Diego County are well advanced in establishing four such habitats in that area.
Mr. Babbitt's spokesman in Washington, Jay Ziegler, said the Secretary "looks at the process in California as a good example of the kind of collaborative problem solving we need across the country to balance the need for sound ecosystem planning and economic progress."
Originally proposed in 1991 by Gov. Pete Wilson the California plan is called the Natural Communities Conservation Planning Program. The outcome of the gnatcatcher dispute is being closely watched for lessons when Congress votes on reauthorizing the Endangered Species Act this year.
Probably no other state faces more environmental demands and disputes than California. Decades of water pumping have brought the winter-run chinook salmon and delta smelt to the brink of extinction, forcing major diversions of water away from irrigated farms. Two-thirds of the 2,350 species that are candidates for Federal listing are in California.
 
Hurdle of Federal Law
 "The conflict between the needs of people and species is only going to increase," said Michael A. Mantell, Under Secretary of the California Resources Agency, which oversees the new conservation plan. "This plan is a way to resolve it before a crisis hits. Once a species is on the list or about to be listed, the options are very limited. This is an attempt to get ahead of the curve, to take an entire ecosystem and work with local governments and landowners to allow for a species to flourish while providing for economic development."
A crucial question, he said, is whether the Federal Government will or can cooperate, since the law does not allow the Government to make agreements governing land use until after a species is listed as endangered or threatened. "This is the initial test of how the new Administration wants to go on single species management versus ecosystem planning," he said.
But even within California, getting cooperation from competing interests will not be easy. Though they have participated in the planning process, environmental groups remain wary.
"In theory it's a good program, but in practice it has not amounted to much yet," said Joel R. Reynolds, a lawyer in Los Angeles with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which petitioned for the endangered listing, along with Jonathan Atwood, a Massachusetts ornithologist. "There have been negotiations for two years, and the gnatcatcher has not been protected. We have refused to drop our petition because the threat of listing is driving the collaborative process."
Indeed, the big developers concede as much. "Developers want to be able to see the future," said Laer Pearce, executive director of the Coalition for Habitat Conservation, which, despite its name, is financed by big landowners fighting the gnatcatcher listing.
"One road is an endless chain of species-listing petitions in which they will always be paying attorneys and biologists to fight," Mr. Pearce said. "The other road is to pay up front, to look at all the habitat and all the populations, set aside enough land and say the species is protected and then say none of the other populations are important to the protection of the species. It is very costly, but it frees up land."
Environmentalists contend that up to 90 percent of the gnatcatcher's scrub habitat has been destroyed, leaving only 2,000 pairs of the birds in California. Developers have challenged that assertion and have sued to thwart the endangered listing on the ground that the bird is not a separate species but the same species that flourishes nearby in Baja California in Mexico.
Still, the Resource Agency says more than 70 private landowners and local governments have placed a voluntary moratorium on development and other activities on 77,000 acres of the chaparral-like sage scrub favored by the gnatcatcher until next November in four counties. Even with the moratorium, more than 2,000 acres of habitat were bulldozed between August 1991 and last April, the Fish and Wildlife Service says.
Later this month a special state-sponsored scientific review panel is expected to issue guidelines governing the amount and distribution of development for the next five years while the habitat is studied. During that time, developers are to stay away from areas with heavy concentrations of rare plants and animals.
 
Preferable to Legal Costs
 It is unclear how the guidelines will be enforced, but Richard M. Broming, vice president of the Santa Margarita Company, said his company preferred such compliance to the costly legal and scientific work to get permits under the Endangered Species Act.
The company, which owns 40,000 acres of gently rolling scrub country between the Santa Ana Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, hopes to develop more than 6,000 acres for more of the manicured "planned communities" like Mission Viejo and Rancho Santa Margarita, built earlier out of what was once a cattle ranch.
Though environmentalists embrace the multiple-species habitat concept and are cooperating in the state plan, they are skeptical. Dan Silver, coordinator of the Endangered Habitats League, a coalition of conservation groups, said the state plan had been "hijacked" by developers with close ties to Governor Wilson, that they had enrolled lands for habitat preservation that they did not plan to develop anyway and that the emerging compromise had little teeth to enforce compliance by private or public landowners.
"There really is no area out there that is not under development threat," he said.
Underlying the dispute is the question of how a developer will be compensated for land that is ruled crucial to an ecosystem. While land swaps are possible, money, a scarce commodity here, will undoubtedly be needed.
The issue is also complicated by plans to build a 17.5-mile toll road in Orange County from Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano. On Feb. 26, the Fish and and Wildlife Service said the road posed no jeopardy to the species.
The Building Industry Association of Southern California and the Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies, which are planning toll roads in the area, have asked for a preliminary injunction to prevent the wildlife service from listing the gnatcatcher. A hearing is scheduled in Federal District Court in Washington on Tuesday.
In all this, many people are hoping the Clinton Administration can bring the encouragement to bring the sides together. "The tough part is to create something that never existed before," said Stephen P. Johnson, director of land management for the Nature Conservancy in California. "One of the bright spots is that the Clinton Administration is thinking in the same direction as the state. The state was already there. Now it's just a matter of getting all these sides together."

HEADLINE: U.S. Gives Britain a Warning In Approving USAir Deal

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
The United States today approved a $300 million investment by British Airways P.L.C. in USAir Group Inc., but warned that the British carrier would not be able to increase that stake unless American carriers receivedgreater access to British airports.
The announcement, by Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena, signaled a tough new approach to foreign investment in America's airlines. 
 Mr. Pena also announced plans to renegotiate the aviation agreement between the United States and Britain, which he said placed American carriers at a disadvantage.
"The U.S. Government must take an assertive position to defend the rights of U.S. carriers abroad and work toward a global level playing field in aviation," Mr. Pena told a news conference.
Mr. Pena's remarks follow stiffening economic competition between the United States and Europe and a series of tough positions taken by the Clinton Administration on trade policies.
Last Friday, Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, promised to restrict European access to Government contracts in the United States, in retaliation for a new European regulation giving preference to European companies for government contracts. In January, the United States announced import tarrifs on European steel in retaliation for what it called European subsidies of its steel industry and unfair pricing.
Aviation holds a special place in these disputes because the industry is heavily subsidized and involves both high-technology and manufacturing jobs. Last month, President Clinton vowed to take a tougher approach toward Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, because of what he considered unfair government subsidies.
The nation's airlines, which lost $10 billion in the last three years, are increasingly looking abroad for cash. USAir, the nation's sixth-largest airline, has 46,000 employees. Last November, the Bush Administration approved a request by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to merge its operations with Northwest Airlines, after completion of an "open skies" agreement under which each nation's carriers could fly where they wished in either country. Continental has a relationship with Air Canada, and Delta Air Lines has a relationship with both Swissair and Singapore Airlines.
Today's decision will have an impact far beyond the question of access to Heathrow Airport in London, said Kenneth Quinn, a former chief counsel to the Federal Aviation Administration during the Bush Administration who is now with Mercer Management Consulting.
"It's a watershed event in the airline industry," Mr. Quinn said. "This cements British Airways' position as a global mega-carrier, and will increase pressure on the Big Three U.S. airlines to form competing global alliances."
One matter of concern in the USAir plan has been whether the United States can allow substantial foreign investments in its airlines and still retain control of the industry.
"Our preliminary finding is that the $300 million investment by British Airways does not impair USAir's 'citizenship,' " Mr. Pena said.
He suggested that his approval of British Airways' initial investment would put pressure on Britain to open up its airports. The arrangement "binds the parties to work for an amicable agreement," he said.
Some aviation experts believe that Britain knows it has to allow greater American access to British airports, although few expect an "open skies" agreement.
 
Opposing Voices
 The British Airways' proposal to invest in USAir had been strongly opposed by the strongest American carriers -- American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta. American said today that Mr. Pena's action gave the British carrier "inappropriate, insuperable and, by any standards, unfair competitive advantages."
Robert L. Crandall, chairman and president of American, said the agreement "will have an adverse impact on the U.S. international trade balance."
"Moreover," he continued, "it will shift passengers, revenue, profits and jobs from U.S. carriers to British Airways at a time when the U.S. economy and U.S. workers need active and vigorous support."
But some aviation experts contended that the other carriers were trying to increase pressure on the Administration to pursue a new round of American-British negotiations.
Clark Onstad, a Washington aviation lawyer who is a former airline executive and chief counsel of the F.A.A., said, "The real test of this arrangement is not in code sharing or the initial investment, but whether the United States and the British can reach a more liberal bilateral agreement."
Under the agreement approved today, British Airways will receive 19.9 percent of USAir's voting stock and the authority to name 3 of USAir's 16 directors. The American carrier's domestic market will be linked with the British carrier's international destinations under a system called code sharing for a one-year test.
 
Legal Obstacle
 British Airways plans to invest $200 million more within three years for a total of 34 percent of USAir's voting stock, and $250 million more within five years for a 44 percent stake. These additional investments would require a change in American law, which limits overseas investors to 25 percent of an airline's voting stock and 49 percent of its equity.
Some Congressional leaders believe that Congress should relax these restrictions only if foreign carriers reciprocate.
The General Accounting Office, the research arm of Congress, has found that a major reason for the restrictions -- protection for a fledgling industry -- no longer applies. But national security may still be an issue, the office said, recommending that the Department of Defense be required to study the issue.

HEADLINE: Clinton Promises Rabin He Won't Cut Aid to Israel

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Despite pressure to cut foreign aid as he reduces domestic spending, President Clinton assured Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel today that he would oppose any attempt to reduce military and economic assistance to Israel for years to come.
Senior aides said that Mr. Clinton pledged to continue current aid levels not just in the coming budget as Secretary of State Warren Christopher said last week, but in the years to follow. The aides also suggested that if Israel made peace with its neighbors, it would be compensated even further for its sacrifices, just as both Israel and Egypt were guaranteed hefty American aid packages after the 1979 Camp David treaty. 
 "The President made it clear that we would make our best efforts to maintain those levels beyond those years," a senior White House official said, referring to the period beyond the 1994 fiscal year, for which a budget is now being planned. "And of course, if there is indeed a breakthrough to peace in the region, I think that will transform the environment, and there's a sense in which the United States would then be prepared to help compensate Israel for the risks it would take to make peace."
 
Effort to Prove U.S. Friendship
 The assurances were part of a deliberate attempt to prove to Mr. Rabin in his first meeting with President Clinton that he not only has a friend in the White House, but a particularly close friend. A striking feature of their joint news conference today was that the President, unlike his predecessors, made no conciliatory gestures to the Arab side to balance his pro-Israeli remarks.
Shortly after Israel deported 400 Muslim fundamentalists to Lebanon in December, Mr. Clinton, as President-elect, criticized the action, saying he was concerned that it might imperil peace talks. At the time, the balanced statements were welcomed by Arab countries and the Palestinians, who were worried that the new President would favor Israel.
But when he was asked today about the expulsions, Mr. Clinton said bluntly, "We did not discuss that.
"As far as I'm concerned, the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister reached an agreement on that," he said, a referring to a compromise Mr. Rabin and Mr. Christopher struck last month to speed the return of the deportees.
Last week Palestinian leaders rejected an American and Russian invitation to a new round of peace talks in Washington next month, saying Israel had to resolve the deportation issue first.
Mr. Rabin and Mr. Christopher have predicted that the Palestinians will come to the two-week talks, which are to begin on April 20, but the Palestinians still hope to persuade Washington to further speed the return of the deportees and to extract a pledge from Israel to end such expulsions. But in choosing not to address the issue, Mr. Clinton is sending a clear signal that such pressure will not be forthcoming.
 
An Arab Journalist's Question
 At another point in the news conference, an Arab journalist told Mr. Clinton that "the Arabs think that you favor Israel against them," and asked, "What are you doing to balance this situation?"
Mr. Clinton replied that Mr. Christopher had taken a consistent message to all parties on his recent trip to the Mideast and that the United States "can be counted on to keep our word" if an agreement is reached.
Mr. Christopher, during his discussions with Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem last month, pledged to work with Israel to improve its human rights record in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, but Mr. Clinton did not say whether he had raised the issue today.
If today's meeting is any indication, the President and the Prime Minister will get along much better than their predecessors did. Tension today seemed limited to the effect of the new White House no-smoking policy on the chain-smoking Mr. Rabin during three and a half hours of meetings and lunch.
Before addressing reporters, Mr. Rabin extended his hand and offered a smile to Mr. Clinton, gestures that for the normally taciturn, all-business Israeli war hero are the diplomatic equivalent of a tight embrace. Contrary to the reservations he has expressed about an expanded American role in the peace negotiations, in his prepared remarks today Mr. Rabin said that he had heard "with satisfaction" the American concept of "the role of full partner as an intermediary," adding, "Mr. President, you will find us to be full partners."
 
Israel's 'Qualitative Edge'
 For his part, Mr. Clinton nodded with apparent approval when Mr. Rabin said that Israel would not be able to "win the battle for peace without a qualitative edge" over its neighbors' military forces.
During their appearance together, Mr. Rabin said he was "ready for compromise" and repeated his offer to surrender part of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights to Syria. But he reiterated the position he has often stated that Israel would not negotiate a withdrawal of troops from the strategic plateau territory without knowing Syria's peace terms in advance.
Mr. Clinton endorsed Mr. Rabin's conditions, saying that any peace must include open borders between Israel and Syria and full diplomatic relations, and pledging to maintain Israel's military edge over the Arabs as an inducement for a settlement.
Mr. Rabin also thanked Mr. Clinton for promising to oppose any cuts in aid to Israel, which totals $3 billion a year. That aid and the $2.1 billion that goes to Egypt account for 36 percent of the American foreign aid budget.
"We do appreciate and greatly value the decision to maintain the current level of aid to Israel," Mr. Rabin said. "This decision will help us integrate new immigrants into our society and to bear the heavy burden of our security."

HEADLINE: Elderly Care: The Insurers' Role

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
The insurance industry believes it has one answer to the high cost of health care: policies to cover home and nursing home care for the elderly.
The trick is to get young Americans to buy these policies now, just as they buy life insurance policies, and spread the heavy costs over many years. 
 In fact, many companies have begun to sell such policies, which have become the fastest-growing type of health insurance sold in recent years.
"The key issue is that this nation is going to be in big trouble if we try to fund this on a pay-as-you-go basis," said David E. Hughes, a senior vice president of the UNUM Corporation, an insurer based in Portland, Me. "The private sector can play a crucial role here, particularly if Americans start to think about this problem years before they retire."
But consumer groups are skeptical. They have attacked private long-term care as deceptive, vulnerable to inflation and appropriate only for the most affluent Americans, perhaps less than 20 percent of the aging population. In addition, they question whether insurers can estimate accurately what long-term care will cost decades from now.
"Private long-term care insurance is a good option for some people, but is not the answer for everyone," said Susan Polniaszek, director of national services for the United Seniors Health Cooperative, a consumer group in Washington. "It is certainly not the answer for financing long-term care for the country. Individuals have to ask whether they can really afford it."
By all accounts, the costs of long-term care are mammoth, and growing quickly.
In 1990, long-term care cost $42 billion for Americans in nursing homes and $8 billion for care at home, not counting care given by family and friends, said Donald M. Charsky, the president of Life Plans, a long-term care consulting company in Walthham, Mass. By 1992, he calculated, nursing home costs had jumped to $50 billion and home care costs to $10 billion.
 
2020: $500 Billion a Year
 If current trends continue, Mr. Charsky estimates the nation will be paying $500 billion a year for long-term care in today's dollars by the year 2020, when the baby-boom generation becomes the elder boom.
In 1900, only 4 percent of the population was over 65, according the Census Bureau. In 1990, 12.5 percent of the population was. By 2050, 20.6 percent of Americans will be over 65. And many of those people will be forced to seek long-term care.
At age 65, a person stands a 40 percent chance of spending some time in a nursing home, and a 23 percent chance of living in a nursing home for a year or more. Costs of nursing homes average $30,000 a year and go as high as $100,000 a year in some urban areas. In addition, the cost of a visit by a so-called home aide, who might help with bathing or dressing, averages $50 nationally. Visits by trained nurses average about $100.
Nursing home costs are already taking a terrible toll on Federal and state governments. Contributing to soaring Medicaid are the nursing bills for middle-class people who "spend down" their life savings so that they qualify for Medicaid -- a program designed for the poor -- to pay their nursing bills. In spending down, people either sell their assets or transfer them to family members.
Officials of the President's Task Force on National Health Care reform have disclosed that the Administration is contemplating a new, Federal Government role in the long-term care problem.
 
Financing a Problem
 Some aides have urged a Government-subsidized program that could cost as much as $34 billion over the next four years, reports say, although one Administration official, asking for anonymity, said the financing for such an extensive program was unlikely to be found. Another possibility is Federal encouragement or assistance for buying private insurance.
New York State recently announced a partnership with private insurers to make private long-term care policies available. The program, which would help many people avoid reducing their assets to qualify for Medicaid, follows a similar program in Connecticut and is being contemplated by other states.
At issue, though, is just how much of the job the private insurance companies can do.
In the last six years, more than 100 private insurers have rushed into what they see as a potentially enormous market. Since 1987, the industry has sold more than 2.4 million policies. Last year, the policies accounted for $1 billion in premium sales, up from virtually nothing a decade ago. And large companies and state governments are increasingly offering employees the option of buying the policies.
Although other major insurers like Aetna, CNA and Amex Life, an American Express company, have entered the field, the industry estimates that less than 5 percent of the elderly and 1 percent of the population have bought long-term care insurance.
 
Not a Pressing Thought
 In part, the reason is that even now, few people think about nursing care and home care until they approach retirement and the premiums for long-term care policies -- like some types of life insurance -- are far cheaper when the insured is younger.
The Health Insurance Association of America says the average annual premium charged to a 50-year-old by leading long-term-care companies was $852 in 1991. Such a policy pays $80 a day for nursing home stays, $40 a day for home care and offers increased protection to keep up with inflation at a compounded rate of 5 percent a year. For a 65-year-old person, however, premiums were roughly double.
By its estimate, some 60 percent of all elderly Americans can afford private policies. The Health Insurance Association said 61 percent of those with long-term insurance paid less than $1,000 a year for premiums.
But Ms. Polniaszek of the United Seniors consumer group in Washington says that the costs of long-term care insurance are prohibitive for the majority of Americans, even for those in their 50's.
A person 68 years old will pay on average $3,400 a year for a well-designed policy, according to her group's research.
"At several thousands dollars a year," Ms. Polniaszek said, "if you don't have much in the way of assets you could spend all your assets to protect your assets."
Ms. Polniaszek argues that the policies are advisable only for people with significant assets to protect: a minimum of $40,000 to $50,000 for individuals, more than $100,000 for a couple. (Medicaid will pay for nursing home care and still allow a married couple to protect half their assets, up to $70,000, for the spouse who does not need long-term care.)
 
Other Demands on Funds
 The cost of the same policy for someone 55 years old, she added, would be only $1,400 and should remain relatively low as the person ages. But even then, she said, most middle-age people worrying about college tuition and health insurance may find such a premium prohibitive.
A recent study by the Families USA Foundation, another Washington consumer group, said that policies that paid for two years of nursing home care were unaffordable to 81 percent of Americans from age 55 to 79 -- a figure that the Health Insurance Association bitterly disputes.
But other issues have also plagued the fledgling long-term care insurance business.
A study in June 1991 by Consumer Reports, for example, rated 94 policies and concluded that many of the policies included "traps" that should make consumers wary.
Trudy Lieberman, a senior editor of Consumer Reports, said that in visits with more than a dozen agents, she found they often did not warn customers that inflation could undermine the value of a policy. If inflation for care in the next quarter century matched that of the last 25 years, the effect on policy values, particularly for younger policyholders, could be devastating.
 
Adjusting for Inflation
 Some companies offer the option of having the amount of coverage grow at a rate of 5 percent a year on a compounded basis, but that option costs considerably more. Other companies allow consumers to purchase additional coverage every few years, a problem, Ms. Lieberman said, because the coverage becomes more expensive as the insured ages.
A related issue, Ms. Lieberman said, is the stability of rates. Although insurers say their rates in recent years have not risen significantly, consumer groups warn that insurers have the right to raise premiums in the future, which is not typical of other insurance coverage.
In addition, Consumer Reports expressed concern about restrictions that determine who is eligible to receive benefits. For example, some policies require that care be "medically necessary" because of sickness or injury. But many people who need custodial care may not have such a medical condition.
Perhaps an even more troubling question facing companies and consumers alike -- and one that may not be answered for decades -- is whether the actuarial assumptions underlying the new industry are correct.
Unlike life insurance, where more than a century of study has given insurance companies a highly accurate ability to predict death and calculate the cost of the insurance, the problem of predicting what nursing care costs will be decades in the future is, as yet, an unproven science.
 
Premiums Could Rise
 Those companies that charge premiums that are too low now to cover future costs could be forced to raise premiums suddenly in the future or could go out of business. Consumer Reports said that a third of the companies it rated in 1988 for long-term care policies were no longer selling those policies by 1991.


GRAPHIC: Long-term care policies typically cover services ranging from custodial through skilled nursing care. Some just cover stays in nursing homes; others pay for services at home. Some cover both.
Chart/Graph: "Aging and Higher Premiums"
 The average premium of leading long-term care companies for a 50-year-old was $852 in 1991, the Health Insurance Association of America says. Such a policy paid $80 a day for nursing home stays, $40 million a day for home care and increased protection to keep up with inflation at a compounded rate of 5 percent a year.
 Graph shows dollar amounts of a basic plan, a basic plan with inflation protection, and a basic plan with a nonfortfeiture clause for 50, 65, and 79 year-olds.
 
Here are some tips, offered by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, on buying long-term care insurance:
 Check with several companies and agents. Compare benefits, the types of places you have to be in to receive coverage, the limitations of coverage, the exlusions and the premiums.
 Check the inflation benefits of policies to see what happens when nursing home costs rise.
 Check to see if there is a provision that allows you to stop paying premiums once you are in a nursing home.
 Check nonforfeiture benefits to see if you can get back some investment if you stop paying premiums.
 Don't be misled by agents who say your medical history is not important. In some cases, companies have used inaccurate of incomplete reporting of medical conditions to deny payments.
 Check the financial stability of the company you are considering. Among insurance rating services are A.M. Best Company (900) 420-0400; Moody's Investor Service (212) 553-1653, and Standard & Poor's (212) 208-1527.

HEADLINE: Aspin Tells Base Panel to Harden Hearts

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Signaling his support for closing more military bases than he recommended last week, Defense Secretary Les Aspin today urged a Presidential commission to resist efforts by lawmakers and local communities to spare their installations.
"Almost all bases that are going to be appealed to you will have a story to tell and a case to be made," Mr. Aspin said at the first hearing of the 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which will make the difficult decision. "If you buy into their criteria, you will agree to take that base off the list. Pretty quick you end up with no bases on the list at all." 
 The eight-member commission, set up to insulate Congress from angry constituents on such decisions, can alter the Pentagon's list by adding or subtracting bases. The panel must submit its final recommendations to President Clinton by July 1. Mr. Clinton, and then Congress, would have to approve or reject the entire package.
Mr. Aspin last week recommended shutting 31 large military installations and shrinking or consolidating 134 other depots and smaller sites. Mr. Aspin said that once the Pentagon spent $1.7 billion to clean up and close those installations, it expected to save $3.1 billion a year starting in the year 2000.
 
Following Bush's Lead
 This round of proposed closings, which has provoked an uproar among lawmakers whose districts would lose bases and thousands of military and civilian jobs, goes no further than bringing the number of installations in line with the cuts in troop levels made by the Bush Administration's final budget.
"Using the Cheney-Bush base force as the basis for this round means we're going to end up closing bases, but probably not enough," said Mr. Aspin, who later called his recommendations "modest," even though they are larger than the base closings in 1988 and 1991 combined.
Mr. Aspin said the Administration was beginning a comprehensive review to reduce military budgets and troop levels through 2000, but he told the commission that the review would not be finished until mid-summer, after the panel's deadline.
The comments by Mr. Aspin and Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggested that the Pentagon would approve of more closings -- as long as it did not have to be the bearer of bad news. Shutting more bases would free money to protect troop levels and modernize weapons.
 
Panel to Visit Bases
 "If the commission were to find bases we don't need that were overlooked by the Defense Department process, I'm sure that would be looked on with favor," said one senior Pentagon official.
The commission's chairman, James A. Courter, a former Republican Congressman from New Jersey, said that commission members would visit the 43 large bases considered for closing or reduction and that 9 or 10 regional hearings would be held.
Mr. Courter said "not everybody is going to be happy with the results," but he said the panel's responsibility was to insure that everyone was "at least satisfied with the process under which we arrived at that result and those conclusions."
One obvious hot potato that Mr. Aspin dropped into the commission's lap was McClellan Air Force Base, which the Air Force proposed closing but which the Defense Secretary pulled from the final list, citing the "cumulative economic impact" on parts of Northern California already suffering from bases closed in previous rounds.
 
Take a Look, Take a Look
 McClellan is one of five big Air Force maintenance depots nationwide, and both Mr. Aspin and General Powell said the Air Force could afford only four now. "One of them has to go," said Mr. Aspin. But when commission members asked which one, Mr. Aspin smiled the smile of a salesman who has just sold a clunker to a patsy and said, "I'd urge you to take a look at that."
A senior Pentagon official said the next likeliest depot to close would be Hill Air Force Base in Utah.
Arguing for Mr. Aspin's choices, General Powell recommended that the commission "adopt the proposal in its entirety, or at least in the same quantity as the Secretary has noted after you have made your puts and takes."
Mr. Aspin, a former Wisconsin Congressman who headed the Armed Services Committee, expressed relief that he didn't have to make the final decision.
"I don't envy you, the work that you are undertaking today, but boy am I glad you're doing it," Mr. Aspin said.
That was clear in one exchange between Mr. Aspin and a commission member, Robert D. Stuart Jr., who asked why the same "economic impact" argument that spared McClellan Air Force Base -- Mr. Aspin said the impact of the base closing on that state's weak economy would amount to "piling on" -- was not applied to Charleston, S.C., where several installations are slated for closing.
"I just wondered whether South Carolina, for example, didn't have a little bit of the same piling-on implication," Mr. Stuart said.
Mr. Aspin replied, to laughter in the hearing room: "It's your choice, sir. The ball's now in your court. "

HEADLINE: Chinese Minister Denounces Britain

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 15

 BODY:
Prime Minister Li Peng accused Britain today of "perfidiously" trying to create disorder in Hong Kong and trying to impede the territory's smooth return to China.
Mr. Li used the occasion of a two-hour policy address, opening the annual session of the National People's Congress, to step up the attack on Britain's proposals to increase democracy in Hong Kong. His voice rising in outrage, Mr. Li departed from the advance text of his speech to warn that China would hold Britain fully responsible for the consequences of the dispute. 
 The speech also indirectly accused the United States and France of "having deliberately created obstacles to China's peaceful unification" by selling arms to Taiwan. While Mr. Li specifically referred only to "certain foreign elements" it was clear that he meant Washington and Paris. He also warned that China was ready to take "strong measures" -- apparently meaning full military force -- to prevent Taiwan from proclaiming itself an independent country separate from China.
Communist Party leaders have worked together for several months on the speech, which is equivalent to a state-of-the-nation address. It thus represents the views of the entire leadership, not just those of Mr. Li, and as such it is one of the best indications available of what vision the party has for China's future.
But this year the speech seemed to have more slogans than vision. While Mr. Li called for officials to "emancipate the mind" and hasten economic liberalization, he spoke in Communist cliches that undermined the message. "We should dare to think and act, boldly experimenting with new reforms, so long as we act with prudence," Mr. Li said, in a typically fuzzy passage. "We should evaluate our experience at every step, continuing to do what is right, correcting what is wrong and improving what is imperfect, so as to avoid losses, great losses in particular."
The speech affirmed China's current course, but its lack of vision underscored the extent to which the initiative in economic policy has passed from the central Government to the provinces. At a party this evening attended by many Chinese officials and business people, none of those questioned had bothered to listen to the speech. "Frankly, no one really cares," a businessman said, then changed the subject.

BYLINE: By John Tierney

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn.

 BODY:
WHEN Bridgeport Jai Alai opened in 1976, its owners enthused about presenting the world's best players in the world's largest arena for the world's fastest game. Critics complained that it was making too much money. Today most of the seats are empty most of the time, and its owners are enthusing about tearing it down.
You can argue that all of this might have been foreseen: Who got the idea that Americans were dying to spend their evenings watching Basques in white pants throw a ball against a wall and chase it with baskets on their arms? But that's not quite fair, because the sport was never the point of it all, at least not in Bridgeport. 
 No, the chief purpose of jai alai was to enable citizens to turn over their betting money -- 18 percent at a time -- to politicians and promoters, and as a gambling diversion jai alai compares favorably with Americans' other options. Before you insult jai alai, try explaining the intrinsic excitement in watching horses, greyhounds, and roulette balls go around in a circle. Or the sheer thrill in seeing someone pick a Lotto number.
Somehow, though, the competition has done in the Bridgeport fronton. After the first season, attendance steadily declined as the novelty wore off, star players were lured away, and other gambling opportunities arose -- casinos in Atlantic City, more and more state lottery games. The problems were compounded in 1988, when the Spanish players went on strike and the fronton used inferior American substitutes.
"The strike crippled us," said Robert L. Beslove, the fronton's vice-president for public relations. "It lasted three years, the longest strike in the history of professional sports. By the time we settled it, the economy was in terrible shape, and that hurt us. Then came the last nail in the coffin, the Indian casino. The Indians killed us."
Mr. Beslove estimated that a quarter of the fronton's bettors have gone up the Connecticut Turnpike to the casino run by the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe in Ledyard, which opened in February of last year. "I tell our customers the road to the Indian casino is paved with our tax dollars," he said, lamenting the tax exemptions enjoyed by the tribe. "Don't get me started on the Indians."
After reporting a loss of $1.5 million last year, the fronton's president, A. Robert Zeff, is hoping to abandon jai alai and beat the Indians at their own game. Together with Mirage Resorts, he has proposed tearing down the fronton and putting up the Bridgeport Sporting Club, a complex that would include a casino, greyhound track, hotel, shops, movie theaters, ice rink, and bowling lanes.
The prospects for that proposal are unclear, but the State Legislature has already given Mr. Zeff permission to build a dog track next to the fronton, which is on the Pequonnock River across from downtown Bridgeport. Plans call for construction of the dog track to begin in the fall, with the fronton to be closed and torn down as soon as the track opens.
So the fronton's future looks bleaker than the present, which is saying something. The scene on Friday night, when the weather was still clear, was fairly typical: 1,655 people in an auditorium built to hold 9,000, and some not even following the jai alai games. They were there to bet on the horse races being shown on television screens, a recent innovation that has increased attendance but provided the ambience of an off-track betting parlor.
There was a listlessness in the air much of the time, but every now and then the crowd roared at a particularly lovely shot soaring the 176-foot length of the court, and you could understand why some Americans are actually getting nostalgic about jai alai.
In the stands, when they were not grumbling about their losing bets, fans talked wistfully about the days before the crowds and the star players had left. Over and over they mentioned Francisco Churruca, the Basque who at age 40 was still the game's greatest player when Bridgeport opened. He retired in 1983 -- "I knew it was time to quit when my eyes were quicker than my legs" -- but has remained at the fronton as the players' manager.
"It will be very sad for me if this closes," Mr. Churruca said as he followed the action Friday evening. "When we opened, it was incredible. We had the best players, the people loved the game, and we could feel the excitement. Now we have lost that. The attendance is less, and I don't think the young players are as fully dedicated to the game. But we are trying to rebuild."
He and Mr. Breslove gazed at the empty seats. "I used to stand here in the '70's and look out at 8,000 people," Mr. Beslove said to Mr. Churruca. "You were up there catching it between your legs. I remember how you'd jump up the wall, catch it, and throw it before you landed. Well, we can't live in the past, I guess. But, boy, it was bedlam in here. You still had hair, too."

HEADLINE: School Board Challenges Aid Formula

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
New York City and the Board of Education sued the State of New York yesterday, charging that the state's school aid formula discriminates against city students and has cost city schools at least $274 million this year.
The suit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, comes as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Board of Regents, acknowledging inequities in the formula, are proposing separate plans to change it. But there is no guarantee that New York City would fare better under either of the two proposals, which are given little chance of passage in the Legislature. 
 City and Board of Education officials said they filed their suit in hopes of accomplishing what they expect the Legislature will not.
 
Inequitable Aid Formula
 The 50-page complaint says 37 percent of the state's public school students are enrolled in New York City, but the city receives only 34 percent of the state's education financing. That and other inequities, the suit argues, violate state education laws and the equal protection clauses of the Federal and state Constitutions and Federal civil-rights laws.
In one argument that appears to break new legal ground, the suit goes beyond earlier attacks on state educational formulas in New York and in other states by contending that the formulas are not only inequitable but racially discriminatory.
The New York suit argues that the state's public schools are "severely split between urban and suburban areas, between one world that is largely African-American, Latino, Asian-American and poor, and another that is largely white and prosperous."
By attacking racial and economic inequalities that have resulted from the division of New York into cities, where students are mostly poor and nonwhite, and suburbs where students are largely white and affluent, the legal action parallels a lawsuit now being tried by a state court in Hartford. The Connecticut lawsuit, however, asks a judge to rule that segregated conditions are unconstitutional, whereas New York City's action seeks fairer school aid formulas.
The New York suit names as defendants Mr. Cuomo, the State Education Commissioner, Thomas Sobol, the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, the State Taxation and Finance Commissioner, James W. Wetzler, and the majority and minority leaders of both houses of the Legislature.
"For years, New York City, along with most of her sister cities in the state, have had to endure a state aid allocation system that has been grossly unfair to its schoolchildren," Mayor David N. Dinkins said in a statement. "With the filing of today's lawsuit, our city loudly and strongly notifies the State Legislature of its intent to not put up with this inequity any longer."
 
Similar Challenge Rejected
 O. Peter Sherwood, New York City's Corporation Counsel, whose staff drafted the suit, said that the State Court of Appeals, rejected a similar challenge to school financing formulas in a 1982 suit filed by the Board of Education of Levittown, L.I., holding that the state Constitution does not guarantee equalization of educational resources.
In the 11 years since the failed Levittown suit, however, the prospects for a similar suit have improved because the inequalities in the state's education formulas have worsened, Mr. Sherwood said.
Similar suits challenging state education formulas have been brought in New Jersey, Texas, Kentucky, Arkansas, Montana, West Virginia, Washington, Mr. Sherwood said.
"We have exhausted all of the political remedies to get our fair share of aid, with very little progress being made," Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez said in a statement. "Our city's children have no choice but to seek the protection of the courts."
The suit does not demand a specific increase in state financing for New York City's schools. But Michael J. Petrides, Staten Island's representative on the seven-member Board of Education, estimated that the inequalities built into the formulas result in city schools being shortchanged by nearly $350 million a year.
 
$7.5 Billion Budget
 The Board of Education received 43 percent of its $7.5 billion annual budget for the present school year from state funds, said James S. Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Fernandez. The city financed 47 percent and about 10 percent came from the Federal Government, he said.
Because city students are mostly nonwhite, the suit says, the state consistently allocates less state aid to nonwhite pupils than to white pupils throughout the state.
Anne Crowley, Governor Cuomo's press secretary, said yesterday that the Governor had not seen the suit and would not comment on specific allegations. But she added: "The Governor has said repeatedly over the years that this is an inequitable formula and the Legislature should change it. And if the Legislature won't, maybe the courts should."
Asked about the timing of New York City's suit, Mr. Sherwood said it was filed yesterday because it only recently became ready for litigation after months of preparation. A Board of Education official, however, said that the filing had been timed to coincide with a new phase in the Board's annual lobbying campaign in Albany, which begins today.

Treasury Bond Prices Fall Again

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell again yesterday as traders and investors tried to gauge the impact of the unexpectedly large jump in producer inflation reported Friday and waited for tomorrow's release of data on consumer prices.
The price of the 30-year bond dropped 12/32 , and the yield jumped to 6.89 percent. Earlier in the day the price had been off a full point, with the yield up to 6.93 percent. In the last two trading days, the price of the bond has fallen almost a point and three-quarters, and the yield has leaped from 6.76 percent. 
 Prices of notes also fell yesterday, but not as much. The discount rates on three-month and six-month Treasury bills rose to their highest level since early January at the weekly auction yesterday.
A sharp rise yesterday in the closely watched Commodity Research Bureau Index of commodity prices, another barometer of inflation, added to concern. And there was selling by portfolio managers who decided that the inflation data were an excuse for them to take profits after a strong rally that pulled the yield on the 30-year bond down from its 1993 high of 7.47 percent on Jan. 12 to 6.72 percent, its low, on March 8.
 
Is Rally Over?
 It is not clear yet if the rally is over, or simply pausing. But even if the rally has ended, analysts are not predicting that long-term interest rates will rise sharply, because the basic fundamentals for low interest rates are still in place. These are moderate growth, contained inflation and prospects that President Clinton will be successful in cutting the Federal budget deficit. So forecasters say the yield on the 30-year bond should rise only to 7 percent or a little higher.
"I don't think rates are going up a whole lot or going down a whole lot," said Glenn E. Murphy, chief investment officer at the Travelers Asset Management International Corporation in Hartford.
Mr. Murphy has sold 10-year Treasury notes recently because "the pendulum of sentiment had swung past the equilibrium point." But he said his decision was tactical, not a change in sentiment. "I am looking for a re-entry point," he said. "I am bullish for two or three points on the price. And that is essentially what we have given up since the peak."
While inflation is worrying investors, it is not from concern that the rate of price increases is suddenly skyrocketing. Instead, it is a worry that an earlier assumption -- that the rate of inflation will decline this year -- will not be borne out.
The Consumer Price Index rose 3 percent last year and some analysts have said they think that this year it could slow to around 2.5 percent or even lower. One of the reasons for this forecast is that the rate of increase in unit labor costs is being held near zero because of gains in productivity.
But other analysts argue that the January increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in the Consumer Price Index and the four-tenths of 1 percent increase in the Producer Price Index reported Friday does not fit with an inflation rate falling below the 3 percent level for the year. And the concern yesterday was that the Consumer Price Index for February will confirm this view tomorrow.
 
Decisions to Make
 What is happening now is that investors and traders are being forced to reconsider the expectations about inflation. They can decide that everything will be O.K., either by concluding that inflation will move lower or that a 3 percent rate should not get in the way of a move of long term rates to levels like 6.5 percent.
For this to happen, however, investors will probably have to get some support from other data and developments. For example, if the economy appears to have slowed slightly in the last two weeks of February, which some data have indicated, this could provide some comfort. A slower economy means there is less chance for prices to move higher.
Investors could also get support from progress on President Clinton's deficit reduction plan.
If the Consumer Price Index for February is higher than expected, then this reconsideration will be more difficult. According to a survey by Bloomberg Business News, forecasters expect an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent. For the first two months of the year, that would mean an average increase of four-tenths of a percent, which at an annual rate equals 4.8 percent. To get the rate to 3 percent would take average increases of around two-tenths of 1 percent for the rest of the year.
Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, still expects inflation to decline this year so he predicts that long-term interest rates will continue to fall.
He also said he would not worry about the recent surge in the Commodity Research Bureau index unless it broke through 225. The index ended yesterday at 210.19, up 2.40.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

Nike's Quarterly Profit Exceeds Estimates

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
Whether it was because of Michael Jordan leaping from one planet to the next, Andre Agassi wearing fluorescent colors to pummel tennis balls or Bo Jackson doing almost anything, Nike made a favorable impression, with a 8.4 percent earnings increase for the fiscal third quarter.
Nike, one of the world's leading marketers of athletic footwear and apparel, said yesterday that sales growth in the United States shoe market helped raise earnings to $89.5 million, compared with $82.5 million in last year's third quarter. 
 Investors reacted favorably to the report, sending Nike shares up $4.625, or 6.4 percent, to $76.375, yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.
But several analysts who follow Nike expressed a bit of skepticism over the market's reaction, noting that Nike warned analysts last month that third-quarter results would be lower than previously forecast.
The fact that the results turned out better than the gloomy predictions probably contributed to the bullish response in trading yesterday, and some analysts said they expected Nike's stock to give back a significant portion of its gains when trading resumes today.
"Their earnings were really no surprise," said Gary M. Jacobson, who follows the stock for Kidder, Peabody. "They were modestly above recently revised lower expectations."
The earnings report also indicated soft growth in foreign sales, which were up only 4 percent after five previous quarters in which foreign sales had grown between 19 and 49 percent.
The analysts attributed the decline to the exchange rate of the dollar and to economic sluggishness and even recession in Europe, Nike's largest foreign market. European retailers slowed their orders of Nike products for the quarter.
But Nike said in a statement that orders for athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery between now and July had increased 21 percent, to $1.65 billion, a figure that would have been as high as 26 percent, the company said, had the exchange rate for the dollar remained unchanged from a year ago.
"We are especially pleased by the strength of our U.S. footwear business, which grew 15 percent, our strongest quarter in two years," Philip H. Knight, Nike's chairman, said in a statement. "Solid increases in basketball, outdoor, cross-training and women's categories account for most of these gains."

Dollar Trading Is Mixed; Gold Prices Up in New York

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended narrowly mixed yesterday in listless trading as dealers turned their attention to events, including this week's economic data.
Gold for current delivery rose $1.30 from Friday on the Commodity Exchange in New York, settling at $329.30 an ounce. The Republic National Bank gave a late price of $329.25, up $1.25. 
 The successful completion an agreement to distribute the cost of German unification among government, business and labor, lent the dollar some underlying support on speculation that it gives the Bundesbank the leverage to cut rates at its council meeting on Thursday.
While Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German central bank, has said rate moves will not be decided by specific events, dealers said the poor state of the German economy, potential volatility in the European Monetary System and easier German money market rates pointed to a rate cut this week.
Dealers said a rate cut was already largely priced into the dollar, so few are predicting a big rally if the Bundesbank does act.
Dealers said they were also looking forward to the British budget announcement today, American consumer price data tomorrow and the French elections next weekend.
The dollar ended at 1.6631 marks in New York, down from 1.6640 on Friday. Earlier in London, the dollar ended at 1.6635 marks, down from 1.6655 on Friday.
In Tokyo, the dollar ended at 118.18 yen, up from Friday's 117.85. In London, it rose to 118.34 yen from Friday's 117.70. The dollar rose to 118.65 yen in New York, versus 118 on Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.4327, from $1.4350 on Friday. It firmed in New York to $1.4350, up from $1.4337 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Friday, included: 1.5230 Swiss francs, up from 1.5181; 5.6540 French francs, down from 5.6550; 1,606 Italian lire, down from 1,607, and 1.2476 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2444.

Storm Brings a Price Surge For Citrus, Sugar and Hogs

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 15

 BODY:
Orange juice, sugar and pork futures soared today amid concerns that severe storms over the weekend had damaged crops and hog farms, analysts said.
On other commodity markets, wheat, coffee, cocoa and lumber futures advanced. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities, a widely followed gauge for inflation, closed above the 210 level for the first time since June. 
 Crude oil for April delivery closed 13 cents lower at $20.16 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Heating oil for April delivery finished 0.92 cent lower at 57.28 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline ended 0.54 cent lower at 58 cents a gallon.
Orange juice for delivery in May rebounded sharply amid worries about damage to the citrus crop in Florida, which ranks second among the states in orange juice production. But initial reports from Florida indicated that groves sustained only minimal losses, analysts said.
Below-freezing temperatures during the weekend did not affect the crop, but the high winds that trailed the storm blew 5 percent to 7 percent of the fruit off the trees, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Citrus said.
May orange juice closed 3.20 cents higher at 78.10 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.
Sugar for delivery in May extended recent gains, fueled by worries that shipments from Cuba, the world's third-largest producer of sugar cane, would be disrupted because of storm damage to ports, analysts said.
May sugar closed 0.95 cent higher at 11.50 cents a pound, after setting a life-of-contract high at 11.85, at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York.
Livestock traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange pushed pork futures higher after reports of storm-related damage to hog farms in North Carolina, an important pork-producing state, analysts said.
Live hogs for delivery in April closed at $49.07 per hundredweight, up $1.18. Pork bellies, or uncured bacon, finished at $49.25 per hundredweight, up $2, the most the contract is permitted to gain in one session.
Wheat futures led soybeans and other grain futures higher at the Chicago Board of Trade in response to the Agriculture Department's report on Friday that it would donate 520,000 metric tons of wheat and 87,000 metric tons of rice to Russia under the Food for Progress Program. The donation was valued at $102 million.

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
MIKE WALLACE is lending a hand to his old school, Brookline High School, at a benefit -- unusual for a Massachusetts public school -- in New York tomorrow evening. Mr. Wallace, class of '35, will interview the school's acting headmaster, Dr. ROBERT J. WEINTRAUB, at a cocktail party that is expected to draw 60 or so Brookline graduates to the University Club on West 54th Street.
The purpose is to help meet the $150,000 goal of a yearlong campaign tied to the 150th anniversary of the school. 
 "We are in the midst of a financial crisis," Dr. Weintraub said yesterday. "We have had major cutbacks and have lost 13 percent of our staff over the last four years."
The year is being bracketed by two celebratory weekends -- one last June, one this June -- that include class reunions. Last year's event brought more than 2,000 graduates back to the school, including Mr. Wallace, Alan Rachins, a star of "L.A. Law," and former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts and his wife, Kitty.
"Brookline was a superb place to grow up, and the school was always good, so we are trying to raise dough for a variety of activities that go beyond the basic curriculum," Mr. Wallace said yesterday.
Dr. Weintraub seemed unperturbed by the prospect of being interviewed by the usually hard-hitting "60 Minutes" correspondent. "I deal with The Brookline Citizen, the local weekly, on a regular basis, so I am prepared for Mike Wallace," he said.

HEADLINE: Computers Make People More Employable;
Training Holds Key

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Jeremy Rifkin speculates that the Clinton Administration's 36-page plan to rejuvenate the economy by spurring high-tech industries "runs the risk of creating a new and dangerous America -- one in which a small high-tech elite of corporate professionals exist in a nation of the permanently unemployed" (Op-Ed, Feb. 24). 
 One can certainly argue that this small high-tech elite already exists. Is the question then that this elite group will become smaller? Will it have more political clout? Undeniably, there are social and economic dangers in high-tech madness, but is it fair to characterize all high-tech industry as socially irresponsible and elitist? All technology, high and low, suffers from the trickle-down syndrome, and society must come to terms with the uses of technology.
To say that new technologies are beginning to force a reorientation of the job market, with no new jobs waiting for the displaced worker may oversimplify. Perhaps Mr. Rifkin underestimates the ability of Americans to compete in the high-tech job market. Retraining the work force can be effective if it is a "training" program. Industry, high- and low-tech, and Government agencies need to take the steps to insure that employees are adequately trained for jobs, whether they are semiskilled, clerical or support staff.
Most professionals would rather have a personal assistant than be tied to their personal computer. Properly trained staff members with computer-friendly systems will keep a clerical staff employed and result in a more skilled clerical work force. The problem is not that technology is forcing a decline in the need for clerical workers, but that their training is often inadequate. Let us not neglect the potential of the semiskilled and clerical worker to participate in high-tech industry.

HEADLINE: Computers Make People More Employable;
Where the Jobs Are

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Jeremy Rifkin's atavistic reasoning (Op-Ed, Feb. 24) is reminiscent of the labor riots in the 19th century at the start of the Industrial Revolution. Workers feared permanent displacement by machinery. 
 Many living Americans remember when unions fought to lower the workweek to 60 hours. Today the average workweek is 40 hours, with a much higher standard of living. More leisure industries have been created, employing millions of workers.
While a strong defense posture is still a sine qua non, it must be commensurate with the perceived threat, plus a safety margin. However necessary our military spending is in this highly volatile world, such spending is inflationary since it diminishes the product available for resale.
The Pentagon should not be used as a make-work employment facility. The two strongest creditor countries, Japan and Germany, have spent less than 1 percent of gross domestic product on defense since World War II, whereas we, the largest debtor country in the world, have been spending about six times as much.
We are a long way from having a dearth of necessary projects in this country requiring the full spectrum of skilled, semiskilled and unskilled workers. Our decaying infrastructure will require hundreds of billions of dollars and millions of construction workers for the next 10 to 20 years.
We have a crying need for millions of low-priced dwelling units. In New York State alone, there are 240,000 applicants for low-cost housing. At the present pace of construction it will take 20 years to fill this void. This should be speeded up for completion in five years, putting hundreds of thousands back to work. There are similar needs throughout the country.
The Clinton Administration intends to add 100,000 to our country's police forces. This could be doubled if we are to make a serious dent in combating crime. The bulk of the added police should be drawn from the discharged military personnel. The transition from the military to police work should be relatively simple.
Upgrading our second-rate educational system will put back to work thousands of teachers forced to take semiskilled and unskilled employment, thus opening replacement opportunities for the unemployed.
We can further technological innovation, the key to raising living standards, while creating millions of low-tech jobs for health care, housing and energy conservation. Our country is decades from filling all our job requirements.

HEADLINE: Why Italy Finds Itself In a Peculiar Position

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Don't Blame Fate. Blame the Italians" (Op-Ed, March 9) by Enzo Biagi, instead of merely reinforcing a stereotype image of Italians, should have explained that corruption scandals in Italy were also caused by: 
 * The peculiar position of Italy during the long cold war: halfway between the free West and the totalitarian East. The first illegal contributions to the Italian parties were made by the United States to "defend" the country from Communism. The Soviet Union and its satellites financed the Italian Communist Party to undermine democratic institutions.
* Italy's peculiar economic structures: Half owned by the state and nearly half by a small group of powerful individuals, with little room for competition. Within this restricted environment of welfare state and false capitalism, kickbacks and bribery were easier than anywhere else in the West. At the same time, the Italian Communists shared the benefit of the same political and economic system that they preached to destroy.
* The peculiar nature of the current political crisis, marked by arrests, convictions and suicides, but also by a strong willingness of judges, citizens and a new breed of politicians and entrepreneurs to clean house and start with new political and economic rules.

HEADLINE: Avoid a Bloodbath in Haiti;
Declare A Deadline

BYLINE: By Jean-Bertrand Aristide; Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the President of Haiti, is author, most recently, of "Theology and Politics."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Last summer, Haitians hungering for democracy were filled with hope when candidate Bill Clinton declared that the U.S. should "use its unique position to support freedom, whether it's in Haiti or China."
Today, I will discuss with President Clinton the plan initiated by Haiti's constitutional Government and endorsed by the U.S., U.N. and the Organization of American States. It can convert his moving words into an effective policy to "support freedom" by restoring the democratically elected Government, ending more than 17 months of bloody dictatorship and bringing a solution to the refugee crisis that takes my fellow citizens' lives. 
 Through international cooperation, we have already seen the deployment, under U.N. auspices, of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti to stop human rights violations and to facilitate the swift return of our constitutional Government.
Despite the thousands of deaths and cases of torture and arrest, the Haitian people continue to make clear that there is no alternative to the restoration of the Government they elected. That sentiment is palpable from the remotest rural hamlet to the heart of Port-au-Prince.
The cornerstone of our plan is for the U.S., working with the U.N. and the O.A.S., to set a date certain for the restoration of the elected Government -- to specify the day when democracy will be re-established. That and only that will convince the coup regime that the international community will not tolerate its unlawful and violent usurpation of power.
The solution to Haiti's crisis is not elusive. Visas of the leaders and financiers of the coup regime can be annulled and their international assets frozen. Instead of simply blockading Haitians inside the country, the U.S. could use its Navy to make the economic embargo effective, stopping the delivery of all oil and weapons. The democracy embraced by Haitians will endure if the international community remains firm.
The events of recent weeks remind us that this climate of liberty has yet to be reached. The vicious attack on Bishop Willy Romelus after funeral services for victims of last month's ferry disaster and the subsequent mass arrests and beatings of church worshipers plainly refute any assertions that the small U.N.-O.A.S. presence has already succeeded.
Bishop Romelus was beaten in front of members of the International Civilian Mission. Mourners at the funeral, fearing identification by the military and its collaborators, put bags over their heads and were escorted to the safety of the cathedral by diplomats and other foreign officials. Even so, several young people vanished into the detention centers to face torture and other ill-treatment. It is evident that the widespread terrorism in Haiti necessitates a larger number of observers than are now present.
With each passing day, the Haitians languishing in Guantanamo desperate to go home move closer to death.
We must act quickly. The intensifying violence, in open defiance of the International Civilian Mission, is a test of the international community's resolve. If the world fails to respond, it is not only Haiti that perishes but the hopes of all nations that in this new world order, democracy -- at all costs -- will be cherished.

HEADLINE: Drug Makers Propose Self-Control on Prices

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Under strong criticism from President Clinton that has sent drug stocks tumbling, the pharmaceutical industry last week formally offered to limit average price increases to the general inflation rate.
Similar moves have already been announced by Merck & Company, Pfizer Inc. and eight other large drug companies. 
 While attempting to stave off the Government controls advocated by their critics in Congress and the Administration, the drug companies appear resigned to end more than a decade of extraordinary profits. In the last four years their pretax profits were five times as high as those of other industries and their sales rose 50 percent, to $55 billion in 1992.
 
Managed Competition Backed
 In statements to White House and Justice Department officials, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group in Washington, also endorsed a national system of managed competition among large purchasers, which could force drug makers as well as hospitals and doctors to roll back prices for products and services. And it urged the Administration to add a comprehensive drug benefit to the Medicare program for 30 million elderly and disabled Americans.
Under the voluntary plan, each company's pricing would be checked by outside accountants and submitted for review to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the General Accounting Office of Congress. If a company exceeded the price limit, it would have to make up the excess by lowering prices the next year.
The association said the proposal was based on the assumption that market conditions would be stable and Government policies would support "innovation" in drug research.
 
Monitoring Called Difficult
 But drug industry critics in Congress and economists familiar with White House health-care plans said the industry plan would be hard to monitor and enforce and would not help most elderly people, who must pay for drugs themselves.
"I am skeptical about any voluntary effort by the pharmaceutical industry to restrain their prices," said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the House energy and commerce subcommittee on health.
President Clinton recently blamed the drug makers for helping to make health care unaffordable for many Americans. And a study for Congress said last month that the industry had made "excess profits" of more than $2 billion a year.
Several pharmaceutical stocks dipped yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange after an upward bounce last week. Merck was down 50 cents, to $38.625; Eli Lilly lost $1, closing at $50.75, and Johnson & Johnson was off 12.5 cents, to $43.50. Pfizer was unchanged at $62.125 and Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 37.5 cents to $57.625.
 
An Interim Arrangement
 The association offered its proposal as an interim arrangement that would expire if a national health-care system were enacted.
It said the price average would reflect discounts and rebates, which are already provided to large buyers and state Medicaid programs. But industry analysts said the averaging would leave the door open for continuing price increases in pharmacies. About 40 percent of drugs are bought by people with no drug insurance.
Senator David Pryor, the Arkansas Democrat who has criticized drug pricing as head of the Senate Committee on Aging, said any voluntaryagreements would have to lower prices "for the average cash-paying buyer of medications."
Drug company executives say their prices are based on benchmarks that include the number of potential users, the return on investments in research, the number of years of patent protection remaining and the product's advantage over existing therapies. Unique new drugs usually are priced high from the start.
Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, chairman of Merck, said that when a new drug is medically superior, "we would like to have a price somewhat higher than what is out there."
 
High Risks, High Costs
 Drug companies say they have to charge stiff prices to pay for costly research that often leads nowhere.
"We have the highest risks of any industry I know," Dr. Vagelos said. "We are betting on things that may or may not mature and become available to the public in 10 or 15 years. That has to be rewarded."
But the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment insisted last month that "in recent years the financial rewards from R.& D. have more than offset its costs and risks."

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about drug prices misstated an increase by Pfizer Inc. for its heart drug Procardia XL. The increase on Feb. 1 was 4.5 percent, in line with Pfizer's voluntary limit on price increases in 1993.

HEADLINE: 'Year of Unity' for Weary Europe Is Splintered by Public Uneasiness

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, March 11

 BODY:
For most of Western Europe, 1993 -- the year the European Community was finally supposed to come into its own as the world's largest free-trade market -- has started off badly, with a dispiriting recession, a spate of scandals and the most serious loss of self-confidence in 20 years.
In almost every European country, polls show that ordinary people no longer believe in the parties that have dominated politics since World War II, concluding that they are not up to the new challenges of the post-cold-war era. The consensus of a decade ago in Britain, France and Germany has been replaced by seemingly endless bickering and near-paralysis. 
 The contrast with the apparent rejuvenation brought about by President Clinton has struck many European politicians and commentators, who see in him traits that they do not see in their own leaders: boldness, decisiveness, most of all an ability to solve problems that have stumped everybody else.
 
Different Strokes
 Though success for Mr. Clinton is by no means assured, European leaders say they have been impressed by the way he has shaped the debate on his deficit-reduction plan, mobilizing support across the political spectrum.
If Mr. Clinton succeeds in even a few of his endeavors, the respected French editor Andre Fontaine wrote in Le Monde, Europeans would do well to emulate "the amazing shot in the arm he is giving to the United States and, and the same time, to democracy."
The contrast between the public images of Mr. Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany could not be greater, and not just because the President is 46 years old and the Chancellor is nearly 63. What is most telling to the Germans is the contrast between the ways the two men have shaped the national debate in each country over the need to sacrifice.
The view in Germany is that Mr. Clinton asked almost all Americans above the poverty line to make sacrifices to reduce the soaring budget deficit and got a favorable reception because the requests seemed fair.
Mr. Kohl also asked for national sacrifice to pay the unexpectedly overwhelming costs of reunification, estimated at close to $1 trillion over the next decade and a half.
But, largely because he began by proposing cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits just as steelworkers and others were losing their jobs at a record pace, the debate in Germany has degenerated into a clash between poor and rich, between western German haves and eastern German have-nots.
According to recent polls, Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic-Free Democratic coalition, re-elected with a handsome majority in 1990 when unification seemed like a dream just come true, would not be returned to office if there were an election today.
A survey in January by the Allensbach Institute found that 48 percent of the 2,264 people questioned were concerned that politicians could not handle the country's most serious problems, and 53 percent were worried about the spread of far-right extremism.
Much of the public doubt has come from the Government's seeming inability to do anything about a flood of asylum-seekers from the Balkans and elsewhere. Last year, when nearly 450,000 arrived, some right-wing extremists took the law into their own hands, killing 10 Germans and 7 foreigners in more than 2,200 attacks.
 
While the Politicians Talk . . .
 After bickering with one another for years about whether a change in the country's Constitution was necessary to stem the influx of asylum-seekers, the coalition parties and the Social Democratic opposition agreed late last year to eliminate the constitutional guarantee of asylum.
But the change is still being debated in Parliament, and 74,350 more asylum-seekers poured in during the first two months of this year.
Just the exhaustion of being in power too long may be another reason for Western Europe's demoralization.
French commentators say President Francois Mitterrand, who is 76 years old and has held office since 1981, is trying to distance himself from the major defeat his Socialist Party is expected to suffer in this month's legislative elections.
The Conservative Party, which has been in power in Britain since 1979, has become deeply divided over whether it wants to be in on the stalled movement toward greater European unity.
The biggest corruption scandal in the postwar history of Italy has gravely weakened the Christian Democrats and Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's Socialists, who between them have governed the country since World War II. Mr. Amato has won a string of votes of confidence in Parliament only by threatening to resign and force the major parties into new elections.
 
The Drain in Spain
 The Socialists who have ruled Spain since 1982 are hanging on to power by their fingernails, and polls indicate that they will lose the next elections, which are due before October. The Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez must answer for corruption scandals that have riddled his party, and the Spanish economic boom of the late 1980's has turned to bust, with rising inflation and high unemployment.
Indeed, the most important reason for the demoralization of Europe may be the recession, which is steadily deepening here just as the United States has finally begun to pull out of it.
One major reason is that Germany, which all its partners thought would pull them along into a boom after unification in 1990, has slumped.
Bankers and opposition politicians all agree that the slump was caused by a jump in Government and private borrowing to finance the unexpectedly high costs of unification, forcing the Bundesbank to raise interest rates to prevent inflation.
 
In the Depths of Debt
 According to a recent report by Smithers & Company, a British financial consulting concern, the German Government deficit, officially estimated at 3 percent of gross national product, or $58.8 billion, is actually higher -- perhaps 8 to 9 percent of G.N.P. when borrowing by Government agencies like the railroads and the postal service are considered.
Western Germany will have to subsidize the East for decades with $60 billion to $80 billion a year, according to estimates here. Mr. Kohl's Government will have to raise taxes to provide the money, and investment funds will be scarce for years to come.
[On Monday, leaders of Germany's major political parties reached a consensus on the need for a 7.5 percent income-tax surcharge in 1995 to pay part of the cost of unification. They decided that cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits would not be necessary but left many details unsettled.]
With all the European economies now tied closely to one another, slow growth in Germany means a long and painful period of recession elsewhere in Europe. Some countries are beginning to feel that they are having to do just what Mr. Kohl assured them in 1990 that they would not have to do -- pay for Germany's unification.
Shimon Peres, the Israeli Foreign Minister, said today at the end of a visit to Bonn, "We don't share the German pessimism about Germany."
But, he said, with the collapse of Communism, the West had lost an enemy and gained a set of new problems, and "it's more complicated to solve a problem than it is to deal with an enemy."

HEADLINE: Oregon Health Plan Stalled by Politics

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 16

 BODY:
Marina Anttila, an unemployed mother of three, still has no health insurance even though she lives in Oregon, a state that long ago came up with a plan to provide medical care for all its citizens.
The problem is that the Oregon plan has been snagged on the shoals of Presidential politics. The Bush Administration rejected the proposal last summer. This week, President Clinton is to decide what do with the Oregon proposal -- the first attempt by a state to provide broad coverage through rationing of medical procedures. 
 If the White House approves it, Ms. Anttila and thousands of other Oregonians who currently have no insurance would be eligible for health care. For the rest of the nation, the decision could set the tone for the Administration's universal health-care proposal, which it is scheduled to disclose this spring.
As a candidate, Mr. Clinton promised to quickly approve Oregon's plan. But his position was at odds with an influential children's advocacy group whose board members included, until three months ago, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the President's health-policy chief.
 
Slicing a Small Pie
 The state was not planning to substantially increase Medicaid spending, said the advocacy group, the Children's Defense Fund. In effect, in the group's view, a small pie of benefits would be sliced even thinner and distributed among more people.
Approaching the Friday deadline for the decision, aides to the President and Mrs. Clinton say there is no dispute in the First Family. Both Clintons support the gist of the Oregon plan, though they are not prepared to say what the final decision will be, White House officials said.
A central element of the Oregon plan is a ranking by the state of all medical procedures, ranked by a cost-benefit formula. That system has drawn intense criticism because it rations care, limiting coverage to procedures ranked above an arbitrary point on the list. As currently proposed, 568 of the 688 procedures listed would be covered. Others, considered too costly and beneficial to only a few people, like operations for people with terminal illnesses, would not be covered.
Even the harshest critics of the plan say Oregon has done a service by trying to sort out which procedures are important to most people and which ones are dragging down the system with high costs and little benefit.
 
'Send a Message'
 "This may be the most important decision made by the Clinton Administration because it will send a message about which way they are going to go on health care," said Robert Griss, a health-policy analyst for the United Cerebral Palsy Associations, and a leader of the groups opposing the Oregon plan.
Indeed, as most attention has been focused on the health-care tour of Mrs. Clinton, a huge lobbying effort has centered on the Oregon decision.
Formally, the decision will come in a response to Oregon's request to waive the Medicaid laws. What Oregon is trying to do is cover all citizens who do not have health insurance but make too much money to qualify for the Medicaid program, which is financed by Federal and state funds. In most states, Oregon among them, Medicaid only covers about half of all the people who are living near the poverty line.
The Oregon list would also be the basis for a minimum level of coverage, which all employers would have to provide their employees by 1995.
 
Focus on Shalala
 The waiver decision will be made by Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Like Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Shalala was a board member of the Children's Defense Fund.
Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Shalala said today that Oregon's plan had been changed substantially from the version the Children's Defense Fund opposed, another hint that the Administration may go along with Oregon's plan. In one change, Gov. Barbara Roberts, a Democrat, promised last week that for the first two years no one now receiving health benefits would have those benefits reduced.
A major legislative opponent, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of a committee overseeing Medicaid, said on Friday that he would no longer try to block the Oregon plan. He said he remains opposed to it, but that enough changes had been made that he would not try to stop it.
Mrs. Clinton met on Friday with Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has been trying to lay the groundwork for approval.
"She was particularly interested in the relevance of Oregon's plan to a national health-care proposal," Mr. Wyden said. "Mrs. Clinton did not give a yes or no on the Oregon plan, but the overall tone was encouraging. I'm very optimistic we will get the waiver."
 
What the Critics Say
 A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Lisa Caputo, said the First Lady is not ready to say how much of Oregon's or any other plan would be used to shape the Administration's proposal.
Opponents of the Oregon plan say it is a radical break with the past, and that it is unfair to the disabled, people with terminal AIDS and others. "I think every medically necessary service should be covered by our health-care financial system," said Mr. Griss of the cerebral palsy group. "I think it would be a terrible mistake to break with what is now the best health system in the world."
When President George Bush rejected the proposal in August, he cited opposition by groups representing the disabled. They objected because the list of procedures covered was based, in part, on a telephone survey of Oregonians and their values about health care. But that survey has been thrown out and the list has been revised.
Some care and procedures that were not covered -- intensive care for extremely low birthweight babies, liver transplants for alcoholics suffering from cirrhosis, some stages of terminal AIDS -- are now covered. By changing the list, which was initially drawn by computers but has since been through subjective review, Oregon officials have satisfied many opponents.
"We used to be neutral, but we have taken a formal position in favor of it," said Janna Starr, executive director of the Arc of Oregon, which represents mentally retarded people. "There is a lot of misinformation about this plan. It does not shortchange the developmentally disabled."
 
Governors Take Stand
 Last month, after President Clinton urged the states to experiment with health-care plans, the National Governors Association passed a resolution urging Federal approval of the Oregon waiver.
During the campaign, Mr. Clinton was unequivocal in his support of the plan. On several visits to Oregon, he criticized President Bush's rejection.
"If I were President, I would give the waiver to them in a heartbeat because I think they deserve it," Mr. Clinton said last May. But he also expressed reservations about the rationing system, saying it might not work for the rest of the nation.
The wait for a Presidential decision has angered Ms. Anttila in Portland. "I had hoped to have health care by the first of the year for my family," she said. "But now it has taken so long that it is getting very frustrating."

HEADLINE: China Raises Military Budget Despite Deficit

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 16

 BODY:
The Government today announced a 15 percent increase in the military budget for this year, adding to a series of increases in military spending that is alarming neighboring countries.
Although China no longer faces a major threat on its borders, its military budget is almost double the figure for 1988. Other Asian countries fear that China is trying to intimidate its neighbors and resolve longstanding boundary disputes in its favor. More fundamentally, some diplomats suggest, China is trying to fill a vacuum in the Pacific after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the withdrawal of United States forces from the Philippines. 
 Chinese officials made no attempt today to justify the increase in military spending. But on Monday, Prime Minister Li Peng told the National People's Congress that China needed to turn the three-million-member army into "the best armed forces that China's conditions permit." Without citing any threats, Mr. Li said the army must "constantly increase its combat effectiveness and defense capabilities under modern warfare."
The spending figures were included in a budget speech today by Finance Minister Liu Zhongli to the congress, a rubber-stamp parliament that is meeting in its annual session. Mr. Liu said the military budget was 42.5 billion yuan, or $7.4 billion. That compares with military budgets of 37 billion yuan last year and 21.5 billion yuan in 1988.
Military spending increased even though Mr. Liu released figures indicating that by Western accounting methods the budget deficit grew to $19.8 billion, or 27 percent of revenues last year. Other areas like education, culture and health care increased much less than military spending.
In fact, the publicly announced military budget includes just half of all military spending, experts say. It does not include money spent on acquiring new equipment, on weapons research or on relocating and supporting retired officers. Those amounts are disguised in other areas of the budget. In addition, the military has other substantial sources of income, including arms exports and the sales of the refrigerators, radios, clocks and other civilian items made by military-owned factories.
Even so, total military spending probably accounts just only a bit more than 3 percent of the gross national product, a smaller share than in many other countries. Other Asian countries are nervous largely because China has boundary disputes with at least seven neighbors and has lately been aggressive in pressing its claims.
Diplomats and other military experts say among the improved weapons that China is building or obtaining from Russia or other countries are fighter planes, surface-to-air missiles, destroyers, frigates, tanks and radar equipment. Chinese documents also say the country will acquire an aircraft carrier.
Distressed by suggestions abroad that China is becoming a threat, officials in Beijing have mounted a vigorous counteroffensive. "Recently, some people in Western countries have deliberately spread slanderous rumors that China is building up its national defense to a level 'seemingly beyond a capability for defense,' " the official New China News Agency complained a few weeks ago.
Mr. Li referred to such analyses in a meeting last month with former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and added, "All these fabricated rumors and absurd tales are totally ridiculous."
The New China News Agency asserted last week that critics of increased military spending here were "simply unhappy that there is no chaos in Asia, and they are trying to drive wedges among the Asian nations."
One Chinese official cited inflation as a factor in the rising military spending. But according to official statistics, retail prices rose less than 7 percent last year, and they have increased 32 percent since 1988, the same period in which the military budget has increased 98 percent.
Sympathetic diplomats, usually from countries that are not adjacent to China, also say it is natural for a country to increase its military spending as its overall economy grows.

Notes and Bonds Advance in Price

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes rose yesterday after a little help from the Federal Reserve. But all eyes were really looking ahead to today, when the Labor Department releases the Consumer Price Index for February.
That report may help settle the question of whether the current rate of inflation is low enough for a continued decline in longer-term interest rates, or whether inflation may be higher this year than some have anticipated, which could slow or even halt any decline of long rates below their recent lows. 
 The price of the 10-year note jumped 18/32 , as the yield dropped to 6.87 percent. The price of the 30-year bond rose 8/32 , and the yield slipped to 6.87 percent, from 6.89 percent Monday.
Matthew Alexy, a government trading strategist at the First Boston Corporation, said that a lot of the activity was traders getting into a neutral position before the C.P.I. release. This meant that traders who were short, or who had sold Treasury securities in anticipation of a decline in price, bought some yesterday.
According to Bloomberg Business News, the consensus forecast for the C.P.I. in February is a rise of three-tenths of 1 percent. That would follow a five-tenths of 1 percent increase in January. The January increase was a surprise but was dismissed at the time because part of the rise was attributed to special factors.
But since then, the February jobs report, released March 6, showed that the economy was stronger than expected. This has put much more focus on the inflation rate because a lot of investors who have been buying Treasury securities have assumed that the rate of consumer inflation will decline toward 2.5 percent this year, below 1992's 3 percent.
The help from the Federal Reserve yesterday was the central bank's buying of short-term and intermediate-term Treasury notes, in what is called by traders a "coupon pass." The Federal Reserve regularly does such buying when it wants to add reserves to the banking system to prevent normal seasonal flucuations in the demand for money from making its monetary policy too restrictive. The coupon pass was expected; the timing was a little of a surprise.
In a separate development, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York asked for reports from primary dealers on the trading of the current five-year Treasury note because of a possible squeeze.
 
Bond-Payment Vote
 Voters in Brevard County, Fla., yesterday decided by a narrow margin to stay in a controversial government office complex in Viera, choosing not to default on a $23.9 million bond issue to pay for the complex.
The results should have a calming effect on the $65 billion market for certificates of participation, a kind of tax-exempt municipal bond for which the principal and interest payments have to be appropriated on a annual basis. The C.O.P.'s are controversial in Brevard County because they were used to avoid a general vote on the bond issue for the new office complex.
The threat of a community voting to default on such an issue had raised the yield or cost for such issues recently by as much as 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
The referendum was in two parts. First the voters were asked if they wanted to stay in the office complex. If they said yes, they were asked if they wanted to retire the controversial certificates of participation by issuing general obligation bonds. A recent study by the board of commissioners said retiring the old bonds with new ones would lower costs for the county because interest rates had declined so much since the sale of the original certificates of participation.
According to the supervisor of elections, the vote for staying in the office complex was 46,290 to 43,017, and the vote against refinancing with general obligation bonds was 47,930 to 38,270.
The vote was a victory for the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, which spent more than $370,000 -- or about 90 percent of all the contributions reported -- in an effort to persuade the voters not to default on the $23.9 million bond issue the company has insured.
According to reports filed with the supervisor of elections, M.B.I.A. contributed $361,600 in cash and $12,375 in other contributions for a total value of $373,975. The contributions went to three organizations that are in favor of the county remaining in its office complex in Viera and, therefore, not defaulting on the bonds sold in 1989 to pay for the offices.
Most of the contributions went to the Brevard Taxpayers Association. The B.T.A. received $240,000 in cash and $8,625 of in kind contributons from M.B.I.A. An additional $70,000 in cash and $1,875 of in-kind contributions went to the Melbourne-Palm Bay Political Action Committee. And $51,600 in cash and $1,875 of in-kind contributions went to the Cocoa Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. The contributons are through March 11, the last date the organizations could accept money for the campaign on the referendum, unless they continue as permanent groups after the election.
Michael C. Ballinger, a spokesman for M.B.I.A., said that the donations were made in response to requests from groups "attempting to educate voters on this very emotional issue." He said that the total amounts to a little less than $1 per registered voter.

HEADLINE: A New Breed of Hired Hands Cultivates Grass-Roots Anger

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
The era of electronic vox pop, when radio talk shows help drive out a prospective Attorney General, has meant boom times for at least one species of Washington insider: consultants who deliver populist rage.
Consider Bonner & Associates, which occupies an entire floor of one of Washington's pricier office buildings. From a distance it looks like the boiler room of any telephone sales company, with fresh-faced young men and women in narrow cubicles reading intently from typed scripts. 
 But these operators are not pitching Veg-O-Matics or life insurance. They are prospecting by phone for that most elusive of Washington commodities, the hometown pressure points that representatives or senators are loath to resist.
This company is among a new breed of Washington firms that has turned grass-roots organizing techniques to the advantage of its high-paying clients, generally trade associations and corporations.
Unlike old-fashioned letter-writing campaigns, which rained easily identifiable form letters on lawmakers, the new campaigns are sometimes intended to appear spontaneous. Jack Bonner, who founded Bonner & Associates in 1984, says he always lets his targets know of his activities. But the rise of this industry has made it hard to tell the difference between between manufactured public opinion and genuine explosions of popular sentiment.
Or as they put it in the lobbying industry: is it grass roots or Astro Turf.
 
The Zoe Baird Case
 The real thing helped bring down President Clinton's first choice for Attorney General, Zoe Baird, when thousands of angry citizens, apparently without the benefit of outside encouragement, called their members of Congress to complain about her hiring of an illegal immigrant couple as a baby sitter and driver, and her failure to pay the helpers' social security taxes
But Bonner Associates specializes in seizing on unformed public sentiment, marshaling local interest groups and raining faxes, phone calls and letters on Congress or the White House on a few days' notice. Some competitors rely more on a retail approach. They phone potentially irate citizens, deliver detailed briefings and then transfer the newly aggravated callers directly to the office of the relevant senator or representative.
"The golden age of grass roots has arrived," Mr. Bonner said. He has mobilized public opinion against limits on credit card interest rates when he was working for the banks, against tougher fuel efficiency standards when he was on the side of the auto makers, and against triple-trailer trucks when he was hired by a railroad.
Mr. Bonner reports a surge in potential clients in the last two to three months. "In the past," he said, "a lot of businesses wouldn't go to the grass roots because they thought they could contain their problems in D.C., either by lobbying or by George Bush vetoing anti-business legislation. Well, that veto isn't there any more."
 
Technique Is Developed
 Through the early 1980's, environmental groups and others on the fringes of the Washington establishment relied on letters, petitions and other manpower-intensive methods to counter the power and connections of big corporations.
But by the end of the decade, specialists like Mr. Bonner, as well as several Washington political consultants and lobbyists, had begun to co-opt the strategy, a trend that gathered even more momentum when Ross Perot and Bill Clinton tapped into the electronic babble of dissent that is talk radio and television.
"What some of these trade organizations are asking now is: How do we find these Perot-type people and get them to speak out on our issue?" said R. Nancy Clack, vice president of a political consulting company called The Clinton Group, which has been operating since the 1960's and has no ties to the current Administration. "How do we fit into this talk-radio democracy?"
Jeff Eller, director of media affairs at the White House, who is one of the Clinton Administration officials responsible for keeping a finger on the public pulse, said he had a practiced ear for detecting stage-managed campaigns. Mr. Eller said that on an average day, 65,000 people weigh in by telephone with their opinions about President Clinton's economic plan, and another 700 a day use computers to send electronic mail.
 
'From the Heart'
 "You can tell if you listen to the phone calls and read the mail which is preprogrammed and which comes from the heart," he said. "If a bunch of phone calls saying the same thing come in at the same time, you know."
Or do you?
Ms. Clack said The Clinton Group used computer data banks to identify people with specific leanings. Her company generally works for Democrats and can set in motion a wave of sincere, unscripted phone calls.
The technique, called "patch through," works like this:
Say, for example, the National Organization for Women opposes a nomination to the Supreme Court because the candidate has an equivocal record on abortion rights.
The Clinton Group will take the membership rolls of the group, and match names to phone numbers. It might also use its computer to cross-reference magazine subscriptions, data on personal purchasing habits, and precincts with particular voting and income profiles, to come up with a bigger list of sympathetic people.
 
Computer Dialing
 At the company's phone bank in Louisville, Ky., a computer dials the numbers. When someone answers, an operator comes on the line and explains NOW's position, offering to transfer the caller, at no charge, to the White House switchboard or local member of Congress.
"Progressive groups have got to do this," Ms. Clack insisted. "The right wing doesn't. They've got the Christian Broadcasting Network, the 700 Club and about 1,200 radio outlets. All they do is print a press release, read it on the air."
The quality of this kind of briefing is crucial. Mr. Bonner, 44 years old, who was a political aide to the late Senator John Heinz, a Republican from Pennsylvania, employs as many as 200 "issue junkies" to explain matters to a local business or interest group. He often asks the people he called to call him back after they are through talking to their Congressional office, to test whether any unforeseen questions arose.
Mr. Bonner's 12,000-square-foot offices occupy an entire floor, through which he walks with the pride of a high-tech craftsman. He shows off the million-dollar phone system, which can keep 300 lines humming at once, and walks a visitor past rooms of phones.
 
Methods of Enlistment
 Mr. Bonner tries to enlist local people. Sometimes it is a straightforward matter of getting local bankers or small businessmen to call their Congressman. Other times the connection is a bit more oblique, like the time he persuaded local handicapped groups to attack proposed fuel efficiency standards for auto makers. (Smaller cars would be arguably harder for handicapped people to get into.)
His services do not come cheap. A campaign aimed at a handful of lawmakers on a subcommittee could cost in the tens of thousands of dollars, but one trade association in an uphill fight on the Senate floor paid $3 million for a single month's work.
Prodding of public opinion, whether by talk show hosts or Washington experts, has touched off its own backlash and complaints that the reborn democratic spirit is being subverted.
"Give me a break," Mr. Bonner replied. "Most communications to the White House or the Hill are prompted. Whether by the Sierra Club, the National Rifle Association or the American Association of Retired People is not the point."
At the White House, the switchboard has already been equipped with that favorite high-tech wrinkle of corporate America: the voice mail system, which allows callers to register views by pressing numbers on phones.
"Thank you for calling the White House; we appreciate your call," intones a man's voice. "If you would like to make a comment or express your opinion, please press one now."
There's not a lot of room for nuance. "Do you support or oppose the President's economic program," the message begins. The next three selections allow voters to assess the Clinton plan for its size of deficit reduction, cuts in Government spending and the fairness of the tax burden proposed for upper income taxpayers. In each case, the choices range from "too far" to "not far enough" to "about right."
Callers are invited to talk with an operator if they have further thoughts.

HEADLINE: Wider Investment Tax Credits Urged

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
A council of experts that Congress and President George Bush had appointed to recommend ways of increasing the nation's competitiveness called today for broader investment tax credits than President Clinton proposed, a stepped-up program to spur exports, and a revamping of the nation's high schools.
In a report, the council of business, labor and government officials praised President Clinton's economic package but said stronger measures were needed to increase investment. 
 "The United States continues to face major competitiveness problems," the Competitiveness Policy Council said, pointing to the nation's huge trade deficit. "The problem has been developing for two to three decades. It cannot be solved overnight."
The panel called for a permanent investment tax credit on equipment, saying the President's proposal for a temporary two-year credit does not go far enough. The council also said that the tax credit on research and development should be expanded to include research into improving manufacturing processes.
Viewing exports as a way to create high-wage jobs, the report urged the Administration to increase export credits to $20 billion a year to help American industry compete against foreign rivals. That would be an increase from $12 billion at present and would involve an annual outlay of about $1.2 billion to subsidize interest. France spent $1.99 for every $1,000 in nonfarm exports in 1990, the report said, while the United States spent 59 cents.
"The United States really lags behind in export finance," said C. Fred Bergsten, chairman of the council and president of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research group. The council also includes Rand V. Araskog, chairman of ITT; John J. Murphy, chairman of Dresser Industries; Edward V. Regan, a Republican who is Comptroller of New York State; Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and Lynn R. Williams, president of the United Steelworkers of America.
Giving low marks to the American education system, the council recommended developing nationwide performance standards, a uniform nationwide high school transcript and increasing the importance of school records for colleges and employment. The council complained that high school students had little incentive to do well because employers paid scant attention to how well they did in school.
"Our high school students perform far worse than their counterparts abroad," the report said. "Twenty percent of our adults are functionally illiterate. A country cannot compete effectively unless its human resources are world class, and ours are falling toward the bottom of the league."
 The report said the Government should provide financial rewards to schools and districts that achieve high standards. It also said aid to colleges should be linked to raising their admission standards.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mark Time in More Light Trading

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Traffic on the stock exchanges yesterday seemed to move as cautiously as on the nation's icy roads, with the major market averages virtually unchanged in slow-motion trading.
Investors were fretting about today's consumer price report, traders and strategists said. The stock market's recent gains to record levels have been built on the bond market's strength, which could crumble on clear signs of inflation. The low yields available on bonds and other interest-bearing investments have prompted investors to seek higher returns from stocks. 
 Yesterday, the bond market's brightness after several gloomy days helped the utility stocks, which are sensitive to interest rates. But medical issues, up a bit lately, resumed their downward course.
 
Dow Up 0.54
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose just 0.54 point, to 3,442.95. The Standard & Poor's 500 was fractionally lower, the Nasdaq fractionally higher and the American Exchange index up by a hair to a record. Big Board volume of 218.8 million shares, though up from Monday's 195.9 million, was still light.
Analysts' metaphors seemed to outnumber trades. "The market was very goosey, very itchy, very nervous," said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisors.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News estimate that consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in February. After producer prices came in higher than expected last Friday, investors are especially alert for evidence that the economy's expansion is reviving inflation.
"People are saying, 'Whoops, I'm going to wait for more evidence to come in to reinforce some of the market themes I was confident about three weeks ago,' " said Robert Heisterberg, global policy analyst at Alliance Capital.
 
Some Could Benefit
 Today's number could move some stocks much more than others, perhaps even in different directions. Cyclical issues stand to benefit from indications of economic strength, analysts said, even if inflation rises mildly.
Nancy Lazar of the International Strategy and Investment advisory firm was one of several strategists who said that any damage from today's report would be only momentary. "Even if tomorrow's number is bad, there seems to be plenty of evidence that there is downward pressure on prices," she said, citing stable gold prices and labor costs.
Among the market's shiniest sectors yesterday, the Dow Jones utility average of electric and natural gas companies rose 1.19, to 237.79, led by Consolidated Natural Gas, up 7/8, to 47 7/8. Many telephone stocks continued their gains, with Ameritech up 1 3/4, to 76 1/4, and BellSouth up 3/4, to 55.
 
 
 
SECONDARY LIFT

 
For all the recent enthusiasm about heavy-industry stocks, the Nasdaq composite index has quietly gained about twice as much as the Dow over the last several weeks. The Nasdaq biotechs have stablized somewhat and the computer issues have rebounded, leaving the Nasdaq index less than 2 percent below its Feb. 4 high.

HEADLINE: War on Ice Uses Sun And Muscle

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
An army of shovel-wielding laborers fanned out across New York City yesterday to liberate sidewalks, intersections, fire hydrants and catch basins from the icy snow left by the weekend blizzard.
Aided by rising temperatures, more than 800 laborers hired by the Sanitation Department at about $8 an hour smashed and scooped and pushed to clear the way for pedestrians and motorists. 
 "It's a little strenuous, but if you're physically fit, it's easy to deal with," said Fred Sanders Jr., 26, as he and two other men muscled through the thick sheets of ice covering the corner of 135th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem.
"This is pretty much my backyard here," he said, pointing toward his apartment two blocks away. "I like to keep my backyard clean for other people."
Like nearly all his fellow laborers, Mr. Sanders, a veteran of the Persian Gulf war, is unemployed and learned about the job from the radio and newspapers.
 
'Just Chipping It Out'
 His partner, Michael Tillman, 32, an unemployed chef who lives in Harlem, agreed. "I had nothing to do," he said. "I was bored sitting at home. Maybe if I do something for the city, they'll do something for me."
Emily Lloyd, the city's Sanitation Commissioner, said the department was relying on the laborers, who should number about 1,000 by today, because its more than 1,700 plows and salt spreaders were running into so many difficulties removing the snow.
"This is going to be a day-by-day dig-out," she said, noting that the department last hired day laborers after the blizzard of 1983. "We're really just chipping it out a piece at a time."
Most of the laborers were men, but a few women signed up.
"This is for the community and for safety," said Brendina Ellington, 25, of Harlem. "And it's something for me to do to earn a little extra money. I can fulfill the needs as good as a man can because I'm not lazy."
Pedestrians slogging through the mounds of sludge applauded the laborers.
"We've had a lot of trouble because we can't get across the ice," said Evelyn Telbrot, 60, who walks with a cane. "But now that they're cleaning it up, nobody will fall."

HEADLINE: Rise in Starts Only 2.5% for New Homes

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Construction of new homes and apartments rose moderately in February, the Commerce Department said today, though not enough to recover from a sharp January slump.
 The annual rate of starts of new homes increased 2.5 percent in the month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.21 million units. That modest upturn came after a revised fall of 8.4 percent in January, which was larger than than the 7.2 percent decrease previously reported by the department. 
 The gains in February construction were widespread, with only the South reporting fewer starts of new homes. But over all, the February starts level was 6 percent lower than the seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29 million units in the month a year earlier.
 
Strengthening Is Seen

Analysts expect housing to strengthen however, helped by mortgage rates that are at the lowest level in two decades despite edging up last week after nearly three months of declines. Last week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates inched up to 7.47 percent from the previous week's 7.44 percent.
 Sales of new homes had weakened sharply in January after rising strongly in the second half of 1992 as the economy began growing once more. Housing is still expected to be a source of strength in the relatively sluggish expansion.
 Federal Reserve banks across the country, surveying the economy last week in the Fed's periodic "beige book," report, cited "almost universally positive" reports about home sales and construction prospects.
 Today's report showed that construction of single-family homes declined eight-tenths of a percent in February, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.05 million units, after falling 6.4 percent in January. New apartment-building construction jumped 33.3 percent, to an annual rate of 156,000 units, after dropping 23.5 percent in January.
 
Permits Decline
 Applications for permits to build new homes and apartment buildings dropped in February for a second straight month, down 3.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.14 million units. Permit applications fell 1.7 percent in January.
 Permits for single-family homes fell in February by 4.1 percent, to a 956,000-unit rate, after a 4.5 percent decline in January. Permits for apartment buildings rose to 188,000 from 183,000 in January.

HEADLINE: Bank Yields Mostly Down For Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by banks on money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the week beginning today are down slightly compared with the previous reporting period, with the New York market only a little off the pace of the downticks recorded at 20 major banks nationwide.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest-rate publication in North Palm Beach, Fla., the average New York market yield for a six-month certificate of deposit remained unchanged compared with a decline of 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, in 20 major banks across the country. The average decline in a money market account was the same in New York as it was across the county. 
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, where rate fluctuations are often the harbinger of trends in deposit rates, bills were sold with higher discount rates than the previous week. The rate for a three-month bill rose 2 basis points, to 3 percent, while the rate for a six-month rose 3 basis points, to 3.12 percent.
In The Bank Rate Monitor's latest survey, the average New York area money market account is down about a basis point, to 2.58 percent, with certificates of deposits unchanged at 2.69 percent for a three-month maturity and 2.9 percent for a six-month maturity.
For the third consecutive week Chase Manhattan Bank was named among the New York banks posting the sharpest changes in deposit rates this week. The bank raised the yield on both its three-month and six-month certificates of deposit, with a three-month up by 25 basis points, to 2.63 percent, and a six-month up 26 basis points, to 2.69 percent.
National Westminster Bank lowered the yield on its money market accounts 10 basis points, to 2.53 percent.
Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks were down a little more sharply when compared with the New York market; an average money market account slipped 1 basis point, to 2.56 percent, and a six-month certificate of deposit dropped by 2 basis points, to 2.89 percent.

HEADLINE: KITCHEN BOOKSHELF;
Irish Food That Won't Turn You Green

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
IRISH food gets but an annual nod in America, on St. Patrick's Day, like the fruitcake at Christmas. It's no wonder, given the inevitable plates of gray stew or sodden cabbage with corned beef. Food like that does not begin to reveal Ireland's invitingly rustic culinary soul.
Consider instead, for starters, pristine oysters sparkling on a bed of seaweed with slices of earthy hearth-baked brown bread spread with hand-churned butter and accompanied by glasses of rich, dark stout. Other possibilities: Crusty, butter-browned triangles of potato bread with bowls of pleasantly peppery wild-nettle or watercress soup, thick cuts of poached fresh salmon, casseroles of sausages with potatoes and onions, and desserts drenched in cream. 
 Ireland boasts a peasant cuisine based on the wealth of superb fresh ingredients that come from its rich soil and surrounding seas. Mussels, oysters, prawns, salmon, potatoes, carrots, greens, lamb, beef, butter, cream, oats, apples and berries are used frugally among people haunted by memories of famine.
This year, Irish cooks and writers have produced an appealing crop of cookbooks to explain it all.
THE FESTIVE FOOD OF IRELAND by Darina Allen (Roberts Rinehart, $12.95), a slender volume decorated with color photographs, paintings of food and Celtic motifs, is a fine primer. The author, who runs the cooking school started by her mother, Myrtle Allen, at Ballymalloe House in southern Ireland near Cork, covers the essential highlights of the cuisine according to a calendar of holidays. She also examines the lore and legends surrounding the culinary traditions.
Thanks to the Broadway drama "Dancing at Lughnasa," some Americans now know that in addition to St. Patrick's Day the Irish celebrate Lughnasa (the word is pronounced LOO-nuh-sah) to mark the beginning of the harvest. That holiday, as well as St. Bridget's Day, May Day, Threshing Day and Michaelmas, are among the 14 that are given lively descriptions, often from the author's childhood memories, each accompanied by a few apt recipes.
Reading instructions like "mash them straight away" for the potatoes that go into fadge, a deliciously savory potato bread, you can sense the author at your side.
At the same time, even though this is an American edition of the book, no alternatives are offered for ingredients like Bramley cooking apples (dry-textured apples), sultanas (golden raisins) and demerara sugar (brown sugar). Ms. Allen, who welcomes an American clientele to her school, must know that such terms are unfamiliar in the United States.
A certain comfort in the kitchen is also necessary to execute recipes that do not specify whether onions are to be sliced or chopped to make a soup nor give step-by-step details on how to fashion pastry. As for the plain brown soda bread, it required nearly twice the four cups of buttermilk listed in the recipe. (Half the flour might have been better still.) But recipes for boxty pancakes, fadge and poached salmon with Irish butter sauce worked fine.
IN AN IRISH COUNTRY KITCHEN by Clare Connery (Simon & Schuster, $32) takes a more encyclopedic approach, nearly exhausting the repertory with its 150 recipes. In addition to exploring Ireland's culinary traditions, the author -- a home economist, food consultant, chef and broadcaster in Belfast, Northern Ireland -- provides a detailed overview of Ireland's history, farming and fishing.
The plodding prose, which lightens up when recipes are described, is no match for the glorious color photographs of the countryside and dishes sizzling on a hearth or arrayed on a farmhouse table.
But mining the recipe sections yields a trove of things like silky carrot soup smoothed with butter, rabbit stew bolstered with English mustard, crusty parsnip cakes and excellent scones and oatcakes.
A TRIFLE, A CODDLE AND A FRY , subtitled "An Irish Literary Cookbook," by Veronica Jane O'Mara and Fionnuala O'Reilly (Moyer Bell, $18.95), presents gastronomic profiles of 20th-century Irish writers. The authors live in Dublin and share an avocational interest in food.
Relying on anecdotes and excerpts from the works of 11 writers, they have cobbled together mini-biographies describing the writers' personal tastes and quoting from food-related passages in their works. The 11 include James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Sean O'Casey, Bernard Shaw and Elizabeth Bowen, as well as some less prominent figures like Oliver St. John Gogarty and Mary Lavin.
Most of the recipes, some of which are forced companions to the literary portraits, were written by the two compilers. Their descriptions of how much their families enjoy this or that dish, often in the third person, add a jarring, pretentious note to an otherwise charming concept that succeeds best in the chapters on Joyce, that author of food-filled works, and George Moore, a gastronomic snob.
The recipes are a mixture of the good, the odd and the out of date. Rarely do they come from the literary figures themselves, not even from Molly Keane, who has produced a cookbook. And scales are required, since measurements are usually given by weight rather than volume. But the result can be worth the effort, especially for the simple but lush chocolate cake iced with melted candy bars and the apple duff (said to be a favorite of Joyce and his wife, Nora Barnacle Joyce), which consists of apples stuffed with raisins and baked in excellent pastry made with a touch of wheat germ.
Finally, a tiny gem, HOW TO MAKE A PERFECT CUP OF COFFEE (Stone Street Press, $3), is one of the many engaging hand-printed books that Malachi McCormick, an Irish author and calligrapher who has written books about Irish food, produces at his press on Staten Island. The 20-page booklet, covered in textured, speckled paper that suggests whole wheat, describes a variety of ways to select, grind, store and prepare coffee. The only recipe, at the end of the book, is a simple one for Irish coffee.
The author's exacting standards -- remember, he's writing about perfection -- are illustrated by an anecdote about an acquaintance who has the right equipment but the wrong tastes and by the fact that no mention is made of decaffeinated coffee. They can be summed up in this line: "Coffee will get no better than when it's just made."
 
Apple Duff
 
Adapted from "A Trifle, a Coddle and a Fry"
 
Total time: 1 hour 30 minutes
 
 1 1/2 cups flour
 1/2 cup wheat germ
 1 teaspoon salt
 6 ounces (1 1/2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, in small pieces
 1/3 cup cold water (approximately)
 4 medium-size apples
 4 tablespoons light brown sugar
 1/2 cup raisins
 Cinnamon to taste
 1 beaten egg
 Whipped cream or heavy cream (optional).
1. Sift the flour into a bowl and mix with wheat germ and salt. Cut in the butter using two knives or your finger tips, until the pieces are the size of peas. (This cutting can also be done by pulsing briefly in a food processor.)
2. By hand, lightly stir in most of the water and mix until the ingredients cling together to form a dough. Add water if necessary. Turn the dough out onto a floured board, knead briefly until smooth and cut it into four equal pieces. Shape each into a round patty.
3. Peel and core the apples, scooping out the core well but not cutting through to the bottom.
4. Mix the brown sugar, raisins and cinnamon together, and fill the apples with this mixture.
5. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
6. Roll out the portions of dough on a floured board to form circles about 8 inches across. Put an apple in the center of each and brush the edges of the dough with some beaten egg. Draw the pastry up around the apples to enclose them completely and press the edges together to seal. Brush the outside of the pastry with the remaining beaten egg and put the pastry-wrapped apples on a baking sheet.
7. Bake about 40 minutes, until golden brown. Serve warm with whipped cream or heavy cream.
Yield: 4 servings.

Carrot Soup
 
Adapted from "In an Irish Country Kitchen"
 
Total time: 1 hour 30 minutes
 
2 tablespoons butter or vegetable oil
 1 large onion, sliced thin
 1 clove garlic, crushed
 1 pound carrots (about 4 large ones), peeled and sliced
 3 1/4 cups chicken or vegetable stock
 Sprig of fresh thyme, sprig of parsley and bay leaf, tied together
 Pinch of ground mace
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
 2/3 cup half-and-half or light cream
 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley
 1 cup freshly fried croutons.
1. Heat the butter or oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion, garlic and carrots. Cook over low heat until the onions are soft but not brown, about 10 minutes.
2. Stir in the stock and add the herbs and mace. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, lower heat to a simmer, cover and cook until carrots are very tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
3. Puree the soup in a blender or food processor; then force it through a sieve into a clean saucepan. Stir in the half-and-half, and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Bring to a simmer, and serve with parsley and croutons sprinkled on top of each portion.
Yield: 6 servings.

Fadge
 
(Potato bread)
 
Adapted from "The Festive Food of Ireland"
 
Total time: 1 hour
 
 2 pounds Yukon gold or other boiling potatoes
 1 egg, beaten
 7 tablespoons butter, softened
 1/2 cup flour
 1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, chives or lemon thyme, or a mixture of them
 1 to 2 tablespoons whole milk
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
1. Put the potatoes in a saucepan, cover with water, and boil until tender. Drain, peel and mash in a bowl.
2. Stir in the egg, 3 tablespoons of the butter, 3 tablespoons of the flour and the herbs. The mixture should hold its shape but not be too stiff or dry. Add a little milk if necessary. Season well with salt and pepper.
3. Put the potato mixture on a work surface, knead it briefly, and flatten it into a round about an inch thick. Cut it into eighths.
4. Spread the remaining flour on a dish and season with salt and pepper.
5. Just before serving, dip each potato piece in the flour to coat lightly. Grease a griddle with some of the remaining butter or melt the butter in a large, heavy skillet, preferably cast iron. Fry the pieces of fadge over medium heat, about 4 minutes on each side, until crusty and browned. Serve at once.
Yield: 8 servings.
Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 220 calories, 11 grams fat, 55 milligrams cholesterol, 115 milligrams sodium (before salting), 4 grams protein, 30 grams carbohydrate.

HEADLINE: Save Nafta. But Don't Roll Over.

 BODY:
During the Presidential campaign Bill Clinton talked tough, vowing to hammer out bold protections for the environment and U.S. workers before he would approve the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. At the time, his demands sounded like potential deal-busters. Now he's facing up to the difficulty his campaign rhetoric poses for completing negotiations on the trade pact.
In Congressional testimony yesterday the President's chief trade negotiator, Mickey Kantor, took a tougher stance than he did the week before. But the proposals he outlined were cautious, even timid. Negotiations on final details begin today with the Mexicans and Canadians; if Mr. Clinton doesn't stiffen his demands, Nafta might run into trouble among Congressional Democrats. 
 Mr. Clinton is under pressure from environmentalists, labor and industry groups to win additional concessions from Mexico and Canada. But the pact signed by President Bush is sound at the core. By knocking down tariff and other trade barriers, Nafta would lower prices for hundreds of millions of consumers and help Mexico solidify its pro-market reforms.
It would protect U.S. workers from surges of Mexican imports. It is the most environmentally sensitive trade pact ever negotiated -- protecting U.S. standards against easy challenge. And while U.S. businesses will continue to move to Mexico, the flow should not rise much above current levels.
Yet there are areas where the agreement comes up short. It would provide no long-term funding to clean up polluted border areas. Nor would it force improved environmental codes and working conditions -- though in general the three countries have set high standards.
The glaring problem is Mexico's appalling record of enforcing standards. Here Nafta won't help much, because it provides no sanctions against a country that persistently violates its own environmental and labor laws. Lax enforcement becomes a trade issue when it permits companies to produce at lower costs, which can be passed along to customers as lower prices.
Mr. Kantor has offered useful, if incomplete, ways to address the problem. He's called on Mexico to give citizens easier access to courts to challenge environmental violations. He has also called for trilateral commissions to negotiate better environmental and labor standards and trigger investigations of alleged violations.
But what if a country consistently violates its own laws? In yesterday's testimony Mr. Kantor refused to say whether the commissions should levy trade sanctions. Such sanctions raise tricky issues of sovereignty. Is the U.S. prepared to have sanctions applied to companies because an international tribunal finds them guilty of polluting the air over Los Angeles or hiring illegal aliens?
Trade sanctions can also ignite protectionist maneuvers: businesses would be tempted to trump up charges against a foreign competitor in the hope that a tariff would be imposed on its exports.
Though tricky, these problems are solvable. Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott of the Institute for International Economics would allow panels to impose sanctions -- but apply them to all exports from the offending country, not just those from the offending companies. That way, companies from, say, the U.S. would gain little by bringing frivolous charges against Mexican competitors; yet Mexico would still be pressured to correct the violation because thousands of innocent exporters would feel threatened by across-the-board tariffs.
Nafta is a good deal for the U.S. even without improvements. And it would be a foreign policy blunder to let it die. Fortunately, the Administration seems well aware of the stakes. Still, there's room to get tougher without busting the deal.

HEADLINE: Northern Irish Talks Must Include Sinn Fein;
MacBride Principles

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your March 9 interview with Prime Minister Albert Reynolds of Ireland on the eve of his visit to the United States says that the MacBride principles "seek to discourage American investment in Northern Ireland companies that are deemed to discriminate against the Roman Catholic minority in the province." 
 The Irish National Caucus -- with the blessing of Sean MacBride -- initiated the MacBride principles in November 1984. The first thing we stated was that they do not call for disinvestment or divestment, reverse discrimination or quotas. The MacBride principles -- a nine-point set of fair employment, affirmative action principles -- seek to encourage United States companies not to be part of the pattern of anti-Catholic discrimination in Northern Ireland.
Since the MacBride campaign began, it has proved to be the most effective effort against anti-Catholic discrimination in Northern Ireland. The principles have been passed into law by 13 states; and more than 40 cities have passed or endorsed them.
The British Government acknowledges it spends millions of dollars in the United States to combat the MacBride campaign. Too bad it doesn't spend that much trying to create jobs for oppressed Catholics in Northern Ireland.

HEADLINE: Paul C. Barkley, 63, Ex-President of Airline

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: EL CAJON, Calif., March 16

 BODY:
Paul C. Barkley, an early advocate of low-cost air fares who weathered deregulation as president of the old Pacific Southwest Airlines, died of cancer on Monday. He was 63.
Mr. Barkley joined the airline in 1967 as vice president of finance and became president in 1979. He retired as chief executive in April 1989 after helping to negotiate the sale of the company to USAir. 
 He once said that the most difficult year for Pacific Southwest was 1978, when deregulation of the airline industry was announced, clearing the way for his company to fly outside California. It was also the year that a Pacific Southwest jet collided with a private plane over San Diego, killing 144 people, including 37 employees of the airline.
After retiring, he remained a member of the board of the PS Group Inc., which specialized in aircraft leasing, travel retailing and oil services. He was also chairman of the California Tourism Corporation and commissioner of the California Tourism Commission, and a director of the San Diego Economic Development Corporation.
Mr. Barkley, who was born in Minneapolis, graduated from San Diego State University.
He is survived by his wife, Jessie; two daughters, Anne Benson of Rochester, Minn., and Lynne Watkins of Lemon Grove, Calif.; two sons, Paul C. Barkley 3d of Winston-Salem, N.C., and John Barkley of El Cajon; his mother, Irene Novak of Minneapolis, and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Report Calls Cholesterol Tests in Young Unjustified

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
National guidelines for routine cholesterol screening of the nation's 80 million young adults may cost the nation billions of dollars a year and could end up harming, rather than helping, the people who are screened, a group of medical experts said in a report today.
In an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reviewing and reanalyzing existing data, Dr. Stephen B. Hulley, an epidemiologist at the University of California at San Francisco, and his colleagues say that there is no justification for routine cholesterol tests before age 35 in men and age 45 in women. They said that even if a young adult's cholesterol level is elevated, he or she will reap almost all the benefits of cholesterol-lowering if they wait until middle age to start a diet or drug treatment. 
 Moreover, Dr. Hulley said, such screening might actually do more harm than good. Early screening may lead young adults who are unable to control their cholesterol levels by diet alone to embark on a regimen of drug therapy. "We think that it's not a good idea for low-risk young people to begin a drug treatment that can last three, four or five decades," he said. "We have no idea what drugs do in such a long-term setting and there is evidence that makes us quite concerned that the harmful effects in a low-risk person might outweigh the benefits."

 Dr. Hulley is a member of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel, a 25-member group established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, a Federal agency. The panel has recommended that all adults over age 20 know their cholesterol levels.
Other members of the treatment panel, asked to comment on Dr. Hulley's conclusions, said they stood by the recommendations. Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute said he was "appalled" by the article. By denying young people cholesterol tests, he said, doctors would "deny them an opportunity to do something" about high cholesterol levels.
But some experts in heart disease said they felt the criticism of the national policy was on target.
The panel's recommendation "is quite seriously misguided," said Dr. C. David Naylor of the University of Toronto, who wrote an editorial accompanying Dr. Hulley's article. "There is a narrow window where cholesterol testing and treatment makes sense -- in the middle aged until around age 70."
 
Early Intervention Questioned
 Agreeing with that view were Dr. David Jacobs, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, and Dr. Michael Criqui, a professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of California at San Diego. "I've been saying that for a long time," Dr. Criqui added.
And a Canadian task force, the Toronto Working Group, determined in 1990 that cholesterol screening of young adults was unwarranted. Its recommendations were distributed to all doctors in Ontario.
The guiding philosophy of the American guidelines is the belief that the sooner a person with high cholesterol realizes it and take steps to reduce it, the better off the person will be.
Dr. Basil Rifkind, who directs lipid research at the heart institute, recited a simple sequence supporting early intervention. "Atherosclerosis is a cumulative process," he said. "We know that 20 or 30 or 40 years of these deposits precede a heart attack. So it is logical that if we bring down cholesterol levels and fatty deposits early in life, we will be better off."
Dr. Scott Grundy, who is director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and the American Heart Association's representative to the national task force that sets cholesterol screening guidelines, agreed: "The point is, if you can slow atherosclerosis over your whole lifetime, you are going to get less atherosclerosis in the end than if you started in middle age."
And Dr. James I. Cleeman, coordinator of the National Cholesterol Education Program, said that "it beggars the imagination" to say that people will be just as well off starting a cholesterol reduction program later in life.
 
Benefits at Issue
 But, Dr. Hulley said in an interview that data from clinical trials lead to the opposite position. Several large and well regarded studies that involved middle-aged people with high cholesterol levels consistently showed that for every 1 percent drop in cholesterol level, there is a 2 percent drop in the risk of heart disease.
Dr. Hulley and his colleagues calculate that if people lower their cholesterol early in life, they would achieve two-thirds of the maximum benefit that could be expected. Moreover, the improvement occurs within two years of starting treatment. Since no one has ever studied the effect of starting cholesterol lowering early in life, Dr. Hulley said, it is not known whether it would even be possible to do as well in reducing heart disease by beginning cholesterol-lowering earlier.
"There's a belief structure that we've all grown up with that makes us want to believe in the benefits from early intervention," Dr. Hulley said. In fact, he said, "the evidence, that almost everyone would agree with, is that you get most of the benefits starting in middle age."
But, Dr. Rifkind asked, what is wrong with starting early and possibly getting a little more benefit? After all, he noted, the panel guidelines emphasize low-fat diets to reduce cholesterol, which certainly will not cause harm.
 
Possible Harm Seen
 The problem, Dr. Hulley says, is that some people will forgo diets for drug therapy, which may be harmful. Dr. Alan Garber, a co-author of Dr. Hulley's paper who is a specialist in internal medicine and a health-care economist at Stanford University, argues that the logic of the national guidelines, combined with human nature, "inevitably lead to drug treatment." Moderate low-fat diets, he pointed out, "don't usually lead to large reductions in cholesterol."
Although there are no national data on the number of young people now taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, Dr. Hulley said that a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control several years ago indicated that 200,000 people between the ages of 20 and 35 were taking them. Cathy Kernen, a spokeswoman for Merck & Company, the maker of lovastatin, one of several cholesterol-lowering drugs, said that 2.8 million Americans take lovastatin and that 308,000 of them are between the ages of 35 and 45. She said 56,000 of those who take lovastatin are under age 35.
In Dr. Hulley's opinion, virtually no young adult should be taking the drugs. He and his colleagues are concerned about the possible adverse consequences of drug treatment that begins at an early age. Since the drugs would be given to otherwise healthy people, "we must be sure we're doing more good than harm," Dr. Hulley said.
Drug intervention is justified for the 1 in a million young people who inherit a rare disorder, type II familial hypercholesterolemia, that can cause heart attacks very early in life. But Dr. Hulley says that their numbers are so few that, for example, even if all women aged 20 to 24 were screened and treated only two deaths from heart attacks would be spared in the entire nation.
But Dr. Lenfant, the director of the heart institute, said the argument was "just ridiculous." He said he believed that young people who know their cholesterol levels will be more motivated to follow the low-fat diets that are recommended for all Americans.
"Are we going to tell people, 'Don't worry about your cholesterol because you may not be able to do something about it?' " Dr. Lenfant asked. "I just don't accept that as a philosophy every individual is entitled to be informed about his or her condition."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 18, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about cholesterol screening rendered a statement by Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, incorrectly. He said: "Are we going to tell people, 'Don't worry about your cholesterol because you may not be able to do something about it?' I just don't accept that as a philosophy. Every individual is entitled to be informed about his or her condition."

Shifting the Computer Jobless to Software

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 16

 BODY:
In Massachusetts, where more than 46,000 high-tech jobs have disappeared over the last three years, an innovative internship and training program is trying to help workers displaced from the computer, military and electronic hardware industries find jobs in the state's rapidly growing software industry.
At a time when so much of the storied Route 128 high-tech corridor outside Boston has fallen on hard times, the software industry in Massachusetts is expected to add 33,000 jobs in the next three years. 
 The internship program, announced on Monday, is sponsored by the Massachusetts Computer Software Council, a trade association, with cooperation from the Massachusetts Department of Employment and Training. The idea is to match unemployed high-tech workers from troubled computer giants like the Digital Equipment Corporation and Wang Laboratories, with software companies like Lotus Development, Banyan Systems and Credit Technologies.
Each fellow, as the interns are called, will spend six months at a software company learning the technology, acronyms and issues in on-site work projects. Though there are no guarantees of permanent job offers, there is hope that the match will result in a new career.
"We think we have the opportunity to pick up some terrific people out of the minicomputer community," said Frank Ingari, vice president of marketing at Lotus. "The knowledge generated by those companies is extremely relevant to us today -- large-system installation, internetworking, troubleshooting. We're very likely to end up employing these people."
The first group of 15 fellows will begin work immediately. Supporters see the program as a potential national model for pursuing the Clinton Administration's goal of training and retraining workers.
Joyce Plotkin, director of the Mass Software Council, said she believed the program was the first of its kind in the nation. To be eligible, an unemployed worker must have 8 to 10 years' experience in a computer, electronics or military business.
"Some of these people have worked only in the mainframe area," Ms. Plotkin said, "which is very different from the PC software area. Those worlds don't cross very often."
Each participating software company must contribute $10,000 per fellow to cover costs of administering the program and pay a weekly $350 stipend to each fellow over the course of the internship.
John Phelan, with 25 years in the computer industry, is among the first fellows. Out of work for 18 months, Mr. Phelan, 48, will start his internship with Credit Technologies in Waltham this week. To qualify, he had to make it through a screening process with the state agencies and interviews with companies.
"The job picture has been really gloomy," Mr. Phelan said. "This offers a pretty strong ray of hope."

HEADLINE: SENATORS APPROVE A BILL THAT EASES VOTE REGISTRATION

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
In an effort to encourage voter registration, the Senate today passed legislation that would allow a person to register to vote when applying for a driver's license.
The quick and relatively lopsided approval of the bill, by a vote of 62 to 37, belied the two angry weeks of partisan sniping that preceded it. Passage came only after the Senate's 57 Democrats conceded that they lacked the 60 votes needed to halt a Republican filibuster against the bill, and after they gave in to demands for small but politically important changes that must now be negotiated with the House before the bill can become law. 
 Without the concessions, the Democrats would have been unable to break the filibuster. That would have been an even deeper embarrassment for the White House, which had declared the voter-registration bill a priority in the new Congress. President Clinton himself had worked the phones on the issue, lobbying swing-voting Republicans for days.
 
The 'Motor Voter' Bill
 The bill, nicknamed "motor voter," would require states to permit every adult over the age of 18 to register to vote simply by filling out a form while they obtain a driver's license or apply for disability benefits. It would also establish a nationwide system of voter registration by mail.
Under Republican pressure, the Senate removed provisions that would have required voter registration at welfare and unemployment offices. But the bill, heavily favored by Democrats who believe it would increase turnout in poorer precincts, where their support is concentrated, would sharply increase the number of registered voters. Ninety percent of American adults have a driver's license.
Thomas Mann, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution, estimated that the bill would increase turnout in major elections by five percentage points. Only 50 percent to 55 percent of all eligible voters now go to the polls in major elections.
 
Why Republicans Objected
 Republicans, who filibustered the bill for two weeks, have called the bill a partisan scheme to lard the voter rolls with new Democrats and to heap the cost -- up to $20 million annually, by Congress's estimate -- on state and local governments. They also objected to the notion of imposing a Federal mandate on what has historically been a matter of state discretion.
The final vote came after a furious bout of amending and political horse-trading. Among other changes, the Republicans weakened a clause that would have signed up as new voters millions of predominantly Democratic welfare recipients, and the Democrats rejected a bid to automatically register hundreds of thousands of predominantly Republican military workers.
George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, later dismissed suggestions that the Republicans' success presaged more trouble for the Democrats on other vital legislation, such as Mr. Clinton's budget and his $31 billion package of economic stimulus measures. "Different bill, different issue, different circumstances," Senator Mitchell said.
Senator Wendell H. Ford, the Kentucky Democrat who sponsored the bill, said the Democrats had preserved 90 percent of what they sought in the legislation and had produced "a reasonably good bill."
But his Republican colleague from Kentucky, Senator Mitch McConnell, who led the fight against the bill, said his party had just begun to flex its muscles. "This week we demonstrated that we can improve a bill," he said. "There may be future instances in which we will have to defeat a bill."
The Senate will now try to reconcile the legislation passed today with a broadly similar version that the House passed last month. The finished product will go to Mr. Clinton, who has promised to sign it. A similar bill was approved by Congress last year but vetoed by President George Bush.
As part of today's compromise, Democrats pledged a good-faith effort to persuade the House to accept the Republican amendments when the two versions of the bill are melded. But the chief Democratic sponsor of the House bill, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, immediately signaled that that would not be easy.
"The Senate has sold the farm and dramatically undermined the hope that the House bill offered," he said in a statement, adding that the House "ought to reject the Senate bill."
 
Decline in Voter Turnout
 The legislation aims to reverse a 30-year decline in voter turnout in American elections. About 9 out of 10 registered voters go to the polls in Presidential election years. But the turnout in major elections is much lower because many people do not register -- 70 million of 180 million prospective voters.
Both the Senate and House bills would dramatically increase the share of citizens registered to vote, largely by making registration an almost seamless part of everyday tasks like getting a driver's license.
Everyone over 18 who applied for or renewed a driver's license or sought public assistance for a disability would register to vote, simply by signing an affidavit appended to each application. Military recruitment centers would develop their own procedures to routinely sign up new servicemen and women as voters. The bill also orders states to adopt a standard procedure for registering new voters by mail.
 
Modest Impact Predicted
 But outside experts suggest that the actual impact on Election-Day turnout at the polls will be more modest.
"Given what we know about states where motor-voter has already been implemented, you're really looking at a five to 10 percentage-point increase in turnout, and that's at the most," said Ruy A. Teixeira, a sociologist at Brookings Institution scholar who is the author of "The Disappearing American Voter" (Brookings, 1992).
"A lot of these people are somewhat disconnected from political issues and the political process," he said of the nonvoters. "There's no guarantee that they're going to go out and vote just because you sign them up."
To the 57 Senate Democrats who voted for the bill, and to many civics and civil rights groups as well, the legislation is nevertheless a historic expansion of the constitutional right to vote. Republican opposition to expanding that right, Senator Mitchell said today, was "pathetic."
But the Republicans were incensed by the Democrats' zeal to register the jobless and welfare recipients, who would have been added to the voter rolls more or less automatically in the original bill. And the Republicans were equally dismayed by the Democrats' omission, at first, of any plan to register members of the military.
Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Vietnam war hero, said 200,000 servicemen and women are denied a chance to vote each year because of registration problems related to their nomadic lives. Today he carved out the Republican position with a broadax, offering an amendment that would have automatically registered every member of the armed services.
The amendment was tabled, largely on a party-line vote. But, under Republican pressure, the legislation was changed to insure that recruits are signed up to vote in nearly automatic fashion.

HEADLINE: Saving Lives and Money Too: Doctors Say It Can Be Done

SERIES: A Search for Limits -- A periodic look at prescriptions for an ailing health-care system. A Search for Limits -- A periodic look at prescriptions for an ailing health-care system

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DANVILLE, Pa.

 BODY:
Dr. James C. Blankenship, a cardiologist with a health-maintenance organization in central Pennsylvania, performs costly, risky procedures in which tubes are pushed to the heart to help find whether coronary vessels are clogged.
In his catheterization laboratory, he studied X-rays revealing a partly blocked artery in a 55-year-old man. "What are the chances this will shut off, causing a heart attack, versus the risks of surgery?" he asked. "The studies differ." 
 "I'll advise him to watch and wait," said the doctor, whose salary would not be affected one way or the other. "I want to do everything that's necessary, but not too much."
As Americans consider a more frugal medical future, possibly dominated by competing H.M.O.'s or other forms of "managed care" that limit consumer choice, urgent questions are rising about the quality of care and how to protect it. Will people be pushed into health plans staffed by sullen, rushed doctors whose decisions are second-guessed and who are paid extra to scrimp on costly tests and operations?
Or will they find sensitive doctors who have no financial incentive to do too much or too little, have ready access to the best technologies and hold down costs by preventing illness and avoiding procedures with little benefit?
 
Room for Judgment
 Medical experts are scrutinizing better health plans around the country to see how large savings might be gained through efficiency and prudence, not through shortchanging the sick. And the evidence suggests that institutions that foster physicians like Dr. Blankenship and allow them to exercise professional judgment may be in the best position to pursue that goal.
At his organization, the Geisinger Foundation in Danville, the decision about how much is enough is left to the doctors. Their cautious style of medicine has held costs well below the national average. Increases here have still averaged 8.6 percent in recent years, though, raising questions about whether the country will be able to tame medical inflation without cutting into the quality of care.
The 530 salaried doctors who work here, and offer care through a prepaid insurance plan, do receive prodding from above. But it involves not constant second-guessing or rewards for scrimping, but rather a steady flow of research news and tips that helps suffuse the institution with an ethic of conservative care.
"Here, we don't police; we trust our doctors," said Dr. Howard G. Hughes, who directs the H.M.O., the Geisinger Health Plan.
In the case of the 55-year-old man, some doctors would have recommended immediate surgery, but Dr. Blankenship felt sure that a trial period of drug therapy was in his patient's best interest.
 
Covers Wide Area Of Pennsylvania
 In Danville, a town of 6,000 people, Geisinger runs an advanced 577-bed hospital as well as a network of clinics over a wide area of central and northeastern Pennsylvania. Its growing H.M.O. serves 142,000 members, while the same doctors and clinics also provide the same style of care to hundreds of thousands more people covered by government or other insurance.
The doctors insist that their brand of medicine improves on a system laden with incentives to overuse procedures.
And they are saving money. The H.M.O. has the lowest rates in Pennsylvania, according to the state insurance department, with monthly premiums this year of $109.70 for individuals and $285.22 for families for a plan covering nearly everything but prescriptions.
But the numbers suggest, too, just how severe the challenge is. The health plan's charges have risen by an average of 8.6 percent a year since 1985, Dr. Hughes said. That is a good record compared with that of most insurers: nationwide, H.M.O. rates grew by an average of 11.7 percent per year from 1986 to 1992, and rates for traditional fee-for-service plans rose annually by 14.2 percent, according to A. Foster Higgins & Company, a consulting firm.
But it remains well above the national goal of steady real spending set by President Clinton. Recent increases have mainly reflected the rising cost of nurses, technicians and other personnel, the soaring price of new drugs and other factors, officials said.
Geisinger doctors and administrators, most of them practicing physicians, insist that through steady refinement they can save much more without compromising care. Just how much and how fast, though, no one is sure.
"If this model can't hold down prices enough, then I'm not sure it can be done in a way that fulfills the medical expectations of society," said Dr. Stuart Heydt, president of the Geisinger Foundation.
While America's medical costs are increased by administrative waste, excess equipment, incentives to use procedures lavishly and outright fraud, in the end spending mainly reflects the routine decisions of physicians. They decide when a patient needs a $70 electrocardiogram, when to order a $100-dollar antibiotic instead of a $10 one, and when $40,000 bypass surgery is truly likely to improve a patient's chances of survival or quality of life.
"The best way to control costs and preserve quality is to have the physicians do it," said Dr. Arnold S. Relman, the former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine. "The whole health-care system is built on the behavior of doctors, and that behavior is greatly influenced by the way health care is organized."
Dr. Relman, who has been studying health plans around the country, praised Geisinger for high doctor morale and a system of mutual review that promotes excellent care.
While no organizational structure guarantees quality care, Geisinger has several traits that promote it. The bedrock, officials here say, is the careful selection of doctors who share the group philosophy and are happy to work for a salary. Since they are not paid piecework, they make decisions with no direct financial interest at stake. (Nationally, doctors are salaried in some but not all H.M.O.'s or other forms of managed care.)
The salaries here are enough to support an affluent life in this rural region, but for many doctors they are well below potential earnings in private practice. Primary-care doctors have starting salaries in the range of $75,000 to $90,000, while among the most experienced specialists who might earn several times as much elsewhere, "very few go beyond $300,000," said Dr. Laurence H. Beck, senior vice president charged with improving efficiency and quality.
 
Less Reliance On the Specialists
 Morale rests on the pleasures of patient care, collaboration, teaching and research, said Dr. Francis J. Menapace, the director of cardiology. "We look for a different type of physician, one who still looks at medicine as a profession, not a business."
As in most H.M.O.'s, all patients must choose a primary-care physician. Usually trained in family practice, internal medicine or pediatrics, these doctors provide most care and refer sicker patients to specialists only when necessary.
Now about 30 percent of the plan's doctors provide primary care, but studies suggest the proportion should rise to close to 50 percent, Dr. Beck said. This means cutting back on specialties, a painful and controversial topic among the medical staff.
Dr. Ernest W. Campbell, a primary-care physician and head of the Geisinger clinic in the nearby town of Bloomsburg, had been in independent practice for 18 years before he and his partner decided to join the salaried group in 1985.
"We looked at the H.M.O. and liked what they were saying," he said. "It's more geared toward preventive medicine, keeping people healthy rather than just meeting the acute needs as they arise." He said the switch involved a significant loss in income, but offsetting this was a drop in work time to 60 to 70 hours a week. Since patients are in a prepaid plan, he said, "now we can tell them they have no excuse for not coming in when they are ill."
A large unified system like Geisinger's can also avoid duplication of costly equipment and readily monitor its use. For example, all cardiac catheterizations, which are Dr. Blankenship's diagnostic specialty, are performed at the main hospital in Danville, as is open-heart surgery. This does mean, though, that some patients have to travel up to 100 miles for major procedures.
With central control, too, can come imbalances in staffing, sometimes causing long waits. Currently, for example, because of a shortage of gynecologists in the group, an appointment for a routine pelvic checkup can take several months. Officials insist that that is a temporary side effect.
But in surveys of H.M.O. patients that generally find high satisfaction with care and doctors, intermittent difficulty in getting quick appointments has been the most common complaint, said Dr. Duane Davis, medical director of the health plan.
 
When Supervision Is From Within
 For all its emphasis on efficiency, Geisinger does little of the routine oversight that is now so prevalent in the health-insurance industry and so annoying to doctors. Instead, the doctors are expected to watch themselves.
"We have a high awareness of what our colleagues are doing in the next room," Dr. Blankenship said. "There's lots of intercommunication, lots of informal second opinions."
Peer review is, however, increasingly backed up with research and suggestions from above. The H.M.O., for example, keeps track of prescribing patterns and sends out newsletters urging physicians to prescribe cheaper drugs or generic versions where they have been shown to be equally effective.
In another example, officials studied whether patients who were put on an expensive cholesterol-lowering drug were first asked to experiment with dietary change. By sharing the results with other physicians and stressing the recommended course, doctors found that the proportion of patients trying diet changes had risen. Some will end up needing the drug anyway, but some will avoid indefinite use of a drug that can have dangerous side effects.
Dr. Campbell, the primary-care doctor, said he welcomed these "timely reminders," and stressed that he remained free, without any pressure, to prescribe a costly alternative when he felt it was indicated.
When a doctor's prescribing and referral patterns diverge significantly from the norm, a senior doctor might ask why. In one case, a doctor who has since left for private practice was found to be ordering twice as many tests and costly drugs as his colleagues. Asked to explain, he said, "I'm a Cadillac; can you afford a Cadillac?" recalled Dr. Robert M. Haddad, who oversees seven primary-care clinics.
"But I would say he overused tests," Dr. Haddad said. "A 30-year-old man doesn't need an E.K.G. every year."
The continuous search for "better" ways of doing things is not simply a code word for "less," Dr. Beck said. "What our physicians insist on is to look at the outcomes and make them as consistent and good as possible," he said. "If we do things the right way, and reduce variation, we will end up with savings."
The question is how far even the best-organized providers can trim without choking off tests and treatments of significant benefit.
Dr. Beck said he believes that Geisinger and other similar groups still have large opportunities to wring out expense. Increasingly important, he said, will be reliance on clinical guidelines that reflect research, done locally or nationally, on what sequences of tests and treatments work best.
Still, Dr. Beck said, "At some point there will be tradeoffs between cost and quality." If price controls are too severe, he said, society will have to openly face the issue of rationing. "Those are decisions the individual physician can't make in his office."

Blankenship, left, conferred with a heart patient, Mary C. Reinhart of Orangeville, Pa. "I want to do everything that's necessary, but not too much," he said. Dr. Ernest W. Campbell examined a 3-week-old infant in his clinic in Bloomsburg, Pa. He left his private practice in 1985. "We looked at the H.M.O. and liked what they were saying," he said.

Bonds Gain Despite Inflation Data

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury bonds and notes moved higher yesterday as traders and analysts dismissed bad news in the consumer inflation report for February as an aberration.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, helped with his interpretation of the three-tenths of 1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index. In response to a question at a Congressional hearing, Mr. Greenspan said, "While we must clearly remain vigilant, my inclination is to view the latest data as aberrations." 
 Some traders seemed to focus on the fact that a large part of the increase was caused by a 1.5 percent jump in clothing costs, which are notoriously volatile. They seemed little concerned that consumer inflation excluding energy and food prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent, following an identical jump in so-called core inflation in January.
 
 
'More Inflation'
 "Clearly, people are looking at the C.P.I. and saying there are one-time factors that will be reversed," Alan Levenson, money market economist at UBS Securities, said. But he said he was still hard-pressed to explain why Treasury prices rose because for him, the data said "the inflation trough is past. Anyway you slice or dice these numbers, we have more inflation in 1993 than we had in 1992."
The problem for traders and investors is not that inflation, which eats away at the fixed returns from Treasury securities, is about to soar. Even with the February report, analysts see inflation rising only a little more than the 3 percent of last year. The issue is that many forecasters are expecting inflation to decline this year, which has become one of the supporting factors in the bond market rally.
The price of the 30-year bond, which had dropped sharply with the prices of Treasury notes just after the inflation report was released, seesawed through the day to end up 3/32 point, as the yield slipped to 6.86 percent, down from 6.87 percent Tuesday.
The price of the five-year note was up 10/32 , as the yield fell to 5.18 percent, from 5.26 percent the day before. The five-year yield is now below where it was before the producer inflation report sparked a sell-off Friday.
The demand for the five-year note is so strong that the Federal Reserve is examining whether there is a squeeze at work. Traders said they thought the squeeze was natural, not illegal, and was caused in part by selling to hedge against corporate bond holdings.
Despite the demand, the Treasury will auction just $11 billion of new five-year notes next Thursday, the same amount as last month. On Wednesday the Treasury will auction $15.25 billion of two-year notes.
 
 
Municipals
 Traders and analysts said yesterday that the certificate of participation market will be helped by Tuesday's narrow election victory in Brevard County, Fla. Voters approved a referendum that would keep the county government in its office complex and prevent the default on the certificates of participation that were sold to pay for the complex.
But some also warned that the vote did not end the threat of some local governments deciding to walk away from these special bonds, which have to have their interest and principal appropriated every year.
"It stops a bad situation from getting worse," said Robert J. Froelich, director of municipal research and investment strategy at Van Kampen Merritt Investment Advisory Group in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill. "But the problem has not gone away."
Traders said that there was no immediate reaction in the market because there was little trading in certificates of participation yesterday.
The Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation, which insured the bonds and would have had to make the interest and principal payments if the county had defaulted, applauded the victory.
M.B.I.A. contributed $373,975 to three groups opposing the default. With 46,290 people voting in favor of not defaulting, that works out to $8.08 a vote. But for the county at large, where there are about 400,000 residents, it is just under $1 dollar a person. The vote to default was 43,017.
 
 
New York City
 Mayor David N. Dinkins and City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman yesterday named the new team for managing the city's bond sales for the next regular rotation, which lasts about 18 months.
Included among the list of 22 co-managers are seven firms run by women or minority groups, which is the first time such firms have been chosen by the city. These firms are Artemis Capital Group; Carmona, Motley & Company; Grigsby Brandford & Company; W. R. Lazard; Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Company; Samuel A. Ramirez & Company, and Muriel Siebert & Company
The seven senior managers are Bear, Stearns & Company; the First Boston Corporation; Goldman, Sachs & Company; Lehman Brothers; Merrill Lynch; J. P. Morgan, and Prudential Securities.

HEADLINE: Democrats, Sensing Victory, Hunt Votes for Clinton Economic Plan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Democratic leaders scoured the Capitol for votes today in hopes of delivering a big victory to President Clinton as the House debated the Administration's economic plan.
"Rank-and-file Democrats want to give this President a victory," said Representative John Lewis of Georgia, who like other members of his party's leadership predicted passage of Mr. Clinton's economic-revival agenda. 
 With outnumbered Republicans arrayed solidly against them, top Democrats coaxed and cajoled fellow Democrats in an effort to solidify majorities for the President's proposals.
His plan was embodied in two measures the House considered: the outlines of a $510 billion deficit reduction and a $16.3 billion jobs bill.
 
Debate in the Senate
 The Senate debated its own $502 billion deficit-cutting blueprint. As in the House, Democrats arguing that the President's plan should be enacted were pitted against Republicans saying that its spending cuts and tax increases would not spark a recovery.
"That's not going to happen with a deficit-reduction plan that is essentially cutting defense and taxing the American people," said Senator Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico.
The House seemed certain to approve the budget-cutting package on Thursday, while Senate approval was likely next week. But the fate of the jobs bill, on which the House also planned a vote on Thursday, seemed less certain.
Conservative Democrats were hoping to trim the jobs measure, arguing that it would add too much to budget deficits that are setting records every year. So they were particular targets of party lieutenants hunting for support.
"Their sales pitch is: 'It's part of the President's overall plan' and 'We can't let the whole thing fail,' " said Representative Timothy J. Penny of Minnesota, one of the conservatives hoping to reduce the spending for jobs.
Mr. Lewis, his party's chief deputy whip, said he believed that enough conservatives would fall into line to insure passage.
But at least some conservatives showed no signs of quitting.
"Since when is a good fight among Democrats damaging to the legislative process?" Representative Charles W. Stenholm of Texas asked reporters.

GRAPHIC: Photo: As Democrats sought to garner the votes for President Clinton's economic plan, Republican members of the House Budget Committe called for the panel's demise. The committee "is no more than a doormat," said Representative Bob Franks of New Jersey, center, and should be "radically overhauled or totally abolished," because it has allowed the national debt to skyrocket. With him at news conference yesterday were Representatives Dan Miller of Florida, left, and Nick Smith of Michigan. (Jose R. Lopez/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: New Group Considering Bid for Post

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
A group of investors with access to hundreds of millions of dollars could provide the first serious alternative to Abraham Hirschfeld or Steven Hoffenberg as the buyer of The New York Post.
The group, which includes an investment banker and a former New York City Deputy Mayor, Kenneth Lipper, and the real-estate multimillionaires Larry and Zachary Fisher and other major investors, was assembled by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Lipper said yesterday. 
 The Fisher brothers have been major builders and property owners in New York for decades. In 1988, Forbes magazine estimated their fortune at $800 million. But Larry Fisher told the magazine that his family was worth more than $1 billion.
 
Examining the Books
 "The Fishers and I have been approached by the Governor and this is a totally exploratory effort," Mr. Lipper said. Mr. Lipper, people involved in the situation said, went to The Post late yesterday to examine its books, with Mr. Hirschfeld's permission.
At a news conference yesterday, Governor Cuomo said the group consisted of "formidable and successful business people." He did not name any participants and some people involved said there might be more than one new group interested in buying The Post.
Others involved in the talks said the group that includes the Fishers and Mr. Lipper was considering an investment of $20 million to $30 million and a long-term commitment to make The Post profitable. They said Mr. Lipper, 51, would probably be the publisher if the group were to acquire the newspaper.
 
Unstable Situation
 Eric Breindel, The Post's former editorial page editor, who has been involved in financial negotiations with potential buyers, said Mr. Lipper's expression of interest marked a sharp change in what he described as an unstable situation since Mr. Hoffenberg first appeared in January.
Mr. Lipper's interest, Mr. Breindel said, demonstrates "that you have a valuable franchise at The New York Post even from the standpoint of a serious financier who has actually looked at the numbers."
The Post's bankruptcy filing this week, people who have talked with the Fishers and Mr. Lipper said, has made the paper more attractive as an investment. In bankruptcy, the court has broad powers that could permit it to reduce some of the massive liabilities that have helped discourage potential buyers. The court could also permit The Post to renounce its union contracts, forcing employees to renegotiate with new owners.
New bidders could come to court tomorrow during a bankruptcy-court hearing. But it was not clear yesterday whether the Lipper-Fisher group would make a bid then or wait until the newspaper's situation is even more desperate.
Although Mr. Hirschfeld has a contract to purchase the newspaper, he could change his mind. At least until Mr. Hirschfeld formally becomes the owner, and possibly even after that, a bankruptcy judge could decide that a better-financed buyer would be likelier to help the newspaper survive.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Lipper stressed that the group had been assembled only this week and its four or five members had not all talked yet. He also said the investors would insist on cooperation from employees, union leaders and others at The Post. He did not use the word "concessions," but he indicated the group would try to drive a hard bargain.
"This effort will only be successful," Mr. Lipper said, "if it's a totally team endeavor, where all levels of management and workers participate with the owners in developing a long-term-stability plan for The Post. There is no value in a short-term fix."
The Fishers did not return telephone calls yesterday. But Mr. Lipper said he had their permission to confirm their interest in exploring a purchase of The Post.
People involved in the negotiations that are being led by Vincent Tese, Governor Cuomo's chief economic development adviser, said a central condition of the Fisher-Lipper group was that all of its investment be applied to building The Post.
Until now, Peter S. Kalikow, the current owner, Mr. Hirschfeld and Mr. Hoffenberg have all been focusing on who would shoulder current debts of the newspaper, like a $4.1 million past-due tax bill, and possible shutdown costs, such as severance pay, estimated at $20 million or more.
People involved in the talks said the Lipper-Fisher group appeared convinced that, in bankruptcy court, many of the newspaper's debts and future liabilities may be negotiable and that there are new opportunities to reduce operating costs.
If the Lipper-Fisher group does buy The Post, it would be a successful conclusion of the unusual involvement of Governor Cuomo in the travails of the newspaper. In what he said was an effort to save jobs, and a journalistic voice that he said he did not particularly like, Governor Cuomo began searching for buyers when Mr. Kalikow said he would have to close the Post in January.
Governor Cuomo was said to be partly responsible for bringing Mr. Hoffenberg to the Post, and the situation quickly became politically embarrassing as Mr. Hoffenberg was charged with investor fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The political thicket grew denser with the arrival of Mr. Hirschfeld, who has sometimes been a mischievous foe of the Governor.
The Lipper-Fisher deal could free the newspaper of both Mr. Hoffenberg and Mr. Hirschfeld and leave the Governor, once again, in the position of being able to claim credit for helping to save The Post.
Mr. Lipper has had a relatively low profile in business, making tens of millions of dollars as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers, Salomon Brothers and, since 1986, as chairman of Lipper & Company.
 
Taste for Public Life
 But he has shown a taste in the past for a more public life. He was a deputy mayor under Edward I. Koch, ran unsuccessfully for City Council president in 1985 and wrote the novel "Wall Street," which was the basis for the Oliver Stone film of the same title. Mr. Lipper was an adviser to Mr. Stone on the film.
Last night, Pete Hamill, The Post's acting editor in chief, said on PBS's "Charlie Rose" show that Leon H. Charney, a lawyer who owns several commercial buildings in Manhattan, and Ronald S. Lauder, the former Republican candidate for Mayor of New York also remained interested in buying the paper.
Peter Faris, The Post's senior vice president and top administrator, was asked in an interview yesterday whether a bid from a new group could stabilize The Post. He said he believed a critical date is this Friday, when the bankruptcy court may give Mr. Hirschfeld permission to move ahead with his purchase.
The mood at The Post is so hostile to Mr. Hirschfeld, Mr. Faris said, that new bidders who fail to move quickly might not have a paper to buy. "It might be dead later," Mr. Faris said.

HEADLINE: South African to Lobby for U.S. Impartiality

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRETORIA, South Africa, March 15

 BODY:
South Africa's Foreign Minister has cautioned the Clinton Administration against a sentimental tilt toward the African National Congress, saying that playing favorites in South Africa could increase tension in the country.
The Foreign Minister, Roelof F. Botha, also endorsed "the framework" of a new Washington peace plan for Angola, but appeared to differ with some elements of the proposal. 
 Mr. Botha, who has led the Foreign Ministry since 1977, spoke in an interview before leaving for Washington, where he will size up the Clinton Administration's leanings in Africa and try to persuade the new President not to discount his governing National Party just because of its apartheid past.
President F. W. de Klerk's Government is uneasy that Mr. Clinton's election means a greater sympathy in Washington for the African National Congress. Nelson Mandela, president of the congress, was the first foreign political figure invited to meet with Secretary of State Warren Christopher after the inauguration in January.
"I can understand there is a sentiment," Mr. Botha said in a conversation at the Foreign Ministry guest house outside Pretoria. "It will be a pity if that continues much longer."
Mr. Botha once would have bristled at the suggestion America could play a role in South Africa's domestic affairs. Now, with the white Government on the brink of surrendering power to a nonracial democracy, he argues that the United States should use the leverage of foreign aid to insist that democratic principles, free-market economics and minority rights are securely enshrined in a new constitution.
"It was one thing to fight apartheid," he said. "But what must be emphasized now is whether those who opposed apartheid support democratic values."
Mr. Botha said he would ask, for example, "where does the United States Government really stand" on the A.N.C.'s alliance with the South African Communist Party.
South Africa was for many years Washington's partner in sponsoring the Angolan rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, in his war against the Marxist Government in Luanda, which in turn drew support from Cuba and Moscow.
Washington has cut off support for Mr. Savimbi, and has said he is principally to blame for plunging the country back into a civil war that has reportedly killed tens of thousands of Angolans.
The war resumed after Mr. Savimbi refused to accept his party's defeat in parliamentary elections last September, asserting that the votes were rigged. In a presidential election held at the same time, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos outpolled Mr. Savimbi, but fell short of a majority.
South Africa has also ended official support for Mr. Savimbi and has criticized the rebel leader for refusing to comply with the election results, which were deemed generally fair by United Nations observers.
But Mr. Botha said he opposed those -- including the United States Ambassador in Angola -- who have urged Washington to bolster the Angolan Government by giving it formal diplomatic recognition.
Mr. Botha argued that recognizing the Angolan Government would amount to proclaiming Mr. Dos Santos the winner before a presidential runoff has been held. "It will not make a negotiated settlement easier," he said.
Mr. Botha's main mission in Washington will be to explain that his National Party is not to be counted out in South Africa, especially since the African National Congress has agreed that all parties with a substantial showing in the elections should share in a coalition government.
Indeed, Mr. Botha, who is also the party leader for the Transvaal, South Africa's most populous region, said if anyone in Washington asks he will be happy to explain his theory of how the National Party might emerge victorious from the elections, in coalition with allies like the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party -- a view even many in the Government find far-fetched.
"I do not think a single party will get an outright majority," he said. "But the National Party, together with other parties who share our basic principles, certainly stand a good chance."

HEADLINE: College Chief Is Reported Picked to Run U.S.I.A.

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
President Clinton has selected Joseph D. Duffey, president of American University and an old friend, to head the United States Information Agency, Administration officials say.
No date has been set for the appointment. But it is expected that when Mr. Duffey, long active in the Democratic Party, is named, the appointment will be coupled with an announcement that his deputy will be Penn Kemble, a conservative Democrat, the officials said. 
 Mr. Duffey, 60, and Mr. Kemble, 52, said that they had discussed appointments with the Administration, but that they could not provide details.
The selections, on the one hand of Mr. Duffey, who was in top educational and cultural posts in the Carter Administration, and on the other hand of Mr. Kemble, who is counted in the conservative camp, appear to create an ideological balance at a critical moment. The information agency, with 8,900 workers and a $1 billion annual appropriation, is being buffeted by crosswinds over its mission and budget.
Advocates of the agency, including the bipartisan United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, endorse a proposal by Mr. Clinton to consolidate all Government-sponsored international broadcasting operations under the U.S.I.A., which sponsors the Voice of America. That would mean phasing out Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.
Defenders of the stations in Munich, Republicans and conservative Democrats began campaigning recently to preserve them as preferable to the Voice of America.
The conservative Democrats have complained bitterly that none of their number had been named to a high post in the new Administration. Recently some carried their complaint to Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and his deputy, Samuel Berger, saying at least one favorite, Representative Dave McCurdy, Democrat of Oklahoma, or Richard Schifter, a former chief of human rights at the State Department, deserved a choice post. They got nowhere, said Ben Wattenberg, the conservative columnist.
Proposals have also been made to take the Voice of America from the U.S.I.A. and turn over its foreign educational-exchange programs to a foundation while placing its remaining functions in the State Department. But officials at the agency took heart from Mr. Clinton's strong support for instruments of "public diplomacy."
Mr. Duffey became acquainted with Mr. Clinton when he was running for the Senate in Connecticut in 1970 against Lowell P. Weicker Jr., then a member of Congress. Mr. Duffey had been a Congregational minister, chairman of the Americans for Democratic Action and a participant in Eugene J. McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968. Mr. Clinton, having just completed studying under a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford, was attracted to Mr. Duffey through opposition to the Vietnam War and went to work in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.
The two stayed in touch through Mr. Clinton's career in Arkansas politics and Mr. Duffey's Carter years as Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs and chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Before being called to head American University, Mr. Duffey was chancellor of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
On Monday the Clintons and the Duffeys had supper together with the actors Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward in a restaurant here. Mr. Duffey's wife, Anne Wexler, was Deputy Under Secretary for Commerce in the Carter Administration and is a prominent lobbyist.
In the weeks after Mr. Clinton's inauguration, there was a wide-ranging competition for the top U.S.I.A. job involving public figures and former Government officials who were put forward by others or put themselves forward. They included Mary Bitterman, a former director of the Voice; Rozanne L. Ridgway, a former ambasssador; David Gergen of the Reagan White House, Martin Peretz of The New Republic, Bill D. Moyers of the Johnson White House, Pierre Salinger of the Kennedy White House and Mr. Wattenberg.

HEADLINE: Lilco's Emissions Sale Spurs Acid Rain Concerns

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Long Island Lighting Company wants to sell the right to emit pollution to a fuel supplier that would resell the pollution rights to any of a dozen utilities scattered around the Midwest, South and West, according to documents made public yesterday and people involved in the deal.
Disclosure of the name of the buyer, Amax Energy Inc., opens a new chapter in a mystery that has concerned environmentalists for weeks. Many people upstate worry that if the ultimate buyer is a company upwind of New York, a result could be an increase in the acid rain that blows into sensitive areas, especially the Adirondacks. 
 Several trades of emission allowances, essentially purchases of a right to pollute, have been announced in the last few months, but this is apparently the first in which the buyer plans to resell them.
Such a complex trade is just the kind of transaction that economists envisioned when they helped convince Congress that an open market in emissions would find the cheapest ways to reduce pollution.
But environmentalists say this situation also illustrates their fear that a ton of pollution can cause more damage in one location than another.
A spokesman for Amax Energy, Kevin A. Feeney, said the company planned to sell the allowances in a package with its coal or natural gas, essentially offering them as incentives to encourage the sale of energy products that create comparatively high levels of pollution, particularly coal, which has a high sulfur content.
"It gives us another marketing tool to use in marketing our products," he said. In practice, with the Clean Air Act of 1990 making it harder to burn high-sulfur coal, offering the fuel with the allowances will simplify compliance for utilities.
All Lilco has sold is an option to buy the allowances, not the allowances themselves. The New York State Public Service Commission could still step in and stop the deal.
Sale of the allowances is permitted under the Clean Air Act, but environmentalists are concerned that such deals could allow utilities in the Midwest to burn dirtier coal, resulting in more acid rain blowing back into New York.
The news yesterday would greatly increase the difficulty of predicting the effects of the sale.
"This is exactly the worst-case scenario from the point of view of protecting New York State," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County who is the chairman of the committee on environmental conservation.
Lilco previously said it had concluded a deal to sell options on the emission allowances, but had sought to keep the details secret. The Public Service Commission, in a ruling that took effect yesterday, said that Lilco did not have to disclose how many allowances the option covered, or at what price, but that the buyer's name must be made public. The buyer, Amax Energy of Greenwich, Conn., is a subsidiary of Amax Corporation, a conglomerate based in Manhattan. Amax Energy's Indianapolis-based coal company says it is the nation's third-largest producer of coal; another subsidiary, in Houston, produces oil and natural gas.
Amax produced 41 million tons of coal last year, much of it high-sulfur coal from Tennessee, Indiana and Illinois. It also produces low-sulfur coal from West Virginia and Wyoming. Mr. Feeney said the company's coal customers include Ohio Edison, Kansas City Power & Light, the Public Service Company of Indiana, the Central Indiana Public Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Public Service Company of Colorado.
 
Way of Meeting Standards
 The Midwestern utilities are the ones likeliest to need allowances to meet the Clean Air Act limits on sulfur dioxide, which take effect in 1995. Some will build "scrubbers" -- devices that filter sulfur dioxide and other pollutants out of smokestacks -- on their plants, others will switch to lower-sulfur fuel and still others are expected to buy allowances.
The allowance trading system was approved by Congress at the urging of economists and some environmentalists, who said it would improve efficiency in pollution reduction. The intent is to encourage that reductions be made in the cheapest way possible while not affecting the amount of emission reduction nationwide.
The act gave Lilco a windfall because a New York State law forced it to reduce emissions in the 1980's to levels below what the Federal law will require. As a result, Lilco has 40,000 to 50,000 allowances a year to sell, each representing one ton of sulfur dioxide, beginning in 1995. Publicly announced trades have pegged the price of an allowance at $250 to $400.
 
Potential for Damage Seen

Lilco said it would use the income to lower its rates, which are now the highest in the mainland United States.
But environmentalists said a result would be to hurt the vulnerable Adirondacks. "There is the potential for extreme damage from a sale like this," said John Sheehan, a spokesman for the Adirondack Council. "Part of our problem with this process is there is an inherent lack of accountability as far as what will result from the trading of allowances," he said.
The solution, he said, was for the Environmental Protection Agency to set limits on the amount of acid rain that could be deposited, and review each trade to see whether it would push any area over the limit.
Assemblyman Brodsky is the author of a bill that would permit the Public Service Commission to block such trades if it found them harmful to New York State. The Public Service Commission has jurisdiction already but the standards it can use are "hazy," he said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plan's 2 Aces: Fed and the Bond Market

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
As the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on President Clinton's deficit-cutting plan and stimulus package, Republicans are still trying to shoot down the stimulus program, contending that it would be a waste of money and may give the economy too much of a push.
But many economists say the biggest problem about the President's package is not that it will speed up growth dangerously, creating fears of inflation, but that it will slow growth too much. 
 That is because the plan to cut the deficit by $473 billion over five years will have a much bigger effect on the $6 trillion economy than the $16 billion in stimulus. The plan's tax increases and spending cuts, economists agree, are likely to be a drag on growth and job creation from 1994 to 1997.
This could create some tricky political problems for Mr. Clinton should he run for re-election, because, by some estimates, the negative effects of his deficit-cutting plan could hold down employment growth by more than one million jobs in 1996.
But two outside forces might save the President: the bond market and the Federal Reserve.
 
Bond Market Delighted
 The bond market, so far delighted by the President's plan, has cooperated more than the Administration dreamed, pushing down long-term interest rates to their lowest level since the 1970's. In the view of many economists, the stimulus created by the steep drop in rates more than outweighs the slowing effects of the tax increases and spending cuts.
The President's stimulus package will increase growth slightly this year, economists say, but when the deficit reduction measures pick up steam in 1995 and 1996, their slowing effects, known as fiscal drag, will start to take a big bite out of growth. At that point, Mr. Clinton might need more than help from the bond market to keep the economy chugging.
That, many economists predict, means the President will press Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to keep short-term interest rates low.
"I believe the Federal Reserve's role is pivotal," said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Company. "If this program is passed, then the Federal Reserve should be prepared to lower rates to make sure we get the maximum benefit out of the program."
Many forecasters have concluded that the package, by bringing about lower interest rates and more investment, will not produce faster-than-anticipated growth until late this decade, that is, growth faster than the baseline projections of the Congressional Budget Office.
"The emphasis on investment is good for the long run, but the long run doesn't arrive in four years," said Roger E. Brinner, research director at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass.
 
Little Help for Short Run
 Laurence H. Meyer, who runs his own economics consulting firm in St. Louis, added, "If you do a better job educating kindergarten students, that's not going to generate higher growth by 1996."
The deficit-cutting plan is expected to hurt growth because tax increases, like the proposed broad-based energy tax, generally hurt investment and consumer spending, while cuts in Federal spending, like closing military bases, mean layoffs and less consumption.
Conservatives argue that Mr. Clinton's plan will hurt growth especially because tax increases represent the lion's share of the deficit-cutting measures.
"I don't see how the President can create jobs by raising taxes," said John H. Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. "I think the plan could mean trouble for him in 1996."
Fears that the plan could undermine growth help explain why Mr. Clinton warned Congress last week not to go overboard in cutting the deficit beyond what he has proposed. Several economists said that neither the $510 billion deficit reduction plan approved by the House Budget Committee nor the $502 billion plan approved by the Senate Budget Committee would do much additional damage to growth.
 
Risky for Clinton
 In many ways the Clinton plan is a risky experiment in which the payoff of faster growth and higher living standards might not be seen until after the 1996 elections.
Mr. Clinton's economic advisers say the plan will raise the nation's long-term underlying growth rate to 2.5 percent in 1997, up from its current level of about 2 percent. Long-run growth will climb, his advisers say, thanks to lower interest rates, increased investment and improved job training.
But many economists assert that the plan will not increase long-term growth that soon or that much, although most believe the plan is worthwhile, despite the damage it does to growth in the mid-1990's.
"If you gave me the choice of two economies to inherit on Jan. 1, 1998, one with a large deficit or one with deficit reduction, I'd take the one with deficit reduction, which means we will have lower interest rates," said Robert F. Wescott, an economist with the WEFA Group, a consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "That should lead to higher levels of investment and help make the standard of living much better over the next 10 years."
According to DRI/McGraw-Hill, the plan's tax increases and spending cuts would, without the help of lower interest rates, cause employment to grow by 1.1 million fewer jobs in 1996 than it would have without the plan, while the economy would expand by a meager 1.7 percent, well below the Congressional Budget Office baseline of 2.7 percent.
But DRI predicts that if the bond market and Federal Reserve keep rates low, then 1996 will see much brighter results: employment growth of 260,000 above the baseline and economic growth of a healthy 3.2 percent.
 
Forecasts Can Be Way Off
 Such forecasts are often off by a wide margin because economists' hyper-complex computer models try to factor in many unpredictable ingredients, such as how consumers and the dollar will behave and how much Congress and the President will actually hold down spending.
Mr. Sinai of the Boston Company made a forecast in line with DRI's, saying that with the Clinton plan, the economy would grow by 2.2 percent in 1996 and employment would rise by 254,000 fewer jobs than baseline projections if the Federal Reserve does not hold down rates. But Mr. Sinai said that if the Fed cooperated, growth would be 2.5 percent in 1996 and employment would grow by 309,000 jobs more than the baseline.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has said many forecasts may understate the plan's positive effects because they do not sufficiently take into account the sharp drop in long-term interest rates. Using a rule of thumb that he said had come from Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Bentsen said every drop in interest rates of 10 basis points or one-tenth of 1 percent meant $10 billion in economic stimulus. Because long-term rates have plunged 100 basis points since November, that means $100 billion in stimulus.
Mr. Wescott of WEFA said that in 1994 the stimulus from lower rates would outweigh the drag from the modest deficit reduction, but he predicted that low interest rates would not offset the drag created by the larger deficit cuts scheduled for 1995 through 1997.
"The program is definitely a minus for growth in 1995 and 1996," he said. "The spending cuts and tax increases really start to ramp up as you go further out in the plan."

HEADLINE: Assembly Plan on Transit Would Put Issue to Voters

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 17

 BODY:
With the state's budget deadline two weeks away, Assembly Democrats have proposed a new transportation financing plan that would require voter approval to borrow money for road, bridge and mass transit construction.
Assembly aides said the plan, which would raise the money through the sale of general-obligation bonds, had only recently been floated in closed-door negotiations with aides to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and with the Republicans who control the State Senate. 
 "It is an idea that the Speaker is considering and discussing with the other leaders," said Steven A. Greenberg, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat. "He believes it's a way to deal with the transportation issue and with debt reform, because going to the voters for permission to issue debt is the ultimate debt reform."
In the last three months, both Mr. Cuomo and the Senate Republicans have released their own transportation financing plans, which outline ways to preserve the $1.25 fare on New York City subways and buses, pay for improvements needed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and subsidize road and bridge construction around the state.
Mr. Cuomo's plan would spend $21.4 billion in state, Federal and local money over five years. The Senate plan, which was issued last week by Senator Norman J. Levy, the chairman of the Transportation Committee, would spend $24.2 billion.
 
Seeking Voter Approval
 Both plans would rely heavily on the sale of revenue bonds, which would be backed by revenue sources like an existing tax on petroleum and tolls on Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority crossings.
The Assembly plan would differ because general-obligation bonds, unlike revenue bonds, must be approved by the voters. Assembly aides said today that the transportation plan would be presented in a package with a debt-reform proposal, including a Constitutional amendment that would prohibit the use of quasi-governmental agencies to sell bonds that raise money for the state's general fund.
But the notion of letting the voters decide also introduces an element of risk not present in Mr. Cuomo's or Mr. Levy's plan. Voters in New York have rejected the last two general-obligation bond acts, an economic development bond act in 1992 and an environmental bond act in 1990.
While the Assembly has not decided how much money the transportation bond act would have to raise, state leaders agree that the amount would be large. And if voters rejected the bond issue, it would be politically difficult for the Legislature and Governor to then turn to revenue bonds as a financing mechanism. The state would be left to pay for transportation improvements solely with money produced by tax revenues, a relatively small sum compared with the state's needs.

HEADLINE: Core Inflation Climbs 0.5% For 2d Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Consumer prices climbed a moderate three-tenths of 1 percent in February, the Labor Department said today, but "core" inflation rose an unnerving five-tenths of a percent for the second straight month.
Many analysts considered the results, combined with last Friday's report of the biggest jump for producer prices in two years, fairly solid evidence that inflation was no longer on the wane. 
 "I think we've troughed out," said Alan C. Lerner of the Bankers Trust Company, referring to an inflation rate that retreated from 6.1 percent in 1990 to 3.1 percent in 1991 and to 2.9 percent last year.
 
Sharp Inflation Rise Doubted
 Few analysts, however, believe a sharp pickup in inflation is likely soon.
A second report today showed that industrial production rose in February for the fifth straight month and that gains for November, December and January were a bit higher than previously estimated. The report, from the Federal Reserve, showed that industry ran at 79.9 percent of capacity, two-tenths of a point higher than in January and the highest rate since September 1991.
The news of higher-than-expected core inflation initially sent bond prices down, but the market recovered, apparently when traders and investors realized that apparel accounted for much of the increase. Clothing prices, which account for 6 percent of the Consumer Price Index, are notoriously volatile, but are included in the underlying, or core, inflation rate. Food and energy prices are excluded.
In another reassuring sign, all major categories except for apparel posted smaller price increases in February than they had in January.
"We do not feel that the two-month, five-tenths of 1 percent increases in core consumer prices is the beginning of a new upward-drift pattern," said Donald E. Maude, an economist with Scotia McLeod Inc. in New York. "We expect a significant moderation in these prices over the months immediately ahead."
Other analysts agreed, noting that the price index has tended to post sizable increases in the first months of recent years. Allen Sinai, an economist for the Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc., said that the best news on inflation was probably past, but added that "a permanent and significant reacceleration of inflation is unlikely."
This view is based on generally weak economies abroad, an apparent slowdown of American economic growth and very slow increases here in unit labor costs, among other reasons.
In the longer run, however, economists see a potential for higher inflation if the Clinton Administration moves to raise the minimum wage, engages in protectionist trade policies and seeks to provide health insurance for 35 million people now without it.
 
Apparel's Impact
 Apparel prices, with a 1.5 percent jump, accounted for about one-quarter of the overall rise in the price index. Other significant influences on the index were a sharp downturn in the price of fresh fruits and vegetables, a 2.2 percent increase in airline fares and a decline in energy services that more than offset an increase in gasoline and other petroleum products.
Medical costs rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month, about the same 6.3 percent annual pace that has prevailed for the latest three-month and 12-month periods. Hospital and related services, however, surged 1 percent in February.
Prices for services rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month, while commodities rose four-tenths of 1 percent. Each gain was one-tenth of a point less than the January advance. Services account for 56 percent of the index, commodities for 44 percent.
 
Purchasing Power
 For urban consumers, the price index now stands at 143.1, which means a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in the 1982-84 base period now costs $14.31. Stated another way, the value of the 1982-84 dollar slipped last month to 69.9 cents from 70.1 cents in January.
The four-tenths of 1 percent rise in industrial output -- the production of the nation's factories, mines and utilities -- was largely as expected.

HEADLINE: As Japan Chip Talks Near, U.S. Turns Up the Pressure

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 17

 BODY:
The semiconductor trade agreement between the United States and Japan has reached a critical juncture, and once again Japan is being criticized for a failure to live up to the goal of opening 20 percent of its market to foreign-made computer chips.
But for Japan, the real concern might not be that the agreement has failed to increase foreign companies' share of the market, but that it has worked so well. 
 While it is true that American and other foreign manufacturers still do not have 20 percent of Japan's market for computer chips, these companies' combined share has doubled since the first semiconductor trade agreement was signed in the middle of 1986 -- from 8.6 percent to an estimated level of 17 percent or more for 1992. And this increase, American executives say, would never have happened without the agreement.
"The opinion of our industry, collectively, is absolutely unambiguous," Norman P. Neureiter, director of Texas Instruments Japan, said today. "The existence of this agreement has made a big difference."
The consensus is significant as American and Japanese officials from government and the chip industry prepare to meet in Hawaii next week. Given the pattern so far, the Americans are likely to try to keep the pressure on Japan without threatening the progress already made.
But some Japanese officials fear that this success might encourage American companies or the United States Government to ask for specific market-share goals in other industries in which Japan is said to be closed to foreigners.
The prospect of "managed trade" has the Japanese worried, especially since some in the Clinton Administration are thought to be more receptive to such an approach than was the Bush Administration.
Sozaburo Okamatsu, director general of the trade policy bureau at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said, "I think that this is a bad example of an arrangement between two free-market economies, so I don't want to accept or extend this type of arrangement to other sectors."
Mr. Okamatsu said that specifying a market-share percentage in the semiconductor agreement had led to numerous misunderstandings, because the United States regards the figure as a commitment while Japan considers it only an expectation. But asked if foreign companies' share of the chip market in this country would have risen as much without the specific goal, Mr. Okamatsu declined to answer a "hypothetical" question.
 
Pressure Is Building
 Already, there is some pressure to move toward managed trade. Japanese companies have agreed to a monetary target for all the American automobile parts they will buy in a few years. And the Ford Motor Company's chief executive, Harold A. Poling, among others, has called for a policy requiring Japan to reduce its trade surplus by a certain amount each year, leaving it up to the Japanese to figure out how to do it.
This country has always been reluctant to set specific goals. Its 1986 semiconductor agreement with the United States included acknowledgments by Japan of the United States' expectation that foreign chip makers could achieve 20 percent of the market by the agreement's expiration in mid-1991. However, that language was contained not in the main text of the treaty, but in an unpublished side letter.
In mid-1991, with the market-share goal unmet, the agreement was renewed, with the 20 percent goal being postponed until the end of 1992 and being put into the main text of the treaty.
Market-share figures for the last quarter of 1992 are expected to be announced shortly, but it is already clear that they will fall short of 20 percent. Using the formula favored by the United States, the share is likely to be about 17 percent; using the formula advocated by Japan, perhaps 19 percent.
American Government and industry officials are already complaining, blaming Japan for a failure to adhere to the accord. There have even been discussions about whether sanctions should be levied.
 
Americans in Japan Differ
 Given that view, it seemed surprising to hear what several Japan-based executives of American semiconductor companies said at a press luncheon here today. While there are still difficulties in selling chips in Japan, they said, by and large the trade agreement has worked well in opening the market.
Until the agreement, the executives said, many Japanese companies would not even consider buying foreign-made semiconductors. Keith M. Kolerus, president of National Semiconductor Japan, said that in the past his company's executives were not even allowed inside the gates of a Japanese automobile company to make a sales pitch.
And William O. Howe, president of Intel Japan, recalled that Japanese chip purchasers "would basically stare at us with a big smile."
"They had absolutely zero intention of buying a foreign semiconductor," Mr. Howe said. "None." But the trade agreement forced Japanese companies to at least let would-be foreign competitors seek business, he said.
Keiske Yawata, president of LSI Logic K.K., the Japanese subsidiary of the Silicon Valley chip maker LSI Logic, said that the company would usually have had to wait 10 to 15 years to establish itself as a trustworthy supplier in Japan and begin receiving large orders. But aided by the trade agreement, he said, business started to flow in about three years.
 
Progress Is Still Significant
 Until 1986, foreign executives have said, their market share in Japan never rose much above 10 percent and was only 8.6 percent when the chip agreement was signed in 1986. But by the third quarter of 1992, foreign companies, which are predominantly American, had 15.9 percent by the United States' formula.
With Japan's semiconductor market worth about $20 billion a year, a 17 percent market share instead of 8.6 percent translates into an extra $1.7 billion in sales each year for the foreign manufacturers.
And because the Japanese market has grown since 1986, foreign sales of semiconductors here in 1991 were actually triple the level in 1986 -- about $3 billion compared with $1 billion -- according to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
The trade agreement has also contributed to a vast increase in the number of foreign computer chips being designed as part of Japanese products and in the number of alliances between American and Japanese companies.
Some of these gains, of course, might have occurred without the trade agreement. Intel, for instance, has rapidly increased its share of the semiconductor market throughout the world because of its near-monopoly on microprocessors used in personal computers.
 
Getting Down to Specifics
 But American executives say that the market-share goal was a very important part of the agreement because it represented a specific standard against which to measure progress. In past agreements, they said, Japan emphasized vague measures like setting up new procedures, new committees or new meetings to help open its market.
"They would count the successes by the number of people who attended the meetings," not by the increase in foreign-product sales, said Roger C. Mathus, the representative here of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the American chip-industry lobbying group.
Setting a high target and then holding Japan's feet to the fire has resulted in higher sales for the foreign manufacturers, even if the 20 percent goal has not been met. In fact, in mid-1991, when the second semiconductor agreement was signed, many assumed that the goal would not be reached by the end of 1992. That would have required foreign companies' market share to rise as much in 18 months as it had in the previous five years.
The big question is what to do next.
"We don't want to add fuel to the fire, but if the fire is put out, we may collapse," said Mr. Yawata, the LSI Logic executive. "So I think it's good to have a fire."
Although sanctions to punish the Japanese might harm relations between the two countries, some Americans caution that postponing the 20 percent goal again could have the effect of taking the pressure off. "You can't keep resetting the clock forever," said Mr. Mathus of the American trade group.
That is why there are various compromise proposals afloat, like raising the market-share target in exchange for more giving the Japanese more time to meet it. James Norling, the chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association, has proposed perhaps a 20 percent average share for all of 1993, meaning that foreign companies would have to be above 20 percent by the end of the year.
 
A Theorem: Coercion Works
 Japan, however, is not expected to agree to any new numerical targets -- unless it is threatened with sanctions by the United States. The Japanese are likely to propose programs to increase access, such as offering to help American companies design chips for consumer-electronics products, which now use a lot of chips made in this country.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Gains Abroad, Then Stalls in U.S. Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mixed on world currency markets yesterday, rising overseas and then losing some ground in uneventful domestic dealings.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $329.30 an ounce, up 20 cents from Tuesday. But the Republic National Bank said gold slipped 5 cents, to a late price of $328.80. 
 The dollar advanced in European trading ahead of today's scheduled meeting of the policy-making council of Germany's central bank. Traders were divided over whether the German officials would lower interest rates, and activity seemed to stall when trading shifted to the United States.
"The general expectation of a rate cut is priced into the market at this point," said Hillel Waxman, chief dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company.
The Government released figures yesterday on inflation and industrial output that would generally be viewed favorably by currency traders, but Mr. Waxman said the data "didn't really have much of an impact on the market."
He noted that currency dealings have been "sluggish for a couple of days now."
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 116.95 yen, down 0.83 yen from Tuesday's close. It was quoted later in London at 117.40. In New York, the dollar settled at 117.20 yen, up from 117.00 Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.4515, from $1.4465 late Tuesday. In New York, a pound cost $1.4525, up from $1.4485 Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6615 German marks, down from 1.6635; 1.5325 Swiss francs, up from 1.5260; 5.6460 French francs, down from 5.6535; 1,605.00 Italian lire, down from 1.608.00, and 1.2509 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2508.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $329.35 an ounce, from $329 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold closed at $328.55, down from $328.80. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 11 cents to close at $329.15 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcies Hit a Record

BYLINE: by The Associated Press

 BODY:
For the eighth straight year, filings for bankruptcy protection in United States courts hit a record high in 1992, the American Bankruptcy Institute reported yesterday.
The rate of increase slowed, but the Washington-based research institute said anecdotal evidence showed no abatement in filings and no indication that underlying economic weakness was improving. 
 Record filings have been set every year since 1985. In 1992, 971,517 bankruptcy petitions were filed nationwide. Nonbusiness or personal bankruptcies accounted for 92 percent.
Using figures from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the institute said 1992 filings increased by less than 3 percent from 1991 filings, while 1991 filings rose by nearly 21 percent from 1990.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money Market Funds Show Mixed Changes in Yields

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Changes in the yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were mixed in the latest week, according to the most recent survey by IBC's Money Fund Report.
Walter S. Frank, IBC's chief economist, expects that rates will remain stable for some time to come. 
 "The Fed isn't going to do anything while the President and Congress are working the budget, restrained by political policy," Mr. Frank said. "This means investors are going to find this area of the market not very attractive compared to alternatives like bonds, and some cases the stock market." "
Tax-exempt yields were up modestly in the week ended Tuesday, as a heavy supply of new municipal issues pushed yields higher.
Assets of tax-exempt funds declined by $230 million, to a total of $102.7 billion. The size of the decline was not considered meaningful, according to IBC analysts.
Portfolio managers made few changes in the week, and the average number of days left to maturity of the securities in their portfolios was unchanged at 54.
The IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Average seven-day compounded tax-exempt yield rose 6 basis points, to 1.81 percent, with the average seven-day simple yield up 7 basis points, to 1.80 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
IBC statisticians calculate that over a 30-day period, the compounded yield averaged 1.83 percent and the simple yield, 1.82 percent.
Ignoring state and local taxes, the taxable bond equivalent yield of the average seven-day compounded tax-exempt yield is about 2.51 percent for an investor in a 28 percent tax bracket and about 2.62 percent for the 31 percent bracket.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets exceeding $100 million, the Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market fund was, for the second straight week, the best performer, with a yield of 2.55 percent.
 
Drop in Taxable Funds

 
 Assets of taxable money market funds fell $2.1 billion in the week ended yesterday, to $484.5 billion. Institutional fund assets were down $3.9 billion, to $166.6 billion, and retail assets rose $1.8 billion, to $317.8 billion.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable portfolios fell to 60, from 61.
The average seven-day yield on a taxable fund was down 2 basis points, to 2.69 percent, while the seven-day simple yield was down a basis point, to 2.66 percent.
Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, distributed by Olde Asset Management Inc. in Detroit, had the highest return among general-purpose taxable funds, at 3.49 percent.
Banks, which compete directly with money market funds for investor cash, were offering an average yield of 2.64 percent on their money market accounts.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Foreign aid may be the glue that will keep Russia in one piece.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WILL Russia negotiate the tortuous path to capitalism without a detour through hyperinflation and depression? Can outsiders do much to keep it moving in the right direction?
Fatalism, tinged with skepticism, seems to be the fashion of the day. While Bill Clinton and his counterparts in Europe and Japan are certainly rooting for Boris Yeltsin to pull off a miracle, most of the technocrats working in the trenches scoff at the idea that Western cash and know-how can make much difference. 
 Most, but not all. Jeffrey Sachs, an economist at Harvard who is advising the Yeltsin Government, thinks there is room for a deal among Russia's warring domestic interests that could ease the way to competitive free markets. And he thinks foreign aid could be the glue that keeps the deal in one piece.
Even those peering at the Russian economy through rose-colored glasses find it hard to ignore the gloom. Inflation is pushing 30 percent a month. The tax system is not generating anything approaching the revenue needed to balance the budget. Oil and gas output is falling for want of modern equipment. Great industrial enterprises are running on empty, using inflationary credit extorted from Moscow to pay suppliers and meet payrolls.
Worst of all, no one seems to be in charge. The Yeltsin Government issues decrees that hostile bureaucrats and enterprise managers ignore at no particular peril. Economic policy is set by committees whose power ebbs and flows with the latest skirmishes between the Office of the President and the apparatchik-dominated Parliament.
The prevailing wisdom says that Mr. Yeltsin can win only by vanquishing the old order -- in particular, the big enterprises of the military-industrial complex that have banded together to lock the credit spigot in the open position. Just how (or whether) this can be accomplished is anybody's guess. As Keith Crane, the research director of the Planecon consulting firm in Washington sums it up, "They'll have to live through their own hell."
But Mr. Sachs, who has brokered stabilization plans in Poland and Bolivia, demurs. An interest realignment that ends the political stalemate is possible, he argues, and for two reasons.
First, the inflation dragon is close to consuming its own children. The trillions of rubles gushing out of the central bank and into politically connected enterprises are doing little more than making up for continuing losses in the purchasing power of enterprises' working capital. Meanwhile, trade between enterprises has become a financial crap shoot: a few weeks' delay in payment can wipe out even the most generously calculated profit margin.
Second, the Government's gain need not be the enterprises' loss. Those who see this contest as a zero-sum economic game, Mr. Sachs suggests, neglect the fact that Russia is hemorrhaging real resources to both former Soviet republics and foreign creditors.
Russia continues to subsidize the impoverished republics with both cheap resources and ruble credits to buy Russian industrial goods. This may suit Russia's foreign policy apparatus, which long ago learned that low-cost oil equals influence. And it may please the West, which is worried about the vacuum of power in Central Asia. But by Mr. Sachs's calculation, it is costing Russia 10 percent of national output -- 10 percent the economy can ill afford to sacrifice at a time when hard currency export revenues are tumbling.
Then there is the matter of servicing hard currency foreign debts. The big creditors are asking Russia to pay back $6.5 billion in 1993, some $4 billion more than Moscow is offering. This $4 billion represents about 4 percent of national income at the current exchange rate.
Mr. Sachs imagines a deal in which all the old enterprise debts to the banking system are canceled and the short-term credit spigot is shut off. The clean slate might then be used as a platform to restructure sectors of the Russian industrial economy with very high potential payoffs, notably energy, high-tech military and agricultural processing.
Long-term financing would come from a combination of increased Western aid and the redirection of resources from the periphery of the old empire. If these struggling republics need outside help, Mr. Sachs argues -- and presumably they do -- it should come from the West, not Russia.
Not every enemy of economic reform could be bought off with this formula, Mr. Sachs concedes. But many enterprises -- enough to build a winning political coalition -- ought to be willing to take their chances on a fresh start in an environment of stable prices and fiscal discipline, where capital is available to those who have a prayer of paying it back.
Is he right? Certainly the prevailing view is that more dollars going into Russia will lead only to more dollars going into very private bank accounts. "They would just be shoveling money into Switzerland," Mr. Crane said.
But the prevailing view is, by no coincidence, the most convenient view, Mr. Sachs contends, the one that gets hard-pressed Western governments off the financial hook. "On the eve of every successful stabilization," he insists, "it looks this hopeless."

HEADLINE: Bronzing Memories Happily

BYLINE: By DEBORAH HOFMANN

 BODY:
SIXTY years ago, parents who got the notion to preserve Susie's or Timmy's first walking shoes besought the local trophy maker or auto-body specialist to electroplate the shoes in between making loving cups or car parts.
The process consisted of stiffening the shoe with a lacquer-based -- and water polluting -- solution, then coating the leather with a conductive material, usually copper, which adhered when voltage was applied in a plating bath. Polishing, the final step, gave the shoes an antique finish, from which came the term bronzing. 
 But by the 1970's, with more stringent environmental standards, most such mom-and-pop resources got out of the plating business, unable to afford updated machinery. The large electroplating factories found the novelty shoe market too small to support such a labor-intensive practice. And the custom often fell prey to haphazard operations; customers experienced delays or even fraud. By the 1980's, many children's shoe stores had stopped their referrals.
"Bronzing can be a big scam," said Nadia Obeid, assistant manager of the Stride Rite store in Manhattan, at 730 Columbus Avenue (95th Street). She warned that unscrupulous vendors could disappear with the deposits, adding: "Shoes are picked up by the vendor and never returned. The parents wait months, call the vendor, and no one answers. They're out their deposit and shoes. What a trauma."
While some shoe store owners refuse to become the middlemen for bronzers and their customers, a majority of 20 Manhattan store owners interviewed now work with two shoe-preservation companies that, they say, do the job reliably, quickly and with a minimum of environmental damage. (For example, shoe-stiffening solutions are now water based to comply with waste-treatment regulations.) Even skeptics like Miss Obeid are taking their first baby steps toward become brokers.
The biggest and oldest provider of shoe bronzing in the United States is the Bron-Shoe Corporation, based in Columbus, Ohio. It was founded 50 years ago by Violet Shinbach, who is credited in the shoe industry with being the first to commercialize the bronzing of baby shoes. To date, it has bronzed shoes for more than 12 million clients; its 100 artisans plated 400,000 shoes last year.
These days, preserving baby shoes is big business. Bron-Shoe projects $10 million in sales in 1993 in what Bob Kaynes Jr., its executive vice president, described as the "invigorated second baby boom." Many people bronze a single shoe, others pairs.
"Baby shoes are our bread and butter," said Mr. Kaynes, who is a grandson of the company's founder. "We had exponential growth in the 1950's. We're becoming very high profile, again."
Bron-Shoe markets its service in four ways, to appeal to parents' various senses of style, budgets and definitions of convenience. The American Bronzing Company, the company's "economy" division, solicits business from new mothers through direct mail. A single shoe costs about $20 to bronze-plate; a pair, $35. The customer mails in a reply card and receives a padded mailing envelope. (All four divisions require about eight weeks for processing.)
Thicker plating and a variety of finishes are available from the Bron-Shoe division. Copper-plating of a single shoe is about $25; a pair, $48. The burnishing that creates the bronze patina costs $2 more per shoe. Other metals cost more: sterling silver, $33 a shoe; 14-karat gold, $47.
The service is sold in infant and jewelry areas of department stores. In Manhattan, Bron-Shoe is available at Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's. Customers browse through a portfolio; the store forwards shoes to Ohio and notifies customers when they're ready to be picked up. Sears, Roebuck and J. C. Penney stores also offer the service.
The company's Senti-metal division offers the same finishes but has higher prices -- about $59 a shoe ($99 a pair) -- because the service is sold by appointment through 400 representatives, who receive referrals from children's shoe stores. They show samples of finished shoes, as well as stands and bases. The latter cost $15 to $150, depending on the material -- from plastic to marble. The company can incorporate shoes into bookends or picture frames.
In 1992, Bron-Shoe, through its Royal Bronzing Company, began selling a gift pack through mail-order catalogues, shoe and department stores, and added a toll-free number: (800) 783-9507. The pack includes a certificate for the antique-bronze finishing of one shoe for $30, or a pair for $50, using the thickest coating available.
The newest thing in shoe preservation is called porcelainizing. "We've got a younger market out there interested in a nonantique look and getting away from what their parents did," Mr. Kaynes said. For this new group of consumers, Bron-Shoe and Senti-metal offer a porcelainlike finish, baked onto shoes several times over, like a ceramic finish, to create the appearance of fine china. This finish -- in white, pastel pink or blue -- is about $34 a shoe; engraving is extra.
The other big preserver of baby shoes is Memory Lane, in Watertown, Mass. The company offers porcelainizing only, with a patented material it calls Dresdenite. "It's for people who want the shoe to look like the original," said Phyllis Fields, president of the 40-year-old company. Since the mid-1950's, she and her husband, Melvin, who is a chemist, have also been using the porcelainizing process to preserve patent-leather Mary Janes.
The company operates with a network of service representatives -- often the same stores used by Senti-metal (typically Buster Brown and Stride Rite outlets). Or customers can call Memory Lane directly, at (617) 926-3036, to have a sales clerk call on them.
Memory Lane's 25 artisans can match any shoe color, from pink ballet slippers to three-color high-top sneakers. They even improve on the originals. Shoelaces are typically accented with gold edging. Some artists can render a perfect Keds insignia; others will replicate Superman on the vamp. And a few have mastered lace borders for christening slippers.
Memory Lane prices start at $75 to $100 a shoe, depending on the detailing. Typical orders take about a month to complete. Memory Lane says it preserves about 400 pairs of shoes a month.
Robyn Feldman, manager of the Little Eric children's shoe store at 1331 Third Avenue (77th Street), has displayed samples of both Senti-metal and Memory Lane bronzing for seven years and is convinced of the companies' reliability. "I wouldn't trust my customers to any other companies, which can be, frankly, cut-and-run places," she said.
The Better Business Bureau for the Watertown, Mass., area and the Ohio Attorney General's office said they had no complaints about the companies on file.
Joe Hernandez, co-owner of Jack's Shoe Center, 669 Ninth Avenue (47th Street), also provides referrals to Senti-metal. He said the system worked smoothly.
Stride Rite stores that do refer their clients most often use Senti-metal. Based on experiences at her store, good and bad, Miss Obeid advised: "These are legitimate establishments, with addresses, track records, their own factories, a secretary. You'll know where they are taking your shoes and your money."

Mets Put Stock in Off-Season Additions

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., March 17

 BODY:
They were minor deals the Mets regarded as major steals. Mike Maddux, journeyman reliever, and Joe Orsulak, consummate role player, were added to the roster this winter. As parts, they would make the whole greater, the organization proclaimed.
Orsulak, a 30-year-old left-handed batter with great instincts and intangibles in the outfield, offered insurance against an injury to Vince Coleman or a flop by Ryan Thompson. Maddux, having rescued his career from a near washout, was the kind of pitcher who could answer any number of bullpen emergencies -- setup right-hander, spot starter, long relief. 
 For the two additions -- modest by most standards, vital according to the Mets -- the early spring returns have been mixed. Orsulak has been everything the Mets had hoped he would be when they signed him as a free agent. He has hit. He has played all three outfield positions, his center field outings a pleasant surprise for even his most enthusiastic backers. He has offered his experience to an outfield otherwise loaded with inexperienced youngsters (Thompson and Darren Reed) and unpolished veterans (Vince Coleman and Bobby Bonilla.)
 
Bad Luck, Bad Calls
 "He's good and greedy, and a pro," Barry Foote, the Mets' first-base coach, said of Orsulak.
Maddux, on the other hand, has had an uneven first month with the Mets. He has given up at least two runs in each of his three outings, yielding four his first time on the mound against the Braves and three Tuesday night against the Phillies. Manager Jeff Torborg, though, has said he liked the essential tools he has seen. Maddux talks about bad luck, infield hits, umpire's calls.
"I've come to lots of spring trainings trying to win a job," said Maddux. "But I'm to a point where I can use the spring to get myself to where I want to be for the start of the season."
Two seasons ago, Maddux thought he was at the end of his career. There had been two rounds of elbow surgery, more than three times as many games in the minors as in the majors, fat earned run averages and a slim chance at a future. He asked the Padres for a tryout, won a job and methodically went about becoming the only National League reliever to post a 2.50 e.r.a. or lower in each of the last two seasons.
 
A Curious Decision
 The Mets were evidently overwhelmed enough by his recent success to discard the underwhelming total picture of his career, and so the club, which could have taken Maddux to arbitration, wound up signing him for two years and roughly $2 million. It was a curious decision, given the tight economics of the game and the often difficult-to-discern quality of middle relief pitching numbers.
"I think I've kept the baseball in the infield for the most part, and if I'm doing that I don't call it struggling," said Maddux. "Some of the results just haven't been there."
Orsulak is all about results, and not at all intrigued by public relations. The outfielder, who tied for the Orioles' lead in batting average three of the last five seasons despite being mostly a platoon player, has hit .347 this spring, homering once and driving in four runs. He has spoken almost not at all.
"What you see is what you get, and what you get is a guy who gives away nothing at the plate," said Paul Gibson, the left-hander who faced Orsulak regularly when in the American League. "He's always at the plate when you don't want to see him. He's made a career of taking advantage of other people's failed opportunities."
He has made the most of his opportunity here so far, and there is every likelihood, given Coleman's susceptibility to injury and Thompson's rawness at the plate.

 
 
 
INSIDE PITCH
 It was not the ideal outing for the man in the middle of multimillion-dollar contract negotiations. BRET SABERHAGEN was smacked around for five runs in four and two-third innings and removed before he could get the final out of the fifth inning because he had reached the outermost reaches of his pitch limit. "I threw 82 pitches, and it felt like 82 pitches," Saberhagen said. There were a couple of pitches, though, with added intent. "I keep hearing from Al that my curveball isn't sharp," said Saberhagen, in reference to the club's general manager, AL HARAZIN, and the man negotiating his contract extension. "I got a few off today." DWIGHT GOODEN pitched for the first time since injuring his toe and reported no great pain and no great worry about whether he will be able to start on Sunday. "A big relief to pass that test," said Gooden, who threw to MEL STOTTLEMYRE for 15 minutes. TIM BOGAR, the backup infielder, injured his left shoulder Tuesday night and will be sidelined for two to three days.

VONS EXPECTS BAD PUBLICITY WILL HURT SALES

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The Vons Companies said its first-quarter sales are expected to drop about 8 percent, in part because of negative publicity from contaminated fast-food hamburgers. Vons, Southern California's largest supermarket chain, said yesterday that other factors for the projected sales drop included the poor economy, store remodeling and competitors' recent changes in pricing and promotions. But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Vons said it did not expect operating earnings or cash flow for the quarter ending March 28 to "decline materially" because of the expected sales dip. 
A Vons subsidiary, Vons Meat Service Center, processed meat into frozen hamburger patties for Foodmaker, parent company of Jack in the Box. The product was implicated in the E. coli outbreak in which at least two children died and more than 500 people fell ill.

ANHEUSER EXPECTS NARROWER FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The Anheuser-Busch Companies said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings would fall 7 percent as beer sales have been hampered by the sluggish economy, last week's storm and a change in the company's delivery system. The St. Louis-based beverage giant expects to earn about 69 cents a share in the period, compared with earnings of 74 cents a share for the similar period a year ago. 
 The company's forecast is 16 percent below the mean Wall Street estimate of 82 cents a share for the quarter, according to Zacks Investment Research. Shares of Anheuser-Busch fell $2.25 yesterday, to $50.75, equaling the stock's low price for the last 52 weeks.

Asian Arms Races

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
Westerners barely noticed the announcement last month that Indonesia had bought a third of the former East German Navy at a bargain-basement price. And perhaps only stockholders paid attention as McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics scrambled to Malaysia recently to hawk discounted fighter aircraft in a losing price war with Russia, which was willing to be paid partly in palm oil. Eyebrows raised only at the specter of nuclear war in Korea this week.
If the end of the cold war produced a geostrategic peace and a rush to cut military spending in Europe, it prompted new uncertainty and anxiety in East Asia -- and set off a colossal shopping spree for arms. 
 Now that the Soviet Union has collapsed, East Asians are far less sure who will attack them -- or who will protect them now that the U.S. is reducing its presence overseas. And they are now rich enough to buy a lot of firepower insurance.
East Asian nations made 35 percent of all major weapons purchases in 1991. Even so, they lag far behind Europe in modern military punch. But if Europe continues to slash arms spending and Asian trends continue, East Asia will be the world's most heavily armed area by century's end.
China has raised defense spending a whopping 50 percent over two years, and just announced a new 15 percent hike. Japan was the only industrialized country whose arms budget increased last year. Singapore's rose 23 percent in 1991. Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand followed suit with double-digit spurts. So did South Korea, where alarms continue to sound about North Korean nukes.
To be sure, much of this buildup is routine. East Asian economies have been booming, and Asians can afford expensive modern arms. Most of the big spenders can also legitimately claim the need to modernize ancient equipment.
But these nations are not simply refurbishing. Some are becoming major arms makers and exporters, and many more are expanding their capacity to attack as well as defend.
South Korea has good reason to beef up. Dying North Korea, one of the last Communist states and by far the most dangerous, is capable of anything. The nuclear crisis here requires immediate attention. And minor conflicts could explode later.
Like China. Freed from the Soviet threat and less concerned with American power, Beijing might be tempted to flex its new muscles, as it's been doing in the oil-rich Spratly Islands.
At least as alarming is the mounting China-Taiwan face-off. Taipei is shopping for arms like there's no tomorrow. It bought 150 F-16's from the U.S. and wants about half again as many modern French fighters. It is also buying up submarines, anti-sub helicopters and naval vessels.
This is Taiwan's way of asserting its independence from the mainland. And that is the one thing that no Chinese leader, reformer or unreconstructed Communist, can stand for.
Japan, by far the most modern military power in the region and with a military budget soon to exceed any Western European country's, is unsettled by all these events. Other countries fear its unease may translate into military aggressiveness. But Tokyo has been a leader in trying to tamp down anxieties.
Above all, Japan and its neighbors want the U.S. to maintain a strong presence in East Asia. And they will be happy to hear the Clinton Administration's wise decision to make only small cuts in U.S. forces here, even as it slashes troops in Europe.
For some time, Japan and the others have also wanted to talk to each other about mutual security, only to be blocked by the U.S. The Reagan and Bush Administrations couldn't stand the idea. They clung to the old Pacific security network, based on direct security links between individual Asian nations and Washington, which kept the U.S. central but did not weave regional trust.
The Clinton team has already quietly ditched that ostrich policy, encouraging the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, to talk about common military problems at a May meeting. It will be an informal discussion of who's buying what and why. Asean members will then reach out for similar talks with Russia, China, Japan and the U.S. That's a good start toward preventing the East Asian shopping spree from becoming a shooting spree.

HEADLINE: Timber Industry Wants You to Hate Owls

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Lumber Prices Are Soaring on Shortages and Owl Feud" (Business Day, March 11): According to all the timber industry sources you cite, an 8-inch, 22-ounce owl is responsible for one of the greatest stampedes the lumber market has ever witnessed. In reality, there is no evidence that environmental protection measures are driving up lumber prices.
Lumber prices today are lower than in 1975, when adjusted for inflation, as a new analysis of lumber prices by the Congressional Research Service confirms. 
 Even a leading timber industry economist agrees lumber is a bargain for consumers. The Spokane (Wash.) Spokesman-Review has quoted Fred Reseburg, economic services director for the Western Wood Products Association, as saying, "The public has really been getting a bargain on lumber."
He added that lumber is being sold at or below 1970's price levels.
The demand for housing, especially in postrecession years, is the single largest factor affecting lumber prices. When housing starts rise, so do lumber prices, and when housing falls off, lumber prices decline. Finally, lumber prices rise every spring as builders stockpile inventory for the new construction year.
The biggest influence on lumber prices this year has been the hysteria whipped up by timber companies with a well-financed national campaign. This tactic has panicked the lumber markets, which these groups hope to exploit to create political backlash against Federal environmental laws.
There is a crisis in America's national forests, but it's not the one timber companies want you to think. Years of overcutting, neglect, mismanagement and cozy industry-Federal deals have left many national forests in tatters. More than 365,000 miles of logging roads slice through what remains of the public's forests. And when timber companies log these public lands, the Government loses millions of dollars. In 1992, taxpayers lost more than $350 million on timber sales from 111 national forests.

HEADLINE: When Publishers Unite, Authors Must Worry

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"In a highly unusual marriage of convenience and commerce, Random House and Simon & Schuster will jointly publish the joint campaign memoirs of James Carville, President Clinton's chief strategist, and Mary Matalin, a top political aide to President George Bush" (Business Day, Feb. 23).
This joint purchase is a great marketing gimmick. But the publishing deal is bad news for writers and ultimately for the reading public. This deal was reportedly conceived by bidders in the middle of an auction in which they were bidding against each other and other parties. Why should this practice not be considered a restraint of trade? Doesn't this kind of deal avoid competition between two competitors and permit them to cut, if not set, a price? 
 The deal, which reportedly guaranteed an $850,000 advance, ended up costing two competitors half of what one of them would have paid if it had won the auction alone. Probably less than half, because if the auction played itself, the price could well have gone higher. I can understand why the publishers like the gimmick, but not why any writer would.
Publishers, bemused by the recession, are buying fewer serious books and paying less money to serious writers, while they run after celebrities, offering huge advances. For most writers, the pool of available money to publish books is diminished.
Publishers dislike auctions of books, often blaming lawyers, who now represent many authors, for using the technique to escalate prices. But writers ought to get the best price available for their work in a free and open market. If publishers can pre-empt the market from running its course by joining forces with competitors, authors will not get the top prices.

HEADLINE: Price War Traps Smaller PC Makers

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
Gregory E. Herrick believes he is doing all he can to survive the costly war in prices and customer services that has roiled the personal computer industry since last June, forcing some of his competitors, namely Nippon Steel's Librex brand and Philips Electronics' Magnavox, to abandon the personal computer market in North America and changing the nature of the business for even the strongest.
The Minneapolis-based company he heads, Zeos International, hired a new president, won applause from the trade press for three of several new machines, slashed costs by auctioning small operations and paring inventories, attracted new financing and opened gleaming new assembly lines. 
 Yet Zeos still posted a loss of $28 million for last year, with sales dropping from 1991 levels every quarter. Mr. Herrick says the pricing battles must ease soon because "at some juncture, there is just no more to cut."
Medium-sized manufacturers like Zeos and Advanced Logic Research, which is losing money for the first time after nine profitable years, are threatened by the continuing shakeout in the $60 billion personal computer market. On Monday, the Compuadd Computer Corporation of Austin, Tex, said it would close its 110 retail stores and reduce its work force from 1,170 to approximately 550 people. It also said its revenue could fall, from $524.4 million last year to below $350 million for this year.
"A lot of middle- and lower-tier vendors are bloodied and on the ropes," Steven L. Eskenazi, technology analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, said.
Bigger companies that slashed operating costs last year trying to keep pace with falling prices now find their profits pinched further as they compete on more fronts to capture sales.
"Buyers are looking at brand names, service and support, technological differences and even the financial stability of a vendor itself," said Jim Schraith, vice president at AST Research, in Irvine, Calif., which topped $1 billion in sales last year for the first time. "I would guess that 80 percent of the total PC market will be held by the 10 largest suppliers in five years, up from 58 percent last year."
Larger rivals like Compaq Computer and Dell Computer have applied much of the pressure, not just with well-publicized price cuts, but with costly benefits for customers including next-day repair service, multiple-year warranties on new machines and free telephone consultations. Dell, with sales of more than $2 billion, is 10 times larger than Zeos and Advanced Logic.
To some, those packages are as big a draw as low prices. "They are very buttoned up, on top of everything with all the services they offer nationwide," said Paula van der Geest of Stanfordville, N.Y., who selected Dell as the primary vendor for a new international computer-based service she organized. "I could be telling someone in Maine to get their computer through Dell. There is 24-hour replacement if the machine goes down. Those things are valuable. And the prices are great."
 An overhauled Compaq, vowing to grab the lead from I.B.M. in total worldwide sales, touched off the pricing war last June, when it introduced several personal computers priced below $2,000. Dell and the International Business Machines Corporation followed with cuts that matched Compaq's or went lower.
Compaq slashed prices again last week on several desktop and notebook machines by as much as 15 percent and started a direct-mail operation last Friday. And Wall Street believes that Dell Computer is gearing up for more intensive pricing battles -- and thinner profit margins -- in the months ahead.
These high-profile companies and a handful of smaller peers that have annual sales of nearly $1 billion or more, including Gateway 2000, AST Research and Packard Bell, have the distribution, speed, cash, engineering capabilities and manufacturing efficiency to slug it out, perhaps for years.
Mr. Eskenazi of Alex. Brown estimated that Compaq, Dell, AST and Gateway 2000 increased their share of units shipped last year. Among the majors, only I.B.M. lost ground. But Big Blue reversed that trend after joining the pricing battle late last year. Mr. Eskenazi said the five companies together would increase their share of unit shipments to 34 percent of the global market this year, compared with 27 percent last year and 23 percent in 1991.
 
 
Assembly Shops
 There are also hundreds of assembly shops, ranging from the multiple locations of national computer supercenters like CompUSA to small garage and storefront outposts that compete mainly on price because they commit little capital for parts, research or marketing.
That leaves companies like Zeos and Advanced Logic wedged in what consultants and analysts say has become a very vulnerable middle: with yearly sales barely exceeding $200 million apiece and sliding. In addition to the withdrawals from the market, Everex Systems entered a bankruptcy reorganization. Sales at Northgate Computer Systems plunged 26 percent last year, to $124 million, although the Minneapolis-based company posted a small fourth-quarter profit despite an overall loss of $15.5 million for 1992.
 
 
Discounting Rewrote the Rules
 Michael Nevens, the partner who heads studies of personal computers at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, said that once these companies discovered that they no longer could price their machines as much as 40 percent or more under the big brands, cracks in their business plans began to spread.
"At some point, the economic rationale for the existence of these smaller players goes away," Mr. Nevens said.
The big companies have virtually insurmountable advantages with their legions of telemarketing specialists and design engineers, as well as brand names that influence major buyers, Mr. Eskenazi said. "Aggressive players like Dell and Compaq may want to cut prices proactively, invest in marketing and sales programs or expand geographically or in production lines in order to deliver the final knockout blow," he said.
 
Looking for Niches
 Mr. Herrick at Zeos, and Gene Lu, chairman and chief executive of Advanced Logic, based in Irvine, Calif., are trying to carve out self-preserving niches. Zeos scaled back a test started last year to sell bare-bones models through Sam's Wholesale Club, where Dell is now entrenched, to concentrate on telephone orders and direct-mail shipments, where it competes head-on with Dell, I.B.M. , Gateway 2000 and soon, Compaq.
While Dell and Compaq's gains have come from tapping small-business and home buyers through sales at rapidly expanding computer supercenters like CompUSA, Circuit City and Computer City, Zeos has held fast to computer-literate shoppers. "Brand names are a refuge for the ignorant," Mr. Herrick said. "Someone who picks up the telephone and makes a decision to spend $2,000 to $3,000 on a computer has a good ability to discern what is good value for the money."
Mr. Herrick, 41, said Zeos had nibbled away at Dell, Gateway and Compaq through advertisements in magazines like PC Week, PC World and PC Computing. Zeos, which sold its first personal computers in 1987, offers immediate shipment of several machines that are similar to popular ones that its rivals cannot keep in stock.
"We call it Computers Now, and it ranges from 10 to 15 different configurations" of Zeos machines, Mr. Herrick said. "We're going after these people who can't deliver."
 
 
Future in Network Building
 Mr. Nevens of McKinsey said the big action in the future would come from businesses building networks of a dozen or more computers that also want a full range of services along with the latest models and low prices.
"The real core of the market is and will remain people who are using their PC's on a network to do more and more complicated business tasks," Mr. Nevens said.
Zeos cut costs and laid off some workers when it moved operations late last year from five different buildings in St. Paul to a refurbished building in Minneapolis once occupied by Unisys, the mainframe maker. The company obtained $12.5 million in new credit from the Congress Financial Corporation in December, a month after Mr. Herrick handed off some of his duties to a new president, Martyn Ratcliffe, from Vtech Computers, in Beaverton, Ore.
 
 
New Ways to Sell
 Mr. Lu of Advanced Logic said the narrowing profit margins last year forced him to rework longstanding relationships with his company's major distributors, specialty retailers such as Computerland , Entre and Micro Integration.
Instead of selling them a completed system, Advanced Logic now patches together a chassis with a few basic parts -- one model for $500 and another for $680 -- to which the retailers add custom chips, peripherals and other equipment before the final sale.
Mail order now accounts for about 10 percent of its $207 million in sales. Mr. Lu also eliminated suggested retail prices and gave its more than 4,000 resellers a cost-plus formula designed to add a few percentage points of profit for the resellers.
"We're still counting on our technology to keep us in the same league, competing for the same business," he said.
Compaq disagrees. "Weaker companies are being confronted with new standards, which they will not be capable of providing," Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's president and chief executive, said. "There is clearly a consolidation under way. Frankly, we hope it will accelerate."

HEADLINE: HOUSE DEMOCRATS UNITE TO APPROVE CLINTON'S BUDGET

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, March 19

 BODY:
The House of Representatives, in a late-night session, gave President Clinton two major victories as overwhelming Democratic majorities passed first his plan to cut the deficit and then his jobs bill, designed to foster short-term economic stimulus.
Early today, at 12:38 A.M., a 235-to-190 vote sent the $16 billion jobs measure to the Senate. That bill had been challenged by some conservative Democrats who doubted its ability to spur the economy, but in the end only 22 Democrats deserted their party. 
 About three and a half hours earlier, the House voted 243 to 183 to pass Mr. Clinton's plan to curb the deficit by raising taxes and cutting spending. Only 11 Democrats voted against the plan after Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, told the House the plan would strengthen the nation. "I think we have a President who has a plan," he said. "You may not agree with it, but I think he deserves a chance."
 
Limits on Total Spending
 The budget resolution sets limits on total spending and taxation, with the expectation that it will reduce the deficit, now about $300 billion, to below $200 billion by the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 1996. Under the procedures of the Congressional Budget Act, votes on specific tax increases and spending cuts will come this summer.
The budget resolution deals with tax and spending decisions affecting the fiscal year that begins this October. The emergency spending bill, once it makes its way through the Senate and is signed by the President, would make money available immediately.
A majority of the House followed the arguments of members like Representative Carrie Meek, a Florida Democrat who said: "Vote for this stimulus package. It's an investment in America."
 
Need to Create Jobs
 And Representative David Bonior, the Democratic whip from Michigan, advised: "Stay with the President. Stay with his total package."
Besides calling wavering lawmakers, Mr. Clinton defended his economic measures publicly on Thursday, describing those who asked that it be cut back as the "status-quo lite" crowd. He said in a speech to Treasury Department employees, "Frankly, I think if we do a little less of everything -- we have a little less deficit reduction, a little less spending cut, a little less tax cut, a little less investment -- we'll get a lot less in results."
"We've got to create jobs on our own here," he said. "That's what the stimulus package is about."
The Democrats achieved remarkable unity in the early voting. None abandoned their party on the vote that set procedures for considering the measure. Only three deserted their leaders to support a plan offered by Representative John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, that sought to cut the deficit without any tax increases. Taxes account for almost half the approximately $500 billion in the Democratic plan's deficit cutting over five years. The Kasich plan was also opposed by 41 Republicans as it lost, 295 to 135.
The Democrats' unity will be repeatedly tested throughout the spring and summer as the general provisions of the budget resolution are translated into painful votes to cut popular programs and increase taxes. As Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, said, "The real budget work will be done in the trenches of our committees."
Even so, the resolution's overall limits on spending and taxes erect solid walls within which other Congressional committees must operate. It also offers a nonbinding plan on how to achieve its deficit cuts. The committees can choose different priorities, as long as they reach the same result. But the budget plan provides those committees with political cover for doing unpopular things.
While the House voted, the Senate debated a very similar resolution. Both the House and Senate measures would cut domestic spending slightly more than Mr. Clinton proposed, changes that he accepted quickly. The differences between the two proposed resolutions are small enough so that agreement in a House-Senate conference should not be difficult, and Congress may be able to meet its goal of adopting a final resolution before it takes an Easter vacation on April 2.
 
Week of Debate
 Senate rules provide 50 hours of debate on the budget resolution, so decisive action is not expected before next week. Nor will the Senate vote on both the budget and stimulus methods in a single day, a device House leaders developed so that lawmakers can have flexibility in describing their votes to constituents this weekend.
There is also some uncertainty in the Senate over the $16 billion spending program, and Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, announced Thursday that he would try to balance some of it with additional spending cuts. He said he would try to amend the spending bill, but House leaders blocked his amendment from floor consideration on Thursday.
The Senate did take one significant vote on Thursday, defeating an effort led by Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, to eliminate authority for Mr. Clinton's proposed energy tax from the resolution. That vote was 53 to 46.
The House went on to the spending bill only after bitter Republican complaints against the "tyranny" of Democrats in controlling procedures and writing procedural rules that denied the minority the chance to offer any amendments.
They sought repeatedly to cut back on such items as $3 billion for highway construction, $1 billion for summer youth jobs, $4 billion for unemployment benefits, $2.5 billion for community development block grants, $2.6 billion for small business loans and $1.9 billion for college grants.
Representative David Dreier, Republican of California, said, "This gag rule is a clear reflection of a Democratic leadership that opposes open debate, that scoffs at fiscal responsibility, and that pays nothing more than lip service to the rights of peoples' representatives in Congress."
Thursday's debate in the House provided the same sort of oratory that has accompanied votes on these issues for several years.
But if the arguments were old, some of the voices were new.
Representative Eva Clayton, the North Carolina Democrat elected by her party's 63 freshmen to be their leader, called the vote on the Clinton budget "a chance to move America and move it in the right direction."
Representative Deborah Pryce, a freshman Republican from Ohio, disagreed. "Raising taxes on Americans is not the answer," she said. "Higher taxes lead to greater spending, not deficit reduction."
Some familiar voices were also heard with familiar arguments. "This is indeed a defining moment between the two parties," Mr. Michel said. "Democrats prefer to raise taxes on practically everyone, and Republicans do not."
Another Democratic freshman, Representative Cynthia McKinney of Georgia, challenged that definition. Under Republicans, she said, "Government serves the needs of a few of us at the expense of the rest of us."
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, "What makes our budget the best is that it can pass, and we're doing something about the deficit."
With one exception, all of the representatives from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut voted along party lines. The exception was Representative Robert E. Andrews, a Democrat from Bellmawr, N.J., who sided with Republicans. He said he voted against the President's budget plan because it included five years of new taxes. But he said he supported the economic stimulus package because it would create jobs and pay for itself.
While Republicans challenged the plan for its proposed taxes and military cuts, the Congressional Black Caucus offered an alternative plan that would have cut military spending more heavily to provide more money for domestic spending and foreign aid to countries like Somalia.
Barbara Rose Collins, Democrat of Michigan, said the caucus's package would "create jobs, feed children and educate our children."
The plan was defeated by a vote of 335 to 87.
House action was repeatedly delayed by Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, who forced at least four insubstantial roll-call votes that took up at least an hour and a half. He said he did so because the Democratic leaders had not allowed the House to consider a proposed budget of his as a possible substitute. It would have allowed Federal spending to grow by no more than 2 percent a year, and he said it would have led to more than $800 billion in budget cuts over five years.
He explained his delaying tactics in these terms: "If a guy pushes you around the schoolyard and you punch him in the mouth just one time, sometimes he gets the idea that it's better to work with you than against you."
Representative Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, suggested that Mr. Burton was being "petulant and puerile."

HEADLINE: Clinton Health Team Member Is Forced Aside Over Conflict

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The wall of secrecy surrounding the membership of Hillary Rodham Clinton's health policy team was breached today as White House officials finally identified one of its top members, only to disclose that he had been demoted for conflicts of interest.
The adviser, Thomas O. Pyle, was the head of one of 15 committees working for the Task Force on National Health Care Reform. He is also chairman of the Jackson Hole Group, a conclave of health-care executives and policy analysts sometimes described as a brain trust for the Administration. 
 Until today, White House officials had been unwilling to acknowledge that Mr. Pyle was on the staff of the task force. And, under questioning today, they said only that he had been removed from his job and given an undefined "consultant" position because of concern about his stock ownership and service as a director of several companies in the health-care industry.
Mr. Pyle was, in effect, dismissed for crossing a line that is still not visible. In its rush to assemble a health policy, the White House hired many outside experts, temporary employees and consultants who say they do not completely understand Federal personnel laws or ethics rules.
It is now clear that the White House has established conflict-of-interest guidelines for the task force. But it is not entirely clear what those rules are, as the staff of more than 500 people races to devise a proposal to control health costs and guarantee coverage for all Americans. President Clinton has said he will send the proposal to Congress by May 1.
While confirming Mr. Pyle's role, the White House still refused to identify any of the other people employed by the task force, in large or small roles. But because their work could send shock waves through the American economy, trying to discover their identities has become a major Washington pastime.
Trade publications have named roughly 200 of the more than 500 people working for the task force. Of those who head the 15 working groups, about a dozen are known, including six Federal employees, a California state official, a professor of sociology and a policy analyst identified with an advocacy group for elderly people. None of these seemed as likely as Mr. Pyle to have a financial conflict of interest.
Mr. Pyle said that Ira C. Magaziner, the senior adviser for policy development who is serving as manager of the task force operations, had told him he would have to step down as chairman of a panel working on such issues as medical malpractice, training of health-care professionals and ways to measure the quality of care.
Mr. Pyle remains a consultant to the task force. He has much less authority, but retains an office and a telephone in the Old Executive Office Building, next to the White House.
 
Ethical Questions Raised
 His case raises ethical questions that loom over the work of Mr. Clinton's health policy advisers. A White House lawyer has told some people working for the task force that they may have "criminal liability" if they keep their ties to health-related businesses while working for the Government.
But the laws are complex. In its ethics handbook for Federal employees, the Justice Department summarizes one criminal law this way: "You may not participate personally and substantially in a matter in which you, your spouse, minor child or partner has a financial interest. This prohibition also applies if an organization in which you serve as an officer, director, trustee, partner or employee has a financial interest."
Mr. Pyle said he started working for the White House on Feb. 8, assuming he would be paid for his services. But he added, "I have not signed any employment forms, and I have never been paid."
He said he informed White House officials of his business interests and outside activities because he realized they might create conflicts of interest.
 
Told About Business Ties
 "Before coming to Washington, I informed Magaziner and other officials of all my business ties," Mr. Pyle said in an interview. "After coming to Washington, I forcefully and repeatedly brought this issue up -- my situation, my supposed conflicts. But I found it quite difficult to get anyone to pay attention."
He added: "Eventually, it was decided that I did have conflicts. I could not be an employee of the Government, according to various rules established for the task force, some of which are quite ad hoc."
Robert O. Boorstin, a spokesman for the task force, said Mr. Pyle's case showed that the Administration would enforce rigorous standards against conflict of interest.
"Tom Pyle is one of the most talented, innovative health administrators in America," Mr. Boorstin said. "We wanted his input. He was asked to come down and be a 'cluster' leader. But he could not extricate himself from a bunch of boards he sits on."
From 1978 to 1991, Mr. Pyle was chief executive of the Harvard Community Health Plan, the largest health maintenance organization in New England. It now has 540,000 members.
He said he was still a director of the Millipore Corporation, a multinational high-technology company based in Bedford, Mass., and an adviser to the KBL Healthcare Acquisition Corporation, a merchant banking concern in which he owns stock.
Millipore sells a wide range of products to drug companies, biotechnology companies, hospitals and clinical laboratories, among other customers. KBL describes itself as a "publicly traded buyout fund organized for the express purpose of consummating a significant acquisition in the health-care field," and says its initial capitalization will exceed $15 million.
Mr. Pyle is a senior adviser on health care for the Boston Consulting Group, which has many clients in the health-care industry. He said he was also a director of the Chickering Group, which sells student health insurance to universities, and a director of the Controlled Risk Insurance Company of the Cayman Islands, which provides malpractice insurance to doctors.
For 10 years Mr. Pyle has attended meetings of the Jackson Hole Group, which takes its name from its meeting place in Wyoming and consists mainly of people outside the Government.
 
First Open Meeting Set
 The task force, formed on Jan. 25, tentatively plans to hold its first open meeting on March 29. Mrs. Clinton has defended the secrecy of the panel by saying, "We do not want to have health-care legislation in the Clinton Administration written by any special-interest group."
But William G. Kopit, a health-care specialist at Epstein, Becker & Green, a Washington law firm, said: "There is a double standard here. Conflict-of-interest principles are not interpreted consistently. Some special interest groups are more special than others."
"People who have formal ties to trade associations in the health-care industry cannot work for the task force or attend meetings of its staff," he continued. "But some people on the staff of the task force have ties to business and consulting groups whose paying clients include corporations in the health-care industry."
Information about the task force is commercially valuable. "We have received calls from Wall Street investment houses," said Mr. Kopit. "They want to know what health-care companies are well-positioned for health-care reform under President Clinton."
Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader, and Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, complained this week that the foundation was acting in a partisan way. In a letter to the foundation, the Republican leaders said such conduct was "inappropriate for a nonprofit, tax-exempt, supposedly nonpartisan foundation."
Thomas P. Gore 2d, a vice president of the foundation, said the charges had no merit. But he added, "It is a concern of ours, that we are seen as being boldly partisan."
 
Some of Those Identified
 Only a handful of the many people working for Mrs. Clinton have been identified. One is Walter A. Zelman, a California insurance official who is supervising the design of the new health-care system. Judith Feder, a health policy analyst who worked in the Clinton campaign last year, is now trying to decide what health benefits should be guaranteed to all Americans.
Dr. Stephen H. Bandeian, a physician with a law degree who worked at the Office of Management and Budget under President George Bush, is in charge of linking the new program to existing programs like Medicare and veterans' health benefits.
Paul Starr, a professor of sociology at Princeton University, is chairman of the panel drafting proposals for short-term cost controls.
Marina Weiss, an aide to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, is responsible for determining how to pay for the President's ambitious program. Robyn I. Stone, a policy analyst at Project Hope, an international health foundation, is in charge of proposals for long-term care, including nursing homes.
Dr. Bernard S. Arons, a psychiatrist from the National Institute of Mental Health, leads the panel on mental health care. David M. Cutler, a Harvard economist, is in charge of analyzing the economic effects of Mr. Clinton's program.
And Kenneth E. Thorpe, a Clinton campaign adviser now working at the Department of Health and Human Services, is supervising "quantitative analysis" of the proposal.

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies Quietly Returning to South Africa

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, March 18

 BODY:
The advertisement spread across two pages of a Johannesburg newspaper pictures a bottle of pharmaceutical capsules and the announcement: "Now Legally Available."
The product on sale is not a drug, but the Windows computer program from the Microsoft Corporation, the American producer of software that withdrew from South Africa in 1986 when an anti-apartheid boycott was gathering force. For years there was a gray market in Microsoft products, but now the company is back, with a small office and an ad campaign that transforms the long taboo into a marketing come-on. 
 Although the African National Congress is still months away from lifting its injunction against doing business with the white Government, American companies are quietly drifting back into South Africa, most of them on scouting expeditions, but some re-establishing their corporate beachheads in Africa's most promising market.
Already the waning of South Africa's infamy has brought formerly illicit American brands like M&M candies, Tampax tampons and the Compaq Computer Corporation. For the first time since sanctions were introduced, the number of American companies doing direct business here rose last year, from 106 to 119, according to the Investor Responsiblity Research Center, a Washington-based group that monitors compliance with sanctions. For the first time, American exports to South Africa have surpassed their pre-sanctions levels.
So far, however, the big producers, whose dollars and jobs South Africans hope will help pull them out of a deep economic slough, are keeping a wary distance. Economists and businessmen agree that even though the stigma of South Africa is disappearing, chronic violence, political confusion and deep doubts about the economic policies of a future government will deny the country any quick windfall from its new respectability.
"They worry about strikes," said Michelle Cohen, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Southern Africa. "They worry about the violence that is disruptive to business. They worry about prescriptive laws. Above all, they worry about whether there will be a free market."
"Unless the new government has the answer to those economic questions, we can forget about investment," said Thami Mazwai, editor of the black business magazine Enterprise. "Between now and, say, 1996, only gamblers will come in."
The major exodus of American business began in 1985 when foreign banks froze new credits to South Africa. The next year Congress voted over President Reagan's veto to restrict trade, investment and lending by American companies in South Africa. Scores of state and local governments enacted their own anti-apartheid statutes.
 
U.S. Exports Slowly Rising
 The sanctions contained numerous loopholes, and to this day their impact on South Africa is hotly debated. But many American companies sold out and fled rather than face the wrath of shareholders or the loss of contracts with governments at home.
American exports to South Africa plunged from $2.27 billion in 1984 to $1.20 billion the following year, before slowly creeping upward. Exports in 1992 were $2.43 billion.
President George Bush repealed the Federal restrictions on trade with South Africa in July 1991, but 164 state and local governments in the United States still restrict business with South Africa, and anti-apartheid lobby groups have not let up their pressure.
The African National Congress, now alarmed about inheriting a country with a crippled economy, says it will urge the end of all economic sanctions when a date has been set for the first universal elections, and a transitional council has been created to assure a fair campaign. This is expected about midyear.
The congress has given mixed signals about what companies should do in the meantime.
"I suppose I take the view, 'So what?' " shrugged Trevor Manuel, head of the congress's economic department, when asked how the congress feels about companies already opening shop in South Africa. Mr. Manuel said the congress is now more concerned with marketing South Africa as a future investment opportunity than with policing the vestiges of the anti-apartheid campaign.
 
Apple Computer Told to Wait
 Before opening its office here, Microsoft got an informal nod of approval from congress officials, according to a Microsoft distributor. "The people I deal with in the A.N.C. have all kind of accepted that sanctions are gone and we need to move on and create jobs," said the distributor, Dana Buys of Work Group Systems.
But companies that have waited for an unambiguous, top-level signal from the African National Congress have been frustrated. Apple Computer Inc., which says it is eager to open an office here, met with the congress president, Nelson Mandela, last September, and was told to stay out of South Africa until the congress makes its formal announcement.
David de Jong, an independent distributor who handles Apple technology, grumbled that Microsoft's entry may have been smoothed by the fact that both the congress and its most important political ally, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, use Microsoft products, many of them donated by the company.
"They are prepared to give absolution if they receive sufficient benefits," Mr. de Jong suggested. He added that when he approached Mr. Mandela recently to ask about Apple's prospects, the congress leader wanted to know why Apple had not yet delivered the 100 Powerbook laptop computers Apple executives had promised the congress as a gift.
When the congress does call for the resumption of trade, it may discover that repealing sanctions is as cumbersome as imposing them. William Moses, senior analyst with the Investor Responsibility Research Center, noted that 50 cities, including New York and Los Angeles, have rules against giving contracts to banks or suppliers that do business with South Africa.
"If you sell gum or clothing, it's not going to matter to you that Los Angeles or New York won't buy from you," Mr. Moses said. "If you provide food for hospitals or schools, or sell photocopiers, or road-building equipment, it matters a lot."
Mr. Manuel of the African National Congress promised that when the time comes the congress will mount a lobbying campaign to revoke these sanctions, but, he said, "your legislative mill grinds slowly."
And if more militant black groups oppose lifting sanctions, or if some anti-apartheid pressure groups in America insist on replacing the old sanctions with new conditions for South African investment, local governments may be confused.
Last November the congress issued a "platform of guiding principles" for companies that invest here after sanctions, including codes of conduct governing worker rights, affirmative action and environmental policies. To the alarm of American businesses, some lobby groups professing to speak for the African National Congress have begun a push to have these guidelines enshrined in American statutes.
Mr. Manuel, the congress's chief economic spokesman, said any conditions on foreign investment in South Africa should be regulated by South African law and international treaties, not dictated by self-styled allies in America. "I understand the power of groups that have built South Africa as their life's work," Mr. Manuel said. "But we are now in transformation from anti-apartheid to pro-democracy. That process needs continuing support, but it is no longer the time for barging in on shareholders' meetings."
Such confusing signals have contributed to a wider uncertainty about the African National Congress and its intentions if, as expected, it wins the majority role in a new government.
 
Conversion From Socialism?
 Although Mr. Mandela rarely talks any more about socialism and the need to nationalize industries, many businessmen wonder how deep the conversion goes.
"There's a kind of paradox really in the A.N.C.," said one executive whose company is contemplating a major project in South Africa. "There are those who are very welcoming toward investment, but then on the ground one encounters a more old-fashioned approach. When you get down to the operational level you find people aren't necessarily hearing what Mr. Mandela and others are saying."
The companies South Africa most hopes to lure here are big producers like the H.J. Heinz Company, whose food processing plants and canneries already employ 2,000 people in neighboring Zimbabwe. Heinz executives visited Johannesburg last June in search of potential partners, but backed away when negotiations on the country's political future broke down.
Edward Smyth, Heinz's vice president for corporate affairs, said the company is still interested, but before it moves again South Africa must have a multiracial government in place, and "they have to make clear what their rules are for investment and capital."
"There are a lot of other countries around the world that are very supportive and offer incentives," Mr. Smyth said, noting that two months after visiting Johannesburg the company spent $300 million acquiring a food company in New Zealand. "A place like South Africa has to compete with the whole world, and take its chances when it can."

HEADLINE: Clinton Adds Visit From Russian Official on Aid

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
In an effort to support President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and his democratic reform movement, President Clinton is to meet with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia in Washington next week, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today.
The meeting comes as the Administration is struggling, in the absence of major new financing, to put together a package of small-scale incentives to promote Russia's economic and political reform movement before the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, on April 3 and 4. 
 The meeting with Mr. Kozyrev, Mr. Christopher said, will be an opportunity to make final preparations for the summit talks as well as "a reflection of the President's support for him and President Yeltsin's Government." Mr. Kozyrev will meet with Mr. Clinton on Tuesday.
Mr. Clinton is likely to announce details of the aid package and to explain why it is necessary in an address to the American people, White House officials said.
At a breakfast meeting with newspaper reporters, Mr. Christopher seemed torn between his desire to stress the positive aspects of Russia's reform movement and his inclination to make realistic judgments.
Mr. Christopher acknowledged that perhaps the United States had taken too rosy a view of Russia's capacity for democratic reform. But, he added, "we need to work hard to keep them cooperating and moving in the direction that will enable us to reduce our defense budget."
Asked whether American policy toward Russia is too dependent on the survival of Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Christopher said, "The situation there certainly does cause one to think about that question." But he reiterated that the Russian leader is the "only freely elected leader in that country," and that others are "only pretenders compared to the legitimacy that he has."
Mr. Clinton's participation in next week's meeting illustrates a broad-based feeling in the Administration that it has to take advantage of every opportunity to help the beleaguered Russian President.
Mr. Christopher acknowledged that there were problems in dispensing the $400 million already committed by Congress for the dismantling of nuclear weapons in Russia and the other three nuclear republics. "This is a basis for disappointment," he said, adding that a combination of factors was to blame, including "perhaps not enough intensity from our side and rather complex decision-making on their side."
On a related issue, Lawrence H. Summers, the Under Secretary-designate of the Treasury for International Affairs, told Congress today that Russia was "perilously close to hyperinflation," adding that that unless Russia's leaders brought down inflation, its democracy might not survive.
Speaking at his confirmation hearing, Mr. Summers said he was optimistic that the Group of Seven major industrial democracies would provide additional aid to Russia over the next few months. "The task of rebuilding the Russian economy is the greatest economic restructuring job since the Marshall Plan," he said.
In Paris, President Francois Mitterrand has proposed that an emergency summit meeting of the Group of Seven nations to discuss economic aid to Russia be held when Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin meet in Vancouver.
French Government officials said Mr. Mitterrand discussed the idea in a telephone conversation Wednesday with Mr. Clinton. White House officials said the President preferred a Japanese idea for a meeting at the ministerial level in April.
Asked today about his conversation with Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Clinton said, "He thinks we ought to do more and so do I."
Japan, which currently chairs the group and is preparing a previously scheduled summit conference in Tokyo in July, has proposed the lower-level alternative because it wants to keep the focus on the session for which it is the host. Hisashi Owada, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, met with senior officials in Washington to try to head off the possibility of an early Group of Seven summit.

HEADLINE: Doctors' Investments in Home Care Grow, Raising Fears of Ethical Swamp

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Along with a national boom in home medical treatments has come a surge in doctors' investments in companies that provide equipment and medication for such care, raising concerns among medical leaders and government officials about a vast potential for conflicts of interest.
The surge in doctors' investments in home health services coincides with growing Federal and state efforts to ban similar medical investments like clinical laboratories, which critics say drive up the cost of care. 
 But regulatory officials are only now turning their attention to financial ties between doctors and companies in the growing field of home health care, which offers procedures once confined to the hospital, like intravenous drug and nutrition treatments.
The Federal Government is investigating whether some home-care companies and doctors have violated conflict-of-interest rules governing Medicare and Medicaid patients.
And the American Medical Association, which has condemned other kinds of investments by doctors who refer patients, has opened an inquiry into the financial ties between doctors and home-care companies.
 
Rapidly Growing Practice
 No one knows how many doctors have financial ties to the providers of home health care, but while the number appears small there is strong evidence that it is growing rapidly. One of the largest companies, T<2> Medical Inc. of Alpharetta, Ga., disclosed last year that the number of doctors involved in companies it owned or managed was about 2,200 nationwide, up from 650 as recently as 1988.
A study being conducted by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services found evidence that 25 percent of the companies that offer intravenous drug and nutrition treatments in the home to Medicare and Medicaid patients have doctors as investors, said a Federal official involved with the report.
Officials of home-health companies and participating doctors insist that the financial ties do not lead to unnecessary procedures or overcharges. But critics sharply disagree.
"The reason the home-care companies want these relationships with doctors is because the patient goes with it," said Dr. Jean Mitchell, a health economist at Georgetown University who helped write a major study in Florida on investments and referrals by doctors. "That way they have a lock on the referral, and when you have a lock on the system, you can charge higher prices and not worry about service."
The Clinton Administration supports a broad ban on doctors' investing in services to which they refer Medicare or Medicaid patients. A bill now in Congress proposes such a ban and would extend it to private patients as well.
 
Federal Inquiry Under Way
 Most of the investments by doctors in home-care companies are legal. They often take the form of joint ventures in which a company arranges for a group of doctors to form a local business that is managed by the national company. But Federal authorities are investigating two of the largest home-health-care companies to see whether they have violated Government conflict-of-interest rules involving Medicare and Medicaid patients.
Even when legal, the doctors' investments are often unusual because they are open only to physicians, who are virtually guaranteed handsome returns since the patients they refer bring in steady revenue. The cost of some services, like the nutritional feeding of AIDS patients intravenously, can run as high as $2,500 a week.
The home-care companies say doctor-owners of a company can better control the quality of a patient's care at home. Moreover, they note that insurers pay doctors for visiting hospitalized patients, they do not pay for supervising a patient's care at home, so the doctors deserve extra compensation.
"I do not feel that there is a conflict involved in these investments because I treat my patients according to how I feel ethically, not financially," said Dr. Richard Friedman, a gastroenterologist in Atlanta who until recently was an investor in a doctor-owned home-care company managed by T<2> Medical.
Federal and state laws regarding what are known in the profession as "physician self-referrals" are changing. In 1989, the Federal Government barred doctors from owning stakes in clinical laboratories that saw Medicare or Medicaid patients. Last year, a few states, including New York and Florida, banned doctors' investments in some patient services, including clinical labs and diagnostic X-ray and imaging centers. Illinois passed a broader ban on doctors' investments in services to which they refer patients.
The Department of Health and Human Resources also issued rules in 1991 to limit doctors' investments in a wide array of medical services used by Medicare and Medicaid patients. But the large national home-care companies have tried to structure their joint ventures with doctors so that they involve only patients whose care is not paid for by Medicare or Medicaid.
 
Kickback Scheme Investigation
 For the last 18 months, the Inspector General for Health and Human Services has been investigating the incentives offered to doctors by T<2> Medical and another of the largest home-health services, Caremark International Inc. of Northbrook, Ill. The inquiry seeks to determine if they violated the Federal law against paying doctors to induce referrals of Medicare or Medicaid patients. In June, a Federal grand jury in Atlanta took up the investigation of T<2> Medical.
The companies have denied any wrongdoing. The Inspector General's office declined to comment.
Much of the future growth in physician self-referrals may depend on how the American Medical Association resolves an internal debate over the issue. In December 1992, the organization ruled that most physician self-referrals were unethical. But home-health-care companies have contended that they qualify for an exemption that permits doctor referrals to a service from which the doctors benefit if the service is a "direct extension" of their practices.
Dr. Randall Moore, the medical director of Caremark International, said that while a doctor may not visit a patient at home, the doctor is often directing treatment by telephone. "Whether or not the physician is there to lay their hands on the patient is not the issue," Dr. Moore said. "If laying your hands is not essential to the procedure then that should not make a difference."
 
A.M.A. Looking Into Ties
 Kirk Johnson, a lawyer for the A.M.A, said the exemption is supposed to cover cases in which a doctor actually sees a patient, but the organization believes that doctors should be compensated in some way for extensive telephone supervision of home patients.
He said that the A.M.A was opposed to investment plans in which doctors get large returns with little money at risk. To clarify its policy, the A.M.A. started an inquiry in January into the financial ties between doctors and the home-health-care industry.
The debate over home health care comes amid sharp growth in the industry. Sales of drug and nutrition treatments that are administered by patients to themselves or by nurses using intravenous pumps or other devices, called home-infusion therapies, reached $3.1 billion last year, a 19 percent increase over 1991.
Some company officials said they felt compelled by competitors to offer doctors financial incentives. "It is done in a defensive mode," said Donald Millard, vice president for finance of Healthdyne Inc. of Marietta, Ga., which also offers doctors joint ventures.
T<2> Medical, which was founded in 1984, has based its entire strategy on financial alliances with doctors. It recruits about 15 doctors in an area and helps them set up their own home- health-care company, to which the doctors then refer their patients. T<2> Medical manages the business and gets about 24 percent of the profits. The doctors keep the rest.
"We think it is an innovative approach to health-cost containment," said Jeffrey Muir, the company's vice president and general counsel. "The physicians who own companies actively control and manage them."
T<2> Medical gets a one-time fee of $50,000 to set up a doctor-owned company. The doctors each put up $100 in cash and guarantee $15,000 more if needed in order to become shareholders in the joint venture. The doctors seldom have to put up any additional money, as the start-up costs are often quickly paid off by the fees for services.
The doctor-investors can make anywhere from a few thousand dollars to more than $20,000 annually. They can also reap windfall profits when T<2> Medical buys out the units, as it often does.
Dr. Friedman of Atlanta said he and fellow physician-investors each received 5,000 shares of T<2> Medical stock when they were bought out after about three years. That stock is now worth, $100,000 though at one point last year it was worth $338,750.
While Dr. Friedman said he saw nothing wrong with such arrangements, other doctors have rejected entreaties from T<2> Medical.
"I don't like to think that greed in the marketplace was that strong but I guess I was wrong," said Dr. Bruce Feinberg, an oncologist in Atlanta. "It is also one thing when an investor is willing to take a risk but there is no risk here."
The companies also have more traditional means of compensating doctors. Caremark, for example, pays weekly stipends of up to $150 to a doctor for supervising a patient.
Dr. Moore of Caremark acknowledged that the stipends are included in patient bills. He and officials at other companies insisted that charges for their services were a bargain because hospital procedures for the same services were 20 to 50 percent higher.
But Henry M. Weinert, president of Boston Biomedical Consultants Inc., a consulting company in Boston, said such comparisons were hollow because charges for home health care were often far above their true cost.
In 1991, a study by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs found that home-care companies charged up to $9,000 for a month's supply of an intravenous food supplement that cost $1,300.
Dr. Moore called the New York City study misleading because it did not reflect company costs like nursing, delivery and administrative services. But some groups, like health maintenance organizations, have won lower rates recently for home health care.
Still, critics of physician self-referrals said that the problems associated with the practice will not abate until the Federal Government bans it. "Providing doctors these kinds of financial incentives is wrong" said Dr. Mitchell of Georgetown University. "We can't afford these kinds of abuses any more."

HEADLINE: Eluding Trade Embargo, a Vessel Delivers Gasoline to Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
A ship carrying a huge supply of gasoline has evaded the Western ban on trade with Yugoslavia and delivered its cargo to the Adriatic port of Bar, Clinton Administration officials said today.
The delivery of what is believed to be 50,000 metric tons of gasoline, or about 400,000 barrels, undercuts the Western effort to use economic sanctions to stop the Serbs fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 "Just when we are trying to ratchet up pressure on the Serbs, this comes along," a Western official said. "It is not a good development."
American officials say the ship was owned by a Greek company called Tsakos and then sold to a concern called Bellingham, which is based in Liberia and which the officials suspect may be a front company. Washington says Greece has promised to investigate the matter.
 
Warships Enforce Ban
 The delivery is one of the most serious violations of the United Nations trade ban on Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics that together make Yugoslavia. It comes as Washington and its allies are trying to persuade the Serbs to sign a peace agreement and stop their attacks on the Bosnians.
With the Clinton Administration shelving threats of military action to slow the killing in Bosnia, the sanctions have become the Administration's main means of inducing the Serbs to seek an agreement.
To enforce the embargo, a flotilla of ships from NATO and the Western European Union has been patrolling the Adriatic. But the delivery of the gasoline to Bar in Montenegro raises questions about the effectiveness of the Western effort.
Ideas of how significant the shipment is to the economy of Yugoslavia vary, depending on estimates of consumption. One American official said the shipment represented three weeks' supply for Yugoslavia, but another said it might be enough to keep the economy running for several months.
 
Under Various Names
 The episode began when the ship, sailing under the Liberian flag, left Pylos, Greece, officials said. They said the ship has used various names, including the East River and the Penelope.
The ship steamed into the Adriatic, where she was challenged by a Spanish warship, the Cataluna, which was enforcing the trade sanctions. The vessel radioed that she was carrying a cargo to Venice, but added that she had encountered mechanical problems and that a crew member had been injured in an accident.
The Spanish warship directed the ship to an anchorage near Durres, Albania, but instead she proceeded to Bar, where she unloaded the gasoline.
The United States has asked Liberia to strip the ship of its registration, and Western warships are expected to seize her after she leaves Bar. But the damage has been done.
This is not the first time that ships have eluded the Western blockade by reporting mechanical problems. In January, a Greek-owned vessel called the Dimitrakis reached Bar after the captain falsely declared that he was making an emergency stop for repairs.
The episode is acutely embarrassing for NATO and the Western European Union. At NATO headquarters, the United States asked its allies on Wednesday to review the procedures for enforcing the embargo to prevent a repetition, diplomats said.
 
Greeks Promise Crackdown
 Greece has promised to crack down on ships violating the embargo. A prosecutor in Salonika, Greece, recently filed criminal charges against two Russian-flag ships, the Dnieper I and the Dnieper II, charging that they arrived with a falsified transit document indicating that they were carrying a Hungarian cargo. In fact, Greek officials said, they were carrying iron loaded in Serbia.
 
Dominican Ship Detained
 Greek officials also say that a Dominican-flag ship, the Rosario, has been detained by port officials in Salonika for possible violations of the embargo.
But the delivery of gasoline to Bar shows that sanctions breaking is still a serious problem for the West.
The Clinton Administration is planning to bar non-Yugoslav companies like shipping concerns that repeatedly violate the embargo from doing business with the United States, but has not yet done so.

HEADLINE: Black-Cuban Rift Extends to Florida Law School

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 18

 BODY:
With Janet Reno gone to Washington to be Attorney General, black and Hispanic lawyers and officials here are competing to dominate Dade County's legal apparatus while quarreling over the location and control of a new state-financed law school.
Gov. Lawton Chiles dismayed some blacks but delighted Cuban-Americans in Miami last Friday when he appointed Katherine Fernandez Rundle, 42, a 16-year veteran of the prosecutor's office, to succeed Ms. Reno as the State Attorney in Dade County, which includes Miami. 
 Frustrated that one of their own was not named to that post, blacks are redoubling efforts to establish the new law school at a black university upstate rather than at one here dominated by Cuban-Americans and recent Latin American immigrants.
The issues are linked, said H. T. Smith, a black lawyer in Miami, because both are "an indication of the turf wars that will have to be fought between blacks and Hispanics for each of us to get a fair share of the pie and of the power."
 
A History of Exclusion
 In both cases, he said, blacks are trying to redress a history of exclusion from the legal system but face competing demands from Hispanic immigrants who began arriving here 30 years ago and who now dominate Dade County's political and economic life. The Hispanic share of the county's population is slightly more than 50 percent; blacks make up just over 20 percent.
Black lawyers and politicians had favored Judge Ralph N. Person of Dade County Circuit Court, who is also is a former assistant United States Attorney, to succeed Ms. Reno.Greg Samms, president of the Black Lawyers Association here, told a local legal publication that black males have historically been victimized by the criminal justice system, and that it is important to have someone at the top who is sensitive to that.
Having failed to place a black official in the job, blacks are now urging Ms. Fernandez Rundle to demonstrate a "commitment to diversity" by naming blacks to senior administrative and prosecutorial jobs in her office. They say they will also be monitoring her treatment of black defendants and how grand jury proceedings are conducted.
"You can only have one protegee," and Ms. Fernandez Rundle was clearly Ms. Reno's favorite, said George Knox, a former Miami City Attorney who is black. What is important now, he added, is that the new State Attorney "look for talented black lawyers" and give them positions of responsibility so that "they will be contenders for the position in the event she moves up or moves on."
Ms. Reno often assigned black lawyers to important cases but did not have any blacks in her inner circle. There have been suggestions that Ms. Fernandez Rundle carries a heavier burden on racial issues because of her Hispanic background. She did not respond to requests for an interview.
"She is a Cuban-American, and relations between Cubans and blacks in Dade County have been strained at best and outright hostile at worst," Mr. Smith said. While he said he thought Ms. Fernandez Rundle would be fair, he added that "the mass of black folks are skeptical about having a Cuban-American as chief prosecutor, coupled with the fact there is nobody black at her left or right hand."
 
Election Next Year
 If Ms. Fernandez Rundle is to serve the rest of Ms. Reno's four-year term, she must win a general election next year. Black lawyers said that their scrutiny of Ms. Fernandez Rundle's performance would be intense, but that she would probably face black opposition no matter what she did.
"The black community will definitely have some input on candidates in the State Attorney's election," said Gary Siplin, a lawyer who is also president of the New Miami Group, which seeks to encourage black leadership in government. "She'll have some other candidates running against her. Blacks have matured in this county and can show some muscle, and that's what we're going to do."
Mr. Siplin said blacks would also continue trying to insure that a new state-supported law school be established at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, a predominantly black institution, rather than Florida International University here. The state already has two law schools at public universities in Tallahassee and Gainesville, but is willing to set up a third to attract minority students if the Legislature can agree on a site.
"The important thing we have to realize is that we have two large minority groups in Florida that are underrepresented in every area of the legal field, from judges to lawyers to law students," said State Senator Mario Diaz-Balart, who favors placing the new law school in Miami. "The bottom line is that we need to do what is right for both groups, and that is to put the school where the population is and where the minorities are."
 
Minority Status Questioned
 Some black lawyers and elected officials contend that Cuban-Americans in Miami are not a true minorityand should therefore not receive any preferential treatment. Mr. Smith said Cubans are really "white people whose native language is Spanish."
Other blacks have said that Cuban-Americans should be disqualified because they have higher income levels than other minorities.
Hispanic lawyers say those statements are unfair. "We have a tremendous number of minorities, Hispanic students as well as blacks, who cannot afford to attend a private law school or to travel to a place far from home," said Tony Marin, president of the Cuban-American Bar Association. "There are Cubans, Nicaraguans and Colombians from working-class backgrounds who should not have to put their families through severe hardship to get through school."

HEADLINE: Sheik Emerges on TV to Deny Link to Bombing

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, ending more than two weeks of silence about reports linking him to the bombing of the World Trade Center, began a media offensive yesterday denying any involvement in the attack and condemning the media for reporting that he is a suspect in the case.
In a somewhat bizarre twist, the sheik emerged on live television before millions of Americans, ending the mystery of his whereabouts since the bombing and speaking out on the arrest of several suspects who have been portrayed as his followers. 
 In rapid succession, the blind, 55-year-old cleric, whom the United States Government is trying to deport, gave interviews in Los Angeles to Al-Hayat, an Arabic daily based in London, as well as ABC's Prime Time Live and CNN. Previously, as attention had grown about him, his incendiary sermons and his possible involvement in the bombing, the sheik had issued denials of any involvement only through his spokesmen.
In his interview today on CNN, Mr. Abdel Rahman said that he had not been interviewed by any law-enforcement authorities about the World Trade Center investigation. He acknowledged that he had been questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation "before" about his connections with El Sayyid A. Nosair, who was convicted of crimes associated with the killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane in 1990. But he did not indicate when the questioning took place.
Mr. Abdel Rahman gave the spate of interviews as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo led the first group of tenants back into one of the twin towers since the Feb. 26 bombing, which killed 6, injured 1,000 and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
In the investigation, Federal agents were said to have traced several new bank accounts linked to one of the arrested suspects, one of them to a doctor in Germany.
 
Denies Knowing 4 Suspects
 Answering questions through an interpreter, Mr. Abdel Rahman denied knowing the three men arrested in the bombing, as well as a fourth suspect still at large. He left open the possibility that they might have prayed in his mosque.
"I came here and I stand in this arena, not because I've been accused, so I defend myself," he said to CNN. "But I accuse the American mass media of being controlled and racist. And they look for falsifications. They showed my picture hundreds of times accusing me of being a terrorist and to reach, to accuse, Islam through that with terrorism."
Continuing, he asked why the media was connecting "the religious figures of Muslims and the mosques and the Islamic centers and Islam as a whole with those who claim to be Muslims?" The sheik also denied knowing Mahmud Abouhalima, the fourth suspect. The New York Times reported yesterday that Mr. Abouhalima, a German national of Egyptian birth, had been the sheik's driver and personal assistant for many months, according to a Brooklyn man who knew both men.
"I don't know him and I don't know where he is," the sheik said on CNN. I never had a car so he couldn't have driven it for me."
Asked whether his fiery, anti-American messages had inspired violence, he said in front of the cameras on ABC's Prime Time Live: "I did not encourage, I did not know, and I had no relation to this."
 
Mubarak 'Deserves' Killing
 But in a sharp contrast in substance and tone, he applauded the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt in 1981, and said that President Hosni Mubarak, the current leader, "deserves the same thing."
He added, in fact, that his mission in the United States was to confront Mr. Mubarak's regime.
The sheik was tried but acquitted of direct involvement in the assassination of President Sadat. Despite being placed on the State Department's "watch list" and being barred from entry along with a million others, he was granted a tourist visa to the United States in 1990 by mistake. The State Department has admitted that it erred because the sheik's name and other information were not spelled correctly at the consulate where he applied. In a second mistake, the Immigration and Naturalization Service granted him permanent residency status in April 1991 as a religious leader. The agency revoked it in March 1992.
On Wednesday, a Federal immigration judge in Newark denied Mr. Abdel Rahman's asylum appeal and ordered him deported. His lawyer said he would appeal further.
Once a foreigner enters the United States with permission, if his background is then challenged, he is entitled to a full array of hearings and appeals, as the sheik is now pursuing, which would let the person remain in the country for years, even if the original permission was in error. The F.B.I. has said that it is not seeking to arrest Mr. Abdel Rahman or even to question him.
Since his arrival in the United States, Mr. Abdel Rahman has regularly preached at the Abu Bakr mosque in Brooklyn and the Al-Salaam mosque in Jersey City. But dissension has always followed him.
While his revolutionary interpretation of Islam has won him converts among many poor, young Muslims, many who have recently immigrated to the United States, his radical preaching has alienated many older, more traditional Muslims, who do not consider mosques the appropriate venue for such militant calls for upheaval.
 
Falling Out, and Murder
 When Mr. Abdel Rahman first came to America, he was helped by many other immigrants, among them Mustafa Shalabi, an electrical contractor from Egypt, according to Muslims in Brooklyn. Together, the two men raised money to help the mujahedeen fighters wage war against the Soviet invaders in Afghanistan. Acquaintances in Brooklyn said the two had a falling out. In March 1990, Mr. Shalabi was killed.
After the World Trade Center bombing, the police reopened their investigation into his shooting and stabbing.
The sheik has always refused to talk about Mr. Shalabi. On one occasion, he told an interviewer, "I did not know the man."
In the investigation yesterday, a law-enforcement official said that Federal agents were tracing a number of additional bank accounts, beyond those already reported, linked to one of the men arrested in the bombing, Mohammed A. Salameh. The accounts were said to total thousands of dollars. Officials earlier said that they had identified a joint account that Mr. Salameh kept with a second arrested suspect, Nidal A. Ayyad, and at least two individual accounts kept by Mr. Salameh.
In one of the previously identified individual accounts of Mr. Salameh at a National Westminster Bank in Jersey City, investigators have now traced the source of one deposit of $2,420.87, wired to the account nine days before the Feb. 26 bombing, to a doctor in Germany, the official said. He would not provide further details but said the sender of the money had been traced by German authorities, who then advised the F.B.I.
Mr. Salameh's lawyer, Robert E. Precht, has said that relatives of Mr. Salameh wired him money from Germany, but investigators said they had not yet verified the relationship of the senders to the arrested suspect.
 
Not Sure of Escape Route
 The law-enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said that the authorities had not yet identified two men who may have accompanied Mahmud Abouhalima, a possible ringleader of the bombing plot, as he fled the United States from Kennedy International Airport shortly after the blast. Mr. Abouhalima is believed to have fled to Pakistan, but the official said investigators were not sure of the route he had taken or whether the two other men accompanied him or went elsewhere.
To aid their investigation of the bombing site in an underground garage, experts are using a duplicate of the yellow Ford Econoline van that Mr. Salameh leased from a Ryder rental dealer, and are trying to match pieces of metal extracted from the wreckage.
No timing device or fuse has yet been found but tons of rubble remain to be sifted, and every time a big truck rumbles by outside, new debris is shaken loose from the crater and rains down on workers.
 
No Bail for Elgabrowny
 In a separate action yesterday, Judge John E. Sprizzo of Federal District Court in Manhattan declined to set bail for Ibraham Elgabrowny, a 42-year-old Egyptian-born civil engineer whose Brooklyn apartment was listed as the address of Mr. Salameh on his application for a New York State driver's license.
Mr. Elgabrowny was indicted on Wednesday on charges of obstructing justice by elbowing investigators who were searching his Brooklyn apartment after the bombing, and possession of fraudulent Nicaraguan passports, birth certificates and drivers licenses in the name of El Sayyid A. Nosair. Mr. Elgabrowny is a relative of Mr. Nosair.
His defense lawyer, William Kunstler, argued that there was no evidence linking Mr. Elgabrowny to the bombing and that the court did not have jurisdiction. He also accused prosecutors of persecuting Mr. Elgabrowny in an effort to fabricate a "a mammoth Islamic conspiracy."
Judge Sprizzo said there was not enough new information to overturn the decision and told Mr. Kunstler to appeal to the Second Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
 
Attacks Media in Media
 In all his interviews yesterday, the sheik used the media to attack the media for making what he called false aspersions about him and Islam. But he reserved his most extensive and nuanced remarks for his interview with Al-Hayat, the Arabic daily, which is owned by a Saudi prince.
Interviewed by Al-Hayat, the sheik supported the spate of attacks on Egypt's security forces, its tourist industry and foreign investment there, and on any civilian, Muslim or Christian, who opposes Islamic principles.
In Cairo yesterday, the Egyptian Government confiscated the estimated 3,000 copies of Al-Hayat that are sold daily in the Egyptian capital.
The Government offered no explanation, but Egyptian officials said privately that they feared that the sheik's remarks would further inflame tensions between the Government and Islamic militants.
Mr. Abdel Rahman told Al-Hayat, according to Mideast Mirror, a London-based news and translation service, that while he did not "accept American laws," he abided by them for two reasons. First, he explained, he obeyed American law because the United States had accepted him as an immigrant. And secondly, he abided by the law because it was practical.
"I need a land from which I can confront the regime," he said, referring to Egypt, his native land. "I would never do anything that might deny me that freedom."
Asked specifically by Al-Hayat whether he condoned the attacks on Egypt's police, Mr. Abdel Rahman answered: "The argument that the police are people following orders and do not deserve to be killed is unacceptable. Every man is responsible for his deeds. The police are one integrated unit, which justifies attacks on any part of that unit."
Mr. Abdel Rahman denied that he led or was a prominent figure in the Islamic Group, or any other Islamic organization in the United States. There is no Islamic Group in the United States nor in Egypt, he asserted. Those who are conducting raids in Egypt, he told Al-Hayat, are simply "young people who value their faith and defend their rights."
In all three interviews, the sheik denied receiving financial support directly or indirectly from Iran, which the United States accuses of supporting international terrorism. Vincent M Cannistraro, a former counterterrorism specialist for the Central Intelligence Agency who left the Government in 1990, said that American officials had "good evidence" that the sheik was getting money from Iran, at least since 1989.
One of the World Trade Center's original tenants, Fiduciary Trust Company, and two currency trading companies -- Eurobank, and Harlow Meyer & Savage -- are the first tenants after Governor Cuomo to start moving office equipment into Tower 2 since the Feb. 26 blast.
Fiduciary started moving office equipment back to the 94th, 95th, 96th and 97th floors of their Twin Tower office spaces at 8 P.M. yesterday. By 6 A.M., three weeks after the explosion, Fiduciary expected to have its office ready to start the day with its full force of over 500 workers.

HEADLINE: Top Bank in Canada Adds Trustco

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 18

 BODY:
The Royal Bank of Canada, Canada's largest bank, will acquire most of the assets of Royal Trustco Ltd., the nation's second-largest trust company, for $1.65 billion (Canadian), according to an agreement in principle announced today.
If the transaction, which is still subject to approval of stockholders and regulatory agencies, is finally consummated, it would create the fourth-largest bank in North America after Citicorp, the BankAmerica Corporation and the Chemical Banking Corporation. 
 The 101-year-old Royal Trustco is now controlled by the Edper-Bronfman empire, Canada's largest conglomerate, which has recently suffered a series of financial reverses. Today's announcement represents the third major disposal of prized Edper assets within the past two months as the group seeks to redress its position.
In February, Edper sold controlling stakes in John Labatt Ltd., Canada's second-largest brewery after Molson Breweries, and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., the leading forest products company to raise nearly $2 billion.
 
Real Estate Loan Troubles
 Royal Trustco, which is 47.5 percent owned by the Trilon Financial Corporation, a key Edper holding company, has been hit by sour real estate loans made in Canada, Britain and the United States over the last decade and has been on the auction block for some months.
Royal Trustco today provided some indication of the extent of its own financial problems by announcing a preliminary 1992 loss in the range of $850 million to $900 million (Canadian), compared with net income of $107 million in 1991. A Canadian dollar is worth about 80 American cents.
The Royal Bank is taking on Royal Trustco's stronger assets -- international and Canadian trust subsidiaries, including 146 Royal Trust branches in Canada. Royal Trustco will retain the weaker assets -- $4.3 billion in loans made in Canada, the United States and Britian. The company says 76 percent of those loans are performing.
The trust operations administers $124 billion in client assets, mutal fund assets and other funds. They represent the real payoff for Royal Bank. Financial reform legislation that took effect last June allows banks to take advantage of operations in the lucrative trust business.
Royal Bank is also acquiring $34 billion in deposits, residential and commercial mortgages and credit card loans and $950 million in larger domestic commercial loans and internatinal loans.
 
'Tremendous Opportunities' Seen
 Allan R. Taylor, chairman and chief executive officer of the Royal Bank, said the agreement "creates tremendous opportunities" for his institution and "would place us in a strong leadership position in a number of key businesses with above average, long-term growth and profit potential."
Royal Bank's assets, currently $137 billion (Canadian), would rise another $14 billion, or 10 percent.
James Miller, Royal Trustco president, said his company's depositors and clients "can be assurted that they'll be secure with this transaction. It's joining us with the financial strength of Canada's largest and strongest financial institution."
Royal Bank would pay cash. It expects to raise some of the money through the issuance of non-cumulative preferred shares.
Moody's Investor Service, the New York debt-rating agency, did not see the sale in the same light as the two chief executives. It said today it was placing $2.5 billion of in Royal Bank long-term debt under review for possible downgrade.
The review will entail a look at the risks of the transaction. Moody's said the quality of the bank's loans "continues to be challenged" by tough economic conditions in Canada.
Once the deal is consummated, Royal Trusco will be renamed and will focus on collecting outstanding loans, according to Mr. Miller.

HEADLINE: Fervor for French Rightist Doesn't Show in Polls

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 18

 BODY:
As soon as the first bars of the Slaves' Chorus from Verdi's "Nabucco" boomed out, the 3,000 or so people in the indoor stadium jumped to their feet on cue, turning toward a moving spotlight and wildly cheering the heavily built man who came marching in to address them.
By the time the chorus reached its stirring climax, Jean-Marie Le Pen was on the stage, dressed immaculately in a double-breasted suit, punching the air with his fists and savoring the chants of "Le Pen, President." Behind him, three huge screens showed a televised close-up of his triumphant smile. 
 Mr. Le Pen's meetings are probably as close as French politics ever come to American party conventions, not only because of their orchestrated show-biz atmosphere, but also because the audience is always made up of true believers, in this case supporters of his far-right National Front.
At his final meeting before the parliamentary elections on Sunday, though, there was an unusual tone of defensiveness in his voice. The crowd was as enthusiastic as ever. But for the first time since he raised his anti-immigrant banner in 1974, nationwide support for his party may be flagging.
Having won 14 percent of votes in regional elections one year ago, polls now say National Front candidates will receive only 11 to 12 percent in the first round of balloting on Sunday. And after the runoff election on March 28, the party may control just one seat in the 577-member Parliament. Mr. Le Pen himself is expected to lose in the runoff in his district in Nice.
"People say we're stagnating, but we're going to do better than they think," Mr. Pen, a 64-year-old former army officer, insisted, talking through microphones attached to his jacket as he prowled the stage. "For us the battle won't end this month. It will only end when there is a policy in place to save France."
The threat, he said, echoing his perennial theme, comes from the three million or so third-world immigrants who are slowly "conquering" France. "By the year 2000, the majority of the population of Paris will be foreign!" he shouted, prompting an immediate chant of "France for the French!"
"We see an ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia but we don't see that the same conditions exist here," he went on. "Ethnic cleansing is already taking place in the suburbs where native French are being forced by immigration to take their children out of school, to move out of their neighborhoods."
His party's platform includes 99 measures to combat immigration, to cut welfare for immigrants and to force unemployed foreigners to return home. In his speech, though, Mr. Le Pen focused only on his demand for "national preference" -- that employers give jobs to French before foreigners.
 
Not a Major Campaign Issue
 With three million people unemployed here, this is a view shared by many French. Indeed, with National Front candidates expected to win 25 percent of more of the vote in districts with high concentrations of Arab and African immigrants, it is apparent that immigration continues to stir deep concern.
Yet, to Mr. Le Pen's dismay, it has not been a major issue in the current campaign, partly because France now seems more obsessed by its economic crisis, but also because the conservative coalition favored to sweep the Socialist Government out of office has itself taken a tough line on immigration.
Along with clamping down on clandestine immigration, the Union for France coalition has promised to end family reunification, a program that allows 100,000 wives and children of immigrant men to enter the country each year and that in effect turns "temporary" workers into permanent residents.
Mr. Le Pen can also no longer claim to be the sole defender of France's identity against what he calls "Euro-mondialism." Although he fought against French ratification of a treaty on European union last September, conservative nationalists also did so, successfully stealing the limelight from him.
Further, some political experts believe that the violence against foreigners in Germany may have put some French voters off the National Front, despite its efforts to keep skinheads and the like out of its ranks and to present itself as a respectable "true French" movement.
 
'So Where Can We Go?'
 Yet the well-dressed middle-class crowd that filled the Coubertin Stadium here on Wednesday evening suggested that Mr. Le Pen remains assured of a constituency as long as immigration is seen as a threat, if not to the nation, at least to those living in suburbs with large immigrant populations.
"You should see where we live," said Therese Richmond, a 76-year-old woman who came to hear Mr. Le Pen. "Our building was meant to be reserved for those wounded in the war, but it's now filled with Algerians, Turks, black. So where can we go?"
Young people were also present. "Immigration brings crime, drugs, moral decadence," Sebastian Mercier, an 18-year-old student from the Montreuil suburb of Paris, said. Helene Meurisse, who is 20 years old, added, "I am a bit tired of being the only white person on the bus in the morning."
Brought together more by fear than ideology, then, many in the crowd still seemed ready to embrace Mr. Le Pen as the only man who could save them. "Everything he is accused of is false," Mrs. Richmond said of her hero. "He's not xenophobic, he's not racist. He represents France for us."

Free Europe's Entreaty: Don't Tune Us Out Now

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany

 BODY:
News that the Clinton Administration was considering a shutdown of the United States Government-financed Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty stations here in 1995 has set off an avalanche of protest from all over Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Listeners say they want to know why President Clinton would want to pull the plug on American support for the forces of democracy and free enterprise now, with the struggle in its most intense phase? 
 "I hope there is an opportunity to change your decision or at least postpone it until democracy and stability in Latvia is no longer in doubt," Anatolijs Gorbunovs, the chairman of the Baltic republic's Parliament, wrote to Mr. Clinton on March 5, explaining that he was among the 21 percent of the country's population that listened to Radio Free Europe's Latvian broadcasts.
"I hope the electorate in Latvia does not feel that the United States is no longer concerned whether freedom, democracy and the right to self-determination flourish in this part of the world," Mr. Gorbunovs wrote.
 
A Budget of $211 Million
 Since Mr. Clinton has called for a special summit meeting of the Group of Seven industrial democracies to see what more they can do to support democracy and the transition to a market economy in Russia, the station's American managers hope that the Administration will find other, more effective ways to cut the Federal budget deficit than by eliminating the radio services, whose budget last year was $211 million.
"It's a combination of money, a sort of neo-isolationist mood in the United States and a perception that Eastern Europe is now free, so who needs Radio Free Europe?" said Gene Pell, the president of the nonprofit private corporation that runs the radio services under the oversight of the Presidentially appointed Board for International Broadcasting.
With a staff of 1,542, down from 1,809 at the end of 1989, and 57 transmitters in six locations, Mr. Pell said, the broadcasters had closed five Western European bureaus and cut back shortwave transmissions as it became possible to operate more freely inside the countries.
"I believe there are other savings that can be achieved," he said.
Senator Russell Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, has already introduced a bill to consolidate the radio services under the Voice of America, arguing that the stations were never intended to support struggling democracies and that the V.O.A. could do that better if it has to be done at all.
Mr. Pell and his management team hope that support for this argument will wane once legislators and the Administration focus on what the radio services actually do. This, they argue, is helping build the foundations of democracy by broadcasting to the formerly Communist countries in their own languages about what is happening there. They argue that three years after the collapse of Communism, few indigenous Eastern European newspapers or broadcasters are yet able to meet the need.
One of the stations' biggest supporters has been Vaclav Havel, the Czech President, who wrote in January that the kind of reporting Radio Free Europe did on his country was still vital.
"The wide perspective and personality of its editors, even in the future, will help our people free themselves from their own problems, and the useful distance of the reporters will help their objective improvement," he wrote to the stations. "Unfortunately, these attributes are often missing in our domestic media."
Mr. Pell said the oversight board had also proposed to the Administration that Radio Free Europe, which all during the cold war never broadcast to Yugoslavia because it was independent from Moscow, should start doing so now, within existing budget authority, if it got the go-ahead.
"We could bring Serbs and Croats together to talk about how we could end the conflict," he said.
 
'Absolutely Must Listening'
 The assertion that the Voice of America, which broadcasts to the rest of the world about life in the United States, could take over its tasks is vigorously disputed here.
Radio Free Europe was set up in 1951 with clandestine support from the Central Intelligence Agency, as was Radio Liberty, and for years, staffs of emigres from Poland, Hungary, Russia, Ukraine and other Communist countries broadcast to those countries all the news the Communist authorities thought subversive -- dissident activities, news about human rights groups, and the like.
In Moscow and St. Petersburg alone, recent surveys done for the station have shown they have about 178,000 and 103,000 regular listeners each weekday, comparable to the audience for Russian domestic public affairs stations, with 4.4 million to 6.6 million estimated regular listeners throughout its broadcast area.
"There's only one news program that you can depend on, and it's better than anything Russian radio or television can do," said Nikolai S. Portugalov, a former high-ranking official of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee.
"Radio Liberty has hired all the best political reporters in town," he said. "It's absolutely must listening."
 
They Don't Vote in U.S.
 Coming from a former representative of a Government that for decades denounced Radio Liberty as anti-Soviet propaganda, and did its best to jam it off the airwaves, this was high praise, indeed.
Kevin Klose, a former Moscow correspondent and editor for The Washington Post who became Radio Liberty's director late last year, said that both its Russian staff and its Russian listeners tended to be young.
"The core of the group is Russians in their 20's, kids we started signing on as freelance contributors before the coup," he said of his reporters. "Our committed core audience are the people who, if society is going to be changed and democracy firmly established, are the ones who are going to do it."
But, he lamented, "among our millions of listeners, there is unfortunately nobody who can vote in an American election."

HEADLINE: United Air Gets Tough On Unions

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Playing hardball with labor unions in an attempt to lower costs, the chairman of United Airlines said yesterday that the carrier would not take delivery of at least $2 billion worth of planes from the Boeing Company that had been scheduled for delivery in 1994 and 1995. United may also abandon unprofitable short-haul routes, said the executive, Stephen M. Wolf, leasing the planes used on those to low-cost airlines.
Mr. Wolf said that after August, the airline would not accept delivery of Boeing planes until May 1995, when it would begin to get the 777, a twin-engine jet that it has planned to use on international routes.
 
Pressure Tactic Seen
 The move to pull back in the short-haul markets and possibly to use carriers like Southwest Airlines to feed its major routes would presumably put considerable pressure on United's unions to agree to changes in work rules and make other concessions. 
 Besides the cutback on the 41 new aircraft, Mr. Wolf, in discussing his plans at a meeting with industry analysts at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan, seemed to rub salt into Boeing's wounds. He said that United would continue to take delivery of the Airbus A320, a European-built jet, over the same period, though it would seek to lease most of the new Airbuses to other carriers.
United has long been Boeing's largest and most loyal customer.
 
Longer Hours in the Sky
 Mr. Wolf has asked the airline's three major unions for productivity increases worth a total of about 10 percent, mainly from changes in work rules that would have flight attendants and pilots fly longer hours. He has also asked employees to pay about 5 percent of the cost of their medical benefits.
The flight attendants' and machinists' unions have so far refused to go along, he said, while the pilots' union has said it will study the proposal.
Mr. Wolf made clear that unless the unions come around, United would farm out the short-haul routes.
"It's not brutalizing anybody," he argued. "It's not a management decision; it's a marketplace decision."
All the major airlines have begun to retrench and lay off employees as it becomes evident that the huge systems built in the 1980's are too large and possibly too expensive for current levels of passenger traffic at current fares.
Mr. Wolf said that farming out short-haul routes to other airlines could be done without violating union contracts, as long as United does not own the other carriers.
American Airlines is also considering such a strategy.
Southwest, which has low costs and has been growing rapidly, is the only airline that has stuck to a strategy of low fares and simple service, and in most markets it has entered it has been able to wear down its bigger rivals. The carrier has not built huge hubs, and it has emphasized getting the most out of its workers, stressing measures like quick turnaround time for its aircraft at intermediate stops on a route.
Southwest's financial performance in difficult times has been a reminder to the larger airlines that a low-fare policy can lead to profits even in an adverse economy.
Mr. Wolf said today that United had already had discussions with Southwest about the short-haul routes. "We can tie in through a marketing agreement for these carriers to feed us passengers," he said.
He left unclear whether United would cut back on the 50 Boeing planes due to be delivered this year. Analysts said it was likely that the airline would in fact take delivery of most of them, since it would be difficult to turn them back on such short notice.
Of the Airbus 320's, 5 of which are to be delivered this year and 32 more in the next two years, Mr. Wolf said United would seek lessors. For the carrier to put those planes into service, he said, it would take about $200 million for requirements like flight simulators and crew training.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Clinton Staff Chief Lives Up to Name

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The day after President Clinton delivered a somber and poorly reviewed Oval Office speech calling for individual sacrifice to help the economy, his oldest friend called members of the young White House senior staff into his office. And he scolded them.
Yet the friend, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the courtly chief of staff, never raised his voice. 
 "I don't want to sermonize," he began. He then gave those in the room a five-minute dressing down for suffering from what one person described as the "holier than thou" arrogance of the young.
The President's prime-time appearance on Feb. 15 and the salesmanship that had surrounded it, Mr. McLarty worried, had conveyed the tone of an inflexible leader ordering people to follow rather than asking them to join in a crusade.
 
Sign of Influence
 It is not Mr. McLarty's job to write the President's speeches, but it certainly was his job to discipline the speech writers, who he felt had surrounded the President with an air of hubris.
"McLarty felt there was this attitude among some of the staff that if you weren't for the President's plan, just get out of the way; we'll roll you," said a senior official who had attended the meeting.
Two days after the tongue-lashing, when the President delivered his first major address to a joint session of Congress, references to sacrifice had been deleted, pleas for cooperation had been inserted, and the speech had become a lofty call to arms.
So much for those who say the chief of staff is invisible.
White House officials who work closely with Mr. McLarty say he influences policy by affecting the staff members who set the policy rather than by promoting his own political views.
John H. Sununu, the combative and ultimately deposed chief of staff to President George Bush, controlled policy, politics and personnel from top to bottom. But in the self-consciously egalitarian Clinton White House, that power has been spread far more thinly. What Mr. McLarty does is run the staff.
 
Out of Sight Early On
 Mr. McLarty came to the White House a 46-year-old, Arkansas-born businessman who had made millions in the energy industry, who had known Mr. Clinton since kindergarten and who was universally known as simply Mack. In the Presidential campaign he was almost entirely out of the public view, but he raised significant sums of money for the campaign and remained close to both Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary.
While Mr. McLarty was becoming acclimated to the White House, the "speed bumps" -- as one official described them -- of the first few weeks seemed easily negotiated without him. He worked through his first days while nursing a bout of pneumonia and dropped almost entirely out of sight as candidates for Attorney General rose and fell and as a fight broke out with Congress over allowing homosexuals into the military.
Mr. McLarty's flashes of temper, by all accounts, are few but effective. He spends more of his time, officials said, quietly building a reservoir of support among the White House professionals, who refer to him with almost filial respect, and with members of Congress, whom he has stroked for weeks.
"In the White House every day, there are these buffeting events that could throw you off the path," said Howard Paster, the President's liaison to Congress. "And Mack is sort of steady as she goes."
 
Spreading Responsibilities
 Washington insiders like to draw comparisons with those who have held offices in the past, and most say Mr. McLarty is not the high-profile political handyman that James A. Baker 3d was or the pugnacious overseer that Mr. Sununu was.
Much of the Clinton Administration's press relations, speech writing and political salesmanship is developed in the office of George Stephanopoulos, the communications director. And senior aides like Robert E. Rubin, Mr. Clinton's economic policy adviser, and Bruce Lindsey, the personnel director, have their own routes to the President's office.
"Clearly you've got a lot of issues coming at you in a day," Mr. McLarty said in a recent interview in the pale yellow office he occupies near the President's. "You've got to be able to screen more than one piece at a time. I anticipated that, but you have to really experience it before you appreciate it."
Mr. McLarty's is the gift of understatement. He seldom says more than he intends, corrects himself immediately when he does and is unfailingly polite to the legion of reporters, politicians and lobbyists who have trooped to his West Wing office to acquaint themselves.
His temperament is remarkably unlike the President's. Mr. Clinton's bursts of anger are quickly extinguished but their intentions are clear: to force action. Mr. McLarty is more likely to show displeasure through icy distance or by assuming the demeanor of a disciplinarian.
 
Making the Circuit
 For now, charm is his primary weapon, ladled out, his loyalists say, without ideological bias. Mr. McLarty and his wife, Donna (he calls her "my wonderful partner"), often invite lawmakers to the home they rent in the tony Kalorama section of Washington for supper and a chat.
He has been spotted in the Senate dining room. He received sustained applause when he spoke to the House Democratic Caucus in Baltimore recently. And he soothed conservative Democrats when they grumbled that Mr. Clinton's economic plan spent too much and cut too little.
"A business background is very helpful in Congress," Mr. McLarty said. "I think they view that as very much in keeping with many of the constituencies they represent."
Some who have watched the rise and fall of other Presidential chiefs of staff observe that Mr. McLarty is something of a submarine. It is difficult to attack a target that remains largely submerged.
"I've been impressed by the fact that he has been almost invisible," said Richard Moe, who served as Walter F. Mondale's chief of staff when Mr. Mondale was Vice President. "I think that's positive. Most chiefs of staff who have been very high profile have gotten in trouble."
 
Lessons From Business
 Members of the senior White House staff say Mr. McLarty's daily meetings draw heavily from the management style he developed in nearly 10 years as president of Arkla, a Fortune 500 natural gas company in the South, and a lifetime of dabbling in Arkansas politics.
The Saturday before the President introduced his economic plan, Mr. McLarty met with White House senior staff members in his office and worked his way around the long conference table, demanding that each department head stand and explain how he or she planned to help promote the plan.
"Everyone left that room knowing they had a very clear mission," said Mark D. Gearan, Mr. McLarty's deputy.
But even Mr. McLarty concedes that some of the toughest adjustment has come in learning to fit his schedule to another chief executive's.
"I guess right now I'm kind of splitting my time, probably 50 percent with the President, 30 percent with the Hill, about 30 percent with the press," he said. "I know that adds up to more than 100 percent, but that's kind of how I feel."
In Washington, much of the mystery about powerful new officials comes in determining just how much power they really have. Mr. McLarty is one of several Arkansans in the President's inner circle; others include Mr. Lindsey, Carol H. Rasco, the domestic policy adviser, and Vince Foster, the deputy counsel to the President.
Mr. Lindsey, in particular, is known to be close to Mr. Clinton, having an open door to the Oval Office and a title that belies his broad influence.
"I still tend to think Bruce has more juice with Clinton" than Mr. McLarty does, an aide to a Democratic Senator said. "If we were really furious with someone and had to pick one of the two to call, based on who would understand the politics of it, it would be Lindsey."
 
Challenge for a Nice Guy
 Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, is a longtime Clinton ally who has watched with interest as Mr. McLarty has made his way around Congress.
"You've probably heard the word 'nice' describe him once or twice," Mr. Breaux said. "That's not an overused word here. This is going to be the real test of whether a nice guy can survive in Washington in the arena of national politics."
Mr. Breaux said that even if members of Congress underestimated Mr. McLarty, they should not underestimate Mr. Clinton.
"Even those who think Mack may not cut their knees off know that Mack talks to the President several times a day," the Senator said. "And Bill Clinton knows how to do what has to be done."
This observation touches on a refrain that often comes up in discussions about Mr. McLarty around Washington: The chief of staff, the thinking goes, functions as a mirror of a President's instincts, and because a President is heavily involved in day-to-day White House operations, the person who runs his staff cannot function as a deputy President but only as a staff-level assistant and -- in Mr. McLarty's case -- a friend.
Mr. Clinton, aides say, is likely to walk down the hall to an assistant's office when he has the time rather than call the aide on the telephone. In such an environment, they say, no gatekeeper is needed.
"Even if you wanted to be the ultimate gatekeeper, it's hard to do if the person on the other side doesn't stay in his enclosed area," a senior official said. "They are on the same wavelength."

HEADLINE: Medicaid Cost Jumped 25% In '92 Fiscal Year, U.S. Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Medicaid costs rose by almost $24 billion in the last fiscal year as 3.3 million more Americans joined the health insurance program for the poor, the Government reported this week.
The Federal Government and the states spent $118.2 billion providing the health benefits in the fiscal year 1992, which ended on Sept. 30. That was up 25 percent from the $94.5 billion spent a year earlier. 
 The Federal share of the Medicaid bills was $67.8 billion, or 57 percent. The amount each state contributes varies depending on its per-capita income.
The recession and expanded eligibility for pregnant women and children from low-income families helped swell the Medicaid rolls to 31.6 million from 28.3 million, a record.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Drop

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The number of Americans applying for state unemployment benefits fell by 10,000 in the week that ended last Saturday, the Government said today, offering more evidence that employers are adding workers to their payrolls.
First-time applicants for state jobless benefits declined for the second straight week, dropping to 351,000, from 361,000 in the week that ended on March 6, the Labor Department reported. It was the lowest level for claims since the week that ended on Feb. 20, when there were also 351,000. 
 The states with the biggest drops were New York, California, Alabama, Illinois and Missouri, partly reflecting fewer layoffs in construction.
 The report supported other recent indicators that suggested the nation's labor market was strengthening. Unemployment fell last month to the lowest level since November 1991, while the number of payroll jobs outside the farm sector surged by 365,000.
But the latest report was not entirely bullish. On a four-week moving average, the number of first-time applicants rose 6,500, to 359,750, the highest level since the week that ended last Nov. 28, when the average was the same.

HEADLINE: Japan's New York Realty Investing Plunges

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
New investment by the Japanese in New York City real estate dropped to $10 million last year from $859 million in 1991 and a peak of $2.8 billion in 1988, according to a report released yesterday by Kenneth Leventhal & Company, the accounting agency.
The report found that the only Japanese investment in New York real estate in 1992 was a $10 million commitment to renovate a midtown office building already owned by a Japanese company. The primary reasons for the decline are Japan's economic crash and, in this country, the continuing repercussions from the overbuilding and steep drop in real estate prices from the mid- to late 80's. 
 The report said Japanese investors spent $807 million on United States real estate last year, down from $5.06 billion in 1991 and a peak of $16.54 billion in 1988. The 1992 figures showed that Japanese spending on real estate in Hawaii accounted for 41 percent of the year's total, with California at 36 percent and New York at 1 percent, down from 17 percent of the 1991 total.
Jack Rodman, director of Leventhal's Pacific Rim practice, said 1993 was not likely to be much better. "I think that next year you'll see an equal amount of money -- less than a billion dollars -- spent to shore up, because we're still so overbuilt," he said. In fact, he said, Japanese investors are likely to start selling properties.
Jennifer Kimball, spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office of Finance and Economic Development, said that foreign real estate purchases were down because of foreign economic turmoil and sinking property values. But over all, including manufacturing and other sources of investment, "the city's share of foreign direct investment is on the rise, and we are confident about that.".
She added that a recent city study found that by 1990, Japanese concerns had become the leading foreign owners of office space in Manhattan, with more than 19 million of the 67 million square feet of space that was foreign owned.
The Leventhal report came two days after the United States Commerce Department released figures showing that there was a net loss in foreign direct investment in the United States in 1992, meaning that foreign investors put less money into the companies in the United States than they took out.
The figures, which reflect a drop in cross-border investment by the British, Japanese and others, showed that foreigners took $3.95 billion more out of American investments than they put in in 1992. In 1991, the Commerce Department said, foreigners put $11.5 billion more into American investments than was taken out. The peak of foreign direct investment came in 1989, when $67.87 billion more was put into American investment than was taken out.

HEADLINE: Housing Authority Plans $139 Million for Security

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
The New York City Housing Authority plans to spend $139 million over the next three years on an array of measures intended to improve security in the authority's 324 housing complexes.
Authority officials said the money would be spent on increasing housing police officers on the beat, more social services for tenants and such safety measures as new locks and intercom systems. Most of the money will come from existing funds in the authority's budget. Agency officials could not immediately say how much the plan would increase the budget or what programs would be cut or altered to provide the extra security. 
 The plan also calls for the hiring of private security guards to supplement the housing police at some complexes for the elderly and some family complexes with stubbornly high crime rates.
Sally Hernandez-Pinero, chairwoman of the authority, and Mayor David N. Dinkins unveiled the details of the security plan yesterday in the packed community center in Red Hook Houses. The sprawling Brooklyn public housing complex is where a popular elementary school principal, Patrick Daly, was shot and killed last December while searching for a student who had missed school. The police say he was caught in a crossfire between drug-dealing gangs in the complex.
 
Plan at Work in Red Hook
 Housing Authority officials, who said the expanded security program was already in the works at the time of the principal's death, said they had choosen the Red Hook Houses as the site for the announcement because parts of the plan were already in operation there. New security hardware is being installed in the Red Hook buildings; so-called vertical foot patrols, with officers walking from top to bottom, have been increased, and the complex is among the 82 Housing Authority projects that are using extra Federal anti-drug money for increased tenant patrols and drug-education programs.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero told the audience of public housing tenants, building managers and officers that the forces of homelessness, increased drug use, the economic downturn and cuts in Federal spending had worsened problems in public housing.
"I am being honest and realistic when I tell you we can not undo in a year what has been done to us in more than a decade," she said. "What is clear is that it can get better."
Most residents and tenant leaders at the meeting who commented praised the authority's initiative, but some said it did not go far enough.
 
'More Than Better Locks'
 "I support some of it," said Ethel Velez, the tenant president in Johnson Houses in Manhattan. "But it will take more than better locks and lighting systems to make people in my complex feel safer. I think that 150 or 200 more cops is just not enough."
Furthermore, the planned hiring of private security guards in some complexes has drawn the ire of police union representatives.
Timothy Nickels, president of the Housing Police Benevolent Association, said private security guards were a poor substitute for patrol officers and a waste of public money.
"The Housing Authority is asking private guards, who have not been trained in police work, to do the jobs police officers should be doing," said Mr. Nickels, who spoke outside the community center. "It is not fair to the residents of public housing."
 
Beat Officers to Double
 Money for the security program will come from the city, the Federal Government and the Housing Authority's existing budget. The city is to put $15.2 million into the program. Another $16.2 million will come from reallocated Housing Authority money, and the remaining $107.4 million will be from existing Federal grants.
The plan calls for a doubling in the number of Housing Authority beat patrol officers, to 400, in the next two years. Part of the expansion will involve putting civilians in jobs currently done by uniformed officers, along with 160 additional Housing Police officers expected under the Mayor's Safe Cities, Safe Streets program.
The Authority will spend $42 million for electromagnetic locks, intercoms and upgraded exterior lighting, another $42 million into refurbishing the authority's recreation centers and $1 million for youth programs. Security, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero commented yesterday, must include social services like these.
In response to tenant complaints about pervasive drug dealing in some public housing projects, the security plan calls for spending $1.5 million to broaden the screening of prospective residents through criminal background checks, references and home visits. The authority currently manages 180,000 apartments in 3,000 buildings. More than half the residents are under 21 years old.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero has stressed the plan's dependence on a successful partnership between tenants, housing police and management. Responding to the critics, she said that she was confident that she had the support to carry out the plan.

HEADLINE: Pratt & Whitney to Eliminate 7,600 Positions by October

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: EAST HARTFORD, Conn., March 18

 BODY:
Pratt & Whitney, one of Connecticut's largest employers, announced today the timetable for its plan to cut 10,600 jobs, saying it would cut 7,600 positions by October.
Officials of the company, which makes jet engines for military and commercial aircraft, also said they would close an unspecified number of its 13 factories. 
 In a state where manufacturers are reeling from the decline in military spending, today's announcement was the kind of bad news that has become all too familiar.
The president, Karl J. Krapek, said in a letter to employees that Pratt & Whitney would reduce its total floor space by as much as five million square feet over the next two years, two million more than previously announced.
Mr. Krapek said Pratt & Whitney will close factories as well as administrative buildings and warehouses, but did not specify where the closings would be.
The company, with about 20,000 employees in Connecticut, has plants in East Hartford, North Haven, Middletown, Southington, Cheshire and Rocky Hill, and in North Berwick, Me.; Columbus, Ga.; West Palm Beach, Fla., and Montreal.
 
No Final Decisions
 A company spokesman, Mark Sullivan, said final decisions on the plant closings have not been made. He said, however, that at least one or two plants will be closed, possibly more.
Mr. Sullivan insisted that today's announcement does not represent an acceleration of previously announced job cuts.
In January, United Technologies, Pratt & Whitney's parent company, announced that it would slash 10,664 jobs from Pratt & Whitney by the end of 1994, reducing total employment at the division to 30,000 employees. Of the jobs to be eliminated, 6,700 were to be from plants in Connecticut.
The company said it expected to finish cutting 3,600 jobs nationwide by the end of this month, to bring its work force down to 37,000. An additional 2,000 jobs will be eliminated by the end of June and another 2,000 by the end of October.
Analysts said the timetable for job cuts is faster than what they expected but is necessary to make Pratt & Whitney more cost-competitive.
 
Closings Expected
 David J. Franus, an aerospace analyst for Forecast International, a private research and consulting concern that specializes in the aerospace and aviation industries, said the decision to close factories has been expected for more than two years.
"It was getting to the point where if you want to be cost-competitive, you can do that to a certain extent by downsizing, but you also have to reduce overhead, and you do that by consolidating and closing plants," Mr. Franus said.
Union officials were angered by the company's announcement because they said they had been told no decision on the restructuring plan would be revealed until next week.
"When we meet with the company on a Wednesday and we ask them point-blank when the announcement is coming out and they tell us it's next week, it's a shock to us," said Andrew D. Romegialli, directing labor representative for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents most of Pratt & Whitney's blue-collar employees.
"The state is hurting real bad," Mr. Romegialli said. "We're going to need a lot more defense money in this state as soon as possible."
Mr. Krapek said Pratt & Whitney's commercial engine business, now a single entity, would be restructured into three stand-alone operations in the Americas, Europe-Middle East-Africa and the Pacific Rim. Each operation will be headed by a manager responsible for sales, service, customer relations and strategic planning.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Will Not Punish Underwithholding

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 18

 BODY:
Connecticut wage-earners who didn't have enough income taxes withheld from their paychecks will get a break from penalties and interest.
The Legislature unanimously passed a measure Wednesday voiding the interest and penalty payments this year, except for cases of fraud. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. promptly signed the measure. 
 The entire process, which normally could have taken weeks, was dispensed with in a matter of hours -- a sign of lingering concerns that legislators have about a backlash of voter anger over the income tax.
"Because this is the first full year of the personal income tax, it makes sense to remove penalties and interest for those taxpayers who -- acting in all good faith -- underwithheld for 1992," Governor Weicker said.
In recent weeks, it had come to light that many taxpayers inadvertently did not have enough money taken out of their paychecks toward the state's 4.5 percent income tax.
In many cases, the underwithholding was because taxpayers had been given a raise during the year, collected a lot of overtime or had employers who failed to correctly calculate the withholding.
If taxpayers owed $200 or more, and if that represented more than 10 percent of their total liability, they faced penalties and interest that could have added 35 percent to the balance owed.
Taxpayers who have already paid penalties and interest will have the money returned in about a month, according to the Department of Revenue Services.
The Legislature's Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated that eliminating the penalties would result in a revenue loss of about $3 million between the rest of this fiscal year and the 1994-95 fiscal year.
But state officials said they did not count on getting that money so it would not affect the state budget.

HEADLINE: U.S. Partners Say President Shows Two Faces on Trade

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
America's trade partners, bracing for the Clinton Administration's first set of trade sanctions, are angry and confused. Which Bill Clinton are they dealing with, they ask: the President whose policy addresses sketch a broad commitment to free trade? Or the confrontational politician whose Administration has repeatedly hit hard?
"Sooner or later, the U.S. will have to clarify its policy," said Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's commissioner for External Affairs. "You cannot use the language of free trade with one voice and engage in damaging pin-pricks with another." 
 Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community's executive commission, held a long-scheduled meeting with President Clinton today but did not head off United States sanctions that are scheduled to take effect on Monday.
President Clinton told reporters during a break in the meeting, "I don't want a trade war with the E.C. and I don't think we'll have one."
Mr. Clinton and his trade officials say there is no inconsistency in the Administration's emerging trade policy. Trade diplomacy can no longer be neatly labeled as free trade, protectionism or managed trade, they contend; what matters are results. "I agree with the President that we should not slavishly adhere to any particular approach," said Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative.
The immediate cause of Sir Leon's irritation at a news conference in Brussels on Wednesday lies in the Administration's plans to bar European Community companies on Monday from competing for many Federal contracts. The ban would be in retaliation for new government contract rules in Europe that may hurt American companies. Federal purchasing officials have already been warned informally of the coming ban, and an official notice has been prepared for publication in the Federal Register on Monday.
Mr. Delors said after the meeting with the President that he remained concerned about the possibility of a trade war. "I have drawn the attention of the President to the bad consequences of the decision that will be taken next Monday on public procurement," he added.
Few if any trade experts actually anticipate a tit-for-tat trade war that would result in a serious reduction in the volume of trade. But many trade experts are alarmed that the current trade climate is fast deteriorating.
"We cannot have an implosion of trade," said Carla A. Hills, who was the United States trade representative during the Bush Administration. "I worry that you're going to have frictions, from this lobbing of rhetoric across the Atlantic, that will restrict trade."
 
More Disputes Coming
 More trade conflicts are fast approaching. Administration officials will announce as soon as Friday afternoon whether Japan met a target of importing at least 20 percent of its semiconductors. Mr. Kantor is likely to respond vehemently if the figure falls short, as is expected.
The Commerce Department has also imposed steep but temporary import tariffs on steel from 19 countries and must decide within two months whether to make the tariffs permanent. These tariffs have angered foreign trade officials because they replace a more trade-distorting quota system that guaranteed small but automatically profitable shares of the American market to foreign companies.
President Clinton sketched his vision of open international markets at American University on Feb. 26. But he has also flown to Seattle to criticize European aircraft manufacturing subsidies and then gone to Silicon Valley to announce larger Federal subsidies for high technology.
"When the same person is saying different things to different audiences, it is extraordinarily difficult" for trade negotiators, Mrs. Hills said in an interview today.
The Clinton Administration contends that the high-technology subsidies are different from European subsidies because they are aimed at basic research and the earliest stages of product development, whereas the Airbus subsidies have helped the competitiveness of a specific company. But American participants in the main Federal program get to keep the patents for inventions they develop with Federal money.
Clinton Administration officials also say that the differences in emphasis reflect the need for aggressive approaches to what they perceive as unequal trade agreements. For example, the United States puts about $16 billion a year worth of Federal contracts up for international bids under a global free trade code while the European Community has only put about $8 billion worth of annual Government contracts under the same code. No contracts in the code will be affected on Monday.
The World Bank and other independent analysts have found the American market more open than the markets of Europe and Japan. But European officials are quick to point out that the United States has also benefited from nearly half a century of growing international trade that has allowed each country to specialize at what it does best.
They say that Washington is unfairly picking on Europe at a time when America is running a trade surplus with the community and a trade deficit with Japan.
The planned sanctions next week involve banning companies from the 12 European nations from bidding on nearly $50 billion a year in contracts with the United States Government. The move is in retaliation for new European government-contracting rules that the Bush and Clinton Administrations have condemned as protectionist.
Companies from the community have been winning only about $45 million a year worth of these contracts, which mainly consist of local services like supplying cafeterias in government buildings. Unlike certain Federal contracts for merchandise, these contracts are not covered by international free trade rules and the United States is legally free to restrict foreign access to them.
 
Kantor Canceled Meeting
 Mr. Kantor has been aggressive in his handling of the dispute. Last Friday he abruptly canceled a final staff meeting in Brussels, scheduled for Monday and Tuesday. Mr. Kantor contended then that European negotiators had shown so little flexibility that it was not worth the time and expense for his deputies to fly across the Atlantic.
Sir Leon complained in Brussels on Wednesday that, "as the talks were already planned, it served no useful purpose to call them off, especially when we were prepared to commission a joint independent study on the state of the market."
Sir Leon refused to say then whether the community would retaliate if the United States enacted the ban on Monday. But a European official in Brussels said today that retaliation was among the options now being reviewed.
The official added that any decision to retaliate would have to be made by the community's foreign ministers, who are not scheduled to meet until April 1. Mr. Kantor and Sir Leon will have another chance to solve the dispute at a meeting in Brussels scheduled for March 29 and 30.
The community has not threatened any specific retaliation. But a person with a detailed knowledge of the issue said that some European countries were pressing the community's executive commission to tighten its new government contracts regulation, further excluding foreign companies, if the squabble cannot be settled quickly.
The regulation went into effect on Jan. 1 and covers government contracts for telecommunications, electric power generation, mass transit and municipal water supplies. The new rules include two clauses that anger American officials.
One requires that companies from the community's member nations must win a contract unless a company from outside the community underbids them by at least 3 percent. The other clause allows governments to reject bids at any price if less than half of the goods involved are manufactured in the European Community.
The new communitywide rules replaced varying regulations in each of the 12 member countries. Community officials contend that these regulations were generally more restrictive than the new rules.

Treasury Issues in Sharp Price Jump

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices jumped sharply yesterday, raising the question of whether the rally that stalled a week ago could commence again and bring yields on long-term bonds down to new lows.
Coming on the heels of what appeared to be disappointing inflation reports last Friday and Wednesday, the price rises yesterday seemed to show that investors and traders are still comfortable at these lofty levels for price and low levels of yields. 
 The test of whether the rally is on track again could come soon. Yields yesterday fell close to the lows for the year reached at the beginning of the month, and if they now move lower, the rally will look alive.
In trading yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond rose 12/32 , to 10412/32 , as the yield fell to 6.78 percent, down from 6.86 percent Wednesday and just 6 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, above the 6.72 percent low hit on March 8. That was the lowest yield on the 30-year bond since the Treasury began regular auctions in 1977.
The price of the 10-year note jumped 27/32 as the yield plunged to 5.89 percent, from 6.00 percent the day before and just a few basis points above the 1993 low of 5.82 percent.
The price of the five-year note was up 20/32 as the yield dropped to 5.04 percent, down from 5.18 percent the day before and just 4 basis pojnts above its 1993 low of 5.00 percent.
It is not clear exactly what was pushing the buying yesterday. Some traders said the rally was led by intermediate Treasury securitities -- five- and 10-year notes. This, they argued, was because dealers were buying these Treasury securities as part of the technical trading they do to hedge or lessen the risk of loss from holding corporate bonds and the decline in value of mortgage-backed securities as millions of homeowners refinace at lower rates.
This technical reason for the buying could help power the rally further but could also disappear quickly. J. Gregory Erardi, the managing director at Salomon Brothers in charge of the government trading desk, said he did not see a lot of institutional buying from the funds and portfolio managers that were the big force behind the rally in bond prices this year. Selling by these same money mannagers after the report of the four-tenths of 1 percent jump in the Producer Price Index last Friday knocked prices sharply lower and yields higher.
"If we don't see additional institutional selling, we could resume the move up to higher prices," he said.
Technical Data, a market research firm, said that its recent survey of portfolio managers showed that funds still had a lot of cash to invest.
The other theme yesterday was that people have become more comfortable with the inflation news, in part because other data seem to imply that the economy is growing at a slower pace now.
The perception of the pace of the economy has been shifting all year. Early in the year there was a feeling that it would be slower than the pace at the end of last year. Then there were data that made people think the economy was moving a little faster, a belief that was reinforced by the strong jump in nonfarm payrolls in February.
 
Indications of Slowing Economy
 But since that report in early March, there have been data indicating that the economy may have slowed a little at the end of February. And the recent blizzard along the East Coast has people thinking that data in March may be a little weaker than expected. If this is the case, the price jumps reflected in the producer report Friday and the Consumer Price Index Wednesday are less worrisome because the pace of the increases should not continue with the slowly growing economy.

Lender for Low-Income Areas Gets Boost

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Chicago's two largest banking companies, the First Chicago Corporation and the Continental Bank Corporation, said yesterday that they had bought $4.5 million of stock in Shorebank Corporation, a much smaller Chicago banking company that specializes in lending in low-income neighborhoods.
The investment in nonvoting stock by the large banks will allow Shorebank's South Shore Bank subsidiary to expand its business in several Chicago neighborhoods. It comes at a time when bankers are nervously waiting to see how the Clinton Administration will enforce the Community Reinvestment Act. That 16-year-old act requires banks to do business in their local markets but does not set guidelines for the volume of that business.
 
Ratings Cited
 At the end of 1992, about 10 percent of banks had an "outstanding" rating from regulators for complying with the act, nearly 80 percent were "satisfactory," and more than 10 percent were either "needs improvement" or were in "substantial noncompliance," according to Kenneth H. Thomas, a Miami-based bank consultant. 
 But the top two ratings may become harder to achieve, since bank regulators have been embarrassed over the last two years by Federal reports showing that minority applicants for mortgages have been nearly twice as likely to be rejected as white applicants of similar income.
Continental Bank, which invested $2.5 million in Shorebank, has a C.R.A. rating of satisfactory, as does the American National Bank subsidiary of the First Chicago Corporation, which invested $500,000 in Shorebank. The First National Bank of Chicago, a First Chicago unit, with a $1.5 million investment, is rated outstanding.
Deepak Bhargava, legislative director for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, a group that has often contended that banks do not lend enough in low-income areas, said he expected "serious enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act for the first time." He said legislators now see support for the act as a politically popular move and a way to help cities without spending much money.
 South Shore Bank is noted in banking circles for its ability to make loans to and earn profits from borrowers that other banks have shunned. Its successful combination of a bank that makes loans at market interest rates with a real estate development corporation and a nonprofit neighborhood development organization is widely regarded as a model for a national network of 100 community development banks that President Clinton has proposed.
South Shore executives helped create the Southern Development Bancorporation in Arkansas with backing from the Arkansas government under Mr. Clinton. Hillary Rodham Clinton was formerly a director of Southern Development.
South Shore grew rapidly last year when it issued $30 million of new loans and assets advanced about 15 percent, to $235 million. The bank expects another $3 million of stock to be bought by other investors, which would allow it to continue growing by raising its total capital to about $24 million from $17 million before the investment by the Chicago banks.

Dollar Slumps on Concern About Economic Recovery

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against most currencies yesterday, hitting a record low against the yen, as traders expressed concern about the strength of the United States economic recovery.
"There's no reason to buy dollars right now because the U.S. economy isn't recovering as quickly as it once was," Koichi Takenaka, an assistant vice president at the Industrial Bank of Japan in New York, said. 
 The dollar hit a post-World War II low of 115.65 yen late in the New York trading session, breaking the low of 115.85 yen set Feb. 22. The dollar fell almost two pfennigs against the mark, to 1.643 marks in late trading.
 
 
Gold Gains
 Gold for delivery in April jumped $1.50 an ounce, to $331.20, on the Commodity Exchange.
Figures released yesterday showing the trade deficit widened 6 percent in January did the most to damp investors' outlook on the economy, analysts said. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index of economic activity fell in March.
The dollar's late tumble against the yen was exacerbated by big currency funds, which sold the dollar aggressively once the slide started, analysts said.
The dollar fell against the mark earlier in the day after the German central bank cut its key discount rate to 7.5 percent from 8 percent, as many traders and investors expected. The Bundesbank left its Lombard rate unchanged at 9 percent.
"People were looking for a more generous signal from the Bundesbank, and we didn't get it," Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, said.
Lower rates abroad make dollar-deposits more attractive, raising demand for the currency. At half a percentage point, the German cut was not large enough to warrant more dollar purchases, traders said.
The dollar also weakened against the French franc, dropping to 5.603 francs, from 5.658 francs late Wednesday. The dollar slid to 1.508 Swiss francs from 1.5338 francs and slumped to 1,590 Italian lire from 1,608 lire. The dollar weakened against its Canadian counterpart, falling to $1.2473 (Canadian) from $1.2513 (Canadian).

HEADLINE: Canada Trade Surplus

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: OTTAWA, March 18

 BODY:
Canada's trade surplus rose to $1.9 billion (Canadian), or $1.53 billion (United States), in January, the highest level in almost eight years, as exports continued to drive an economic recovery, the Government said today. The trade surplus rose by $900 million, fueled by record exports and falling imports. Exports to the United States hit a record monthly high, while those to Japan and most of the European Community were strong, the Government agency Statistics Canada said.

Double-Up and Out For No. 1 Courier

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. March 18

 BODY:
Jim Courier, the world's No. 1 player and renowned workaholic, put in a double shift today on the weather-whipped construction site that doubles as the site of the Lipton Championships. He wound up sorry he made the extra effort.
His morning opponent treated him with consummate respect, but his evening opponent -- older, wiser and familiar because of their shared practice sessions in the California desert where they have neighboring condos -- cruelly ambushed him. 
 All systems were go this morning, when Courier dealt Mikael Pernfors a 6-0, 6-3 comeuppance in the third round. But after he punched in again tonight for his fourth-round match with Mark Woodforde, Courier found himself unemployed here.
 
Hadn't Been Worried
 Woodforde exploited Courier's nervousness and advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 2-6, 6-2 upset that left the No. 1 player chewing ice in an attempt to cool himself down.
Courier hadn't been worried about having to perform twice and called it "no big deal"; after all, the only other time he did this, a year ago in Hong Kong, he segued straight from semifinal to final and won the event.
But tonight's performance by Courier was of an uncharacteristically knock-kneed, flat-footed vintage that, said Woodforde, "only goes to prove that he's normal like the rest of us."
Courier even vented his discomfort on the chair umpire, Dana Loconto, shaking his chair and earning a code violation during a third-set changeover just after dropping his serve to trail 4-1.
"I had a poor performance and he had a poor performance in the chair," said an unrepentant Courier. "It happened in the heat of the moment; I don't regret anything."
Neither did the 27-year-old Woodforde, a veteran on the mend from knee injuries and confidence trouble. He not only advanced to the quarterfinals against 48th-ranked Marcos Ondruska, who eliminated ninth-seed Michael Stich in straight sets, but also climbed into the top 20 for the first time in his career.
After four days of epic gales and downpours that mangled the palm trees, ravaged the beaches, canceled matches and sent Boris Becker packing because of a flu-related pestilence, fine weather struck the Lipton with a vengeance today only to create a mini-disaster along with five significant upsets.
Warmed by the sunshine, the stadium's soggy Laycold hardcourt surface bubbled up like a witch's brew this morning and rendered itself unusable until late afernoon.
Confined to a Court 1 confrontation with the sonic-server Richard Krajicek, eighth-seed Andre Agassi succumbed to the Dutchman's 12th ace at triple match point and was ousted in straight sets, 6-2, 7-5. Germany's Stich, who called Key Biscayne's variable weather fit only for vacations, not tennis business, was next on and met a similar fate.
Krajicek's next opponent, Pete Sampras, has the same kind of serve. Sampras, who ousted Andrei Medvedev, 6-7, 6-3, 6-2, and Krajicek have never played one another.
The tournament director, Butch Buchholz, later described the temporary stadium's floor problems as "cosmetic," and induced the women quarterfinalists to test it. In the first women's quarterfinal, third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini downed Jana Novotna, 6-2, 6-3, and neither complained about the footing. Sabatini confronts her longtime rival, Steffi Graf, in the semifinals Friday.
In the other semifinal, defending champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, seeded second, will face Japan's Kimiko Date, who upset fifth-seed Mary Joe Fernandez 7-6 (7-4), 6-3.
 
The Other McEnroe
 Becker's withdrawl advanced 38th-ranked Nicklas Kulti into the fourth-round, but the free ride was halted there, 7-5, 7-6 (7-3), by 18th-ranked MaliVai Washington, who next faces this event's sleeper entry, 180th-ranked Patrick McEnroe.
McEnroe began his Lipton idyll by ousting sixth-seed Goran Ivanisevic, and today he outwitted another of the game's top servers, Olympic champion Marc Rosset, 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-0.
Rosset lost his temper in the third set and blamed -- surprise, surprise -- this besieged tournament site. "I've been able to shut it out until today, but no more," snapped Rosset.

HEADLINE: Stocks Jump 38.90 Points; Rates Cited

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
A German interest rate cut and the ensuing bond market rally in the United States drove stocks sharply higher yesterday, with heavy industries showing the most muscle.
The Dow Jones industrial average shot to within about a point of a record before closing at 3,465.64, up 38.90 points, or 1.1 percent. The broader market averages also ran up, in moderate trading, as the best-known issues stood out. 
 "It's very straightforward," Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, said. "Markets like lower interest rates and recovering economies, and this one's got both. What more do you want?"
 
Medical Issues Lag
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.78 percent yesterday after the German central bank lowered its discount rate, for lending to banks, from to 7.5 percent from 8 percent. [Page D12.]
Auto, chemical and energy stocks scored some of yesterday's best gains, with only the medical and secondary issues left behind, as the Nasdaq market was flat.
Traders spotted some foreign buyers, who usually go for the most widely held stocks, and voiced hopes that the German rate cuts would produce more foreign demand for American goods.
"Anything that is going to stimulate the European economies is going to help our multinationals," said Bill Allyn, the director of listed equity trading at Jefferies & Company.
The rally in this country followed a 3 percent gain in Tokyo stocks to the highest level this year.
Lower bond yields have fueled the American stock market's rise, as investors take on the greater risks of stocks in search of higher returns.
The Dow's advance reached 50 points late in the session before settling just 13 points shy of the record of 3,477.26 set last week. Although stocks are already expensive in terms of their earnings and dividends, several strategists look for the rally to continue and broaden.
Elaine M. Garzarelli of Shearson Lehman said that bond yields are low enough to support a rise of about 10 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which went to 451.88 yesterday, up 3.57. "The market's probably realizing that we're undervalued," she said. "It looks like fun."
Ford had the best time at yesterday's party, rising 2 7/8, to 51 5/8, with some backing from Wall Street analysts and from investors looking for companies with vast sales abroad. General Motors gained a point, to 39 3/4, and Chrysler rose 5/8, to 39 7/8.
Among the Dow industrial heavyweights adding a point or more were 3M, Du Pont, General Electric, Allied Signal and Goodyear Tire. Retailers joined in, with Sears up 1 7/8, to 52 1/2, and Woolworth up 1 1/8, to 31 7/8. The nation's three largest airline holding companies -- Delta, AMR and UAL, also gained more than a point.
Left behind were the medical stocks, which only managed to register narrower losses than earlier this week.
 
Little Nasdaq Action
 Nasdaq stocks also drew little interest, as the Nasdaq composite index gained a mere hundredth of a point to 687.41. While noting the recent enthusiasm for the biggest Big Board issues, Mary C. Farrell, a Paine Webber strategist, said a sluggish domestic economy could favor the rapidly expanding Nasdaq companies. "Growth is going to be increasingly hard to find," she said. "I think we'll play catch-up here."
Yesterday, several Nasdaq medical stocks continued falling. Tokos Medical, which provides home treatment in risky pregnancies, dropped 1 3/4, to 6 3/4, on disappointing earnings, far from the price of 34 1/2 reached last June.
Sci-Med Life Systems dropped 3 3/4, to 38 1/4, after falling 3 points on Wednesday, as a Piper Jaffray analyst downgraded it. The company, which makes equipment used in heart surgery, broke 90 early last year.
The market's more pleasant surprises included Kemper Corporation, up 5 3/8, to 36 5/8, on the company's plan to trade two insurance subsidiaries for 17.4 million shares held by the Lumbermen's Casualty Company.

HEADLINE: The U.S. Trade Deficit Widens

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The United States merchandise trade deficit worsened in January, the Government reported today. Economists said the report reflected in part the flat economies of many of America's overseas trading partners.
"Our trade deficit deteriorated in January because Europe and Japan are in the midst of a winter of severe economic discontent," John M. Albertine, head of a Washington economic forecasting firm, said. 
 The deficit widened to $7.3 billion in January, a 6 percent increase over the $6.89 billion trade gap in December, the Commerce Department reported. The increase nearly wiped out a 6.2 percent improvement a month earlier.
Exports, which reached a record $39.67 billion in December, fell back 6.7 percent in January, to $37.01 billion, the lowest level since $35.8 billion last August. Two-thirds of the decline was in aircraft and automobiles.
Imports also fell, largely due to a drop in United States purchases of foreign cars and other consumer items, and capital goods.
But the 4.8 percent decline, to $44.31 billion, was overshadowed by the decrease in shipments of American goods overseas. Imports also had hit an all-time high in December, $46.56 billion.
Analysts said the deficit, the difference between exports and imports, would worsen this year because the struggling economies in Japan and much of Europe.
Also, the slowly strengthening United States economy would provide Americans with more income and stimulate demand for overseas goods, they said.
The trade gap swelled to $84.3 billion in 1992, from $65.4 billion in 1991, the first deterioration since it peaked at $152.1 billion in 1987.

Moving 'Fortress'
The National Gallery of Art in Washington doesn't want to talk, but that's not stopping the rest of the art world. The news is the gallery's pending purchase of Bellotto's "Fortress of Konigstein," for a reported $9.5 million. The deal hangs on whether the painting will be granted an export license and allowed to leave London. It is considered British property because it has been in a private English collection for the last 150 years.
Painted between 1756 and 1758, Bellotto's landscape is one in a series of five commissioned by the Elector of Saxony, Friedrich Augustus II, for the royal collection in Dresden. The painting is large (52 1/2 by 92 3/4 inches) and is being sold to the National Gallery by Bruno Meissner, a Zurich dealer who bought the work with Konrad Bernheimer, a Munich dealer. It was the centerpiece of Mr. Meissner's booth in October at the International Antique Dealers Show in Manhattan, where it carried a price tag of $14 million. 
 The two dealers bought the picture at Sotheby's in London in December 1991 for about $6 million, and then had it cleaned by the Alte Pinakothek Museum in Munich. At the International Antique Dealers Show, Mr. Meissner said that both the Pinakothek and the National Gallery of Art in London were offered the picture.
Ruth Kaplan, who heads the press office at the National Gallery in Washington, said its purchase money was from the museum's acquisition budget. "The painting is particularly meaningful to the gallery's collection," she said. "While we have two Bellottos from the Samuel Kress collection, we do not have an 18th-century landscape of this quality and size. It is one of the great European masterpieces."
Mr. Meissner said he was optimistic that the painting would be allowed to go to Washington, adding, "No English institution has been able to raise the money to buy it."
 
Lawsuit About a Job
 More troubles at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. When Michael E. Shapiro became the director after Earl A. Powell 3d (now director of the National Gallery in Washington) in October, he was faced with an institution fraught with problems. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors had cut $2 million from the museum's operating budget, even as the institution suffered a financial setback from declining membership funds and private donations. As a result, there were staff reductions, weekday gallery closings and cancellations of coming traveling exhibitions.
The latest brouhaha erupted on Wednesday, when Maurice Tuchman, who had been the museum's senior curator for 20th-century art for 27 years, filed a lawsuit against Mr. Shapiro and the museum's trustees in Los Angeles County Superior Court, seeking damages and reinstatement in his job.
Mr. Tuchman said he had been essentially demoted, with no warning, when a memo from Mr. Shapiro informed him that his job would be the newly created post of senior curator of 20th-century drawings. Stephanie Barron, a curator in 20th-century art, has been named to Mr. Tuchman's former post.
"We understand the lawsuit has been filed," Mr. Shapiro said yesterday. "But we haven't had an opportunity to review it, therefore it would be inappropriate to comment on it at this time."
 
Bottom Lines
 The year-end figures just released by Sotheby's and Christie's show auction sales crawling out of the recession, one percentage point at a time. Overall profits for both companies, however, are down, at least if measured in American dollars.
Of the two auction houses, Christie's had slightly more encouraging news. Total sales in 1992 were $1.062 billion, up from $1.032 billion in 1991. The company's pre-tax profits amounted to $11.1 million, down from $11.3 million the year before. (In pounds, the company's profits rose to 6.7 million in 1992, from 6.4 million in 1991.)
"We were pleased that we increased our profits a touch, but we have a long way to go," said David Tyler, the group finance director of Christie's International, in a telephone interview from his London office. "We cut our costs by 22 percent over the last two years and that certainly helped."
Sotheby's figures show a small rise in its auction sales, which reached $1.132 billion in 1992, up from $1.104 billion in 1991. But the numbers for the rest of the company's business were grim, with total pre-tax profits for 1992 falling to $6.5 million, way down from 1991 when the company made $21.5 million.
"This certainly wasn't a great year," said Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's in North and South America. The reason for the nose dive in profits, Mrs. Brooks said, is the company's greatly reduced income from Acquavella Modern Art, the subsidiary of the holding company that was formed three years ago by Sotheby's and the Manhattan-based Acquavella Gallery. The holding company paid $143 million for the contents of the Pierre Matisse Gallery in Manhattan, 2,300 works by Miro, Dubuffet, Giacometti, Chagall and other 20th-century masters, and has been selling off works privately. In the last year, Mrs. Brooks said, Sotheby's has not been offering works of art from Acquavella Modern Art for sale, preferring instead to wait until the market goes up.
In the figures Sotheby's released, profits from Acquavella Modern Art are included in a category that also includes sales of art from Sotheby's own inventory. Profits in this category declined drastically, to $1.8 million in 1992 from $15.8 million in 1991 and $31.5 million in 1990.
Another reason for Sotheby's drop in profits, Mrs. Brooks said, was a reduced demand for its financial services. "We also wanted to reduce our portfolio when interest rates went down," she said.
Sotheby's also had several large expenses in 1992, including opening an auction center in Taiwan, buying the Spanish auction house Edmund Peel and installing a worldwide computer program linking all Sotheby's offices.
 
A Letter to the President
 The Whitney Biennial isn't the art world's only source of political statements. A Manhattan dealer, Richard L. Feigen, is speaking out, too, and has gotten many heavy-hitters in the arts world to join him.
In a letter faxed to President Clinton last week, Mr. Feigen suggested that artists, writers, actors, dancers, musicians, photographers and architects should have a voice in the appointment of the next chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. These groups, he wrote, have "felt disenfranchised for 30 years, since the Kennedy Administration."
The letter went on to suggest that the White House consider the actress Jane Alexander for the job, which has been vacant since Anne-Imelda Radice left it after the Presidential election.
Among those who have signed Mr. Feigen's letter are the art dealer Leo Castelli, the artists Frank Stella and Eric Fischl, the writers Norman Mailer and E. L. Doctorow, the actors Michael Douglas, Eli Wallach, Tony Randall and Lily Tomlin; Peter Martins, the artistic director of the New York City Ballet; the dancer Darci Kistler, and the architects Richard Meier and Charles Gwathmey.
"Every day more people call my office wanting their names to be included," Mr. Feigen said. "I'm about to fax the President an additional list."
 
Heading Back to SoHo
 After 10 years on 57th Street, Holly Solomon is moving her gallery back to SoHo. "I was on West Broadway from 1975 to 1983," she said. "Not only is the new space unique, but I think the artists will be more visible there. It's just to hard to create the kind of energy that you find in SoHo."
Ms. Solomon's new gallery, at 174 Mercer Street, on the corner of Houston Street, has 6,000 square feet of space with 20-foot-high ceilings. It once housed the Pineapple Dance Center.
The new gallery opens on April 3 with the work of the Korean-born video artist Nam June Paik. The show is titled "The Rehearsal" because it will feature some work that will be in the German pavilion at the Venice Biennale this summer.

HEADLINE: Films From New Directors Taking Literary License

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
The New Directors/New Films series has existed for 22 years, but it has rarely if ever led off with the literary one-two punch of tonight's opening programs, "Orlando" and "The Music of Chance."
Both films are adapted from the kind of serious novel that Hollywood has traditionally shunned as hopelessly highbrow and uncommercial. "Orlando," the debut of Sally Potter, a 43-year-old English choregrapher turned director, is a cinematic realization of Virginia Woolf's classic 1928 novel. "The Music of Chance," the first fictional feature by the documentary film maker Philip Haas, is an adaptation of a highly regarded metaphysical suspense novel, published in 1990 by the Brooklyn-based author Paul Auster. 
 On the surface, neither book would seem to lend itself readily to translation into a film. Orlando's title character, portrayed by Tilda Swinton, begins the film as a man, then changes sex midway in his/her 400-year journey into the present. Ms. Potter has filmed the novel as a series of highly stylized historical tableaux, each evoking the tyranny of rigidly defined sex roles on an androgynous spirit.
In "The Music of Chance," Mandy Patinkin and James Spader portray a firefighter turned drifter and a lowlife gambler who become unlikely partners and ultimately prisoners on the estate of two eccentric and sinister millionaires.
The two films are the opening features in the 22d edition of the New Directors series, which runs through April 4 in the Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters at the Museum of Modern Art. The series, which is jointly presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the museum's film department, will show 33 films in 22 programs. Twelve of the selections are shorts varying in length from three minutes to just less than an hour.
 
An Independent Spirit
 Like last year's New Directors series, this year's program reflects the continuing boom of the American independent cinema. Ten selections are American independent films. Among those, the boldest, technologically speaking, is Michael Almereyda's 56-minute featurette "Another Girl, Another Planet." The movie, set in an East Village tenement, was shot on a toy video camera. With its air of deadpan comic hipness, it is vaguely similar in tone to the work of Jim Jarmusch.
The series has always cultivated a quality that Richard Pena, program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center, described recently as "a certain recklessness."
"The films that seem the most attractive are films that go overboard and take it to the limit beyond what was expected," he said. "It is something one normally associates with youth, and it gives the films, even when they're unsuccessful, a welcome energy."
"In a number of this year's films, there is the sense of constructing narratives by layering," he added. "Instead of the old modernist way, in which telling a story became a problem, here people have almost too many stories to tell, and they keep telling them one on top of another."
Both "Orlando" and "The Music of Chance" evoke a theme that pulses through a surprising number of the other films being shown this year. Adrienne Mancia of the Museum of Modern Art's programming staff described that theme as entrapment.
"A lot of the characters are trapped in situations they have no control over," she observed. "It can be everything from AIDS to living in a Communist society."
 
Forms of Subversion
 Three films that evoke a feeling of being socially trapped are the British film maker Richard Spence's rough-and-tumble "You, Me and Marley," Flora Gomes's "Blues Eyes of Yonta," which is set in Africa, and Goran Markovic's "Tito and Me," from Yugoslavia.
"You, Me and Marley" unfolds on the mean streets of Belfast, where frustrated teen-agers play a death-defying street sport called joy riding, in which they steal cars and ride them to destruction. To these youths, everyone, even the Irish Republican Army, is the enemy.
"The Blue Eyes of Yonta" is set in the troubled capital city of the West African republic of Guinea-Bissau, where the economy is stagnant and the young people daydream about emigrating to Europe. "Tito and Me" is a comically irreverent look back at growing up in Communist Yugoslavia in the 1950's when Jozip Broz Tito ruled like a stern, all-seeing father. The central character is a chubby pubescent boy whose pranks subvert a solemn pilgrimage to Tito's birthplace by a group of students.
In two films, the theme of entrapment extends directly to the human body. Yilmaz Arslan's eerie documentary-style film "Passages" is set in a German rehabilitation center inhabited by troubled teen-agers with severe physical disabilities. The late French film maker Cyril Collard's autobiographical film "Savage Nights" is the story of a bisexual artist who discovers he is H.I.V.-positive and goes on a self-destructive erotic and emotional rampage.
 
Emotional Violence
 Along with "Orlando," "Savage Nights" is likely to be one of the most discussed films in this year's series. This month, the 129-minute film was awarded four Cesars (the French film industry's Oscars), including best film. Four days before the ceremonies, Mr. Collard, who wrote, directed and starred in the film, died of AIDS.
"Savage Nights" is a brutal self-portrait of the film maker, whose cinematic alter ego wreaks destruction, among other sins having unprotected sex with an 18-year-old girl without informing her of his H.I.V. status. As he seesaws between his attraction to the girl and to a 20-year-old rugby player with a streak of sadomasochism, the confusion drives several of the characters nearly haywire. Few films in recent years have been charged with so much emotional violence.
In an interview in "Muses From Chaos and Ash: AIDS, Artists, and Art" (Grove Press, 1993), the film maker talked about the freedom of expression he felt after publicly identifying himself as H.I.V.-positive.
"After an artist says, 'I'm H.I.V.-positive,' he can say anything," Mr. Collard declared. "When that taboo has been swept aside, shame or modesty no longer exists. Pure art, essential art, comes out of situations of extreme repression. And AIDS is a form of nonpolitical repression; it's a psychic repression."
 
Fidelity to Woolf
 "Orlando," although much gentler in tone than the raging erotic rebelliousness of "Savage Nights," expresses a similar sense of liberation.
Or, as Ms. Potter described her motto in a recent telephone interview from London, "empowerment through pleasure."
"I chose 'Orlando' because when I first read the book as a teen-ager, it burned a visual hole in my brain that never went away," she said. "I could see it running in my mind's eye as I read it."
"Although it was written in 1928 and covers 400 years, it is so much about this moment now," she continued. "The idea of being able to transcend normal human life is the ultimate contradiction to the fear of death for nuclear-age babies and AIDS babies."
In adapting the novel, Ms. Potter said she wanted to be "faithful to the spirit of Virginia Woolf's intent but not at all faithful to the letter of the book."
"The story line is the same," she explained. "What I've done is add motivational reasons for certain twists in the story. In the book, the changing of the sex is rather arbitrary. In the film, it comes out of Orlando's being pushed to the very edge of manhood and finding that he cannot or will not be the kind of man society demands he be. Later on, she finds out the same thing."
 
Freedom in Captivity
 If "Orlando" examines issues of freedom and repression from a sexual perspective, "The Music of Chance" takes them a notch higher to a metaphysical plane.
Mr. Haas's previous films have been documentaries of artists, including David Hockney, Richard Long, and the team of Gilbert and George. In a series of four films collectively titled "Magicians of the Earth," he also examined the work of traditional artists, including Australian aboriginal ground painters and Malagasy funerary sculptors.
"The Music of Chance," although a dramatic film, has certain stylistic links to his documentaries. It is especially clear in the scenes where the two prisoners are compelled to build a wall using stones that were once the ruins of an Irish castle.
"My documentary works are pretty formal," Mr. Haas said in a recent interview. "The care I put into making films with visual artists, I tried to translate into 'The Music of Chance,' especially in the wall and how one would film the wall."
This visual formality helps to focus the philosophical paradox that lies at the heart of the film. It is a paradox that echoes in more abstract terms some of the same ideas explored in "Savage Nights" and "Orlando."
"It is the whole issue of freedom and imprisonment," Mr. Haas said. "The central character is in a predicament. Initially he seems to have everything, but he learns that in having everything he perhaps has nothing. It is only when he is confined that he realizes a sense of freedom."

HEADLINE: A Test of Backbone for Democrats

 BODY:
Trent Lott of Mississippi and fellow Senate Republicans are on the verge of attracting enough Democratic votes to scuttle a key component of President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan. The unfortunate coalition opposes raising taxes on wealthier Social Security recipients, which President Clinton proposed as a way to trim a program that accounts for nearly one-fifth of Federal outlays. Sadly, Senate Democratic leaders are gearing up to compromise rather than fight.
There's more at stake here than just the $30 billion the tax hike is expected to raise over five years. If the Democratic leaders flinch on the first challenge to their program by a powerful interest group, the rest of the economic package could come apart at warp speed. 
 Mr. Clinton sold his economic package with the message that the pain would be spread widely. Still, it took courage to take on 30 million of the elderly by asking them to fork over -- even though he asks nothing more from them than their fair share.
The President proposes to raise the percentage of benefits subject to income tax from 50 percent to 85. The poor wouldn't be touched because families with incomes under $32,000 and individuals with incomes less than $25,000, more than three-quarters of retirees, would be exempt. The proposed hike would take away an extra 10 percent of benefits for a family in the 28 percent tax bracket.
The 85 percent figure is not arbitrary. By levying the tax in this manner, retirees would pay tax on benefits in excess of their contributions. That's the same fair principle that applies to taxation of private pensions.
Equity is on the side of Mr. Clinton and the Senate Democratic leadership. But the votes may not be. Running scared, the leaders are reportedly prepared to offer amendments that would either lower the 85 percent figure or raise the income thresholds at which the tax kicks in.
But retreat might easily backfire. It will invite every other interest group to clamor for compromise. The better option is to fight for substantial revenues from families that are rightfully asked to pay more so the President's investment program can go forward.

HEADLINE: Old Alliances, New Asia

 BODY:
North Korea's defiance of the world over nuclear inspections should remind Americans that peace in Asia can't be taken for granted. But while the reckless antics of Pyongyang's time-warp dictatorship are familiar to Washington, newer challenges have crept up on policy makers almost unnoticed. America's cold war era security treaties are inadequate to meet the challenges ahead.
China has doubled its military spending since 1988, using the money to build its first seagoing navy since the Ming Dynasty half a millennium ago. This week it threatened to attack if Taiwan moves toward independence. Japan has stretched the limits of its constitutional ban on overseas military deployment. And smaller powers like Indonesia and Malaysia have embarked on arms-buying sprees. 
 Meanwhile, ideological changes have scrambled Asia's political geography and created new diplomatic alignments -- as demonstrated by Russia's strong stand against North Korea this week.
Washington's system of bilateral mutual security treaties with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines were formulated with a monolithic Communist enemy in mind. Future conflicts are more likely to be nationalistic, potentially pitting one U.S. ally against another. America, as a Pacific power, still needs to play a central role in keeping the Asian peace. But to do so it will need new arrangements, leading toward a collective security system open to all countries prepared to play by its rules.
Unlike the cold-war treaties, collective security aims at maximum inclusion. All participating states agree to basic rules like respecting each other's borders, abiding by arms control agreements and avoiding suspicious troop movements. Participants also agree to cooperate in enforcing these rules against any transgressor.
Asian collective security was anathema to the cautious Bush Administration. But the Clinton hands have proved more receptive. They have already endorsed the regional security discussions held under the auspices of Asean, the six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. are formal Asean "dialogue partners." But that still leaves East Asian military powers like Russia, China, Vietnam and Taiwan excluded.
China's flouting of proliferation rules and Taiwan's peculiar diplomatic status might argue for proceeding without them, at least initially. But Russia surely belongs in any post-cold-war Asian security system, as its role in the Korean crisis demonstrates. And now that it is cooperating with its neighbors over Cambodia, so might Vietnam.
Asean deserves credit for starting this needed discussion. And the Clinton Administration deserves strong encouragement in taking on a more active, constructive role. The peace of Asia may well hinge on how quickly Washington updates its policies and expands its alliances.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Cutting Aid to Israel

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Israeli economists in Jerusalem are beginning to talk about a brand new problem of aid from the United States -- how and when to bring up the idea of getting not more but less.
That is not yet the policy of the Rabin Government, and may never be. And there will be a lot of back and forth about it, denials maybe, expressions of shock and similar bureaucratic blahblah. 
 But the fact is that it is being discussed in Israel, which is a compliment to the political intelligence of the specialists and officials involved.
Myself, I think it could be one of the best gifts Israel could give itself and the U.S., and the sooner the better.
Cutting back on aid from the U.S. obviously would increase Israel's immediate economic pressures. But provided Israel took the initiative it would have long-term political advantages for both countries.
Israel gets about $3 billion a year from the United States. About $1.8 billion is for loans to buy American weapons essential to Israeli defense. The rest is used to pay interest on past military loans to Israel.
Now that certainly is a nice way to get a loan, with the borrower getting another loan for the interest. But it is not the huge handout that Americans less than enamored of Israel try to make it out.
In fact, it has been a decent bargain for Washington as well as Israel. No U.S. government that did not want Israel utterly destroyed could have gone on selling scores of billions of dollars a year in weapons to the Arabs without keeping up Israeli strength.
And, of course, from the day of its birth to the fall of the Soviet Union Israel was the only dependable American military ally against Moscow in the Mideast.
For years the reality of Israeli strength gave military credibility to the United States' position in the Middle East -- and pause to the Russians.
But Americans and Israelis have to face new realities, mostly political.
The death of the Soviet Union means that the Arab states can no longer look to Moscow for free help. But for Israel that has not removed the military danger. Arab countries are stuffed with new Western arms, clearance-sale tanks from Eastern Europe and late-model Chinese missiles.
Others may forget Iran's nuclear potential for a day or two; Israelis cannot. And the price of fighting terrorism mounts every day.
For an important article on the risks involved in the peace negotiations see the April issue of Commentary. The article is by its editor, Norman Podhoretz. It is one of the few maverick dissenting pieces by pro-Israel Americans about current Israeli strategy to appear in the American press. I would give up my bow ties rather than miss an issue of this sophisticated, essential journal.
The White House, more candid than Israel's Labor Government is in public, said that peace with the Arabs could bring risks that would involve further expenditures and aid -- presumably to build new bases against the loss of the Golan Heights and much of the West Bank.
Anyway, the military loans would have to remain, for the security of both the U.S. and Israel.
But at a time when the U.S. is cutting back on aid to some countries, and facing new costs in the Bosnias and Somalias, it does not seem fitting for Israel and its American friends to insist on the same package.
It hands her enemies in the U.S. a nice new political bat. But the critical reason is for Israel's sake -- its pride, independence and self-confidence.
Mr. Clinton is warm to Israel. But differences may come. There's no sign whatsoever that he will use those differences as did Bushbaker -- to cover the Israeli Government with contempt.
This is exactly the time, when there is no pressure, for Israel to say it needs the military loans but will handle the interest costs itself, perhaps with extra help from individual foreign supporters.
The economic weight will not sink Israel, which is doing pretty well with a growth rate of about 6 percent and the potential $10 billion borrowing power of the U.S.-guaranteed loans.
The extra expense of the $1.2 billion interest might inspire Israel to move away faster from the musty Socialist dogma that has held back Israeli Governments past and present. That alone would be good value for the money.

HEADLINE: U.S. Shouldn't Push Russia Into Chaos

 BODY:
To the Editor:
After acknowledging that President Boris N. Yeltsin's "authoritarian instincts are undeniable" in "The Perfect Gift for Mr. Yeltsin" (editorial, March 10), you endorse him in his conflict with the Russian Congress of People's Deputies. You thus tell Mr. Yeltsin -- and the world -- that you will support him if he carries out his strongly implied threat to use special troops against the legislature.
You justify this on the ground that Mr. Yeltsin faces a Parliament that opposes and thwarts his economic policy. So will President Francois Mitterrand if new elections bring the opposition to power in the French National Assembly, as expected. 
 The conflict comes because the Yeltsin Government -- and the United States -- insist on economic "shock therapy": the fastest possible transition to a free market. But like the effect of sudden change of temperature on the human body, sudden economic change can bring fever or pneumonia. Years of central planning and captive markets make former Soviet industry unequipped to com pete with the world's cheapest, fastest producers. Without patience and substantial investment, Russian industry will simply fail massively, leaving general unemployment.
It will also leave a cash-hungry Russia as a quarry of raw materials and petroleum prospects at fire-sale prices. That vision attracts some investors here -- and draws mounting nationalist anger in Russia.
To win military support for imposing shock therapy, Mr. Yeltsin must buy off a restless army. He -- and we -- find ourselves accepting the very policies for which we blamed his opponents. In "There's No Oil in Bosnia" (Op-Ed, March 10), Dimitri K. Simes warns that the United States cannot take strong action to stop Serbian genocide without hurting Mr. Yeltsin's "democrats." Mr. Yeltsin has asked us for a United Nations mantle to use Russian troops in other former Soviet republics. This arouses their fears of Great Russian imperialism and has led Ukraine to balk at nuclear disarmament commitments.
It is an axiom of United States policy to support Mr. Yeltsin. But which one? President Yeltsin, the democrat who climbed on top of a tank, or Czar Boris, the autocrat who uses one? At times the bully, Mr. Yeltsin has also shown skill in compromise. It is we who have vetoed compromises in economic policy.
We can and should aid Russia -- without attaching intrusive stipulations. It is in everyone's interest that the Russians have the best chance to find their own future. Only a fraction of Mr. Yeltsin's critics favor Stalinism. It is our intervention that makes most likely an extreme reaction in which the vehement few prevail.
Democracy is a process, not a predetermined result. We should make that clear to Mr. Yeltsin -- and respect it ourselves.

HEADLINE: The Real Voting Fraud

 BODY:
"Cruel," "sad" and "pathetic." So the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, described Republican obstructionism that prompted his withdrawal of key provisions aimed at increasing voter registration among the poor and unemployed. Unless he had caved in to G.O.P. filibuster threats, he said, the entire "motor voter" bill might have been lost.
But there's still hope that the Republicans can be embarrassed into doing the right thing about broadening the franchise. The bill now goes to a conference committee. If House Democrats stick to the sound standards they have already passed, the bill would bounce back to the Senate, where the G.O.P.'s selfish objections would come under a harsh spotlight. The timid Republican moderates who have been lined up behind the minority leader, Bob Dole, would be forced to face their constituents and their consciences. 
 Three such Republican Senators could tip the balance toward wider participation in democracy: David Durenberger of Minnesota, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Bob Packwood of Oregon.
There can be no glow of principle around the G.O.P. position. Senator Dole wants to limit voting because he fears the new voters will be Democrats -- the same calculation that led President Bush to veto a similar bill last year while arguing that he was merely striking a blow against vote fraud.
The bill would require states to let people register to vote when they obtain or renew a driver's license -- a step that should dramatically increase the number of registered voters, since 90 percent of American adults have driver's licenses. The bill would also require states to permit registration by mail.
Senate Republicans did have one good idea: to make registration available at military recruiting offices. But to obtain the 60 votes needed to halt a Republican filibuster, Democrats also had to accept a handful of other amendments, the most damaging of which removed the requirement that states make registration available at welfare and unemployment offices.
To justify this slap at the poor and unemployed, the G.O.P., true to form, raised the specter of coercion and fraud but produced no evidence that these problems had increased in states that have agency registration programs.
So let House Democrats toss motor voter back to the Senate. The version that returns won't be subject to Republican amendments. That could swing the trio of Durenberger, Specter and Packwood, who have been playing a shady game trying to pose as reformers for the benefit of progressive voters back home while voting with their party to torpedo a worthy bill.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:

Social Security
Q. If you return to work after receiving Social Security retirement benefits, will your benefits change when you stop working again?
 A. ROSENBLUTH, Manhattan
 
A. Social Security retirement benefits are based on your lifetime average earnings. "If you claim retirement benefits and continue or return to work, the amounts you earn will be credited to your personal lifetime earnings record," said Joseph L. Matthews, author of "Social Security, Medicare and Pensions" (Thorndike Press, $22.95). 
 This means that when your earnings record changes, Social Security automatically recalculates your average earnings. So if the income you earn after having claimed retirement benefits increases your lifetime income average, your retirement benefits will also be recalculated upward.
 
 
 
Commissions on Securities
Q. How are the commissions figured on stock and bond purchases?
 STEPHAN A. LEOPOLD, Manhattan
 
A. Commissions on stock purchases at full-service brokers depend on the number of shares and the total dollar size of the transaction. "They range typically from under 1 percent for 200 shares at $110 to as high as 5.5 percent for 2000 shares at $2," said Madeline I. Noveck, chairman of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners.
Discount brokers offer discounts of 20 to 90 percent from the commissions charged by full-service brokers, although the latter may be negotiable. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that the exact amount be reported to you on your confirmation slip.
In most cases, there is no separate commission on bonds, which are usually sold to customers from a bond dealer's inventory. And dealers do not disclose their markup on these sales. To find out the difference, or spread, between the buy price and the sell price, get a bid from another dealer, since the selling dealer is unlikely to tell you.

 
 
Savings Bond Interest
Q. I own a large number of E bonds purchased from payroll deductions that date from 1962 through 1974. How long will they continue to earn interest and what is the rate of interest?
 LEONARD RATNER, Manhattan
 
A. Series E United States Savings Bonds issued from 1941 through November 1965 earn interest for 40 years. Bonds issued subsequently earn interest for 30 years.
In November 1982, a program was instituted under which bonds earn either a market-based variable rate if held at least five years or a guaranteed minimum rate -- whichever is higher. Older bonds were grandfathered into this program at the rate prevailing at the time they went into an extension or at the average market-based rate applying to bonds purchased before November 1982, which is 7 3/4 percent.
"All of your bonds are earning that amount for this period because the average is overriding their minimum rates, which are either 4 percent, 6 percent or 7 1/2 percent, depending on the issue date," said Richard J. Schneebeli, deputy executive director of United States Savings Bonds.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Lobbyists Scurry for a Place On the Health-Reform Train

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Politicians love to rail against the entrenched interests who are fighting health-care reform, but nowadays it is hard to find an interest group that does not present itself as a dedicated health-care reformer.
As the lobbyists put it, the train is leaving the station. The Clinton White House is 45 days from producing a comprehensive health-care plan, and the argument is no longer over whether to change the system but how. Nearly all affected interest groups have suggestions, warnings, pleas and competing visions of what the reforms should be. 
 Five big insurance companies, for example, have formed the Alliance for Managed Competition. Managed competition is the Clintons' preferred theory of health care and one that critics say is particularly favorable to big insurance companies. The American Medical Association is running advertisements declaring itself eager for "a new partnership" with the Administration to work toward its plan for "total reform." More than 200 plans for reorganizing the health-care system have been presented to the White House in recent months.
As Jim Jaffe, the press secretary for the House Ways and Means Committee, put it, "Almost everyone has abandoned the Nancy Reagan school of lobbying; rather than just saying no, they're trying to say how."
More than anything, at the moment, the lobbyists want a meeting. At last count, 240 groups -- from nursing home operators to generic drug manufacturers, from insurance agents to advocates for the disabled to supporters of a Canadian-style health system -- have met with Administration officials.
"What we're finding is that some groups want to be met with over and over and over again," said Mike Lux, who heads the White House's public liaison operation for health care.
Some, like A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials, get a private meeting with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who heads the Administration's Task Force on National Health Care Reform. Some, like the Jackson Hole Group that originated the theory of managed competition, get a visit from Ira C. Magaziner, Mrs. Clinton's top aide. Some, like the legislative council of the American Association of Retired Persons, which boasts 34 million members, get a meeting with the President. Others are herded into multi-group "round-table discussions" with Administration officials.
But the normal hierarchical distinctions do not necessarily hold; the more than 500 people in the working groups who are actually developing the plan are in many ways the most sought after. The White House has tried to keep their identities secret, by largely quarantining them in the Old Executive Office Building. But it is hard to keep a secret in Washington, and many of the members have become known.
Mr. Lux said lobbyists had tried to track down some of the working-group members at home. "We're trying to protect our folks from that as much as we can, not because we worry about them being unduly influenced, but because we want them to get their work done," he said. The lobbyists say they are simply trying to convey real-world perspective to a group heavy with academics and theoreticians.
Capitol Hill veterans say this is the struggle's mild phase: Once the Clinton plan reaches Congress in May, a wave of pleading is expected that will make "Gucci Gulch," the hallways near the committee rooms where the tax laws are written, seem subdued.
"There are 750 trade associations specifically connected with health care," said Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, a West Virginia Democrat who has been involved in the issue. "I'm just trying to run through my mind, What happens when this bill hits?"
A bill this big, not surprisingly, involves most of the heavies in the business: the Wexler Group, for example, is representing Johnson & Johnson as well as the Catholic Health Association; Patton, Boggs & Blow is representing Smithkline Beecham, Blue Cross of California and others.
 
Maneuvering by Groups
 But the action at the moment is subtle. "There's a lot of positioning, trying to sound like you're in favor of reform except for this little piece or that little piece; hoping to get your little piece," said Arnold Bennett, a spokesman for Families USA, an advocacy group pushing for universal health insurance. "And if you don't, come out swinging in May."
John Rother, the chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, said, "There's one overriding strategy right now, and that is to secure a place at the table."
The American Medical Association recently voiced frustration about its lack of access, but in an interview its executive vice president, Dr. James Todd, said the press misunderstood its complaints. "We did not want to sit on the task force or in the working groups; we want exposure to the process," he said. "We want input."
Mr. Magaziner noted last week, "There are 26 other groups who also claim to represent doctors who also want to sit at the table."
What many groups fear is that they might end up the way the drug manufacturers did last month, decidedly on the outside, lambasted by both Clintons for their profits and prices.
There is, in fact, an inside and an outside game going on among the health-care groups: the working groups and the White House are one audience, the public another. Hence the advertising campaigns undertaken by groups like the American Occupational Therapy Association. And hence the grass-roots organizing by groups like Citizen Action, which is hoping to demonstrate overwhelming public support for a single-payer, Canadian-style national health plan.
The Clintons are believed to be committed to a system of managed competition, in which individuals and employers are organized into large cooperatives to buy health care, thus supposedly maximizing their power to get a high-quality plan at the lowest price.
A program with so many moving parts, which will cover one-seventh of the economy and, in one way or another, all 250 million Americans, is riddled with pockets of potential controversy. But most of the action right now centers on two broad areas: What will be in the basic benefits package that will be guaranteed to all Americans? And what kind of controls on costs will be imposed?
 
Issue of Cost Controls
 The retired persons' group, for example, is pressing for a benefits package that covers prescription drugs and, at least down the line, long-term care. Groups like the American Psychological Association are pushing for mental-health benefits.
But the fiercest struggle centers on cost controls. The medical association, for example, is strongly opposed to strict price controls or a national "budget" for health care. So are a range of other industry groups, including some of the big insurers that back managed competition. Most of these groups have carried this message to Mr. Magaziner and any other Administration official who will listen.

HEADLINE: Kenneth Boulding, an Economist, Philosopher and Poet, Dies at 83

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Kenneth Boulding, a much-honored but unorthodox economist, philosopher and poet, died yesterday. He was 83.
His assistant, Vivian Wilson, said Professor Boulding, who had taught at the University of Colorado in Boulder since 1977, died at his home after a long bout with cancer. 
 Nominated at different times for Nobel Prizes in both peace and economics, Professor Boulding was renowned less for a single contribution to economics than for a large number of interesting intellectual and moral insights that both charmed and challenged his fellow social scientists.
In addition to writing three dozen books, three volumes of poetry and 800 articles, Professor Boulding -- whose white mane, stammer and pointed wit made him distinctive -- lectured frequently and entertainingly.
"Ken Boulding is like wine that can't be shipped very far," said Mancur Olson, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland. "His talks, his writing were so full of brilliant asides that no summary does them justice."
 
Early Successes
 The son of a plumber, Kenneth Ewart Boulding was born in grimy Liverpool, England, in 1910. He won a chemistry scholarship to Oxford, said Mark Blaug, professor emeritus at the University of London, but soon switched to economics. In 1931, at age 22, he had his first paper -- a short but brilliant work on economics -- accepted by the Economic Journal, edited by John Maynard Keynes, the British economist.
After fellowships at Harvard University and the University of Chicago and a short spell teaching at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, Professor Boulding came to the United States for good. He taught at several colleges around the country before settling at the University of Colorado.
Like the American economist Paul Samuelson and the British economist Nicholas Caldor, Professor Boulding initially concentrated on adding his own insights to Keynes's theory that depressions are due to too little private spending and that governments should run deficits to end them.
His first book, "Economic Analysis," was an introductory textbook that over four editions between 1941 and 1966 blended Keynesian and neoclassical economic theory into a coherent synthesis. Professor Blaug said the book was "remarkable in showing how far one can go in economics by using no tool more complicated than that of demand and supply."
Professor Boulding, from a family of deeply religious Methodists, became a Quaker as a young man and remained a passionate if unconventional Christian throughout his life. An ardent pacifist, he opposed Word War II and lost his wartime post as an economist at the League of Nations.
 
Concerns Beyond Economics
 His spiritual and philosophical concerns ultimately led him to look far beyond economics. "Imagine someone who was half Milton Friedman, half Mahatma Ghandi," said Professor Olson, who knew Professor Boulding well and credits him for influencing his own work.
Professor Boulding invented new areas of economics, including the economics of peace, and published a book of that title in 1945. (An Ayer edition is still in print.)
Professor Boulding won the John Bates Clark Medal of the American Economic Association in 1949, a prize given every two years to the economist under age 40 judged to have made a significant contribution to economic thought. The award was recognition that Professor Boulding was one of the best and brightest of his generation of economists. After that, he increasingly wandered from the traditional concerns of economics
"He left economics," said Wassily Leontief, himself a Nobel Prize winner in economics. "He became a universal philosopher."
Though an outsider among modern economists, Professor Boulding was heaped with many honors. He became president of the American Economic Association in 1968 and was awarded dozens of honorary degrees.
Part of his charm was his rare diversity. He wrote rhymed poetry (one of his books was entitled "Beasts, Ballads and Bouldingisms"), sculptured, painted water colors and, friends said, used to sing entire Gilbert and Sullivan musicals from memory and could recite nearly all of Wordsworth.
Professor Boulding is survived by his wife, Dr. Elise M. Boulding, a professor emerita of sociology at Dartmouth College; five children, J. Russell, of Bloomington, Ind., Mark, of Denver, Philip, of Olalla, Wash., William, of Durham, N.C., and Christie Boulding-Graham of Wayland, Mass., and 16 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Zaire President Reneges on Multiparty Pact

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, March 19

 BODY:
President Mobutu Sese Seko announced plans today to resurrect his one-party Parliament, effectively tearing up a fragile pact.
He said he would convene the National Assembly "very soon" to debate a draft constitution that would guide Zaire to multiparty democracy. 
 President Mobutu, who says the hard-line opposition to him is in disarray, acted boldly two days after defying key foreign capitals to appoint a new Prime Minister to replace Etienne Tshisekedi.
Parliament, made up entirely of Mr. Mobutu's party, was supposed to be defunct, replaced by the High Council of the Republic, an interim assembly.
The council met today to respond to Mr. Mobutu's initiative, which would reduce it to a marginal role.
The President, who has used guile and force to stay in power since 1965, announced his new strategy in a televised speech closing a "political conclave" he convened on March 9.
He said Zaire's political class had shown in the last 10 days that it was "sufficiently mature and capable to resolve its internal conflicts without foreign interference."
He pledged to cooperate fully with the new Prime Minister chosen by the conclave, Faustin Birindwa, who would be "totally responsible" for economic, financial and administrative policy.
The President has refused pressure from the United States, Belgium and France to reappoint Mr. Tshisekedi.

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats Deflect First G.O.P. Budget Shots

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
With President Clinton's five-year budget plan safely through the House, Democrats turned today to defend the proposal against Republican attacks in the Senate, easily rejecting an attempt to freeze spending on many domestic programs at their current levels.
Congressional aides predicted tougher battles before a final vote on the budget resolution is held late next week. The most difficult may be a Republican attempt to strike the budget's most contentious tax proposal, an increase on the Social Security benefits of better-off retirees. 
 But Democrats appear confident, given the trend of early votes on the budget resolution, that it will survive the Senate intact. "We seem to be weathering the storm," said one Senate Democratic aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, "and the White House is putting a lot of effort into holding the votes" of potential Democratic defectors.
 
Guerrilla Warfare Role
 For their part, Republicans seem resigned to playing the role of guerrilla warriors in this budget battle, harassing the Democratic majority without inflicting any lasting damage to Mr. Clinton's plan on taxes and spending.
"We're going to start shooting real bullets when the package passes and that'll be in the Finance Committee," Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said today.
He was referring to the nitty-gritty of the Federal budget process, the line-by-line writing of tax laws and detailed spending bills. That process will come after next week's probable passage of the broad, deliberately vague budget resolution setting overall spending goals.
Mr. Clinton spent part of his day celebrating the House's passage late Thursday and early today of his budget and a $16.3 billion jobs bill. Both swept through the House on essentially party-line votes, getting Mr. Clinton's budget off to the quickest start of any President since Ronald Reagan submitted his first spending plan in 1981.
The jobs bill was declared to be emergency legislation, a move that allows the money to be spent without violating the letter of legal limits on deficit spending.
Today the President played host to 100 House Democrats, jubilant but still bleary from their bout of wee-hours legislating, at a coffee-and-Danish breakfast at the White House.
 
'Moving to the Future'
 Commending them for acting "with unbelievable dispatch," Mr. Clinton said the House vote proved that Democrats "don't have to spend our time posturing and divided and running for cover instead of moving to the future."
He added: "It is a wonderful beginning. But I think it's important to remember that it's just a beginning; that you have to encourage your colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to act."
Later, in Atlanta to stump for his economic proposals, he asked local business executives to ignore his Republican critics. He called them "guardians of gridlock" whose only pleasure is "to hear the gears squeal."
Many members of Georgia's Democratic Congressional delegation were on hand to meet with Mr. Clinton. Notably absent was Senator Sam Nunn, who was one of five Democrats to side with Republican critics of the President in the one Senate vote of any importance today.
On that vote, the Senate killed an amendment by Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, that would have imposed a five-year spending freeze on most discretionary domestic programs, like education and agriculture. It would have left untouched spending for the military and such mandatory programs as Medicaid.
Republicans argued that the measure would cut $104 billion from the budget proposal over five years. It was designed to appeal to conservative Democrats, some of whom say the budget plan's stated goal -- to lower the Federal deficit to $200 billion a year from $300 billion a year by 1998 -- is too modest. The conservatives say Mr. Clinton relies too much on new taxes and too little on spending cuts to reach that goal.
While four Democrats joined Mr. Nunn in voting against a motion to kill the amendment, four Republicans deserted Mr. Grassley, giving the Democrats more than enough votes to bury the amendment.
 
Energy Plan Challenged
 The Democrats suffered a slightly greater scare late Thursday when Republicans tried to pull down one of Mr. Clinton budget's pillars, a proposed tax on oil, coal and other forms of energy that would raise $71.4 billion by 1998.
That amendment failed by a narrower margin, 53 to 46. But Republicans and Democrats alike said today that the vote was a bellwether of Senate Democrats' solidarity on the budget, and that not even a fight over the Social Security tax is likely to pry many lawmakers from Mr. Clinton's side.
The House's Democrats drove that point home with a little levity this morning in their meeting with the President. When Mr. Clinton strode into their meeting room, greeting them with a cheery, "Good morning," the Congressmen responded in kind and in unison, like an obedient class of kindergartners.
Then they all burst into guffaws.

BOMBING PROFILE: MISSING SUSPECT
Mahmud Abouhalima, a missing suspect in the World Trade Center bombing, was known at work as a taxi driver with an attitude. On one March day two years ago, he racked up six separate summonses for failing to post his identity in his cab, driving with suspended licenses and tinkering with the taxi meter. But among Brooklyn's circle of militant Arab immigrants, who consider it a duty to struggle against what they consider infidel Middle Eastern governments, he was known as one of the committed. Page 1.
VAN PIECES ARE KEYS TO BLAST PUZZLE
In a makeshift workroom beneath the World Trade Center, yards from where a bomb carried by a Ryder van exploded last month, blowing the van to bits, investigators move over an identical van, trying to match parts. They are identifying scraps of the original Ford Econoline 350 van that could lead them to new suspects, strengthen ties to those already under arrest and shed light on how the bombing was carried out. Page 24.
WOODY ALLEN AND MIA FARROW IN COURT
As the custody battle between Mia Farrow and Woody Allen went to trial, the two appeared in open court for the first time since their dispute began. With Ms. Farrow watching, Mr. Allen testified about the disintegration of the couple's relationship, his affair with her daughter and his own views of children. Page 25.
POLICE RESCUE CRACK SUSPECT'S CHILDREN
Two small children who were left without supervision in a garbage-strewn and roach-infested apartment in Kensington, Brooklyn, were found by the police after their father was arrested for selling crack to an undercover detective, the authorities said. Page 24.

TRADER'S TRICKS FOR CLEANER AIR
Now that that the right to pollute can be bought, sold or traded, it can also be retired. A Connecticut utility plans to donate about $3 million worth of pollution allowances to chapters of the American Lung Association. And that organization will, in turn, give the allowances to volunteers and donors in the form of "Atmosphere Savings Bonds," each worth one ton of pollution that will never be emitted. Page 26.
DISPUTE OVER CAUSE OF A WOMAN'S DEATH
Three years ago, when the battered body of 20-year-old Susan Negersmith was found in Wildwood, N.J., the medical examiner concluded she died of acute alcohol poisoning and exposure. But private investigators, attracted to the case because of news accounts, say her death was a classic rape-homicide, and they are working to have the death certificate altered. Page 26.

HEADLINE: Trade Center Jigsaw Puzzlers Find How Bits Made a Van

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
In a shadowy, makeshift workroom beneath the World Trade Center, yards from where a bomb carried by a Ryder rental van exploded last month, blowing the van to bits, investigators move over an identical yellow van, trying to match parts.
Holding piece after crumpled piece next to corresponding parts of the unscarred van, they are performing a crucial part of the overall investigation, identifying scraps of the original Ford Econoline 350 van that could lead them to new suspects, strengthen ties to those already under arrest and shed light on how the bombing was carried out. 
 "The goal is to piece together as much of the van as we can," said Lieut. Gerald B. Sheehan, commander of the New York City Police Department's Arson Explosion Squad as he stood yesterday in the tiny room, dimly lighted with construction lights that have been strung with wire. "And as we work, we are finding that there are numerous leads coming out of this examination."
Perhaps the most important leads came only two days after the blast, when a team of investigators from the police department's Bomb Squad, the F.B.I. and the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms discovered a piece of mangled chassis bearing a partial vehicle identification number.
That number was traced to a yellow van from a Ryder rental agency in Jersey City, and then to Mohammed A. Salameh, a 25-year-old man who had rented the van and who was later arrested and charged in connection with the bombing.
 
40 Percent of Van Is Found
 The police say the yellow van was used to carry a huge bomb into the center's underground garage, where it exploded on Feb. 26, leaving six people dead and more than 1,000 injured.
Since then, investigators, using the matching technique and comparing identification numbers the manufacturer stamps on car parts, have found bits of what they estimate to be 40 percent to 50 percent of the van.
"Out of the 20 to 30 parts that the guys sifting wreckage bring us each day, we find three or four pieces that are good ones," said Sgt. James Torrens, who runs the Police Department's Auto Crime division and who is working with Federal investigators. "We couldn't work without this van. We'd have to use part numbers alone and it would take much longer. This helps narrow it down."
So far, other investigators say, judging from the areas where they have identified van parts, they have been able to place the van facing west, on the B-2 level near the ramp.
 
How It Was Made and Set Off
 Shapes of the fragments and traces of chemicals found on them, analyzed in police and F.B.I. laboratories, are also helping investigators confirm theories about the bomb's components, and how it was detonated.
"It's a classic approach to solving these crimes and a very good one," said Clayton McManaway, a former State Department counterterrorism official who is now a vice president for the Fairfax Group, a company in Washington specializing in international investigations and security.
"In Pan Am 103 they put 90 percent of the aircraft back together and in the process were able to determine where the bomb was," he said. "That's not as important in the van, but it might tell them what kind of bomb it was and what kind of device was used to set it off."
In the Pan Am bombing, which left 270 people dead in December 1988, Scottish and American forensic experts examined hundreds of thousands of bits of debris combed from an 845-square-mile area where the wreckage fell to earth. That evidence led them to two Libyan intelligence agents, who were later charged.
 
Wires Like Jungle Vines
 The trade center workroom, built from plaster and wood and set up just steps from the yawning crater where steel pipes and wires hang like jungle vines, is hauntingly stark.
On the side of the yellow van, jacked six inches off the ground to let workers slide underneath, investigators have taped a photocopy of the blasted van's Alabama license plate. They also removed the van's grill, front fender and right side panel, and these now sit in a corner of the room, to allow them to compare the charred parts with internal parts of the van.
Otherwise, two wooden tables, covered with flashlights, hardhats and boxes of mangled metal, and six chairs are the workroom's only decor.
And as the weeks have worn on, and workers have cleared rubble down to the bottom of the five-level garage, the discovery of van parts is slowing as well. Many parts may have been blown into undetectable fragments. Investigators have yet to determine the kind of device or fuse that was used to detonate the bomb.
"In the early stages, it was very very exciting because we were finding so much," Lieutenant Sheehan said. "Now we are just putting the pieces of this puzzle together."

HEADLINE: In Busy Day, Blue Chips Outpace Rest of Market

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
The lumbering industrial giants continued to march ahead of the rest of the market yesterday, as the Dow stocks advanced slightly but most others lagged.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1.70 points, to 450.18, and Big Board decliners outnumbered advancing issues, but the Dow Jones industrial average gained 5.94 points, to 3,471.58. As on Thursday, the Dow ventured to within about a point of a record before pulling back. 
 The quarterly expiration of options and futures on stock indexes and options on individual stocks, known as the triple witching hour, was reflected much more in trading volume than in stock prices. The total volume of 339.7 million shares, up from 241.2 million in recent days, was followed by a record 46.6 million in a special after-hours session reserved for trading baskets of 15 or more stocks at once. Until yesterday, the busiest basket session had been on Jan. 14, with 24.4 million shares traded.
 Some of yesterday's better gains came among gold and energy stocks, which have trailed the market but are now seen as good values. The underlying commodities offer some protection against inflation as well.
Among gold issues, Newmont Mining was up 1 1/8, to 44; Homestake Mining was up 3/8, to 13 3/4; Placer Dome was up 5/8, to 14 3/8, and Echo Bay rose 1/4, to 6.
Energy stocks were generally, but not unanimously, up, with Louisiana Land and Exploration gaining 1 5/8, to 44, and Amoco advancing 7/8, to 57 1/8.
Gold and oil prices have moved up only modestly, but the stocks sometimes gain before the commodities.
The Dow's modest advance was paced by Eastman Kodak, up 1, to 56, and International Paper, up 3/8, to 65 1/8.
Health issues continued to be the market's losers, with Abbott Laboratories down 1 5/8, to 23 7/8; Johnson & Johnson down 1, to 39 1/4, and Schering-Plough off 3/4, to 57 3/8. On the Nasdaq, U.S. Healthcare fell 1 3/4, to 41, and Chiron dropped 2 1/4, to 50 1/2.
 As the day went, so went the week, with the Dow up nearly 44 points, or 1.3 percent, but the S.& P. 500 was up less than a point. The Dow reached a high of 3,477.26 on March 10.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 4.69 points yesterday and about 10 points for the week, to 682.72, with consistent weakness among the medical and computer technology stocks.

HEADLINE: A Railroad Man With the Heart of a Gambler

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
It's 7:15 on a recent morning and the Metro-North train to Manhattan has just departed Chappaqua. A commuter, dozing between pages of his Harry Truman biography, is awakened by the booming voice of a lanky man sprawled across the adjacent seat talking to a companion. "I'm sorry if we've disturbed you," the man says to the sleepy neighbor. "Would you like us to move?"
A scene from one of those Metro-North commercials where real-life conductors plug the tranquillity of their trains? Not quite. But the apologetic man does work for the railroad. In fact, he runs it. 
 He is Peter E. Stangl, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Metro-North's parent agency. And every morning he rides the rails from his home in Westchester County to his office in Manhattan, silently noting torn seats, broken air-conditioners, graffiti-scarred doors and surly service. There is, he insists, less to report on each.
"To the extent you can experience what your customers do is important," Mr. Stangl said. "It's a good system, and it's getting better all the time."
Exuberant, excitable and slightly offbeat -- he once quit a high-level job to shoot pool for 10 months -- Mr. Stangl is a walking, talking advertisement for the $5 billion transportation empire he has led for two years, which includes the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, the Long Island Rail Road, the New York City Transit Authority and the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.
In the coming weeks, his salesmanship will be severely tested in Albany. The Transit Authority is facing a projected $250 million deficit, and without state help, M.T.A. officials say, bus and subway fares will rise by 25 cents to $1.50 on April 4. Although a fare increase is considered unlikely, Mr. Stangl has another, more ambitious request: $9.6 billion for a five-year program to rebuild stations and replace equipment. And he has asked the Legislature for broad new controls over how the agency spends money.
A tough sell even in good times, Mr. Stangl's program faces a particularly skeptical Legislature this year. For starters, the system is not in the dire shape it was 11 years ago when the Legislature financed the first of two capital plans. And the state has its own projected $3.7 billion deficit.
The political mix has changed as well. The Legislature has lost its most outspoken supporter of mass transit, Jerrold Nadler, to Congress. And the Assembly has had an influx of suburban and upstate Democrats whose concerns about roads and bridges could ally them with the Republican-controlled Senate against New York City Democrats in the tug-of-war for transportation dollars.
For New York City transit riders, Mr. Stangl has emerged as their leading advocate in Albany. But while he has brought a certain flair to the job, his critics and even many supporters express concerns about his ability to win the tough political battles ahead.
"His core concepts are winners," said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, a riders' group. "The test for Stangl will be whether he hangs in there, whether he keeps pressing even when the issue isn't hot."
With his toothy smile, lean face and hyperactive hands, Mr. Stangl, 51, bears a striking resemblance to a notable Westchester commuter of yesteryear: Rob Petrie of "The Dick Van Dyke Show." Born in Waterbury, Conn., Mr. Stangl put himself through the University of Connecticut by working in a dairy plant and playing poker. After teaching college economics for two years, he joined the administration of New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1970 as a budget analyst and became an expert in transportation issues.
 
Different Smoke-Filled Room
 In 1978, he confounded friends by quitting his job as assistant commissioner for public transportation in New Jersey to shoot pool for 10 months in musty halls from Trenton to 14th Street in Manhattan. He just wanted some time to himself, he said.
"Friends started to think I was crazy, and they worried about my career," he said. "I said, 'It's fun. The career will take care of itself.' "
To some colleagues, the hiatus was typical of what they called Mr. Stangl's noncomformist, irreverent style. "Peter was the guy who never wore a tie, seldom wore a sports coat and often wouldn't wear socks in the summer," said Thomas Downs, the New Jersey Commissioner of Transportation, who worked for the M.T.A. in the late 1980's. "That's just Peter."
In 1980 Mr. Stangl joined the M.T.A., and he become president of Metro-North three years later. In his eight-year tenure, on-time performance improved to 94 percent from 80 percent and ridership increased by 21 percent, according to the M.T.A. Critics of the system were won over by his amiable, open-minded style.
"He accepts criticism from riders," said Jo Ann Katzban of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A., a transit riders' group. "Others would say: 'Nothing is wrong' or 'We didn't do it.' Peter says: 'You're right. Bear with us.' "
When he was chosen by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1991 to replace Robert R. Kiley, who was retiring as M.T.A. chairman, Mr. Stangl inherited a system that had already been pulled from the brink of collapse. No longer faced with chronic track fires, derailments and breakdowns, Mr. Stangl set a new goal: to stop cutting service and instead make it more convenient and affordable.
He began by packaging dozens of ideas for improvements -- some new, many old -- under a catchy rubric: "Fare Deal." Announcements would be clearer. Dowdy stations would be spruced up, decrepit ones overhauled. Drivers, conductors and token-booth clerks would become more helpful and courteous.
 
New Deal, Old Hurdles
 The program's centerpiece would be a computerized fare-collection system that would enable the M.T.A. to eliminate dual-fare zones, offer reduced rates to frequent riders and make transfers from commuter lines to subways and buses easier.
Two years into Fare Deal, most of the improvements remain years off, largely because the agency still does not have a multiyear capital plan. Last year, the Legislature financed only a one-year, $1.6 billion plan.
Mr. Stangl says he will not be satisfied if the Legislature only holds down the fare this year -- which, in the midst of a mayoral election, is considered highly likely -- without the multiyear building program.
"I am tired of people coming back from Paris and saying how wonderful that system is," he said. "We have the vision for it, but you've got to continue the investment to make it happen."
Some legislators contend that Mr. Stangl must tighten M.T.A. spending before a major plan is approved. "What we're dealing with here is an agency that's like a fire-eating dinosaur, a relic of another age," said Senator Norman J. Levy, a Nassau County Republican who is chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. "Only it doesn't eat fire, it eats money."
Mr. Levy, whose support is essential to any M.T.A. plan, said he supports holding the fare at $1.25 for the next two years and financing a $9.6 billion capital plan, although there are questions about how his plan would be financed. But he has also proposed legislation to dramatically increase state regulation of the agency, a plan opposed by Mr. Stangl.
Some critics also say Mr. Stangl needs to take stronger stands against his patron, Mr. Cuomo, who angered mass-transit advocates by calling for a $1 billion cut in the M.T.A.'s capital plan. Some say they think Mr. Stangl is worried that Mr. Cuomo will not ask him to continue in the $150,000 post when his term ends on June 30.
And to some, Mr. Stangl may be too affable to play political hardball. "He's a capable man, a good railroad man, he just hasn't gotten angry enough to fight," said Sonny Hall, president of the Transport Workers Union, the M.T.A.'s largest union. "It's not his style, and that's the problem."
Seasoned gambler that he is, Mr. Stangl does not publicly reveal what he thinks of his critics. Instead, he is quick to praise them and change the subject. "I continue to be frustrated by this we-they mentality," he said. "To me, it's all we."

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Fall in Profit Taking

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Treasury market retreated yesterday as profit taking and fears of inflation eroded Thursday's surge in prices.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond, which jumped 12/32 on Thursday, was off 5/16 point yesterday, or $3.13 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield rose to 6.81 percent, from 6.78 percent late Thursday. 
 Market participants said Treasury prices began to lose ground after Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve governor, said that the economy might be in better shape than had been believed.
He said the economy was "closer to full employment than we might expect." A healthy economy could aggravate inflation and decrease the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates.
And the selloff was driven by profit taking after Thursday's rally.
Also hurting bonds was a continued rise in the daily Commodity Research Bureau price index, which is considered a barometer of inflation.
By afternoon, volume thinned as traders hesitated to take large positions before the weekend.
"Even though there's been a lot of up-and-down movement in the market, it's not going anywhere," said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Medium-term Treasury notes led yesterday's decline. Short-term maturities were off between 3/16 and 9/32 , and intermediate maturities were off between 1/2 and 17/32 , the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 4.44, to 1,295.91.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 3.01 percent, as the discount rose three-tenths of a percentage point, to 2.96 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 3.15 percent, as the discount added half a percentage point, to 3.07 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 3.30 percent, as the discount rose six-tenths of a percentage point, to 3.19 percent.
Prices of tax-exempt municipal bonds ended slightly higher, although there were concerns over higher inflation and an oversupply of new and already issued securities. Towns and cities plan to sell more than $7 billion in new bonds next week.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Campaign to Stress Control of the Schools

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that his re-election campaign would be a crusade to give the mayor control over the Board of Education, which he said had become "sidetracked and politicized."
By focusing on who would control the schools, Mr. Dinkins appeared to stake his political fortune on his belief that most New Yorkers support the initiatives begun by the outgoing Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, whose proposals ignited a backlash among conservative board members that led to his ouster. 
 In a speech to the Citizens Budget Commission that laid out themes Mr. Dinkins expects to use in his campaign, the Mayor sought to blame the board for the school system's problems.
"That's why, this fall, I will wage an all-out campaign within a campaign to change our system of school governance, to give the mayor the majority of appointees to the Board of Education, to make the mayor more accountable for performance in our schools," Mr. Dinkins said.
"I want this fall's election to be a referendum on school governance," he said.
The school board ousted Mr. Fernandez in a 4-to-3 vote because, among other things, he imposed a grade-school curriculum that teaches respect for homosexuals.
Some political strategists have predicted that the movement to remove Mr. Fernandez would also damage Mr. Dinkins politically, since the Mayor supported the curriculum. By campaigning against the school board, the Mayor appears to be trying to divert the anger over the plight of the schools away from himself.
Mr. Dinkins's thrust at the school board comes while the teachers' union, whose contract talks are mired in an impasse over wages, has been attacking him in television commercials, depicting him as a Mayor who cares little about education. The union, which supported Mr. Dinkins in 1989, opposes the Mayor's proposal to give himself control over the board but is willing to consider changes in the size of the board.
Bill Lynch Jr., the Mayor's campaign manager, said yesterday that the two main themes of Mr. Dinkins's campaign would be improving schools and creating jobs, just as he ran in 1989 on a promise to be "the toughest mayor on crime."
Mr. Dinkins's political rivals said he had underestimated the breadth of unhappiness among voters over the rainbow curriculum and the discontent over the state of public education. The school board's vote reflected a groundswell against using the schools to advance socially liberal philosophies and in favor of a return to basic education, they said.
"At this point in the debate it would be a mistake for David Dinkins to argue for more power for himself," Rudolph W. Giuliani, the expected Republican candidate, said. "After all, what just happened was his approach and his agenda was rejected. I believe one of the things we should have learned from the dispute is that the local governments are asking for more discretion and the ability to shape the system."
But Mr. Dinkins argues that because his hands have been tied by the structure of the school board he cannot be held responsible for the quality of education. The mayor appoints two members to the board and each borough president appoints one.
"It's real simple," he said. "A fourth of our budget goes to education. They look to the mayor to raise the money for it, and many people hold the mayor responsible for the condition of the schools. I say then give me the authority."
One reason Mr. Dinkins is seeking to move the battleground to education is that he believes that the city's declining crime rates during the last two years prove he has succeeded on that front. During his speech yesterday at the Inter-Continental Hotel, Mr. Dinkins asserted that while people may still perceive crime as rampant, the statistics prove that his hiring of 3,000 police officers has reduced violence.
"Without suggesting we are satisfied, people need to know that crime is in fact down," he said. "The fact is there is not a crime wave and crime is down and we have got to some way or another make that point."
Mr. Dinkins's speech signaled that decisions about the schools will be an important arena for the contestants this fall. Mr. Giuliani, who has criticized the rainbow curriculum because it introduces homosexuality as a topic at a young age, has said he will push for policies that give local communities more control over curriculum rather than less.
On the Democratic side, Mr. Dinkins's challenger, Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President, favors the rainbow curriculum. But he has sharply criticized the Mayor for reducing the education budget and failing to reach a contract with the teachers.
"Who's he kidding?" said Phil Friedman, a political consultant to Mr. Stein. "For him to make education a main theme is like Richard Nixon to make honesty in government a main theme."

HEADLINE: Trade Confrontations Averted on Two Fronts;
Washington Says Japan Meets Goal On Chip Imports

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
A trade confrontation that had been looming for years was unexpectedly defused today when American officials announced that the Japanese had met a target for imports of computer chips.
Imports accounted for 20.2 percent of the Japanese semiconductor market during the fourth quarter of last year, exceeding the 20 percent target set in a 1991 trade agreement, said Donald H. Phillips, the assistant United States trade representative for industry. 
 The American semiconductor industry, which accounts for 85 percent of Japan's computer chip imports, has fought for seven years for the 20 percent overall foreign share, enlisting the aid of the Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations. The issue had become the most sensitive point in the tense trade relations between the world's two largest economies.
 
Only 15.9% in 3d Quarter
 The foreign share of the nearly $20 billion Japanese market had reached only 15.9 percent by the third quarter of last year. Until Thursday night, when the final calculations were done, Government and industry officials assumed that the fourth-quarter figures would also fall short, leading to speculation that the Clinton Administration might impose sanctions against Japanese exports to the United States.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said today that the abrupt increase in the fourth quarter reflected a significant contraction of the overall Japanese semiconductor market while sales by American companies continued their long, slow climb.
"There was more shrinkage than anyone expected, and more growth," he said at a news conference this afternoon.
The American semiconductor industry welcomed the improvement.
"It marks a level of openness in the Japanese market that numerous people in the American and Japanese Governments and industries have been working very hard to reach since the mid-80's," said James Norling, the chairman of The Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents American producers and is based in San Jose, Calif.
Non-Japanese companies held only 14.3 percent of the market in 1991, when the current agreement was negotiated, and less than 9 percent in 1986, when a pact was reached calling for a 20 percent share by 1991. Both agreements were aimed at reducing formal and informal trade barriers and used market shares as an indicator of whether this was being accomplished.
The 20 percent figure became the American target in 1986 as a compromise between the American industry's estimate that it would hold 25 to 35 percent of the Japanese market without trade barriers, while Japanese officials did not want a target at all.
In addition to the United States, the European Community and South Korea have small shares of the Japanese semiconductor market.
Mr. Phillips said that total sales of semiconductors in Japan for all of last year were $19.4 billion, but he declined to provide figures for the fourth quarter for either the entire market or the American share.
Mr. Kantor said that the fourth-quarter import increase appeared to be sustainable, and that he had seen no indications that it might have been the result of stockpiling by Japanese semiconductor users seeking to reach the 20 percent target.
But semiconductor industry officials have also noted that computer chip prices in recent months have been higher in the United States, where personal computer production is booming, than in Japan, where the economy is stagnant. As a result, there has been an incentive for Japanese companies to send as much of their production as possible to the United States, leaving room for foreign companies to sell more chips in Japan.
Stanton Anderson, a longtime Washington lawyer for the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, which represents semiconductor users and producers there, said that future market share figures were hard to predict.
"Obviously we're pleased by this, but it doesn't mean that this number is going to stay there as the Japanese economy comes back," he said. "I'm sure it's sustainable in the long term -- whether it's sustainable on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I just can't tell."
Mr. Anderson repeated the contention of Japanese officials that their semiconductor market was open and not subject to Government controls, so that market shares might fluctuate unpredictably.
Japanese officials in Tokyo and Washington have stated repeatedly in recent days their dismay at the attention focused on the 20 percent figure. They have vowed to resist any American efforts to set any target for future sales of semiconductors or any other product.
A Presidential advisory committee on trade, composed of the heads of three dozen multinationals as well as academics and labor leaders, recommended earlier this year that fixed import targets be used more often with Japan.
Mr. Kantor avoided answering questions today about whether the United States would try to set a new target for semiconductor or other industries. He pointed out that the 1991 agreement lasts for three more years and that it calls for "gradual and steady improvement" in the non-Japanese market share.
"The implication is that 20 percent would be the average we would achieve," and that the United States market share will continue to climb, he said.
Mr. Norling of the semiconductor association made a similar point in a statement today.
"The steady improvement over 20 percent foreign share will be evidence that the Japan market is increasingly open," said Mr. Norling, who is also the head of Motorola's semiconductor division.
Japanese officials and their American lawyers have argued that the 20 percent figure should not be paramount. Mr. Anderson said that market share figures were a poor indication of overall access.
And Seiichiro Noboru, the economics minister at the Japanese Embassy in Washington, was quick to point out that the agreement called for steady overall improvement in foreign access to the Japanese market, and did not refer specifically to the 20 percent figure.
"The purpose of the agreement is not only market share -- equally important is the industry-to-industry cooperation," he said. "Progress does not only mean change of the figure."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Chrysler Gets Serious About Luxury Cars

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RUTHERFORD, Calif., March 19

 BODY:
Auto makers stake their reputations on luxury cars, their flagships. In 1989, when the Chrysler Corporation introduced a new Imperial, the boxy, stretched version of the outdated K-car seemed to embody the company's condition, which appeared critical at the time. In contrast, Chrysler's introduction here this week of its New Yorker and LHS sedans is being greeted as a return to the promised land.
The Imperial, decorated with vinyl on its vinyl and plastic froufrou, prompted sneers and giggles from cogniscenti, who deemed it unworthy of comparison with Lexus, Mercedes, Cadillac or Lincoln. Similarly, the New Yorker and LHS are essentially longer versions of Chrysler's new midsize sedans: the Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision. 
 But automotive analysts and critics say that Chrysler has seemed to learn its lesson from the Imperial. For its latest luxury offerings, the auto maker did not scrimp on the styling, creature comforts and engineering attributes that luxury buyers expect; it priced the New Yorker and LHS from $25,000 to about $30,000, a range that should make it highly competitive with domestic and imported luxury brands.
Reviewers from enthusiast magazines and the Wall Street analysts and portfolio managers who gathered here to compare the new cars with other luxury brands were impressed. "The Mercedes was the only car I thought was better," said Ronald A. Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco. "For my taste, it's a better car for less money."
Kathy Hamilton, senior editor of Automobile magazine, said, "Road noise was a little strong for a luxury car," but added, "The styling is striking, handling is good and there's not much out there that's good and fun to drive for $30,000."
A critical question is whether the models will have enough prestige. "These are cars for 50-year-olds who listened to Joan Baez when they were growing up," Mr. Glantz said. "They owned Beetles. Now they want nicer cars, but a Lexus is too much."
For most of the 1980's, the Chrysler name came to signify, for many consumers, second-rate, working-class cars. (The company did win over more affluent buyers with mini-vans and Jeeps.) The new midsize sedans, introduced last summer, are off to a fast start. But luxury buyers, who are fewer in number, are notoriously picky.
The New Yorker, styled for an older buyer who might also consider domestic models like the Buick Park Avenue or Lincoln Continental, "is on the mark for a person seeking traditional luxury," said Susan Jacobs, an automotive marketing consultant based in Little Falls, N.J.
But the LHS model, styled to appeal to a younger buyer who might be considering an Acura Legend or Lexus ES 300, "isn't styled in a way that will appeal to those who like European cars," Ms. Jacobs said. "and secondly, the brand doesn't have enough prestige. It may take a couple of years before the brand can tap into these buyers."
The positive reception for the so-called L/H midsize cars has made Chrysler executives quite optimistic about the prospects for the New Yorker and LHS. The company's stock has performed strongly in recent months, perhaps in part because the economics of a successful luxury car are quite compelling; the gross profit margin of each New Yorker or LHS could amount to $9,000 or $10,000, several analysts said, compared with half that amount or less for the L/H midsize sedans.
Thus, if Chrysler sells out the 65,000 or so luxury sedans it expects to build this year at plants in Bramalea, Ontario, and Newark, Del., that could mean $500 million to $600 million extra in gross profit -- provided that rebates are not necessary to sell the cars.
Even without this additional profit, Wall Street suddenly regards the No. 3 producer as the most reliable money maker among the Big Three, after several years in which Chrysler was on the brink of financial collapse.
Jerry G. Paul, automotive analyst of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York, estimates that Chrysler now earns much more for a vehicle than the Ford Motor Company, which had been the most profitable company in the 1980's. The reason: Although Ford is a more efficient manufacturer, Chrysler with its mini-vans, Jeeps and now its L/H cars is snagging more well-heeled customers than Ford.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Generally Lower; Gold Has Gains Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled broadly lower yesterday in skittish trading on the world's currency markets.
Gold prices rose across the board. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $331.90 an ounce, up $1.10 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold gained $1.25, to a late price of $331.50. 
 Currency traders said the market activity was largely technical. The dollar continued the downward trend that began when Germany's central bank cut a key lending rate on Thursday. The German move had been anticipated, and some traders were disappointed that the Bundesbank did not take further action.
Lisa Pazer, an analyst with MMS International, said the dollar's decline was based on technical factors. "The market has been searching for direction, and for the past few weeks has been tightly range bound," she said.
While the dollar could test lower levels, traders said the underlying tone was relatively bullish, given the improving American economy. Trading was cautious and relatively light.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 116.10 yen, down 0.87 yen from the Thursday close but up from an opening of 115.80. That had been the dollar's lowest opening in Tokyo since the modern exchange rate system was established in the late 1940's.
Later in London, the dollar fell to 115.90 yen. In New York, the dollar rebounded to settle at 116.10 yen, up from 115.65 on Thursday.
Reported comments by Japanese officials, who were said to have complained about the yen's rise, and fears of intervention helped the dollar gain against the yen in American trading.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.4895, from $1.4750 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.4915 to buy 1, up from Thursday's $1.4860.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.6340 German marks, down from 1.6420; 1.5080 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.5685 French francs, down from 5.5980; 1,575.00 Italian lire, down from 1,588.00, and 1.2465 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2471.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $331.30 an ounce, from $330.45 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $331.55, from $330.10. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.56, to $330.67.

There Are Those Who Say

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
Some say the most delicious recent metaphor-mangling in Washington came from the lips of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who gained fame as televised balcony-mate of Hillary Rodham Clinton during her husband's economic address to Congress. The Greenspan pledge: "to break the back of the credit crunch."
The some that led the preceding paragraph is an example of phantom attribution -- a way of making a statement by pretending to report it as the assertion of others. Whenever a speech writer uses the "some say" construction, a speech reader knows that he's safe to agree with, or sternly dissociate himself from, whatever "some" are saying. 
 Some say is neutral; for really stupid or wrongheaded statements, phantom attribution is made to there are those who say; you can bank on those who being straw men. Others say  something far out; others live in a whole other world.
In this regard, we present the first effluvia -- beyond mere metaphoria -- from Foggy Bottom in the Clinton Era. It comes from the "Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Public Affairs," which means that the letter does not come from the Assistant Secretary, but from his office, which is commanded by a desk that writes memos from the desk of.
For as long as I can remember, I have been getting great gobs of unsolicited mail in bulky manila envelopes -- occasionally pretty useful -- from Les Aspin, who was a hard-working Congressman and is a nice guy. Today, in comes this missive from the Directorate for Public Communication (the K.G.B. loved directorates; what else has the Pentagon stolen from Moscow Central?), addressed to "Dear Sir or Madam."
"When Secretary Aspin was Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, you had expressed an interest in receiving information from him on national security issues." (Maybe I put a check mark on a postcard when I was sleepy or drunk.) "Now that he is the Secretary of Defense," writes Harold Heilsnis, director for public communication -- presumably bucking for Chief of the Sixth Directorate of Public Communication and Interactive Relationships -- "some  [italics mine] have asked to continue receiving material from him on these issues."
Ah, some have asked. Who? Close relatives? Old flames? His lips are sealed in his own version of a back-breaking credit crunch. So, is the press agent going to keep sending me the stuff? "We are evaluating the possibility of providing such mailings." (He means "making similar mailings" or "providing such information"; you do not provide a mailing as if it were humanitarian relief dropped from the sky.)
"If you wish to receive such materials from Secretary Aspin, please complete the enclosed form," and he attaches one of those Government forms that require not only my signature (which I suspect would trigger a full field investigation, tax audit and wiretap warrant) but also demand in capitalized boldface that I return the address label from the envelope I threw away.
In the old days, Les's flack would have dropped me a note asking, "You want to stay on the mailing list?" Gone, gone are the days of plain English, as genuine communication is sucked into the black hole of directorates. I'm afraid those snappy salutes are getting to that old gang of Clinton's.
 
KUBLA'S COMEBACK
 "IN XANADU," WROTE the poet Coleridge, transcribing an interrupted dream, "did Kubla Khan/ A stately pleasure dome decree."
Pleasure used to be a powerful word. Rooted in the Old French plaisir, it came into English and developed that sensual zh sound in the middle, similar to the pleasing azure, favorite of romantic poets. As a verb, it means "to give sexual satisfaction to"; as a noun, it is not so lively as delight or gladness, not so rapturous as joy, bliss or ecstasy, and not so amusing as delectation. Pleasure is an emotion that suffuses one who has been gratified or stroked; it's a good feeling, whether physical or intellectual.
It is also a semantically endangered species. Kathie Wellde, the Washington lecture agent who heads Speakers of the Times, sends in this disturbing heads up: "Instead of saying Have a nice day, people are ending their conversations with My pleasure."
Come to think of it, I've noticed that, too, especially at high-class hotels: the phrase is used not merely to mean "I'd be glad to," or even "It's a thrill just to be asked," but with the added sense of "O.K. and so long." Example: "I'll be checking out at noon." "My pleasure."
Where is this coming from? European responses to thanks range from the French je vous en prie, using "I pray of you" to mean "you're welcome," to the German bitteschon, literally a combination of "please" and "beautiful," and the Spanish de nada, "for nothing." In Chinese, the Mandarin dialect response is bu keqi (pronounced boo KUH-chee), and is used for "Don't mention it." But the impetus in our vocabulary has to come from closer to home.
Ellie Peters at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in New York informs me that Horst Schulze, president of the chain of 28 hotels, distributed a credo as part of the employee orientation that includes this as Point 12: "Maintain positive eye contact. Use the proper vocabulary with our guests. Use words like . . . 'I'll be happy to' and 'My pleasure.' "
I don't hear too many I'll be happy tos in the Phoenix Ritz-Carlton, but My pleasure has grabbed hold at Laguna Niguel and Naples. And the fond farewell is in vogue not just in hotels; as Ms. Wellde reports, the soothing phrase is spreading like wildfire. (Like most urban Americans, I have never seen wildfire with my own eyes, but presume it to be a conflagration that spreads quickly.)
Some people (along with others, joined by the dopey those who) hate to see a lush word like pleasure made part of a routine parting or a cheery telephone operator's sign-off, but it beats Have a nice day, originally a happy thought but now one very tired phrase. A more exasperated conversation concluder is Get a life!, the origin of which lexicographers are eagerly seeking; early citations will be accepted gratefully here.
At this point, a with-it sign-off comes all too readily to mind.

HEADLINE: STAGE VIEW;
Opening a Window at a Theater Gone Stale

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
When a dying Joseph Papp turned over the artistic directorship of the New York Shakespeare Festival to JoAnne Akalaitis in the summer of 1991, he kept a title for himself: producer. A little more than two months later, Papp was dead, and the role of producer at the festival, like the title, was buried with him. Ms. Akalaitis, it soon became clear, simply did not know enough about what it means to be a producer, and the consequences of that ignorance were severe.
In the mere 20 months she presided as artistic director, the company that Papp built over three decades became an empty shell, a ragtag fairway for theatrical sideshows rather than main events. The institution that had once been a role model for nonprofit theaters nationwide and a leader in New York City arts advocacy found its own long-term survival thrown into jeopardy. Last week the festival's board stepped in and dismissed Ms. Akalaitis, replacing her with George C. Wolfe. In a typically theatrical gesture, the 38-year-old Mr. Wolfe made it known that he would not be the festival's artistic director. He took instead the title of producer. 
 Somewhere, Papp may be smiling, or at least breathing a sigh of relief. Certainly anyone who cares about the future of the New York theater is. If anyone can save the festival, it may well be Mr. Wolfe, who has heretofore not been known as a producer but as a playwright and director, lately of "Jelly's Last Jam" on Broadway, though earlier of such fine pieces as "The Colored Museum" and "Spunk," both of which were produced at the Public Theater by Papp. Though Mr. Wolfe is untried as a producer and an administrator, he actually produced unofficially the only thrilling new work to appear at the Public during Ms. Akalaitis's tenure, Anna Deavere Smith's "Fires in the Mirror," which had its premiere as part of a mini-festival he organized.
Like Papp, who nurtured his early career, Mr. Wolfe has a flair for talent scouting, show business and self-promotion. He also has an artistic range whose broad sweep has more in common with Papp's inclusivity than Ms. Akalaitis's narrow, academic vision. The Wolfe canon to date has crossed over from the American to the African, from drama to satire to musical theater, from verbal elegance to visual dash. He is one to try anything rather than take no for an answer.
As for Ms. Akalaitis's record on Lafayette Street, it would be nice simply to forget about it, and get on with tomorrow. That's the theater's sentimental way. And certainly any objective observer can see that she was in part a victim of bad luck. A smart director, she was not only miscast as the Public's leader but was also asked to take over an organization already in turmoil during a major recession. But there are important lessons to be drawn from her failure, and they have import beyond her career and the institution she served so inadequately.
Both the nonprofit and commercial American theater are at a crucial juncture in their history, beset by a leadership that is aging and frequently out of touch, severe economic cutbacks, racial divisions and a shortage of new producers. Even as Ms. Akalaitis resigned, board-room squabbles broke out at another major New York company, Playwrights Horizons, prompting the departure of the theater's longtime executive director, Paul Daniels. Other institutional theaters, most prominently La Mama E.T.C. and Circle in the Square, have been on the financial ropes, and more may soon join them. Still other major resident theaters around the country, from Arena Stage in Washington to the Yale Repertory Theater, are in the process of artistic transition following the retirement of visionary leaders of the Papp generation.
If the theater at large is to benefit from the Public's sad tale, it should look carefully not only at what Ms. Akalaitis did and did not do during her tenure there, but also at how the theater community itself responded to her short-lived regime.
Ms. Akalaitis's failures at the festival have little to do with her gifts as an artist. She has been and will continue to be a talented director, especially of edgy European plays (notably those of Jean Genet and of the German playwright Franz Xaver Kroetz) and of darker classics. Though her work as a director during the months she doubled as the festival's chief executive was erratic, ranging from the inspired (" 'Tis Pity She's a Whore") to the dreadful ("Woyzeck"), she would still have failed at her bigger job even if each of her productions had been a triumph.
To be a true leader of a theater with six stages at its disposal -- five at the Public, one in Central Park -- Ms. Akalaitis had to see beyond her own occasional productions as a director. She had to be a producer, whether or not she called or considered herself one. And while being a producer means many things, it means first of all the very basic chore of putting productions onstage. The festival's stages were all too frequently dark during Ms. Akalaitis's term. When they were occupied, the fare was often solo turns by mainstream performance artists (Reno, Ann Magnuson), readings, special events (a puppetry festival) or plays by writers on Ms. Akalaitis's short list of Drama 101 modernists (Beckett, Garcia Lorca, Brecht) or their imitators (Steve Tesich, whose recent "On the Open Road" was a pastiche of "Mother Courage" and "Waiting for Godot.")
All of these theatrical endeavors might well have been produced by Papp, and all are certainly legitimate parts of the Public's bill of fare. But Papp would have combined them with other, more substantial offerings, such as a steady diet of original new American plays and musicals, not to mention frequent mountings of Shakespeare. Ms. Akalaitis's agenda for the festival consisted mainly of theatrical snacks, with very few feasts that might contribute to the Public's allure in the competitive New York performing-arts scene and perhaps even attract audiences to the smaller, more eccentric presentations.
When the Public did offer an occasional new American play or musical (the current "Wings"), it generally did not originate them. Rather than produce plays that might reflect her own creative passions, Ms. Akalaitis usually booked plays produced by others into the Public because they were hits in their originating theaters outside New York.
Booking is what cautious commercial theater owners do; it is not supposed to be the principal calling of artistic directors of leading institutional theaters. Yet Ms. Akalaitis seemed unwilling to gamble her prestige or larger production budgets on playwrights and directors who might give birth to exciting new works in her theater; she became a co-sponsor of new American plays like Tony Kushner's "Angels in America" and Jose Rivera's forthcoming "Marisol" only after other theaters had developed them or given them their imprimatur. At Ms. Akalaitis's Public, there was only one theatrical artist who consistently received the time, money and space necessary to do elaborate new productions -- Ms. Akalaitis. Indeed, her "Woyzeck" was the only major home-grown production to be seen on any Public Theater stage this entire season.
Given how little activity there was at the Public, and how little of it was fresh or substantial, it is no wonder that the festival seemed to fall off the map of many theatergoers. Even so, Ms. Akalaitis sometimes went out of her way to antagonize a public that might otherwise have been patient. She persistently announced that she would stage a theater piece about the Palestinians, possibly a daring one that might stir up some valuable controversy, but never actually bothered to do it. In widely quoted (and published) remarks, she even attacked her theater's most loyal customers: speaking of the festival's subscription audiences at a symposium, she said "they didn't understand the work . . . were essentially dull people [and] did not appreciate especially what we might call more adventurous theater . . . ."
On Ms. Akalaitis's behalf, it can be said that no successor could hope to compete with the Papp record, that in tough economic times co-productions with other theaters can cut fiscal risks, and that she did not have enough time to get her act together. While there is real validity to all these points, there was little evidence to suggest that Ms. Akalaitis had any plan for expanding the Public's scale of play production in the near future. The problem was not that her producing record was inferior to Papp's but that it was virtually nonexistent. (Even the co-production ventures she chose tended to be limited, often to a single company, the Goodman Theater of Chicago, that frequently hired her as a director.) It was not clear, either, that she had any exceptional skill for two essential, if thankless, aspects of the producer's calling -- fund raising and promotion.
Since Ms. Akalaitis was an ailing Joseph Papp's own choice for artistic director, it would have been both unethical and unseemly for the festival's board to jettison her immediately. The board, which acted with unanimity, should be applauded for ending the misery with relative promptness, at the end of two poor seasons and when a successor of Mr. Wolfe's caliber was available.
But what if the board had not acted? One of the saddest aspects of the New York Shakespeare Festival's recent history is how little the theater community stirred itself either to help the fading theater or to call attention to its plight.
Do the art or dance communities stand idly by when comparable institutions like the Whitney Museum or American Ballet Theater are in a crisis? Most official organs of the theater, from the Dramatists Guild to the League of American Theater Owners and Producers (the organization of commercial producers) to the Theater Communications Group (the organization of nonprofit theaters), are so committed to industry boosterism that they spoke only in whispers, if that, about the artistic and financial collapse at what once was the most influential theatrical institution in the country. (The playwright Larry Kramer, author of the longest-running play of the Papp years, "The Normal Heart," and the polemical Papp's spiritual heir if ever there was one, was a conspicuous exception, attacking Ms. Akalaitis's leadership in the same terms he aims at government officials about AIDS.) Would the theater community have maintained its conspiracy of silence until Papp's theater had shriveled to the point of closing its doors, or threatening to? By then, it would have been too late to save the festival, but, oh, the crocodile tears that would have been shed!
Perhaps the theatrical artists and administrators who remained mute about the decline at the Public could argue that they legitimately and genuinely had to stay quiet until Ms. Akalaitis had more time to prove herself. Fair enough, but, if so, why didn't they then support Ms. Akalaitis with actions, by giving her their own time and their creative projects? Despite an admirable but vaguely conceived Artistic Associates program, many major playwrights, directors and actors shunned the festival, thereby executing a pocket veto on the new regime. Yet some of these artists hypocritically implied support for Ms. Akalaitis by either remaining silent or praising her to the press.
As the Akalaitis fiasco dramatizes the timid everyone-for-himself mentality that now seems to drive the theater community, so it also calls attention to another crisis in the American theater: the inability of most of its institutions to plan for an orderly succession. If Papp had not waited to the difficult final months of his battle with cancer to decide the fate of his theater, if he had groomed a successor over a few years when he was in robust health, perhaps a lot of the ensuing waste of his company's artistic capital could have been avoided. But he's hardly unique. Very few of the prominent American theaters with retirement-age leaders have an obvious heir apparent or one of exciting promise. The same is true of the dominant commercial theater companies, the Shubert and Nederlander organizations. Must the leader of every American theatrical organization feel compelled to play King Lear and leave his empire behind in ruins?
By appointing Mr. Wolfe, the festival's board does offer hope, at least about this one institution. Aside from his talents, he is a link to the new generation of audiences and artists on which the future of the American theater depends. Mr. Wolfe is almost two decades younger than the 55-year-old Ms. Akalaitis, who was frequently labeled avant-garde but whose unsurprising tastes were often reminiscent of the avant-garde of the 1960's and 1970's. (The cafe she set up in the Public's lobby looked like a sentimental homage to the bohemian heyday of San Francisco's City Lights bookstore.) Though Mr. Wolfe is grounded in a cultural past, from Brecht to Zora Neale Hurston to Jelly Roll Morton, he is well connected to the theatrical future, whether it is Anna Deavere Smith or Tony Kushner, whose "Angels in America" he is now directing for Broadway.
Mr. Wolfe also happens to be black, at a moment when there is a great deal of African-American talent in the theater but relatively little minority representation in the management of major nonprofit and commercial theater companies and professional organizations. Mr. Wolfe, who is as outspoken about social issues as Papp was, may yet play a role in confronting the Marge Schotts of the American theater world, for surely it is only a matter of time before the theater's top artistic players demand management that reflects their own increased diversity.
For the time being, Mr. Wolfe will have his hands full just getting the Public active again, and it's doubly good news that Kevin Kline, another energetic force in the final Papp decade, will join him in the fight to revive this troubled institution. Whatever mistakes they make, and they will make them, they are unlikely to repeat Ms. Akalaitis's fatal error of simply refusing to take the gutsy chances and to chase the big dreams that are the essence of producing.
The festival's close escape from calamity has at least served one constructive purpose by dramatizing gaping voids throughout the theatrical establishment: of courage, long-term planning and entrepreneurial talent. Perhaps no one can replace Joseph Papp, the last old-time producer of the American theater. But with George Wolfe, the New York Shakespeare Festival has found, and not a moment too soon, a leader with the real promise to reinvent the role of producer for the new generation now banging at the theater's door.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
The Fine Art Of Complaining

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
COMPLAINING has become a subspecies of travel literature, to judge by the daily mail. But a close reading of the copies of complaints that readers send to hotels, cruise lines and tour companies shows that most have not been effective: They are already in round 2 or 3 and have not got what they want. In fact, they often have not specified what they want, which is a major mistake.
To recast the line about how crucial location is in real estate, the three most important aspects of complaining are timing, timing and timing. A complaint must be lodged while something can be done to make things right because, as one tour executive put it, money does not replace lost vacation time. A letter sent a month after a traveler returns from a trip is less likely to get results than a phone call made on the spot, saying, for example, that a hotel does not correspond to the description in the brochure. When the issue is services not provided, delay may make it impossible for management to track down who did not do what for whom. 
 Setting aside problems with airlines -- a whole separate issue -- complaints about hotels, resorts, tours and cruises can be effective and, in a slow economy, can produce more results than you might guess. Among the compensation options are free nights, a change of hotels, points on frequent-stay programs and vouchers for visits to higher-priced places. Those in the business of selling travel want repeat customers.
Here is guidance on getting results, based on the advice of the experts who must cope with the complaints.
To start with, if whatever you are presented does not look right, don't eat it, sleep in it or stay with it, if you can avoid it. Once you have eaten the meal, complaints get a dubious response. If the desk clerk or the tour escort cannot get you a room with a view of something other than the dumpster, try the manager. A scene is not called for, but persist. Call your travel agent collect or failing that, call the tour operator, also collect, and explain that the hotel does not offer the features -- pool, beachfront, air-conditioning, whatever -- listed in the brochure.
 
Room Without a View
 Amy Stainman, an advertising executive in Philadelphia, bought a four-day, three-night Gogo Tours trip, called Miami on Your Own, last month. She and her sister together paid $894 for air fares, hotel and a rental car. They wanted to stay in the city's Art Deco district, relax and swim. Having looked at the brochure, they asked for the Cardozo Hotel, but could not get it and were assigned to another hotel on Ocean Drive.
When they got there, Ms. Stainman said, the hotel was not what they wanted. The view from the room was dismal, the hotel did not seem clean, and their rental car would have to be parked at an expensive meter, she said.
"I said to my sister, 'What are we going to do that will make us happy now?' and we decided to leave," Ms. Stainman said. They went to a Howard Johnson, which was just under $100 a night for a double room. When they got home, Ms. Stainman sent a letter and the motel bill to her travel agent, who will take it up with Gogo Tours. Though the resolution of Ms. Stainman's complaint is still pending, her question was the right one: What will salvage the vacation now? She might have done better if she had called her travel agent from the hotel, possibly getting a place more in the Art Deco mode than a Howard Johnson.
Richard Ellis, senior vice president for marketing at Gogo, said that his company also accepted collect calls from people faced with an unsatisfactory hotel. In this case, it would not have been a big surprise. Mr. Ellis said demand for South Miami Beach rose unexpectedly over Christmas and in February. Kathy Wiltshire, head of Florida marketing for Gogo, said that the company was no longer booking the hotel to which Ms. Stainman was assigned nor a few others, which are in renovation.
Mr. Ellis offers advice. "Separate emotion from reality," he said. "Propose a solution. No operator, no hotel, no cruise is going to deliver 100 percent of the time, so avoid saying you will never visit so-and-so again. State what you want."
But most of all, he said, try to get the problem fixed while you are on the spot. He acknowledges it is less expensive for the tour operator to get an upgraded room for a client than to give a cash refund. "But my real goal is not to lose a customer," he said.
Complaint letters should be as brief as possible, but with names, times and dates, and should be businesslike and not surly in tone. Suggest a remedy: an apology, a refund, a guarantee for the room you want next time. Josephine Kling of Landry & Kling of Coral Gables, Fla., a cruise specialist, said that a pleasant tone was likewise important in making an initial complaint: "An ugly scene turns everyone off," she said.
 
Problem Solving
 Hotel and motel chains, scrambling for customers, have set up guarantee systems to try to satisfy unhappy customers and keep track of what goes wrong where. These systems give top priority to solving the problem on the spot.
Holiday Inn's Hospitality Promise program, which is more than 10 years old, is also in effect at the limited-service Holiday Inn Express motels. If a difficulty is not resolved by checkout time, the brochures in rooms say, the customer need not pay for the part of the stay that caused the problem. Steve Jacobs, vice president for reservations and guest relations, said this meant that the room would be free, for example, if the complimentary breakfast buffet was unsatisfactory. Most complaints, Mr. Jacobs said, pertain to bills: guests are charged for the wrong meal or for a movie they did not rent. If the complaint is not resolved with personnel at the hotel, the guest can call (800) 621-0555, where employees are authorized to negotiate a solution. Even complaints that do not reach the 800 number are logged by guest, hotel and problem, Mr. Jacobs said, and training teams are sent to places with persistent problems.
Efforts to please the customer whose problem was not resolved range from a voucher for another visit, possibly to the premium-brand Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, to points on a Holiday Inn Priority Club account, to a refund in cash.
Mr. Jacobs said that less than 2 percent of the chain's room nights brought complaints. Of these, he said, less than 1 percent came from chronic complainers, who are eventually flagged and get no more free nights.
Hampton Inn also has a satisfaction guarantee for its 300 limited-service motels, as does its sister brand, Homewood Suites, both owned by the Promus Companies. The Hampton guarantee was begun in 1989, and Reg Mallamo, vice president of marketing, said that the number of people who invoked the guarantee was "nominal." All employees are authorized to give the guest a free night if the problem cannot be otherwise solved.
On the assumption that motels not now offering such guarantees are still concerned about guest satisfaction, it's probably worthwhile to ask what can be done about the room bill if the reading lamp was never fixed or the graduation party destroyed a night's sleep. If you get no results, write your complaint soon.

HEADLINE: Lead Paint Moves Up as Housing Issue

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
THE first time Marlene Zarfes ever worried seriously about lead-based paint was in February when officials of the New York City Department of Health called. They told her that her pediatrician had found a dangerously high level of lead in the blood of her 15-month-old son, Adam.
They also told her that they were coming to inspect her co-op apartment in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn for the source of her son's lead poisoning, probably chips or dust particles of lead paint. 
 "I was in shock," said Ms. Zarfes, who moved into her 106-year-old apartment building nine years ago.
Lead-based paint, like asbestos and radon in the 80's, is fast becoming a leading environmental issue affecting residential real estate in the 90's.
Homeowners, landlords and tenants, particularly those with children under the age of 7, are raising a multitude of questions: Does my home have lead paint? What are dangerously high levels of lead? What are the laws regarding lead testing and abatement? Who pays to have the lead removed? Is it tax deductible? Is it covered by my insurance?
"The problem has always existed, but the concern is growing and regulations are coming," said Roellen Garito, an administrative assistant with ACA Environmental Testing of Yonkers, which removes lead paint from homes.
In Ms. Zarfes's case, health officials tested her two-bedroom apartment and found elevated levels of lead in the paint used in the molding around the windows and doors. "The city told me it was off the meter," she said.
Ms. Zarfes, a lawyer, and her husband, Michael Durand, a public relations executive, then agreed to remove the lead paint; if they hadn't they would have been ordered to do so. They hired ACA Environmental Testing. "We spent over $4,000," she said.
ADAM'S lead levels are expected to return to normal, and none of the health problems associated with lead poisoning -- learning disorders being perhaps the most common -- are expected to develop. Other potential illnesses linked to lead poisoning are stomach and kidney ailments and anemia. It is not known conclusively whether the lead came from eating chips of lead paint or inhaling lead dust. Since Ms. Zarfes has minimal levels of lead in her blood it is not thought that Adam contracted the lead during his mother's preganancy.
"It's the kind of thing you think happens to -- I don't know how to say this -- but to people with less money," said Ms. Zarfes, whose oldest child, Matthew, 5, had slightly elevated amounts of lead in his blood two years ago. (Upon retesting, though, it fell to normal levels.)
In New York, about 650 children a year are found to have lead poisoning. That number, though, is expected to increase significantly after April 1 when a new state law goes into effect mandating annual testing for all children under 7. (Mandatory testing is not required in New Jersey or Connecticut.)
The number of cases is also expected to rise as more local jurisdictions adopt the new guideline of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the maximum permissible level of lead in the blood. The level, adopted by the centers in 1991, has dropped to 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood, down from 25.
"The number of lead poisonings is projected to increase to between 6,000 and 10,000 a year in New York," said Vincent M. Coluccio of the Mayor's Lead Paint Advisory Committee and vice president of ATC Environmental, a consulting firm in Manhattan. "We are the lead poisoning capital of the country."
The lower Federal guideline is currently not used as a legal level that triggers an inspection of a New York, New Jersey or Connecticut house or apartment. Rather, if a child under 7 has a blood lead level of 20 micrograms per deciliter or higher, the state or local Department of Health must inspect the child's home. The level for Ms. Zarfes's son, Adam, for example, was 27 micrograms.
 Exposure to lead comes from various sources, including paint, fuel, factory emissions, drinking water, contaminated soil and plumbing joined with lead solder. Children are usually exposed to lead-based paint and paint-contaminated dust and soil. About 74 percent of the homes in the United States built before 1980 contain lead paint. New York City banned lead paint in 1960 for residential use. Under Federal law, it was banned in 1977.
A doctor should test the blood of any children who are regularly in a house built before 1978 that has flaking paint, especially around windows. Surfaces suspected of having lead should be cleaned by wet-wiping rather than sweeping or vacuuming. Children should also be tested if their drinking water moves through the original plumbing in an older home.
During a Health Department inspection, if paint is found to have a lead concentration higher than 0.5 percent, using a chemical laboratory test, or 1.0 milligrams per square centimeter, using an XRF, an x-ray fluoroscopic meter, the removal or covering of the lead will be ordered. Homeowners getting such notices have been hiring lead abatement companies at a cost, typically, of $1,000 to $8,000.
Extreme care should be taken in removing lead paint, as well as in the subsequent clean-up. The work can create high levels of lead dust that can remain in the air and on surfaces for long periods. Indeed, abatement done by untrained people can create a health hazard more serious than if the lead paint were left in place. Generally, the safest approach is to cover walls with sheetrock or paneling and replace, rather than strip, window frames, doors and baseboards.
Though health departments often provide lists of experienced lead-abatement companies, no regulations exist for how the lead must be removed or who can do it.
"Anyone can hang out a shingle," said Mr. Coluccio, the environmental consultant. "There is no training or certification. We need to have good training and certification standards for people doing this work."
Daniel J. Sitomer, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in environmental issues, cautioned owners not to overreact to the potential danger.
"In the beginning of the asbestos issue, there was an over-reaction to it," he said, "and it caused building owners to quickly retain contractors who proved not to be qualified to perform asbestos abatement work properly, and as a result building owners faced additional problems causes by negligence.
"There needs to be a partnership with government and real estate and building owners to move slowly to develop a process whereby consultants and contractors can be properly trained to perform this kind of work professionally. At the same time, it is important to move slowly in requiring this type of work to be done to allow those contractors and consultants the necessary training to perform the work properly.
"Lead management can be implemented in such a way as to protect building inhabitants yet not force wholesale lead abatement, which could cause more problems than leaving the material in place."
Lead paint was used extensively when fashionable limestone or brownstone town houses were built in the early 20th century in such Brooklyn neighborhoods as Bedford-Stuyvesant, East New York and Fort Greene. The chances of extensive renovation with nonlead paint in subsequent years are more remote they are in wealthier locations.
"We call that 'the Lead Belt' and it goes right on up through Queens and Upper Manhattan and the Bronx," Mr. Coluccio said. "It is an economically depressed strip of land where 50 percent of the new cases of lead-poisoned children come from."
IN New York City regulations call for officials with the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development to issue a citation and order corrective steps if, in an inspection for any alleged violation, chipped or peeling paint or dust from paint is seen in a building built before 1960.
A bill that would establish a new regulatory system and a grants-and-loans program for rental housing with lead hazards was introduced by Mayor David N. Dinkins last year but has been stalled in the City Council.
Some critics have complained that the city should seek stronger legislation, such as the removal or covering of all apartment elements that have been coated with lead paint, regardless of whether a surface has been damaged or a child made ill.
The city's proposed legislation states that remediation would have to be undertaken only if, after an insepction, lead is found to be deteriorating and a child under 7 lives in the housing. The form of the remediation would depend on the extent of the lead present.
"We certainly have hopes that the Council will act on this or some other alternative proposal," said Harold M. Shultz, a deputy commissioner with the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
For public housing regulations are already in place.Under Federal law, all public housing units must be tested for lead levels by December 1994 and if the level exceeds 0.5 percent in the chemical test, or 1.0 with the XRF, abatement must be ordered.
"It is the first attempt to have a proactive rather than reactive set of regulations," Mr. Coluccio said. "Until now we have been using children as lead detectors to tell us that there have been problems with lead."
About 10 percent of the public housing units in the city have been done thus far. Bids are now going out for the rest. "Thus far, anecdotally, the results are surprisingly low," Mr. Coluccio said. "People didn't tend to use lead paint in situations like public housing, where they were trying to economize in housing materials."
PERHAPS the most sweeping new law pertaining to lead and the real estate market is a new Federal regulation taking effect in October 1994 that will require property owners to identify potential lead paint hazards before selling housing. The law will apply to all housing built before 1978. Specifically, owners must provide the buyer or renter with a lead hazard information pamphlet, inform the buyer or renter of any known lead hazard evaluation report available, let the buyer or renter inspect the property over a 10-day period to determine lead paint hazards and insert a lead warning statement in the contract of sale.
In addition to the seller or landlord, several other parties, including real estate agents and management companies, could also be held liable. Violations of the disclosure law call for civil liability of triple damages of up to $10,000 for each violation.
As for who pays for the abatement, generally, it is a homeowner's or landlord's responsibility or, in the case of most co-ops and condominiums, the individual unit owners. "Virtually all offering plans provide that the unit owners buy on an 'as is' basis," said Marc Luxemburg, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.
As to whether lead abatement is covered by homeowners' insurance policies, it depends largely on whether the policy has a pollution exclusion.
"Different insurance companies have different positions regarding lead and whether they include it in their pollution exclusion and therefore offer no coverage," Mr. Sitomer said.
Perhaps the only bright financial note for homeowners who have to remove lead-paint is that the cost can be deducted from Federal income taxes under medical expenses if it is being done to prevent a child who has or has had lead poisoning from eating the paint. The surfaces must be peeling or cracking and within the child's reach. Repainting is not deductible as a medical expense, although covering the area with paneling or wall board could be deducted as a capital expense.

HEADLINE: Dangers of Predicting Children's Destinies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The article, "State's Case Links Poverty to Students' Performance" (New York Times, Feb. 28), reveals a severe prejudice which has prevailed in Connecticut, despite the popularity of politically correct attitudes. Instead of attributing deficiencies in students' academic performances to racial or ethnic inequalities, witnesses in the desegregation trial in West Hartford have reported that children's potential in school can be determined by their family's social and economic status.
One expert witness, Prof. David Armor of George Mason University, was paraphrased in The Times as testifying that mastery test scores in Hartford and its suburbs can be predicted almost entirely by looking at the income, college education and number of single parents in each community. He is wrong. 
 Our society does great damage to children by predicting their destinies according to the socio-economic status of the children's families. Great damage. We are replacing one harmful misconception -- that of genetic limitations due to race -- with another stigma -- that of academic inferiority due to one's family. In both myths, a child who is born into a supposedly inferior situation is doomed to mediocrity or failure in school, unless he heroically overcomes the odds.
Unfortunately, educators who maintain this view of children inadvertently create a self-fulfilling prophecy. They track children -- from kindergarten reading groups through high school honors programs -- according to their perceptions of the pupils' potential. Despite the fact that children develop skills in bursts, plateaus and everything in between, students rarely move out of the tracks established in the primary grades. Groupings quickly become based on the child's experience, instead of his or her aptitude.
Educators cannot predict students' test scores according to the family's socio-economic status. The factors which help students persevere to learn are not matters of income, but of opportunity; not college education, but respect for and dedication to learning; not single parents, but the accessibility of deeply caring adult guidance.
Would desegregation, then, promote the academic development of youngsters in the lower socio-economic classes of Hartford? If it increases the opportunities for inner-city students to attend well-equipped, attractive, academically challenging schools, then the answer is yes, desegregation would help. However, we will not serve the needs of these youngsters by moving them to a new school, and then putting them into segregated tracks. We will not meet their needs by ignoring them as individuals and anticipating that they shall fail. If we want to successfully desegregate schools, we must accept responsibility for integrating youngsters into the finest opportunities in their new alma maters.
The complex problem of educating all students in our diverse society cannot be solved by desegregation alone, or even by schools alone. Improving education requires the concerted effort of parents, educators and other members of the community to support children in their academic growth.

HEADLINE: Another Bridgeport Emerges As a Leader With a Past

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN

 BODY:
WHEN the leaders of eight Connecticut cities met last month for what was described as a summit on violence, it seemed appropriate that Bridgeport was the site. It has the highest per capita homicide rate in the state.
But forgetting the violence, which in Bridgeport is hard to do because of the unending series of crimes involving drugs and guns, particularly on its grimy East Side, the city has a terrible image. It has evolved with such public embarrassments as its huge illegal dump known as Mount Trashmore, the attempt by a former mayor to throw the municipality into bankruptcy, and the furor that resulted when an arm of the Unification Church, led by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, bailed out the university that bears the city's name.
 
Neighborhood Pride
 Despite all that, there is another Bridgeport. 
 The "other" Bridgeport is made up of homeowners who fight to keep their neighborhoods safe and clean and who take pride in the state's biggest city (population about 142,000) and its history and architectural legacy. In fact, in one category Bridgeport has emerged in recent months as the leader of the state. The city now has more local historic districts -- five -- than any other community in the state. In contrast, New Haven has two districts; Hartford has none.
Bridgeport became the leader in historic districts, an event rather lost to media attention because of the stream of bad news coming from the city, in the latter half of 1992. Four separate districts were voted by residents, to add to the single district, Black Rock Harbor, that had been created a decade and a half earlier.
 
A Hopeful Omen
 The new districts are Stratfield, a section of 280 homes, mostly stately affairs built in the latter part of the 19th century and the first part of this century; Barnum-Palliser, 42 modest homes built by the legendary P. T. Barnum and an architectural firm for working-class families in the 1880's; Pembroke City, 266 homes dating back to a planned residential development of the middle of the last century that was the brainchild of the energetic Barnum, and Marina Park, a turn-of-the-century seaside enclave of 14 mansions or near-mansions built for Bridgeport's industrial elite of the time.
Preservationists are hailing the creation of the four new districts as a hopeful omen for the future of the city. "I'm so heartened," said Laura Weir Clarke, director of Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. "It shows the city has stability. The vote shows concern for the community and its neighborhoods."
John W. Shannahan, director of the Connecticut Historical Commission, said Bridgeport neighborhood groups that were successful in obtaining the historical districts should be commended. "To achieve this in a large city is a real accomplishment," he said. "A two-thirds vote is hard to get."
The two-thirds vote of a prospective district is the latest magic figure in the sometimes turbulent story of historical districts in Connecticut.
The move for such districts grew out of the fear in the early 1960's that towns and cities would lose their identities in an era of massive urban renewal and highway construction. The General Assembly responded with a law enabling residents of areas considered historically significant to set up commissions to regulate exterior alterations on existing buildings and also control the design of new buildings.
From the beginning, the districts were controversial in a state that has traditionally valued individual freedom. Opponents said they reduced freedom of homeowners to do with their properties what they wished. Proponents said old neighborhoods would disintegrate without them, or become so homogenized that they would lose their identities.
The law survived an effort to vote it out shortly after it had been voted in; it has been amended several times. In 1987, the number of affected property owners needed to vote in a historic district was reduced to two-thirds from 75 percent.
 
Half the Proposals Fail
 Even with the reduction, one out of every two proposals to establish historic districts fails because of lack of voter support, Mr. Shannahan noted. The addition of the four new districts in Bridgeport brings to 103 the total spread out among the state's 169 communities.
The most interesting aspect of Bridgeport's districts is that they are not reflective of the Colonial period, as are most of the other historical districts of the state. Instead, they are reminders of Bridgeport's role as a leading industrial city in the 19th and 20th centuries and the part P. T. Barnum played as civic booster, entrepreneur and Mayor.
The man most identified with the new historic districts, and who did the paperwork necessary for them, is Charles W. Brilvitch, city historian and unabashed fan of Barnum.
"He was a pioneer in city planning." said Mr. Brilvitch of Barnum. "The setback requirements for houses, that was his idea. And rural cemeteries, that was his, too." By rural cemeteries, he referred to spacious Victorian-era city cemeteries, adorned with exotic trees and shrubbery and monuments that are high art in themselves.
Barnum's most enduring gesture to the city that he loved is Mountain Grove Cemetery, where he now rests under a massive monument. Nearby is an obelisk with a tiny stone figure on top. This is the burial place of Charles S. Stratton, the Bridgeport midget made famous by Barnum as General Tom Thumb, the world's smallest man.
 
Glory Days
 A trip around Bridgeport with Mr. Brilvitch is a quick education in the glory that was Bridgeport. It is spiced with comments about how stupid he believes city leaders can be when they ignore the heritage of their domains.
"That's the William Hall house," he said, driving by a formidable frame house in the Black Rock district. "I call it steamboat Gothic." William Hall, he explained, was a builder of clipper ships known all over the world. Establishment of the Black Rock Historic District saved the house. "They were going to tear it down," he said.
Driving though Pembroke Park, he supplied a little tidbit about Barnum's requirements for people who bought houses there: "They couldn't drink, they couldn't smoke and they couldn't keep a pig."
Mr. Brilvitch is not a bookish historian. He is a tall, gangling man of 39, with hair hanging far enough down in back to cover a collar, if he wore a collar. Mostly, it's a sweater and jeans. He is a native of Bridgeport, went to Ohio to get a degree from Case Western Reserve University in urban and environmental studies and came back to his home city after trying the Washington scene for a time.
 
'A Dirty Word'
 Actually, being city historian is only part of his job. He is also the city's environmental officer but only on matters involving Federal money. He works out of the city planning office at City Hall. "I'm the only one in the office without a tie," he will say as a means of identification. He volunteers the information that he is not the most popular person in the building.
"Preservation is a dirty word here," he said. "We never would have gotten any restoration done if the city had anything to do with it. The homeowners were responsible, not the city."
Michael W. Freimuth, the city's director of planning and economic development, denies that he was against the four new historic districts but admits that he and Mr. Brilvitch do occasionally have differences about what is best for Bridgeport. "I needle him and he needles me," he said.
Of one thing, there is no question. The votes to create the new historic zones took everyone by surprise, certainly Mr. Brilvitch. "Before they took the votes, I had no idea how they would come out," he said. "It was overwhelming." The vote in the two bigger districts, Stratfield and Pembroke City, was nearly 90 percent in favor. In the two smaller districts, Barnum-Palliser and Marine Park, it was 100 percent.
A homeowner in the Stratfield district and a leader in the move for historic districts, Nancy R. Savin, credited Mr. Brilvitch for much of its success. "He's the lone person at City Hall who seems to have vision," she said.
Flushed with the new historical status, she and others are talking of conducting a house and garden tour. She admits that it may seem a bit strange for Bridgeport, noting, "No one can remember when one of those was held here."

HEADLINE: Ties That Bind Poverty's Children

DATELINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
IN the last 10 years, admissions to juvenile detention centers in Connecticut have risen by 65 percent, the State Judicial Department says. Last year more than 13,000 cases were added to the department's caseload.
Michael F., 14, is one of those statistics. 
 On the run from the police last month, he said, he spent his time wandering the streets of New Haven until about midnight, then slept over at the home of a relative or friend. He would wake at about 11 A.M., dress and play video games or else find a prime corner where he could act as a "backup for my boys," meaning a lookout for drug dealers. He said he earned about $600 a week.
But late one night the police picked him up as he walked away from a 1987 Chevy on Congress Avenue that had been broken into. He was charged with attempted car theft and violation of parole.
 
Hard to Break Out of Cycle
 The charges were among 25 he had accumulated since August. Others included assault, possession of cocaine, conspiracy, burglary and larceny. The day before he was picked up, his mother said, he stole $70 from her pocketbook. Late last month a juvenile court judge in New Haven placed the boy under the custody of the Department of Children and Youth Services for 18 months.
But marred by the disintegration of his family through poverty, drugs and violence, Michael may never break out of his cycle of destructive behavior. Often the lives of such youngsters evolve into a whirlwind of assaults, thefts, truancies, vandalism and other crimes, child behavior specialists say. Their actions frequently become part of a lifelong pattern.
A recent study by child behavior specialists at Yale University found that 80 percent of chronically troubled youngsters grow up to become adults with high rates of imprisonment, unemployment, failed marriages, alcoholism and other psychiatric disorders. The problem behavior is often passed from generation to generation.
"This is probably the most costly mental health problem we face in the United States," said Dr. Alan E. Kazdin, one of the study's authors. "Not only in terms of dollars but also in terms of human suffering."
The major risk factors in developing behavior problems, he said, include family violence, a parent with a criminal background, depression in the mother and learning disabilities. The study is one of dozens over the last decade that have focused on how poverty and the absence of parental skills form the basis for disturbed families and the behavior problems that occur in children as a result. Children in urban areas like New Haven are especially afflicted.
"Every kid that comes through our doors has a chronic dysfunction somewhere," said Melsetta McFadden, a probation officer for the state Juvenile Probation Department in New Haven. "We're dealing with severely dysfunctional families, and dysfunctional neighborhoods. And if we're going to try and fix one we've got to fix everything."
Raised in a poor, drug-infested neighborhood in the Hill section of New Haven, Michael began being suspended from school for fighting and verbally assaulting his teachers two years ago. Gun violence in the neighborhood escalated at the time and two close friends were shot and killed, one in a drive-by shooting. Soon after, his mother was accidentally shot by another son, who is 17 and now serving his second prison term for gun and drug violations. Earlier the boy's father had served a prison term for assault.
 
'Want to Be Somebody'
 After a long period of marital discord that included violence, the boy's parents recently separated. His mother is severely depressed about the separation and from the multiple disabilities that have resulted from the gunshot wound, she said.
While staying at his mother's on a 24-hour furlough from the Juvenile Detention Center in New Haven in December, Michael said he was excited about an education program offered by the Juvenile Probation Services. "I just want to be somebody," he said.
He wore baggy designer jeans that hung below his hips and a new red sweatshirt. His mother described him as angelic. An hour before the boy was due back at the detention center on Whalley Avenue, he ran away.
For the next three weeks, his mother said, she had nightmares about the boy's possible whereabouts. Every time she heard about another shooting death in New Haven, she said she was certain it was her son.
"I'd just have this feeling that I'd be burying my boy in 1993," she said.
When a police officer appeared at her door to say her son had been arrested, she said she cried in relief. She has applied to the Yale Child Conduct Study Center for counseling for herself and for her 9-year-old son in hopes of deterring him from following the same path as her two older children.
Dr. Kazdin estimated that up to 3.8 million schoolchildren in the United States exhibit chronic-behavior disorders. For the most part, counseling or medicating the youngsters has been ineffective, he said. In the Yale study, he found that treatment worked far better when parents were also taught constructive ways to discipline their children and help them practice new social skills.
"But this type of therapy is far from a cure," he said, "because this disorder appears to be a lifelong condition, especially when you've had a parent with the same problem."
The New Haven Family Alliance applies a similar family-oriented approach. The agency, which receives Federal and private financing, works with 150 families a year, who have been referred to them by the court system, schools or the Department of Children and Youth Services. Some 10 caseworkers work with 12 to 15 families each for a year to 18 months. Both children and parents receive individual and group counseling on a range of personal issues to help them build self-respect and find constructive ways to resolve conflicts. The agency also staffs neighborhood support centers that offer residents tutoring, drug counseling, parental workshops and support for grandparents who are raising their children's children.
 
Overcoming Mistrust
 Mustafa Abdul-Salaam, the agency's executive director, said that although the caseworkers had been able to stabilize about half of the families they see, winning trust was difficult because many poor families had developed a keen mistrust for social service agencies.
"We have made an entire welfare industry out of people's miseries," he said. "That leaves us with clients who have suffered years of abuse from a system that encourages dependency and discourages families to stay intact. Their level of hopelessness and mistrust goes very, very, very deep."
He added that about 80 percent of the agency's clients were affected by drug or alcohol abuse and that most of the families had also undergone generations of physical and sexual abuse, a possible predictor of behavior problems in adolescence.
In a study by the National Institute of Justice last year, researchers found that child abuse increased the odds of future delinquency and adult criminal behavior by 40 percent. Being neglected or abused as a child increased the likelihood of being arrested as a juvenile by 53 percent and as an adult by 38 percent.
Chris M., a 40-year-old mother of a 15-year-old boy, said she was trying to steer him away from a life of criminal actions. After he was suspended from school several times, juvenile officials put her in contact with the New Haven Family Alliance for family counseling. Like many parents who use the agency's services, she came from a troubled background. Sexually abused by her father at the age of 3, she said she was later pressed into having sex with her brother when she was 11. At 16, she attempted suicide, she said. After the birth of her son, she became sexually and emotionally involved with a woman, whom she has since lived with for 14 years. They have raised their children together, she said.
 
Lives of Pain and Inconsistency
 Last year, her son got angry at her for dealing drugs, she said, which prompted her to stop. Nevertheless, she said, the boy's anger continued to grow to the point where he became dangerous. In August, she said, he physically attacked her, forcing her companion to break them apart. The boy now lives with his aunt. She said she had joined a peer group for parents offered by the agency and received individual counseling to help her work through the emotional turmoil of her life and become an effective parent.
Another member of the group was a 27-year-old mother whose husband was imprisoned on rape charges. She had recently completed a drug-rehabilitation program after she discovered that her 3-year-old daughter had ingested cocaine. Her 7-year-old son was sexually molested by a cousin last year, she said. She said she was afraid of the long-term impact her neglect would have on her children's future.
Toni Sands, a caseworker, said that most parents who sought help through the agency had never received professional counseling or openly discussed their problems.
"These are people who are dealing with a billion scary issues," she said. "It's so hard for them to be consistent and firm with their kids when their lives have been filled with so much pain and inconsistency."
 
Goal: Stay Alive
 For many of the youngsters of these parents, life beyond the front door is equally precarious. Eddie Aybar counsels 40 to 50 juveniles a week at Project More, a social service agency for former offenders. He estimates that 60 percent of the youngsters he sees will repeat their criminal behaviors. Many arrive at their appointments terrified because they are being followed by armed gang members, he said.
"Even if their home life is intact, their neighborhood environment is so bad that it's bound to catch up with them."
One 17-year-old that Mr. Aybar was counseling one recent day told of the horror and venality of street life and the fear he shares with many of his friends that he will die young.
"Selling drugs, hanging out and trying to stay alive," he said, summarizing his generation. "That's what the youth of America is all about."

3 Megastores Proposed by Home Depot

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD

 BODY:
A PROPOSAL by Home Depot, the home-improvement discount giant, to build three megastores in southern Westchester County has encountered some opposition, particularly in Yonkers, where an organization was formed just last month to block its plans.
But Robert Morris, chief executive officer of the Morris Companies, of Secaucus, N.J., which would develop a 100-acre complex anchored by Home Depot in Yonkers, called Westchester "the perfect site" for such projects. 
 He noted that Yonkers was an "area with older housing stock and a dense population," where every day more people are doing their own home improvements."
In addition to Home Depot, the $60 million project would include Costco, a wholesale club, and another store, "probably Kmart," Mr. Morris said, plus a multiscreen cinema.
The three-building complex, with more than 450,000 square feet, will be near Austin Avenue, in the north central part of the city, right off the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway.
"It will really be a regional center," said Mr. Morris. "It will draw people from as far north as the Tappan Zee Bridge and as far south as the Bronx."
A similar project anchored by Home Depot has been proposed for New Rochelle. A third Home Depot is proposed for Port Chester.
A key opponent of Home Depot plans is Herbert Lockwood, president of the Citzens, Business & Labor for Proper Planning in Westchester, a group of business and residents formed last month to oppose the Home Depot projects.
Mr. Lockwood, who is president of Lockwood Lumber in Yonkers, calls the proposals for three megastores a "2,000-pound gorilla trying to fit into one shoe."
The group contends that Home Depot comes into a community seeking tax abatements and other favors that negate any benefits it might bring.
"The company saturates an area with stores, puts the competition out of business in order to gain total market dominance," said George Drapeau, spokesman for the opposition group. "Eventually one of the three stores is bound to fail, and one of these communities will be left holding the bag with a shell of a building."
The group maintains that that is what happened in Fairfield County, Conn., where several lumber companes did go out of business after Home Depot stores opened in Fairfield and Danbury.
Home Depot counters that there are economic reasons for the failure of those businesses.
"Lumber companies have also closed in Westchester," said Mark Bander, real estate manager for the Atlanta-based company, "and we're not even there yet."
Furthermore, Mr. Bander said, Home Depot meets a market need unserved by any other store. "For the first time, the do-it-yourselfer can afford to do the kinds of projects he's always wanted to do but couldn't finance before," he said.
At a crowded hearing on the project on March 9 before the Yonkers City Council, concerns were voiced about the traffic and noise that would be generated by the project. Many also opposed rezoning a part of the site to permit retail development. It is now zoned for office parks only.
Opponents say that such rezoning could set a dangerous precedent that would enable other retail development on sites not currently zoned for it.
The City Council is now split, 3 to 3, on the project, with Councilman Thomas Dickerson, a Republican, holding the swing vote. He said he had asked both sides to come up with more detailed information.
A COST analysis by Ernst & Young, a Manhattan accounting firm, that was commissioned by the developer was "superficial," said Mr. Dickerson. Among other things, the report estimates that the project would generate $5.7 million in recurring annual tax revenues for the city and bring in 950 new jobs. "I also want to know how many businesses will be hurt, how many unemployed and what taxes will be lost because of this," Mr. Dickerson said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Dickerson calls the proposal "the single most important revenue- generating project we've seen in this city in 30 years," adding that Home Depot and Costco would "be a big plus for consumers."
Home Depot currently has no stores in Westchester, but has opened outlets in Fairfield County, Bergen and Middlesex Counties in New Jersey and on Long Island.
In Westchester, other large discount centers have built stores, such as Tops Appliance City, an electronic and appliance retailer in Hawthorne, and Pace Membership Warehouse, a general merchandise store, in Elmsford.
The 26-acre New Rochelle site will include the $20 million, 165,000-square-foot Home Depot, BJ's Warehouse, Price Club and Costco.
"We expect the biggest tax benefit to be in sales tax," said Joseph Madonna, the city's development commissioner. He said that conservative estimates put total yearly sales volume for Home Depot alone at $60 million, "which would generate $900,000 for us" and create 150 to 200 jobs. Home Depot will develop its site. The remaining 13 acres will be developed jointly by Halpern Development Corporation of Tarrytown and G & S Investors of Farmingdale, L.I.
The little local opposition, Mr. Madonna said, came mostly from merchants. "I can understand their concerns, he said, "but I think the overall benefit to the city is going to be incredible. Without it we can't succeed."
The Port Chester project seems to have even more support, according to Mayor Peter Iasillo, who is retiring on April 5.
Some village residents fear that a 101,467-square-foot store on Midland Avenue bordering Rye would create traffic snarls and parking problems, a concern of Rye residents, who note that they will get none of the revenue benefits.
"They will be impacted," Mr. Iasillo said of the Rye residents, "but we've also been impacted by their projects and we're going to do what's best for Port Chester."
To accommodate an expected larger crowd, the Yonkers City Council meets again on the Home Depot complex tomorrow at 7:30 P.M. at Saunders Technical and Trades High School at 183 Palmer Road near the Saw Mill River Parkway.
"This is a big deal," Mr. Dickerson said. "It will take time to look at all the issues involved, not to mention what else might be brought up at the next hearing."

HEADLINE: The Global Village In the Classroom

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
MARSHALL McLUHAN'S vision of the world as a global village is becoming a reality in New Jersey high schools.
All across the state, more and more students are taking courses like Russian, advanced-placement economics and world geography from teachers who are hundreds or thousands of miles away, through a satellite hookup. So far, 45 schools have signed on, and 32 more are expected to join in next year. The system also provides training for the schools' teachers. 
 At the same time, 15 high schools and two colleges in Bergen County have been connected by fiber-optic cable, making it possible to share hundreds of hours of classroom instruction a week. And last month the Morris County Board of Freeholders approved financing for a similar system that will link 28 of the county's school districts and tie into the Bergen County network.
 
Interaction With Teacher
 Under the satellite system, far-distant teachers appear in New Jersey classrooms on television monitors. Speakerphones enable students to interact with the teacher, asking and answering questions, and to talk with fellow students from other states. Homework and exams are often passed along by computer key pad and modem.
School officials say the satellite system makes it possible for a school to offer courses it could not otherwise provide either because of limited student interest or an inability to find a certified teacher. Generally, only a handful of students are enrolled in each class.
"The thing that sold us was high interest and low numbers," said Paul Galusha, educational resources coordinator for Cedar Grove High School. "To be able to say that you took Russian, Latin and Japanese in a small school like Cedar Grove is really something."
Before it became one of the first schools in the state to embark on satellite learning four years ago, Cedar Grove, a 400-student high school, offered language courses in only Italian and Spanish.
But not all the subscribing schools are small. Pennsauken High School, with 1,300 students, receives nine different courses throughout the school day. The $14,000 the district pays in total tuition for the more than 25 students taking the courses represents a substantial saving over hiring even one teacher at an average salary of $42,000, said John Ritchie, the principal.
 
Hearing 'Distress' in a Voice
 Though the satellite teachers cannot see their students, the two-way speakerphone system makes up for that, teachers say.
"I can hear when they're asking a question they already know the answer to, or the distress in their voices when they have panicked and really need help," said Pam Winders, who teaches advanced-placement economics from Columbia, S.C., to more than 200 students from 18 states, including 56 in New Jersey.
She likens the experience to being blind and having one's hearing take over. "Before, I would have seen that by the look on their faces," she said. "Now, I hear it in their voices."
Ms. Winders said that, in the course of her teaching, many interstate friendships had developed among her students and at least one transcontinental romance had blossomed. And when the subject of a gasoline tax came up recently, students in South Carolina were surprised to learn from their classmates in New Jersey that self-service gasoline is illegal here.
"They find out about things they never could in a traditional classroom," she said. "But they are also 16, 17 or 18 years old, and they discover they're pretty much the same."
Ms. Winders said her students tend to perform at least as well as the national average on the advanced placement economics examination.
As high-tech as high school satellite learning seems, it is already being replaced by more advanced systems of telecommunications. While satellites allow for only one-way video transmission, the network of underground fiber-optic cables in Bergen County is providing two-way video transmission, enabling teachers and students in remote locations to both see and hear each other. Three high school classes can be linked with the teacher's classroom at any one time.
Susan Mullins, director of program development for Bergen County technical schools, said the county was just beginning to explore the potential of its fiber-optics system. She said, for example, that someday students in small high schools would have access to the same library information that a college student at a major university has.
"It's like using the basement and first floor of the Empire State Building and having the whole rest of the building to expand into," Ms. Mullins said. "This job is about 5 percent technology and 95 percent getting people to work together."
 
A Nonprofit Partnership
 The satellite system that New Jersey high schools are using, called the Satellite Educational Resources Consortium, is a nonprofit partnership between public broadcasters and 23 state departments of education. The cost to individual school districts runs about $3,000 for installation of a satellite dish and tuition of about $500 a student for each course. A teacher, who is usually excused from some other duty during the day, monitors each class and mails in assignments if they are not transmitted electronically.
For students who have been weaned on "Sesame Street" and MTV, staring at a television screen can be a familiar and enjoyable format.
"You pay more attention to the TV because there are a lot of pictures in the background that keep you entertained," said Kurt Long, a senior at North Plainfield High School who took probability and statistics last semester by satellite and is enrolled in a course in discrete mathematics this semester.
Kurt's teacher, Tom Graviss of Lexington, Ky., is not above receiving a pie in the face on camera to illustrate a mathematical point and keep students interested. A recipient of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics, Mr. Graviss, addressed by his students as Tom, ended his course on probability and statistics last semester with an animated video and rap song that summed up the subject.
 
Popularity of Japanese
 One of the most popular satellite courses is Japanese, with an enrollment of 176 students in New Jersey and 1,800 students nationwide. Yoshiko Hirano, a second-year Japanese teacher who broadcasts from Lincoln, Neb., said the biggest drawback to distance learning was her inability to stop a lesson if a student was having difficulty.
"I can't tell him to please come and see me," she said.
Ms. Hirano teaches three times a week for 50 minutes. During each class she interacts with about 20 students while the rest of her 500 students listen, which means that most of her pupils will have direct contact with her six times a year. Her students must also call in to telephone tutors twice weekly, who reinforce concepts and correct errors.
 
Problems Experienced
 Satellite instruction is not without its problems. There are occasional equipment breakdowns, and concentrating on a television set rarely equals the intensity and excitement that a gifted teacher can bring to a classroom. There are also scheduling problems since broadcasting starts in August before school opens in New Jersey and ends in early June, and the daily transmission hours are often at odds with a school's own class schedules.
Teachers worry, too, that they may one day become as obsolete as the one-room schoolhouse if distance learning really takes off. But that fear is unfounded, said Paula Keiser, coordinator of distance learning for New Jersey Network.
"If there is enough interest to hire a teacher, this is not the way to go," Ms. Keiser said. "It's not in any danger of replacing any teacher."
In addition to expanding curricular offerings, many districts are using satellites to transmit special programs throughout the year. When the Berlin wall was being torn down, students of German at Watchung Hills Regional High School watched the action live. Recently, 600 Cedar Grove students of all ages gathered at the high school for a teleconference with a NASA astronaut to discuss his trip to the moon.
"When one of your kids is talking to an astronaut, you get chills up and down your spine," Mr. Galusha said.
 
Training for Teachers
 Satellites are also being used to help train staff members and are drawing on the expertise of educators around the state. Among the programs for teachers have been a workshop on computers in the high school math curriculum that was produced by the Stevens Institute of Technology, a series on elementary science teaching from the New Jersey Institute of Technology and there have been teleconferences with the Thomas Kean State Aquarium and the New Jersey Department of Education.
Despite the relative economy of satellite learning, it still costs too much for some financially strapped districts. After beaming in Japanese, Russian and world geography for a few years, Boonton High School had to drop out of the system last year.
"It's all to do with finances, and nothing to do with the program," said Robert Kane, principal at Boonton High School. "If the financial picture improves, we'll come right back on line."
In Irvington, there is no classroom space to increase offerings beyond Japanese.
"There are no free classrooms anywhere, anytime," said Dennis Rumme, director of media services at Frank H. Morrell High School there, noting that Japanese was made possible only because an extended lunch hour had freed up a room.

 Bulgaria is not one of the former Soviet bloc countries that confront us almost daily with bad news, but it is in the throes of adjusting to a non-Communist form of government and a free-market economy. A glimpse of present-day Bulgaria will be provided in a slide presentation and lecture by Marguerita Z. Herman today at 2:30 P.M. in the Desmond-Fish Library in Garrison.
Ms. Herman was born in Sophia, Bulgaria's capital, but fled with her family in 1942 when she was 1 year old. She said that her first and only pilgrimage back to her native land last September was an unsettling experience.
"I went back to see about some family property that had been confiscated by the Communists and is now being returned," she said. She stayed with family members in Sophia and traveled to Blagoevgard, where the property is situated, trying to absorb a culture whose language she speaks fluently but whose day-to-day activities are quite alien.
"The pollution is unbelievable, and the difficulties in creating a free market are overwhelming," she said. "People are doing things like turning their garages into cafes." One of her cousins, who lives in Sophia, told her that it was doubtful her generation would make the transition but that she hoped her children would.
A coalition of parties, which made up the parliament while Ms. Herman was there, collapsed in October. "Now the Communists are back," she said, "calling themselves Socialists, but they seem to understand that they cannot return the country to Communism." Admission to the lecture is free.
 
CHILDREN'S CONCERT
 A musical program for children, enhanced with puppets and audience participation, begins today at 2 P.M. at the Bronxville Public School, 177 Pondfield Road. The Fine Arts Symphony will be joined by Barbara Pollitt and her puppets in a performance of "Peter and the Wolf," narrated by Karen Bevan.
Ms. Pollitt designed the puppets and masks for "Jelly's Last Jam" on Broadway, and she has performed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, the Royal Court Theater in London and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Today's program also includes Sousa's "Stars and Stripes Forever" and "Four Musicians of Bremen" by Louis F. Simon, director of the Fine Arts Symphony. Tickets are $8 at the door; the number to call for reservations or more information is 368-2300.
 
NAVAJO PAINTER
 Mark Silversmith's father and grandfather were Navajo silversmiths in New Mexico, and Mark has followed his family's artistic tradition but as a painter working in watercolor, pastel, acrylics and prints. He will have a three-day show at Steve's Trading Post in Scarsdale Friday through Sunday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M., when he will be on hand to demonstrate his painting techniques.
Approximately 50 pieces of his work will be on display. Most are realistic scenes of the Navajos and the countryside they inhabit in New Mexico. The pictures are sensitively colored and meticulously drawn, melting into misty backgrounds that evoke the Indians' views on earth and the elements.
The Trading Post is at 75 Garth Road; the phone number for more information is 472-8094.

HEADLINE: HOW JACK KEMP LOST THE WAR ON POVERTY

 BODY:
A major criticism leveled against the Bush Administration was that its members were apathetic and out of touch with the day-to-day problems faced by average Americans. In light of that, DeParle's article was particularly ironic. Jack Kemp defied traditional Republican conservative ideology by fiercely advocating the cause of America's poor and downtrodden. It's a tribute to Kemp that his ideals have been embraced by members of all political persuasions and that he continues to be a favorite among conservatives. To portray Kemp's efforts in any other way is patently unfair. Even staunch supporters of the Bush Administration recognize that housing issues were low on the budgetary priority list. It is a credit to Kemp that he continued to battle for what he believed was right despite constant opposition. Perhaps the new administration will be more responsive to the nation's housing crisis. If not, in four more years Jack Kemp may be given a real opportunity to empower America.

HEADLINE: HOW JACK KEMP LOST THE WAR ON POVERTY

 BODY:
After digesting DeParle's unsettling article, the circumstances leading to policy paralysis in the White House and the ultimate political demise of George Bush have become clearer still. Gridlock in Washington evidently had its genesis at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue before spreading tumorously toward Capitol Hill and was the result of largely of weak leadership and sandbox standoffs at Cabinet meetings. Indeed, G.O.P. bickering and infighting has continued long after Election Day, even as President Clinton cleans the cobwebs in the Oval Office.

HEADLINE: America's Newest Industrial Belt

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: CHIHUAHUA, Mexico

 BODY:
WALK down the long rows of huge machines, newly installed in the freshly painted Ford Motor Company factory. Stop to examine the futuristic control panels that will run this automated factory. Watch Mexican engineers fine-tuning the new machines. And it becomes easy to imagine -- except for the Spanish and the low salaries -- that this most modern of engine plants is really in Dearborn, Mich., and not here on an arid plateau in northern Mexico.
Staffing the plant are people like Eleazor Faudoa, a 32-year-old technician equal in skill and motivation to the best in Dearborn, but earning only $1,000 a month, one-fourth the wage of an American counterpart. Currently, Mr. Faudoa heads a team completing the installation of machines that will grind the connecting rods for a new four-cylinder, multi-valve engine. Illustrating the sort of initiative often sought from American workers, Mr. Faudoa had a say in the machinery's design. "The manufacturers agreed to incorporate some of our suggestions," he said, "like those for a simpler electrical system and for easier access for maintenance." 
 The Ford engine plant is just one example of the rise of advanced manufacturing in northern Mexico, mainly to make products for export to the United States. A.T.& T. is making telephone answering machines; the Big Three, cars and engines; Zenith, television sets; Whirlpool, washing machines. The list goes on, deep into the roster of Fortune Magazine's 500 largest manufacturing companies. They are joined by other foreign giants, like Nissan and Sony, and a handful of Mexican manufacturers. Having invested millions, the Mexicans are exporting paper, tiles, glass and other products to America.
Northern Mexico -- not just the border towns but a strip more than 300 miles deep -- is rapidly becoming the newest American industrial belt. By most accounts, nearly 600,000 jobs have been located in Mexico that in the past might have been in the United States. Most are at maquiladoras, the simple assembly plants that pioneered the migration in the 1970's. But the maquiladoras are increasingly being automated, making them harder to tell apart from Midwestern factories.
 
The 51st State
 "The technological superiority that retained the most advanced production in the United States is disappearing, so that northern Mexico is now almost a 51st state in terms of production," said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at San Diego, who has written on Mexico's industrial transformation. "Boeing might still have a hard time making jet airliners in Mexico, but Mexican workers can match the skills of 70 percent of the labor force in the United States."
The rise of modern manufacturing techniques in northern Mexico seems certain to draw much more American industry to this country, hurting the American work force while amounting to only a mixed blessing for Mexican workers.
For Americans, it may no longer be true that a factory in the United States can be made more profitable than one in Mexico, even if a factory owner in America automates and retrains workers. Ford and others are discovering that semi-automation in Mexico -- with equally skilled and trainable, but lower-paid workers -- can be cheaper than full automation in the United States.
Many American executives argue that if they did not relocate to Mexico, they would be moving operations to low-wage countries in the Far East. Because Mexico is so close, the factories here at least buy their machinery in the United States, along with most of the parts that go into the products. That creates jobs in the United States. But a Mexican manufacturing belt increasingly capable of matching American production seems to guarantee a continuing shift of jobs to the south.
"That is going to create a political problem in the United States that is not likely to surface for two or three more years," Professor Shaiken said. "And when it does surface, it will be difficult to undo. The North American Free Trade Agreement will have locked in the open border arrangement that makes the job shifting possible."
For Mexicans, there is a gain as more companies hire people like Mr. Faudoa, creating a new class of factory managers and professionals. But the automation is also prompting factories to shrink the number of production workers. Partly for this reason, manufacturing employment in Mexico failed to grow last year.
Finally, to maintain the low wages that draw American companies to Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has gotten commitments from business and union leaders to limit raises. It could be years before the gap with American wages narrows significantly, said John Pearlman, chairman of the Zenith Electronic Corporation, which has 20,000 employees in Mexico.
 
A Coming of Age
 The transformation of Mexican manufacturing is only gradually becoming evident. Until now, the American presence had been most noticeable in the border towns, like Ciudad Juarez. The image there was of unskilled people earning very little to perform simple, repetitive assembly.
But farther from the Rio Grande, major cities like Hermosillo, Monterrey and Chihuahua are becoming more representative of northern Mexico's coming of age in manufacturing. The shipments north from these cities are contributing mightily to Mexico's merchandise exports, which reached $16.7 billion last year from a meager $10 billion in 1986.
The lure for the owners of Mexico's new factories is still low pay. But in the 1980's, corporate America realized that low wages could attract not only unskilled people, but also educated applicants in cities like Chihuahua that boast many graduates from public universities and technical schools.
"Without this pool of skilled people, we could not have put a high-tech factory in Chihuahua," said Lyle Raymond, manager of the Ford engine plant. The plant, which has made engines since 1984 for cars sold in the United States, is about to reopen after retooling to make the new four-cylinder engine.
Chihuahua, located on a mountain plain 230 miles south of El Paso, is a birthplace of this process. Now, more than 40,000 people, nearly one-third of the city's workers, are employed in the pastel-colored factories that are spreading across the plain, appearing from a distance like tiny spots of fresh paint against a backdrop of steeply rising mountains.
The Ford engine plant's employees are a cross section of the new work force. One hundred are licensed engineers -- earning $1,400 a month on average and often functioning as foremen, a task that American engineers consider beneath their skills. The 700 production workers are high school or technical school graduates, hired for the assembly line at $1.55 an hour and trained by Ford to work up to electrician, machinery repair, computer programmer or mechanic. The top pay for such specialties is $3 an hour. Mr. Faudoa is a graduate of these ranks, having risen through endless training to be a supervisor of foremen.
The Ford pay, slightly above the norm for Mexico, is deeply below American levels, where a manufacturing worker's average wage is $11 an hour and an engineer newly out of school commands $25,000 to $30,000 a year as a starting salary. By comparison, Esquiel De Luna, a 20-year-old sophomore in electronic engineering at the Institute of Technology here, expects to earn $400 a month -- $4,800 a year -- at one of the factories upon graduation, and work up to $12,000 annually in three or four years. "I would not take a first job as an engineer for less than $400," he said.
 
The Shrinking Payroll
 Seeking to maintain the low-wage lure, President Salinas got business and labor to agree to hold annual wage increases to less than 10 percent this year, in a nation that had 12 percent inflation last year. But he is losing ground on another front: he has promised Mexicans thousands of new jobs, many from American companies here. Now, factory modernization is undercutting this goal.
Just as companies in the United States have automated and shrunk their staffs, automation is limiting job growth in Mexico. The automation here, however, is meant not to save wages, but to improve quality.
"Sixty percent of what we once did by hand is now done by machinery," said Elio Bacich, director of a maquiladora here owned by Zenith that produces circuit boards and TV coders. Employment at the plant has fallen to 2,400, from 3,300, in recent years.
The trend is very visible in Chihuahua, a city of nearly 600,000 with striking combinations of new homes near squatter neighborhoods and shiny malls a few blocks from rundown stores. The population has tripled since the 1970's, and as people migrated here from rural areas, jobs grew at an 8 percent annual rate -- until the 1990's, when job growth halted, at 140,000 employees.
"I would say that the unemployment rate in the city has risen to 8 percent or more, double what it was three years ago," Mayor Patricio Martinez said. "This does not include housewives who worked and now don't. We don't count them as unemployed."
The growing automation is chipping away at a widely held economic theory. That theory states that Mexico and other low-wage countries should be centers of labor-intensive operations while the industrial nations should remain home for the best manufacturing technologies. But some American companies are finding the arithmetic of partial automation in Mexico persuasive. Given their low wages, five Mexicans operating a partly automated assembly line here cost less than one or two Americans on a fully automated line in the Midwest.
Nothing illustrates the trend more clearly than Ford's decision to switch the manufacture of dashboard gauges from a factory in Saline, Mich., to a Ford-owned maquiladora in Chihuahua named Altec. Altec employs 3,000 people to produce radios and other car components. It is assigning 700 people to the production of dashboard gauges, replacing 400 workers in Michigan by 1995. The alternative would be to automate in Michigan.
"When you automate, you get rid of direct labor, but you add indirect labor costs for very skilled people to maintain the more complicated equipment," said Thomas E. Davis, Altec's controller. Mario M. Okubo, Altec's manager, put it more simply. "We brought the production here and saved the business," he said.
 
Getting the Skills
 The pressure to be more skilled also touches young women like Magdalena Munoz, a 19-year-old operator in an automated assembly process at the Zenith plant, which like most of the 60 maquiladoras in Chihuahua is evolving into a higher-tech factory.
Young women seated at long tables in one area of the warehouse-like building still function in traditional maquiladora fashion, repetitively placing plastic and wire prongs into slots. These are the larger parts of a circuit board, and the labor-intensive work that these women do, for $1 an hour, originally prompted Zenith to shift production to Chihuahua from factories in the Midwest.
But technology has miniaturized other circuit board components, so that many tasks can no longer be done with precision by hand. And not far from the women seated at their tables, Zenith has installed computer-controlled machines to stamp or glue these tiny parts onto circuit boards. Ms. Munoz has been trained to operate one of these machines.
As the boards emerge, she scans a computerized readout to make certain the parts have been properly placed; if they haven't, she adjusts the machine or tries to fix the problem by hand. If she can't, she calls over a technician or engineer.
Ms. Munoz's pay is 137 pesos, or $45, for a 45-hour week, the same as the wage for the women assigned to hand assembly. A dollar an hour is the standard factory wage in Chihuahua, although the most modern factories -- like the Ford engine plant -- start production employees higher, at $1.25 or $1.50 an hour. These factories employ mostly young men, while the maquiladoras hire mostly young women.
Ms. Munoz's wage might rise with more training, if she stays. Worker turnover at maquiladoras is often more than 20 percent a year. That is a new problem for companies increasingly in need of retaining experienced workers to operate automated machinery. Rather than raises, other incentives are offered to try to keep people like Ms. Munoz.
A company bus takes her, free of charge, from her parents' home outside the city, a 90-minute trip, and returns her at day's end. She gets two free meals on the job. There is a free health clinic and some factories, like Altec, have ball fields, gymnasiums, adult education courses and social halls that workers can use for family weddings and parties.
But Ms. Munoz's day lasts from the time she rises before dawn until she returns home after dark from her long commute. She had kept a similar schedule for a year at another maquiladora, and then took a year off. Will she stay this time, and go through more training to master the complex equipment that Zenith is installing?
A partial answer comes from Graciela Ramos, who directs a center for working women. "These women see themselves as subjected to intense work and, increasingly, skilled work," Ms. Ramos said. "They know that what they do is worth much more in the United States. They don't discuss this even among themselves. The turnover is their resistance; when they can't take it anymore, they quit. But they take jobs again. Despite everything, the work gives them a sense of self-respect that women don't get at home."
Gerald Gonzalez, 22, is a notch or two above Ms. Munoz in Mexico's work force hierarchy. He was among 125 young men hired recently by Grupo Ponderosa to operate its new paper mill. For years, the Mexican company has manufactured pulp at a plant outside Chihuahua, and now it has opened a paper mill alongside the pulp factory, investing $230 million in the project.
Rather than just sell pulp to Mexican companies, the struggle now is to compete across an open border against American companies that also produce white paper for writing and for copying machines. Mr. Gonzalez and his mates, having survived the hiring tests, are being trained to operate the complicated machinery, made in Finland.
"If this group can learn all the tasks and have a vision of the whole paper-making process, including how to maintain the equipment and repair it, these young men will be more valuable, even though most of their work will be repetitive," said Hector M. Raynal, the plant's director.
That is two years of training, at the end of which Mr. Gonzalez is to earn 250 pesos -- $83 -- for a 48-hour week, or $1.73 an hour. He now earns 165 pesos a week, or $1.15 an hour.
Grupo Ponderosa has recruited its new paper mill workers not from Chihuahua, but from two smaller communities nearer the paper mill, where 165 pesos a week seems like a lot. Furthermore, "For only 17 pesos a month," Mr. Gonzalez said, "I live with my wife and baby in a bungalow on the plant grounds."
Grupo Ponderosa has managed to add the paper mill to the pulp operation without increasing the work force. Having installed a partly automated mill and having upgraded the pulp operation, the company is operating the complex with 400 people -- the same number that once staffed only the pulp plant.
 
Weighing the Costs
 That sort of labor savings is helping to fuel a debate over whether Mexico's low wages still justify shifting production to this country -- since even here the labor content of a given product is declining. For example, George Baker, an Oakland, Calif., economic consultant whose specialty is Mexico, argues that Mexican production is burdened by other costs, not present in the United States, that offset the savings in wages. These include poor transportation, power outages and an absence of nearby suppliers.
Mr. Pearlman of Zenith disagrees. "When I factor in other nonlabor costs -- less heat, cheaper land and cheaper construction -- there is no question that Mexico's lower labor costs are decisive," he said.
So are Mexico's markedly nonmilitant unions. And nonlabor costs are falling as the infrastructure improves. Until its engine plant closed for retooling in 1991, Ford had been shipping engines north to El Paso by railroad. Now, tractor-trailers will haul the engines in half the time on a recently opened high-speed toll road.
The plant here and a Ford engine plant in Dearborn had competed to be the manufacturer of the new four-cylinder engine. The final decision, depriving Dearborn of 500 jobs, involved factors that went beyond labor costs, Ford officials said.
Ford originally put the engine plant here to satisfy Mexican export requirements for doing business in this country, and those requirements won't disappear completely during the first decade of the free trade agreement. Then, too, Ford sells more than 100,000 cars a year in Mexico, and the bad publicity from shifting Chihuahua's production back to the United States could have hurt Mexican sales, Mr. Raymond, the plant manager, said.
Finally, retooling the Dearborn plant would have required an extra $20 million investment -- $420 million versus $400 million here -- for enough automation to reduce the labor force.
Thus companies drawn by low wages find other reasons to stay, entrenching northern Mexico as an American industrial belt.

 
 
FOR MEXICAN COMPANIES, OPPORTUNITY AND PERIL
 The integration of northern Mexico into the United States industrial base is bringing opportunity to some Mexican companies and peril to many others.
Among those prospering in Chihuahua is the Almeida family, which has multiplied a grandfather's brick factory into a modern manufacturer of household and commercial tiles, employing new Italian technology.
Nearby clay deposits, owned by the Almeidas, give their company, Interceramic, an important advantage. So does the recently installed automated machinery that carries out most of the production process. The company's largest bank lender, Banamex, is also a big shareholder, and an American partner, Armstrong World Industries, helps with marketing in the United States, where 20 percent of Interceramic's output is sold.
"If you put the same plants here and in the United States," said Victor D. Almeida, Interceramic's chief executive, "with people of similar skills earning similar wages, the cost here would still be 5 to 10 percent less."
Maybe. Grupo Ponderosa, owner of a pulp factory and a new paper mill here, has not been so lucky. It is going against an American industry more powerful than American tilemakers. With Mexican tariffs slashed, American paper companies raised sales here by 64 percent in 1992, endangering Mexican paper companies that buy Ponderosa's pulp.
In building a paper mill, Ponderosa hoped to compete against the Americans, not only in Mexico but in the nearby Southwestern United States. So far, the strategy has not worked; the company has lost money and recently renegotiated $200 million in debts.
"The United States industry is very competitive," said Irene W. Meister, a vice president of the American Forest and Paper Association. She added that American paper makers had an advantage in technology, chemicals and wood supplies -- advantages the new free trade agreement will strengthen.
And then there is Arnulfo Solis D'Santiago, president of Chihuahua's Association of Small Manufacturers and himself the owner of a company that makes truck bodies and trailers. His work force is down to 52, from 76, and production has fallen to 400 units a year, from 1,500.
Second-hand American trucks, driven south in growing numbers, are cutting into the business, Mr. Solis said, and now that quotas have been lifted on new truck imports, he is expecting to be hurt from that quarter, too. "All our members have the same problem," he said. "We lack the economies of scale, the technology and the marketing to compete."
And Mr. Solis's solution? Well, he is trying to ally with a Minnesota company that makes hydraulic dump truck lifts. Mr. Solis would sell the lifts in Mexico and the American company would sell his dump truck bodies in the United States.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Bond That Only a Gambler Would Consider

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
FIFTEEN percent.
In this age of 5 percent Treasuries and 3 percent bank rates, doesn't that number make you nostalgic? Wouldn't you love an investment that promised that kind of return? 
 If so, Donald Trump and Merrill Lynch have a deal for you. The price talk on the new issue of $50 million in Trump Plaza Holding Associates bonds is a lip-smacking 15 percent. Add in a sweetener -- buyers get additional bonds, absolutely free, after three years -- and the promised yield is over 16 percent.
Those bonds are secured, sort of, by a majority stake in Trump Plaza, one of Mr. Trump's three Atlantic City casinos. A couple of years ago, that casino could not pay its bills and had to restructure its debts, but results have picked up recently, and this $50 million bond issue is to be sold in April. The new bonds rank below every other obligation, and they won't pay out any cash for eight years. Until then, interest will be paid by issuing more bonds.
If you're interested in collateral, these bonds are probably not for you. There isn't much of it, which is why Max Holmes, a Salomon Brothers bond analyst, calls them "fluff bonds." The prospectus devotes a lot of space to listing classes of people and investors with prior claims to the casino's cash flow. Mr. Trump does not guarantee payment, but his personal guarantee is a bit devalued anyway. Some of the proceeds from the bonds will go to pay his bank debts at 50 cents on the dollar.
If this bond issue sells, and Mr. Holmes says he believes there are enough "yield hogs" in mutual-fund land that it will, a new peak in junk will have been reached. In the most speculative days of the 1980's, even the most outrageous junk issues promised to begin cash payments within five years. But in underwriting this deal, Merrill has to delay the cash for eight years, simply because earlier cash flows are already reserved for others.
A buyer is betting that the casino's profits will continue to improve for the next decade, that competition will not get too severe despite the trend to allow casinos in more states, and that by the next century it will be possible for the casino to borrow enough money from others to pay off these bonds. If that bet fails, the bondholders will have a claim to a majority stake in a highly leveraged casino. But the casino's intricate management structure assures that even after default the bondholders would have no say in operating the casino, and no influence over whether the casino paid money to them.
After the junk bond market collapsed in 1990, the words "never again" were heard from investors and fund managers. As it has revived -- Securities Data reports that more junk bonds have been sold in 1993 than in 1990 and 1991 combined -- there have been frequent reassurances that the new issues are of much higher quality than the old ones. That has been true. But if this issue is any indication, the deterioration in credit quality is proceeding apace.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
A British Star Called Telecom

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
FEW companies have remade themselves so completely as British Telecommunications P.L.C., the state-owned phone company that was privatized in 1984. Since privatization, it has ruthlessly cut costs, shed its slow-moving bureaucratic methods and claimed a place as a dominant force in the worldwide telecommunications industry. In the process, its stock, which trades on both the London and New York Stock Exchanges, has become a favorite among analysts.
"I follow everything in the industry, and within the universe of telecom stocks, B. T. is clearly at the most attractive end of the spectrum," said Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York. 
 Analysts said the company, which holds about 90 percent of the domestic and international telephone market in Britain, has done an admirable job of paring costs to prepare for ever-increasing competition. In the last year alone, British Telecom has cut 38,000 jobs, reducing employment to 170,000, and it plans to shed an additional 15,000 positions in each of the next two years.
Over the last 20 years, analysts note, there has been a close relationship between the strength of the economy and the volume of phone calls. British Telecom's lower operating costs -- the job reductions are projected to save as much as $1.5 billion a year by 1997, although expenses related to the cuts are biting into current profits -- will bring it even more benefit than it would otherwise get from an economic rebound.
After three years of deep recession, the economy here is showing tentative signs of life, and according to Government estimates should grow 1.25 percent this year after shrinking by 0.5 percent in 1992.
"If and when the U.K. economy begins to recover, the leverage to the earnings of B.T. is tremendous," Mr. Grubman said. "They will be exiting the recession with 80,000 fewer people than when they entered."
Analysts said the improving earnings could bring dividend growth and lift the stock price. The stock closed on Friday in London at 423 pence, up 38.7 percent over its 1992-93 low. In New York, the American Depositary Receipts closed Friday at 63 3/8, up 3/4, but 10.3 percent below their 52-week high, primarily reflecting the dollar's 25 percent rise against the pound since September.
Analysts view the stock as already attractive to investors because it offers a relatively high dividend yield -- nearly 5 percent -- with low risk. "Relative to the market, it's still offering a good yield," said Stephen Owen, an analyst here at James Capel & Company. "And it's not like the average U.K. utility, which offers good yield but doesn't have much upside in a recovery."
British Telecom is by no means without problems or challenges. From an investment perspective, some analysts are worried that the British Government's plan to sell all or some of its remaining 21.8 percent stake in the company this year will dilute demand and hold down any rise in share prices.
From a technological perspective, like all phone companies, it faces competition in the long run from satellite-based personal communications systems that would largely bypass traditional phone lines.
In the short term, it faces growing competition in its home market, where it gets more than 90 percent of its revenues. Its main rival in Britain, Mercury Communications, continues to make inroads by underpricing British Telecom, particularly on international calls. Cable television companies, some of which have teamed up with telephone companies from the United States, including US West Inc., are starting to offer telephone service.
The British Government, determined to foster competition, continues to license new telephone carriers. So far, however, most of them are small and unlikely to pose a major near-term threat to British Telecom.
The company is pressing ahead with an international strategy to offset the restrictions on growth in Britain, even though it has had several false starts internationally. It is selling its 20 percent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications of the United States to American Telephone and Telegraph.
The British company's current emphasis is on developing ways to serve multinational companies that need international voice and data communications. With relatively little debt and a growing cash pile, analysts said, it has the flexibility to expand abroad.
One of its thrusts is in the United States, where this month it asked the Federal Communications Commission for permission to operate telephone service. The ability to send calls from the United States would be crucial to its plans to offer "one-stop shopping" to big corporations around the world. But the plan is certain to encounter opposition from the American telecommunications industry unless American companies are given reciprocal permission to move into Britain.
British Telecom has also held talks about purchasing or taking a stake in EDS, the data-management company founded by H. Ross Perot that is now owned by the General Motors Corporation.
Its other big opportunity is in Europe, where the European Community is moving hesitantly toward opening highly protected national markets to competition.
"There is going to be only a small handful of companies that will be centers that offer true global services," Mr. Grubman said. "A.T.& T. will be one, and B. T. will be another. Along with A.T.& T., it's the only company that has the resources and the balance sheet to go around the world and forge alliances."

HEADLINE: The Dangers of Declaring War on Doctors

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
WILL Washington soon be in the business of telling doctors and hospitals how much they can charge? Hillary Rodham Clinton & Company aren't saying, but you don't need trifocals to read the handwriting on this wall: The only way to expand access to health care without tapping new sources of revenue is to regulate prices.
While what Administration insiders term "interim cost containment measures" can be accomplished in other ways, the President will most likely extend the elaborate system used by the Government to limit reimbursement of doctors and hospitals for care of the elderly and disabled. 
 The prospect is generating no outrage from free-market economists because it is widely understood that the prices of medical services bear little relation to cost. But economists are extremely skeptical that price controls will do more good than harm. They worry that the immediate financial gains from squeezing health care providers could be more than offset by the additional worthless procedures and bad will elicited in treating physicians and hospitals as the enemy.
The point has not been lost on the medical lobbies. "Price controls are a simple quick fix that will alienate the medical profession," said Dr. James Todd, senior vice president of the American Medical Association.
As important, economists fear that the focus on prices will distract from the core issue driving medical inflation: the failure to ration ever more expensive technology. "Once you have controls, you won't be able to muster political support for tough structural changes," argued Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
For a project so prominent, the Clinton reform effort has been remarkably successful in keeping its own counsel. But the President has not cloaked his desire to wring savings through price controls.
Mr. Clinton's apparent method for cutting costs is an outright abandonment of competitive market principles -- and not worth mourning, suggested Peter Diamond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, because there never was a competitive market to lose. Consumers of medical services barely understand what they are buying in the best of times. And the bulk of services are consumed in the worst of times, when people are hardly capable of rational choices about who should dissect their innards or how much they should pay.
Consumers barely understand what they are buying. And even if patients were up to the task of comparison shopping, they rarely would have the incentive because most bills are paid by insurance companies or the Government.
The distortions created by these "third party payments" are probably large. A classic experiment run by the Rand Corporation in the 1970's showed that requiring patients to write checks when they went to the doctor sharply reduced the demand for routine health care. It should not be surprising, then, that Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution thinks the fees currently paid by private insurers "are essentially arbitrary" -- virtually unrelated to actual costs.
If President Clinton (and Congress) does decide on controls, there are a number of options. The simplest is a freeze, with prices locked in place on the date of announcement. But "even 30 to 60 days is a long time" for a freeze, said John Dunlop, the Harvard economist who administered the general price controls imposed in 1971 by President Nixon.
At some point, Washington would have to allow providers to pass through increased costs, a process that could quickly become unworkable unless the Government was also prepared to dictate wages, employment levels and capital spending. Such micromanagement of medical-care providers would not be very different from nationalization.
This is what happened during the Nixon era. Wage increases were limited economywide to 5.5 percent and price increases to 2.5 percent. If a company -- or, in this case, a hospital -- wanted more, it had to justify each item in its budget to the regulators.
THIS task was never easy for services, like medical care, where there is no clear measure of total output and therefore no straightforward way to measure cost per unit of output. And Mr. Bosworth noted that the difficult became close to impossible after the big jump in oil prices cascaded through the economy through a million different routes. To the relief of almost everybody, the system was phased out in 1974.
"Administered price controls sound tempting," said Mr. Bosworth, who worked on the price regulators' staff. "But the details drive you nuts."
Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton University, is not even tempted: "It's like lending the car to teen-agers and telling them not to make love: How do you police it?"
The most likely alternative, insiders agree, is one that builds on efforts to curb the costs of Government insurance for the elderly.
Washington, struggling to contain double-digit cost increases in Medicare since the early 1970's, came up with a comprehensive program for hospitals in 1983. Since then hospitals have been required to classify each Medicare patient's illness into one of 487 Diagnosis-Related Groups, or D.R.G.'s in the alphabet soup of health care. They are paid a flat fee for each D.R.G. admission, which is calculated to cover the average cost of treatment -- provided the hospitals are running efficiently.
A parallel system is now being phased in for physicians. Called the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (R.B.R.V.S.), it divides Medicare treatment into some 7,000 procedures graded according to the time and expertise needed. For example, a colonoscopy rates as 8.43 times as valuable as an ordinary office visit for an established patient, so Medicare will pay 8.43 times as much for it. (See chart.)
The idea would be to extend the D.R.G. and R.B.R.V.S. scales to the treatment of all patients, not just those insured by the Government. Adjustments might be made to reflect lower rents and wages in, say, Alabama than in California.
Would it work? Care providers have beaten the Medicare caps by shifting overhead expenses to bills paid by unregulated private insurers. Medicare now covers just 90 percent of the average cost of care, while private patients pay more than 120 percent. But if all payments were regulated, there would be no place to shift.
Well, not quite. Economists worry about what health planners euphemistically refer to as the "behavioral response."
"The services provided by doctors are infinitely expandable" as they struggle to make up income lost to price controls, said Dr. Jack Resnick, the president of Managed Care Inc., a health maintenance organization on Long Island. Physicians and hospitals could also fight back by "upcoding" (billing for procedures that receive higher reimbursement rates) and by "unbundling" (billing for one procedure as two or three parts that cost more than the whole). Indeed, these practices are apparently so acceptable to the medical community that software makers sell programs to help physicians and hospitals maximize Medicare billing.
Today, Medicare administrators assume that every dollar saved by binding fee limits is offset by a 50-cent increase through volume, upcoding and unbundling.
ONE solution is to put a cap on total payments -- what the cognoscenti call global budgeting. Insurers might, for example, hold back a portion of the payments due physicians and hospitals, and then cut reimbursements by the proportion that total bills exceeded the allotted expenditure for the group insured.
This is guaranteed to work, if the philosopher-kings in charge of budgeting are resolute. But it might not work in a way that satisfied patients or providers.
For one thing, global budgeting is an accounting exercise, not a way to determine how much medical care is enough. It would not, for example, address which new procedures would be covered, and at what rates. This is no small matter: Joseph Newhouse, an economist at Harvard, estimates that half of the increase in the national bill for medical care now goes to pay for new technology.
For another, it would give physicians a strong incentive to order every test and procedure they could. The alternative would be to order only necessary treatments and lose income to less scrupulous practitioners.
Then there is the issue of regional equity. Alabamans spend less per medical procedure and undergo fewer procedures than Californians. Would global budgets lock these differences in place, or would they be used to equalize the quality of care? If the latter, would Californians be asked, in effect, to sacrifice to make Alabama a healthier place to live?
Kenneth Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, points out that this issue is further complicated by the fact that some states have already begun to squeeze hospitals. In New York City, regulated reimbursement rates for private insurers kept hospital operating margins to 0.3 percent in 1991, compared with the national average of 3.9 percent. Curbs on capital spending pushed occupancy rates to 88 percent, compared with 66 percent nationally. Would states that have already pared the quantity and, by most accounts, the quality of hospital care be asked to cut back proportionately?
EXPERTS are divided about the merits of price controls and global budgeting. What comes through loud and clear, however, is that tough regulation aimed at saving money during the transition to universal care would carry heavy penalties.
Mr. Reinhardt of Princeton points out that countries that have arguably done a better job at containing medical costs while delivering high-quality care -- notably Germany and Canada -- have managed it by emphasizing cooperation with providers. The prospects for creating such a social contract here are bound to be diminished by a declaration of war on the industry.
Mr. Bosworth worries that controls could undermine what comes after. The experience of the Nixon controls, he says, suggests that an effective squeeze on medical bills would generate a burst of inflation when controls were lifted. And hardly anything could do more to discredit reforms in health care.
 
DRUG MAKERS' FIRST-STRIKE STRATEGY
EAGER to soften the punch of price regulation, drug makers have staged a pre-emptive strike: the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has told President Clinton that the industry will voluntarily limit price increases to the cost of living.
That offer is not likely to satisfy industry critics because it would not prevent manufacturers from introducing new drugs at prices of their choosing. Nor would the proposal touch problems outlined last month by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment: high marketing expenditures, discrimination against domestic consumers and the proliferation of drugs that add nothing to the therapeutic arsenal. But it could save face for President Clinton, who may think twice before plunging into this regulatory quagmire.
Prescription drugs absorb just a nickel of the American health care dollar, a smaller fraction than in any other advanced country save Britain. Moreover, pharmaceuticals are often part of the solution rather than the problem: modern ulcer drugs, for example, are substitutes for surgery 20 times as expensive.
But there are a few clouds raining on this technological Eden. Drug makers spend one-fifth of their revenue on marketing -- a mighty $10 billion. And they charge less per dose in countries where governments negotiate drug purchases. Then, too, the Office of Technology Assessment frets that manufacturers invest excessively in drugs that duplicate competitors': between 1975 and 1989, 58 percent of new drugs fell into this "me too" category.
That said, it is hard to find an economist who believes regulators would know how to keep the innovative muscle and get rid of the fat. The best hope, suggested Joseph Newhouse of Harvard, is that health care reforms will give consumers the collective muscle and expertise to bargain for the best prices -- and maybe even push drug makers toward the most productive research.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Investing as the Rules Change

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
WITH President Clinton's economic package now on the table, and higher taxes for many at the core of it, some fine tuning of fund portfolios may be in order.
The Administration is proposing higher tax rates, a wider gap between the top rates on income and capital gains and policies that favor some market sectors over others. But advisers stress that only small adjustments, if any, should be made in light of these proposals, and those only with an eye to the long term and a firm grasp of the basics. Uncertain times, they counsel, call for exceptional discipline. 
 "Investment strategies should never be tax-driven," said Robert Clarfeld, president of Clarfeld & Company, a New York City accounting and financial planning firm. Long-term investing, he said, "should be based only on the fundamentals."
Still, planners note several things for investors to consider.
The Clinton plan would raise the top Federal income tax rate to 36 percent for couples with taxable incomes of $140,000 or more ($115,000 for singles) and 39.6 percent for the wealthiest. The top capital gains rates would remain fixed at 28 percent. This growing disparity is producing "more interest in equities because of the appreciation potential, built up on a tax-free basis, and because of the tax breaks" on sales, said William G. Brennan, who heads the Washington financial planning practice for Ernst & Young.
In particular, the proposals favor small-capitalization stocks by offering tax credits and other incentives to small firms, while large companies stand to be harder hit by limits on deductions. From a tax standpoint, smaller firms, which produce few if any dividends but have a larger potential for capital appreciation, make good sense now.
That's a lucky coincidence for investors because small-company stock funds appear to be good bets at the moment. Large-capitalization stocks dominated the list of winners during most of the 1980's, but the relative performance of big and small stocks has tended to move in cycles and small firms have just begun to take the lead.
As a result, advisers recommend that most long-term investors keep at least part of their portfolios in small-stock funds during the 90's. Look for those investing in companies with median market capitalizations below $250 million -- or mid-cap funds, at $500 million to $5 billion, advisers say.
The spread between the top rates on income and capital gains also means that fund investors who must sell shares should consider holding them for more than a year, when the favorable capital gains rate kicks in.
Funds that buy and sell securities quickly (chart) become less attractive because investors owe taxes on any gains, even if the money is reinvested in more fund shares. One strategy is to segregate high turnover funds in tax-deferred accounts like Individual Retirement Accounts or Keogh plans.
Overall, given an economy growing at 2 percent or 3 percent a year, equities are best, said Michael Stolper, who publishes the Mutual Fund Monthly in San Diego. For people who can part with their money for 10 to 15 years, he likes a mix of growth-driven stock funds, among them Pasadena Growth, Strong Discovery and Nicholas II.
On the bond side, tax-free funds become a relatively better investment if tax rates rise. Yet because most municipal bond funds own long-term issues, which are vulnerable to price drops if interest rates rise, many advisers recommend the shorter-term muni funds.
James F. Lynch, who edits the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, an investment newsletter in New York, recommends a package of three tax-free funds to diversify and blend management styles and fix the average maturity to satisfy volatility concerns. They are the T. Rowe Price Tax-Free Short-Intermediate Fund, Stein Roe Intermediate Municipals and Fidelity Limited-Term Municipals.
Investors in high-tax states like New York and California where the combined Federal/ state tax rate can run more than 45 percent, might want to investigate municipal bond or money market funds for their state alone, whose income is free from Federal, state and local taxes.
A caveat: retirees should not overload on tax-free funds because half their Social Security becomes taxable when the half, plus tax-free income and modified adjusted gross income, exceeds $32,000 for married couples, $25,000 for singles. The half could become 85 percent under the Clinton plan.
Balanced funds, which own a mix of stocks and bonds, provide income plus low volatility, but most own taxable bonds. Sheldon Jacobs, editor of The No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y., suggests that top-bracket taxpayers sell balanced-fund shares and divide the proceeds between conservative equity funds and muni funds. For example, investors in Vanguard's Wellington or Wellesley Income funds might switch to Vanguard Equity-Income plus a Vanguard municipal fund bond.
Because of increased confidence in the economy, Harold R. Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla., has been moving his clients' money from government into corporate bond funds. One of his favorites is the Pimco Total Return Fund.

THE ECONOMY
 
A House Cheer for the Budget Plan; Next: The Messy Part
 
So far, so good for the Clinton vision of the economic future. In a ringing show of unity, nearly all the House Democrats came into line behind their President last week, as the House passed his broad deficit-cutting plan with a solid majority. With Senate action expected this week, final passage is possible before lawmakers break for Easter. With a goal of cutting the $300 billion deficit to below $200 billion in four years, the resolution would set firm limits on total spending and taxes. In a sense, though, this is the easy part. A family might calmly decide to put a firm limit on, say, spending for food, but then find it a lot harder to pass by the steak counter and head for the rice and beans. Individual committees must soon climb into the ring to wrestle this beast, trying to translate a sweeping, faceless mandate into a nasty spending cut here, a biting tax increase there. "The real budget work will be done in the trenches," said Representative Robert Michel. Will unity last?
 
Taking a High-Tech Look at Meat 

The Government has inspected meat pretty much the same way for 87 years, even though its system -- relying on visual inspection -- misses many new dangers. In short, it doesn't work: in the last decade, 150 people have died and 150,000 made seriously ill by tainted meat, making it the top edible health threat. But recent poisoning deaths got the Administration's attention, and last week it proposed a high-tech overhaul. It should meet little resistance: seeing its damaged reputation, the $80 billion meat industry is ready to go along.
 
A Fair Price for the Airwaves
 
Who should rule the airwaves? Those with deep pockets? Many have long said no -- that fairness dictates allocating frequencies on merit, or by lottery. But where's the fairness if a lucky lottery winner resells, at a fat profit, this slice of nature's dowry? The Administration saw this reality and called for wide use of auctions, saying it would bring in $4.4 billion. Existing radio and television stations would not be affected -- they've got their slots. The true impact would be on those trappings of high-tech commerce-to-go: the pocket phones, the pagers, the laptops whose existence inflicts untold guilt on grim-faced executives who dare to read spy novels on the train.
 
Insurer Lament: Enough Already!
 
The insurance industry had something powerful in common with East Coast residents last week: That storm was the last thing it needed just now. Two huge hurricanes in recent years have cost insurers billions. So as everyone was struggling with snow shovels -- or, in the South, wishing they had such things -- the insurers tried to guess at losses. The industry's first, rough estimate: $800 million. What next? In coastal areas, premiums are bound to rise -- if people can get insurance at all.
 
Prices Up. Or Worse. Maybe Not.
 
Statistics are wonderful. For every number, it seems, there's a "but." Jobless rate up? Yes, but Santa did lay off half his elves. Widget output down? Yes, but hemlines are up. And so to last week's consumer price data: February's rise clocked in at 0.3 percent. Not bad. But wait: "core" inflation (no food or energy) was 0.5 percent. More worrisome; bond prices fall. But wait again: apparel, it turns out, accounted for much of the gain; bond prices rise. Bottom line: Inflation has stopped falling, but won't rise much. Or, as one economist (afflicted by that other malady, verb inflation) put it: "We've troughed out."
 
Toward Health Care's Future
 
The nation does seem to be inching toward a new era in health care. Candidate Clinton said Oregon should be allowed to try its innovative rationing system, so it was no surprise last week to find that he plans to approve the proposal. The President will impose certain conditions and try to limit Federal costs. But he clearly applauds the basics of the Oregon plan, which in many ways resembles the blueprint his team is drafting.
 
One member of that secretive team emerged into the daylight -- but not in triumph: Thomas O. Pyle was expelled from the inner circle for conflicts of interest. Mr. Pyle, who had headed one panel, was demoted because of his ties to health care companies.

Terrified that inflation could wash in if it opened the credit floodgates, Germany has kept interest rates far above world levels. But reality is forcing the Bundesbank to change its tune. Essentially admitting the severity of its recession, Germany last week lowered a key rate and signaled that it would keep cutting. These days, no European economy is an island, and that must have been on the Bundesbank's mind: lower German rates allow other nations to try to get their economies going, too.
 
A Gift, and a Fist, for British Air
 
Global airline deals are clearly a sticky issue. United States airlines need foreign cash desperately, but if a foreign carrier gets a foothold here without returning the favor, the playing field tilts. What's a new Administration to do? Transportation Secretary Federico Pena tried it both ways. Even as he approved British Airways' $300 million investment in USAir, he warned British Air that that was the limit unless United States airlines got more access to Britain.
 
Hong Kong: Calm Amid a Storm
 
Hong Kong's mighty economy has its own momentum, unruffled by a surreal political backdrop. As 1997 inches closer, the tennis game is heating up: China denounced Hong Kong's plan to broaden democracy and vowed to set up a shadow government now. A nasty mess, and surely a recipe for business chaos. But no: After some gyrations, Hong Kong stocks steadied, as investors bet both sides had too much to lose not to compromise.

United Airlines Shrinks to Fit
 
In the airline industry, one reality hits home regularly: a system that made sense in the overblown 1980's is wildly out of scale for the 1990's. United's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, was quick to use that argument last week as he brought word of the latest shrinkage. "It's not a management decision," he said. "It's a marketplace decision." United's decision: not to take delivery of $2 billion worth of Boeing planes (but, in a slap at Boeing, to continue to take Airbus A320's). He also said United may abandon some unprofitable short-haul routes. Part of his motive was clearly to put pressure on unions to accept cost cuts.
 
'Drooling' Abe, Weeping Alex
 
It's really an existential dilemma: Does one buy newsprint so that a bunch of people who detest you can, in nearly inch-high type on that very newsprint, call you a "drooling old fool" and then vilify you for not buying the newsprint sooner? I am ridiculed, therefore I am? Absurdist farce? No, just the latest act of the Abe Hirschfeld Follies at The New York Post. Gov. Mario Cuomo is not laughing; he does not want the nation's oldest paper to die. Last week, casting about for a workable solution, he cobbled together another group of investors to look into buying The Post. But the latest round went to Mr. Hirschfeld, as a judge upheld his control.
 
Lopez Is Here! There! He's Gone!
 
Finally it can be told: Ignacio Lopez does walk on water. Now those of you who are totally confused by Mr. Lopez's personal revolving door will understand why both General Motors and Volkswagen gave every impression that they believed the lean and stingy Spaniard was the only human in the known universe who could save them from oblivion. Of course a corporate Superman's resume should include decisiveness, too, and Mr. Lopez has been making decisions with lightning speed: in the blink of an eye, he quit G.M., came dashing back as the No. 2 man, then left a red-faced Jack Smith standing at the altar alone, wilted bouquet in hand.
 
One Tower, Back in Business
 
It takes most people longer to get around to dusting the piano or washing the kitchen floor. But most people don't have 2,700 workers cleaning full tilt. Last week, nearly two weeks ahead of schedule, Gov. Mario Cuomo led the first group of tenants back into one World Trade Center tower. But this is no instant, fairy-tale return to normalcy. Workers will be trickling back to the site of last month's smoky nightmare. Dean Witter, the largest tenant, at first moved just 100 of 4,500 employees back. And it will be a different place: new communications, backup generators. And the garage? That may never reopen.
 
80's 'Barbarians,' 90's Sitcom
 
In a world where fame lasts but 15 seconds, events of five years back are as dusty as ancient history. Last week's history lesson: HBO's "Barbarians at the Gate." It tells of a time, children, when giants of business strode the planet, brushing gold dust off their pristine lapels. Just feel the earth shudder at the sound of the names: Ross Johnson, Henry Kravis, James Robinson -- all tossing billions about in the battle for RJR Nabisco. Well, the Takeover Age is dead, the stars humbled -- but survivors of the era turned out in force for a New York screening. Ah, for greed gone by!

Pushing the Frontiers of the Electronic Age

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
MITCHELL D. KAPOR is best known as the founder of the Lotus Development Corporation, maker of the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, perhaps the single most widely used personal computer application of all time.
He is less well known as a former disk jockey in Connecticut, a stand-up comic and an instructor in transcendental meditation, a trade he plied in Cambridge, Mass., and Fairfield, Iowa. ("I quit because I knew people couldn't fly," he said.) His wardrobe favors Hawaiian shirts. 
 He left Lotus in 1987 and co-founded, with John Perry Barlow, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, based in Cambridge. The E.F.F. explores public policy issues related to the future of computing. Mr. Kapor lives in Brookline, Mass., with his wife and two children.
Question: What is the electronic frontier?
Answer: The construction of the transcontinental railroad was an enabling technology for the economic development of America in the 19th century. In the 20th century, we saw infrastructure development of highways and freeways and ultimately the interstate highway system for the automobile. It had a huge impact on commerce and life style.
In the next century, the development of the digital infrastructure, some connection of digital networks that link all homes and offices and schools, is going to be an enabling technology for, uh, whatever it is that comes. But we're certainly going to be doing commerce and entertainment and education increasingly over these kinds of networks.
Q: Why a foundation?
A: The E.F.F. believes very strongly in freedom, openness and diversity in both the technical architecture of these networks and the public policy regimes under which they operate. We believe the interests of the free enterprise system and the people who are interested in free expression really coincide.
Q: How real is the threat the new technology poses to privacy?
A: If you've seen any of these stories about cellular telephone eavesdropping, you know it's totally real.
Q: Poor Prince Charles.
A: Well, yeah, poor Prince Charles, but the latest thing is that there are clubs of people who get together to listen to the Hollywood stars cutting deals with their agents. Yeah, it's pretty serious. And there was a story about how some hackers reverse-engineered the read-only memory inside the Oki cellular phone, to do all sorts of nasty things including finding out whenever a particular subscriber was making a call, wherever they were, and taping all the calls of that particular subscriber, with code that is just sitting inside the ROM. Yes, there is a real threat to privacy in all these devices.
Q: What was your personal reason for becoming involved with E.F.F. issues?
A: It was an emotional identification with some of the kids who had gotten caught up in the Secret Service raids on the so-called hackers. My gut told me that some of these kids were innocent, no different than I was at age 18, at worst engaged in some mischief, and they were being pilloried, called the villains, the bad guys. I got really mad and said, "This is not right." There is not sufficient understanding in law enforcement of the issues involved here and of the real threat to the constitutionally protected liberties as they apply to computers. A lot of people are scared of technology.
And then it sort of generalized. As John Barlow and I were talking, we realized that we're just ill-prepared as a society to move into this future. We started E.F.F. as a way to understand the impact of that digital stuff, and it broadened in terms of its mission to try to understand the impact of all this digital stuff on society.
Over the last couple of years, we have broadened the agenda to be involved with the infrastructure issues, privacy and all that.

HEADLINE: How to Tell the Debt From the Deficit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Perot Continues His Campaign on Capitol Hill" (front page, March 3), you once again mix up the debt and the deficit, referring to Ross Perot's pounding away at the evil of the $4 trillion Federal deficit. 
 It is the total Federal debt that is about $4 trillion, although even that figure, however often cited, is misleading. What is relevant to the economy is the debt owed outside of the Government itself, about $3 trillion.
The deficit is the excess of spending over revenues, usually financed by borrowing. The debt is what is owed at some point, the sum of all past net borrowings. The deficit in any year is hence the amount by which the debt increases.
The deficit is running at an annual rate of around $300 billion. It will thus increase the debt by that figure over the current year, to about $3.3 trillion.
To be fair, you are one among many in this confusion. Network news programs have erred repeatedly. President Clinton himself mis-spoke in his Inaugural Address and on many other occasions, talking of reducing the debt. This is certainly not part of his program nor, I might add, should it be.
For Mr. Clinton to achieve his goal of reducing the deficit will simply mean to reduce the rate at which the debt grows. His proposed reductions in the deficit would then keep the debt, over the long run, from outgrowing income, which is a sensible rule of thumb for individuals and businesses, and for governments.
Almost everyone is talking about the deficit, or is it the debt? Does anyone, literally, know what he is talking about?

HEADLINE: Rhodes to Rhodes: On the Inside Looking In

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Forget The New Republic. In Washington, this week's hot book may be the privately circulated quarterly published by the Association of American Rhodes Scholars.
Where but in the pages of The American Oxonian might the Secretary of Labor submit a chatty letter reporting on the doings of his classmate the President? Where else might the Ambassador at Large for Russia advise his former roommate to "keep your sense of humor" in the White House? 
 In the pages of the Oxonian, Bill Clinton is still quaintly identified by his home state and Oxford college: Arkansas and University '68. In the corridors of his Government, though, that form of identification is becoming more familiar.
"They seem to be everywhere," said Senator John H. Chafee, the Rhode Island Republican, who at a recent confirmation hearing found himself staring down at a witness table lined with nothing but Rhodes Scholars.
To a fraternity whose members also include six United States Senators and two Supreme Court Justices, prominence is nothing new. But the willingness of the first Rhodes Scholar President to enlist so many like-credentialed deputies has given new possibility to Cecil Rhodes's injunction that the scholarships he endowed at Oxford University be used to "fight the world's fight."
In addition to the lawyers, professors, bankers and reporters, including this one, who are its usual recipients, the latest Oxonian landed this week in the mailboxes of new officials at the White House, the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services and other departments.
It indeed reflects the confidence of a group that always knew its time would come. "Bill notes that in early November he was elected President of the United States," reports Robert Reich, secretary to the Rhodes class of 1968, and now also the Labor Secretary. "Be excellent," adds Strobe Talbott, offering advice to the classmate who plucked him from Time magazine to take charge of the State Department's Russian affairs.
Even for those a step removed from power, the journal provides the chance to underline their near-proximity. "I recently caught up with Geoff in the halls of the Presidential transition office," reports David Frederick, the 1983 class secretary, who like his classmate is thought to be a candidate for an Administration job.
In addition to a red-bordered announcement of Mr. Clinton's election, a poem called "The Man from Hope," and Mr. Reich's tongue-in-cheek advice ("Be especially careful of any economic advice you receive from short people"), the journal includes a report of two letters received from Carl Albert, elected a Rhodes Scholar in 1931. Having first complained of his deteriorating health, the former Speaker of the House was said to have dispatched a post-election update that showed the therapeutic value of electoral success.
"Now Bill Clinton has made it," the class secretary writes, "and Carl is overflowing with euphoria."
Apart from Mr. Clinton, no fewer than six Rhodes Scholars are on the White House staff, including George Stephanopoulos, the communications director; Ira Magaziner, a top health care adviser; Bruce Reed, a domestic policy adviser, and Sylvia Matthews, an aide to the National Economic Council. At Labor, Mr. Reich tapped his classmate Thomas Williamson as the department's chief counsel. The new Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey, put a fellow Rhodes, Joseph Nye, in charge of the National Intelligence Council.
And at the Department of Health and Human Services, a younger cadre has begun to fill the ranks, including Kevin Thurm, the chief of staff, and Daniel Porterfield, a speech writer -- who like Mr. Stephanopoulos are members of the class of 1984 -- and Atul Kawande, an even younger health care specialist.
By mere arithmetic, the representation of Rhodes Scholars is not exactly overwhelming; their total within the Administration now stands at 15. But the numbers are swelling so quickly that even Mr. Stephanopoulos said he was losing count.
In some circles, this has created an element of presumption. One White House official who is a Rhodes Scholar tells of receiving a letter from a long-lost classmate who wondered about job prospects. Another outside the Administration describes calculated schmoozemanship by classmates in which "everybody's trying to angle the connection."
The new Oxonian even includes a cartoon character typing a letter: "Dear Bill: You will no doubt consider yourself fortunate that I, a fellow Rhodes scholar, am prepared to join your innermost circle of advisers. . . ."
Mr. Clinton is expected at a North American reunion this spring that shows signs of becoming a political occasion. While 800 people signed up before an October deadline, another 500 expressed interest only after Election Day, organizers have noted. A similar surge of interest is expected for an Oxford and Cambridge dinner to be held here next month at which Mr. Stephanopoulos is to deliver the ritual "toast to the Queen."
In his role as Mr. Clinton's chief spokesman, Mr. Stephanopoulos at first contended that Oxford credentialism had played little role in his boss's choices. "There's his personal network of friends who are Rhodes Scholars, and then there are the young people, and it's not necessarily because they're Rhodeses.
"At least I don't think so," he quickly added. "Well, I'm not really sure, to tell you the truth."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
China Is Making Asia's Goods, and the U.S. Is Buying

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
For 150 years Westerners have dreamed of cracking the Chinese consumer market, ever since the British calculated that if each Chinese added just one inch to his shirttail, the mills of Lancashire could be kept busy for a generation.
Nobody bothered to look at it the other way around: If each American and European began buying Chinese-made shirts, the mills of Lancashire might be idled for a generation. Yet these days, trade statistics suggest that may be a more likely prospect. 
 The United States Commerce Department reported last month that the American trade deficit with China in 1992 was $18.3 billion, the second-highest after the deficit with Japan. But while the deficit with Japan is down from its peak in 1987, the trade deficit with China has risen more than 500 percent in that period.
Last year alone, the deficit with China rose 43 percent, and that was not a fluke. Since 1985, the gap has doubled, on average, every two years.
"It's going up, up and up," said Nicholas Lardy, a specialist on the Chinese economy at the University of Washington. Like others interviewed, Professor Lardy believes that the deficit may continue to grow, although probably at a slower pace than in the past.
Already, trade is joining human rights as a major source of friction between China and the West. China is vulnerable to criticism because it still has far higher duties and many more restrictions on imports than Japan and other industrialized countries.
The bright side of the picture is that American exports to China are also rising rapidly, though not as quickly as imports. Under pressure, China is opening up its market to foreigners, and that may create more sales opportunities for American airplane manufacturers, grain farmers, chemical makers -- even for Madonna, whose music is popular in China.
"There was a significant increase in American exports the last couple of months of last year," said a Western diplomat. "If American companies are able to take advantage of the market opportunities, if American exports increase as much as I think there's a potential to, that could help a lot."
In any case, there is a crucial reason why some diplomats and economists believe that China is not so much of a trade threat to the United States as are Japan and Europe. They note that the tennis shoes, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, fishing rods and neckties that are pouring into the United States from China are not costing a lot of American jobs. Rather, they are mostly displacing jobs in Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea.
How's that?
Take Hong Kong, which used to be a major toy-making center, producing Cabbage Patch dolls and other products that sent little hearts leaping in the United States. These exports gave Hong Kong a $5.6. billion trade surplus with the United States as recently as 1987.
Over the last five years, however, Hong Kong's toy manufacturers found that local wages were too high. They moved their factories a few dozen miles to the north, to Guangdong Province in southern China. The Hong Kong company still designs the toys, manages the manufacturing, packages the dolls and ships them abroad -- usually via Hong Kong -- but now they count as an export from China rather than Hong Kong. As a result, Hong Kong's trade surplus with the United States plummeted to just $700 million last year.
 
Importing Factories
 Hong Kong has become like a company's corporate headquarters, housing the bosses, the accountants and the planners. China has become the factory site.
The same process is under way in Taiwan, which is gradually being transformed from mainland China's bitterest rival to its greatest economic partner. While political relations between Taiwan and the mainland remain tense, most of Taiwan's shoe-making industry has already moved its assembly lines to the mainland. Garment makers and sports equipment manufacturers are also relocating factories.
South Korea is just starting the same journey, just beginning to shift production of labor-intensive manufacturing to factories in China.
"Taiwan and Hong Kong are offloading their trade problem onto China," Professor Lardy said. "As they move their labor-intensive industry there, it shows up in the trade deficit with China rather than with Hong Kong or Taiwan."
One indication of this pattern of shifting production is that the United States' trade deficit with "Greater China" -- China, Hong Kong and Taiwan combined -- has risen relatively slowly. Since 1986, the joint deficit with these countries has ranged between $20 billion and $30 billion.
As a result, the wave of exports from China may not be as politically sensitive as exports from Japan. There are many fewer American toy-makers and purse-makers to be upset by Chinese imports than there are American auto workers to complain about competition from Japanese cars. Most jobs making cheap toys and purses were already lost a decade ago to Taiwan and Hong Kong, and in any case those were jobs not much valued in the United States.
First indications are that the Clinton Administration is going to take a tough line on trade with China. After a negotiating session a few weeks ago, the United States outraged the Chinese by playing down their chances of entering the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade anytime soon. China is extremely eager to join, partly because that would symbolize its membership in the international community of trading nations.
The Administration's policy is expected to become clearer by June, when it must decide whether to add conditions to an extension of China's low-tariff access to the American market, or most-favored-nation status.
There are other trade complications, like copyright and trademark abuses. President Bush's autobiography, for example, was published in China in at least four different pirated editions.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A Reckoning May Be Due For British Landlords

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Pity poor Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, otherwise known as the sixth Duke of Westminster. He had the foresight to have as a forebear one Thomas Grosvenor who in 1677, trying to recoup losses incurred by choosing the wrong side in the civil war, married 12-year-old Mary Davies. Her dowry was a water-logged cabbage farm called Ebury Manor. To cut the story short: the family held onto the farm, London grew around it.
Today the Duke is one of the two or three richest people in Britain, owning 300 acres in posh Mayfair and Belgravia that could fetch a cool $5 billion. The plot contains, among other things, Claridge's, the Connaught Hotel, the United States Embassy, Belgrave Square and the shops and homes of about 4,000 leaseholding tenants, many of whom live in dark brick townhouses trimmed with cream-colored wood and lined up as neat as chocolates in Thorntons' window. 
 The 41-year-old Duke's position has been summed up by an anecdote, perhaps apocryphal. Speaking at a charity dinner, he exhorted his listeners to empathize with "those less fortunate than ourselves," at which point a guest at one table was heard to mutter: "Gerald, everyone's less fortunate than yourself."
But now all that might very well change, at least somewhat. Under a Jacobin piece of legislation masquerading under the innocuous title of the housing and urban development bill, wealthy landowners in England and Wales could be forced to sell apartments and high-priced houses to people who occupy them under long-term purchased leases. The bill, which could affect as many as 750,000 households, would effectively spell the end of the peculiarly British leasehold system in which tenants pay substantial sums for the right to occupy a property for a certain time, generally 99 years. At the end the property, including improvements made by the tenant, reverts to the landlord, or freeholder. Among other anomalies, the system means that the leaseholder's investment loses value drastically as the lease wears on -- a wasting asset if there ever was one.
 
A Traitor to His Class
 The system of long leasehold tenure, with roots in the 17th century when the crown showered its favored few with tracts of land, took hold as the norm in mid-Victorian London. Those fighting to overturn it, like Joan South, who founded the Leasehold Enfranchisement Association two years ago, argue that it is archaic and discredited and responsible for poor maintenance and the breaking up of neighborhoods. As leases approach the expiration date, lease-holders panic and sell for whatever they can get. "We got fed up seeing people being virtually forced out of their homes and moving away," she said. "That was the glory of London -- its residential heart."
On the other side, the argument is largely the sanctity of contracts and the inviolability of private property."With this as a precedent," asked Jane Sanders, marketing and communications director for the Grosvenor Estate, "what's to stop another government from interfering in other ways -- say, by making people who bought shares in private companies give them to the government?"
The bill is the extension of a "right to buy" principle embodied in a 1967 law, the Leasehold Reform Act, which contributed to a rise of 13 percent in the number of owner-occupiers between 1979 and 1990. But that law excluded apartments and certain very expensive houses, an omission this bill seeks to rectify. It is riddled with provisions and qualifications: leaseholders must buy the freehold of the apartments collectively; their leases must be 21 years or longer when granted, and they must meet a "low rent" test to ensure that they are not simply renters. The sale price is set by a complicated mechanism that both sides object to -- one says it's too low, the other too high. Crown lands are exempt.
Still, it represents a revolution of sorts. And for the scions of the landed gentry, like 79-year-old Lord Cadogan, the possessor of 100 acres in Chelsea worth $600 million, or 59-year-old Lord Portman, whose 150 acres around Marylebone could go for about the same, the unkindest cut is that the bill comes not from Marxist- mumbling Laborites but from their own Tory party, the bastion of property-owning aristocrats. The person pushing the bill is none other than Sir George Young, a gawky housing minister who fights for the poor and homeless in that traitor-to-his-class spirit and is lately lampooned by The Spectator as "the Che Guevara of the leaseholders."
The bill sailed through the House of Commons last month but ran into a predictable storm last week in the House of Lords, where there was much harrumphing and where the debate, noted The Economist, was peppered with "references to expropriation, sequestration, nationalization, socialism and theft." Opponents thundered that it made a mockery of the rule of law, and there were one or two hints that it might make it easier for foreigners to buy up London properties. One defender, Lord Hailsham, a former Lord Chancellor, said it was "no more confiscatory than the liberation of slaves." The various amendments that would have scuttled the bill were voted down. It is in committee and could still change.
Of course, the debate mirrored the changes taking place in British politics and especially among the Conservatives of John Major, himself the son of a carnival worker. The Tories are the party of the middle class now, and the middle class packs clout. As Lord Harris of High Cross put it, in condemning the bill as pandering to populism: "If you take 100 from one man and give 1 each to 100 men, you make one enemy and 100 friends. There are more tenants than landlords."
Perhaps then it was no surprise that the Duke of Westminster quit the Tory party in a fit of pique. And rubbing salt in the wounds, The Sunday Times's list of the richest people in Britain, expected out next month, is rumored to predict that if the bill becomes law and he is forced to sell most of his holdings, the Duke will drop from the second position all the way to the seventh.
Pity poor Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor.

HEADLINE: All Aboard;
Clinton's Plan Gets Moving

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Democrats have been saying for four months that Government gridlock is over, now that they control both the White House and Congress. Last week they proved it, at least tentatively. "Lawmaker," a word reporters use casually when seeking a synonym for a member of Congress, may at last be literally applicable at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
Friday morning, after staying in session for nearly 14 hours, the House of Representatives passed President Clinton's deficit-boosting $16.3 billion economic stimulus bill. A few hours earlier it voted for his $500 billion deficit-cutting budget plan. In the meantime Democrats in the Senate were successfully defending the plan against Republican attacks there. 
 And although that fight is not over, these early victories on the economic issues that got Mr. Clinton elected marked the end of his awkward transition to the Presidency. This was his legislation, not just something Congress passes every year like family leave. Every issue he faces will be different, but success breeds success. And Mr. Clinton had license to claim that the votes showed ordinary Americans "that we don't have to be mired in gridlock, that we don't have to spend all of our time posturing and dividing and running for cover."
The party discipline in the House was remarkable. Congressional Democrats have been promising to deliver, insisting they would not repeat their mistakes of the Carter Presidency. Old Washington hands took that with a grain of salt, saying Congress could not save itself from dissidence and pride of turf.
But the results speak for the Democrats. In 1992, they never got more than 83 percent of their members to vote with the party on a budget or tax measure. Last week, 96 percent backed the budget resolution and 91 percent supported the spending bill. On that vote, 22 Democrats sided with the Republicans, half as many as did so on their most unified budget vote last year, when there were 13 more Democrats in the House.
There are several important reasons for this success. One is concentration. "When they focus all their energies, they have the votes," said Representative Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican whip who is as unabashed an admirer of Mr. Clinton's tactical talent as he is a critic of his policies.
Mr. Gingrich claimed surprise at the effort Democrats had to put into passing a spending bill, but credited the President and his staff with skillfully tamping down incipient rebellion. And while Jimmy Carter spoiled his own good start with Congress by irritating Capitol Hill with efforts to kill patronage-type dams and reservoirs, Mr. Clinton is not pressing Congress on any issue other than his economic plan, and certainly not inviting irritation by demanding action on sensitive matters like campaign finance.
Another reason is the strength of a basic Democratic desire not to see their first President in many years fail. Burdett Loomis, professor of political science at the University of Kansas, recalled that even those Republicans who were not convinced of Ronald Reagan's policies in 1981 voted for them. Mr. Reagan's Senate majority leader, Howard H. Baker Jr., steered them to passage and called them a "riverboat gamble." A similar commitment to Mr. Clinton's succeeding, and hard lobbying, won votes from previously unhappy Democrats like Representative Tim Penny of Minnesota.
And there is a change in the House Democratic caucus itself. Nelson W. Polsby, professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley, said the rise of Southern Republicans and the thinning ranks of very conservative Democrats gave Mr. Clinton a rare opportunity. He said Mr. Clinton was the first Democrat in many years with the option of using a "straight Democratic strategy," with no need "for bargaining or compromising with Republicans," at least in the House. The Democratic caucus is a little smaller this year, but it may have more Democratic votes in it.
But is this unity likely to be fleeting, like one of those frequent flyer awards that is valid only for a few months? Are these votes somehow special and irrelevant to the challenges ahead? And, anyhow, isn't the Senate different?
 
Waiting for the Tax Votes
 Republicans like Mr. Gingrich and Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate minority leader, hope for Democratic failures on taxes. Their hope is that, later this summer, real votes for real taxes will prove much more painful to Democrats than spring votes for budget resolutions that direct committees to raise more tax revenue but in reality leave it up to committees to decide which tax to impose or raise.
Democrats worry less about unity on issues foreshadowed by the budget resolutions than about some other issues. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, argues that members will find no comfort in inconsistency, and cutting the deficit will continue to be a political defense for a vote for higher taxes. "I think people will be willing to stand by their votes on the budget," he said.
If there is one political minefield ahead that everyone knows about, it is the North American Free Trade Agreement. The jobs it will cost are held by real voters who know how their representatives and senators vote. The jobs it will produce are not held by anyone yet, and that makes a difficult political tradeoff.
Social issues like homosexuals in the armed forces and abortion present another set of threats to unity. Mr. Clinton's mandate, and that of most freshman representatives (60 of the 63 voted for the spending bill and 62 voted for the budget), is economic change. Touchy issues outside that area can hardly claim the same sort of authority.
 
Like a Laser
 That may irritate abortion rights advocates, just as delay on campaign finance irritates other reformers, but there was an effective single-mindedness to the Clinton legislative program that last week, at least, paid off.
The Senate presents different problems. It is possible to steamroller the House (if Republican cries of "tyranny" don't bother you even when they have a case), but not the Senate. As George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said, "the rules of the Senate really do lend themselves to delay and obstruction."
The Senate is different in another way, too. Under shrewd leadership, determined Republicans do have the ability to block action. That power, and their experience as the majority from 1981 to 1987, also makes lawmakers of them. House Republicans are shut out -- through their own obstreperous inclination and because Democrats squelch them whenever possible -- but many in the Senate minority want to be part of the action.
Health care is the issue that may test the Administration's legislative flexibility. In the House, it will probably have to count on Democrats alone, and Mr. Gephardt and his allies will try to use the 1992 election as reason to pass it. "On all these economic issues, including health care, there is a mandate," Mr. Gephardt said.
But in the Senate, cooperation and compromise will almost certainly be necessary. Republicans say they cannot tell if the Administration really wants to deal with them or is just pretending. Certainly nothing that has leaked out about Hillary Rodham Clinton's deliberations on health care suggests that political conciliation is as yet a part of the planning.
Mr. Mitchell said he had urged the Administration to stay in touch with Republicans and not to be put off by occasional disagreements. "These people have been active in writing legislation," Mr. Mitchell said. "I don't think they view themselves as obstructionists."
There is one outside force that Mr. Clinton and his Congressional allies count on, and that is public impatience with Washington and its reputation for inaction. House Republicans winced when one of their crankier members, Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, stalled the House for an hour and 34 minutes out of personal pique Thursday.
Mr. Gephardt argues Democrats can pass tough bills that would have had no chance a couple of years ago because the public wants change and believes Mr. Clinton has a plan. Even if "they're not sure of it," he said, "they want him to be given a chance."

HEADLINE: YELTSIN, DEFYING CONGRESS, CLAIMS EMERGENCY POWERS; CALLS APRIL 25 REFERENDUM;
Rivals Resist Move

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 20

 BODY:
Declaring it his duty "as a citizen, as a patriot and as a decent man," President Boris N. Yeltsin today assumed virtually unlimited powers and ordered national balloting to decide how and by whom Russia is to be governed.
Mr. Yeltsin's dramatic appeal to the nation in a televised address plunged the country into an immediate crisis. 
 Within an hour of his address, Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, an Afghanistan War veteran who is popular with the military, and the head of the Constitutional Court, Valery D. Zorkin, repudiated the President before the leadership of the sitting parliament, the Supreme Soviet, and declared his actions unconstitutional.
That raised the prospect of impeachment proceedings and an all-out conflict of the legislative and executive branches. One of the measures put in force by the Congress of People's Deputies, the full Parliament, last week declared that the President would automatically lose his powers if he moved to suspend the Constitution.
 
Emergency Session Today
 The Speaker of the Parliament and Mr. Yeltsin's main rival, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, broke off a tour of former Soviet republics and rushed back from Kazakhstan, and the deputies were summoned to an emergency session at 4 P.M. Sunday.
There were no immediate signs of activity by security forces, and the streets remained calm and empty after the late-evening address. In his speech, Mr. Yeltsin said that as supreme commander he had issued an order to the Defense Ministry "not to use the army for political purposes." He also called for a nationwide vote of confidence in him and Mr. Rutskoi on April 25.
The Deputy Chairman of the Parliament, Yuri M. Voronin, said he had contacted the Ministers of Interior, Security and Defense and was assured that they would "act within the framework of the Constitution." What that meant in the current crisis was not clear, but Mr. Voronin took it to mean that Mr. Yeltsin would be blocked.
In Washington, President Clinton gave strong support to Mr. Yeltsin and said he would meet the Russian leader as scheduled next month. [Page 13]
 
Showdown Has Been Building
 Mr. Yeltsin specifically declared that he was not dissolving the Congress of People's Deputies, which is the full Parliament, or the Supreme Soviet, though he declared that any action they might attempt to block his decrees or orders had "no juridical force."
Since it seemed obvious that the Supreme Soviet would do just that on Sunday, Mr. Yeltsin's speech drew the lines for a showdown that has been building virtually since Russia emerged from the ruins of the Soviet Union. It pits a nationally elected President committed to Russia's profound transformation against laws and legislators inherited from the Communist state.
It is a showdown that Mr. Yeltsin either avoided or was denied in the past. Now the question is whether it is coming too late, whether the coalition of the elected legislature, the Constitutional Court and the Vice President is too entrenched and legitimate for Mr. Yeltsin to overcome.
There is no telling, either, whether a nation badly drained by unending political and economic crisis will once again rise to Mr. Yeltsin's summons. Above all, there is no telling what the military will do if the confrontation reaches a stalemate and all Government is paralyzed. Unsure, too, if the tide of political battle turns against Mr. Yeltsin, is the fate of the summit meeting he has scheduled with President Clinton next month.
The core of Mr. Yeltsin's proposal was the proclamation of a period of "special rule" during which neither his nor his Government's decrees could be challenged by any other organ of power.
 
Vote on New Constitution
 In the same balloting on the vote of confidence, Russians would be asked to vote on the draft of a new Constitution and a draft law on elections to a national Parliament. These would come into effect if the President won the vote of confidence. Then, in line with the Constitution so adopted, elections would be held to the new Parliament.
This would not be a Congress, Mr. Yeltsin stressed, but a new Russian Parliament. Under the Soviet Constitution, the Congress was the highest legal authority, capable of changing the Constitution virtually at will.
Mr. Yeltsin gave no details of the new Constitution or the distribution of powers it envisioned, but it was certain to embody the principles of a strong presidency and a distinct separation of powers that the existing arrangement lacked.
Mr. Yeltsin also announced that he had ordered the Government of Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to formulate measures to push economic reforms forward, including a law on private ownership of land. The Congress has repeatedly stalled on questions of private property.
 
Circumventing Constitution
 In calling for "balloting," Mr. Yeltsin was evidently trying to get around the Constitutional strictures against his calling for an election or a referendum. In many other portions of his address, Mr. Yeltsin seemed to be trying to build a legal foundation for his action, based essentially on the fact that he had been elected by the entire nation and entrusted with Russia's welfare.
But with the Constitutional Court already ranged against him and the Supreme Soviet armed with broad legislative powers, legality was obviously Mr. Yeltsin's weak spot.
In his address to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Mr. Rutskoi declared that Mr. Yeltsin's order violated the Constitution 18 ways. Mr. Zorkin of the Constitutional Court said he had addressed a letter to the President warning that the President's measures would only lead to destabilization and disintegration, and discredit him as President.
But in Russia the law has always been more a tool of rulers, Communist or czarist, than their master. The question is not whether Mr. Yeltsin is acting legally, but whether he can muster sufficient legitimacy from the people to withstand the inevitable counterattack and to prevent violence.
Mr. Yeltsin's move had been anticipated all week after the Congress of People's Deputies scrapped a deal reached with the President at its last session in December to hold a referendum and to abstain from any power struggles.
Already well in advance of the Congress, aware that the cards were stacked against him, Mr. Yeltsin had offered a broad variety of compromises. He also warned repeatedly of "extreme measures" if the deputies rejected his every overture -- as it finally did.
But as the week wore on, the likelihood of a dramatic counterattack seemed to wane, and Mr. Yeltsin seemed to be withdrawing into the shell of the Kremlin. Once he began to speak, however, he was once again the powerful maverick who defied the Communist Party of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who stood atop a tank during the Communist putsch of August 1991, whose broad shoulders shielded a team of academic reformers when they launched the program of painful economic reforms.
Sitting under a Russian flag, his eyes narrowed and his mouth set in a grim scowl, Mr. Yeltsin declared that his election in June 1991 marked a choice of President and a choice of course. "The choice was extremely acute and responsible: either to slide as before into the Communist dead-end, or to begin profound reforms, to take the road of progress on which all civilized humanity has embarked."
The problem now facing the country, he said, is not a conflict between two branches of government, but a conflict between the nation and the "former Bolshevist anti-national system which has not yet fully disintegrated and which is seeking today to recapture its lost control over Russia."
The last Congress, he declared, "was in fact a dress rehearsal of revenge-taking by the former party nomenklatura." With its powers virtually unchecked by the Constitution or the Constitutional Court, the Congress "allowed the leadership of the Supreme Soviet to virtually set loose the flywheel of an anti-constitutional coup."
"The Congress declined to heed the voice of the country," Mr. Yeltsin declared. "It rejected the opinion of the overwhelming majority of voters. But the Congress is not yet a state itself; the Congress does not mean Russia."
But even as Mr. Yeltsin spoke, his adversaries were gathering force. Shortly after midnight, Mr. Rutskoi, Mr. Zorkin, Mr. Voronin and the prosecutor-general, Valentin G. Stepankov, took their turn on national television to denounce Mr. Yeltsin's actions.
Mr. Rutskoi said he had refused to co-sign the order on "special rule." Instead, he said, he addressed a letter to Mr. Yeltsin appealing to him to cancel his statement and warning that it could lead to the use of force and bloodshed. He urged the nation to stay calm.
 
Rutskoi Appeals to Citizens
 "As we say, what happened has happened," said Mr. Rutskoi, a former Air Force pilot. "I find it necessary now to appeal to the citizens of Russia, to law-enforcement agencies, to the Ministries of the Interior, Security and Defense not to give in to provocations, not to dramatize the situation. I also wish to appeal to social movements and parties not to dramatize the situation and not to create provocations."
Mr. Zorkin, who cut short a trip to the United States when reports of Mr. Yeltsin's actions began to surface, addressed his comments to the President.
"Boris Nikolayevich, I sincerely pity you," he said. "You have lost the chance to become the savior of Russia, to be a Russian Roosevelt, a Russian de Gaulle. You tried to regain absolute power. You have put yourself outside the Constitution. Come back to it."
But the die is cast, and it is hard to see how Mr. Yeltsin could backtrack now. Much will depend on the immediate reaction of the public, of security officials and of regional leaders.
Though public-opinion polls showed a distinct public preference for Mr. Yeltsin, there is also a profound fatigue with chaos and a loss of faith in economic reforms that, for now, offered mostly poverty and crime.
The army is likely to do its best to stay out of the fray. But there is always the threat of actions by separate units, like the large security forces controlled by the Parliament.

HEADLINE: New View Calls Environmental Policy Misguided

SERIES: What Price Cleanup?/First article of a series.

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
A generation after the United States responded to poisoned streams and filthy air with the world's first comprehensive strategy to protect the environment, many scientists, economists and Government officials have reached the dismaying conclusion that much of America's environmental program has gone seriously awry.
These experts say that in the last 15 years environmental policy has too often evolved largely in reaction to popular panics, not in response to sound scientific analyses of which environmental hazards present the greatest risks. 
 As a result, many scientists and public health specialists say, billions of dollars are wasted each year in battling problems that are no longer considered especially dangerous, leaving little money for others that cause far more harm.
 
At First, Clear Benefits
 In the first wave of the modern environmental movement, starting about 30 years ago, the focus was on broad efforts to eliminate the most visible pollution pouring from smokestacks and sewer pipes -- programs with clear goals that had obvious benefits.
But a second wave began in the late 1970's, with a new strategy intended to limit visible pollution further -- and to begin attacking invisible threats from toxic substances.
To that end, states and the Federal Government began writing sweeping environmental laws, some of which included strict regulations to insure that certain toxic compounds were not present in air, water or the ground at levels that did not exceed a few parts per billion, concentrations that could be measured with only the most sophisticated equipment.
The result was a tangle of regulations that the Environmental Protection Agency estimates cost more than $140 billion a year, roughly $100 billion spent by industry and $40 billion by Government.
But what is now becoming apparent, some scientists and public health specialists say, is that some of these laws -- written in reaction to popular concerns about toxic waste dumps or asbestos in the schools, as examples -- were based on little if any sound research about the true nature of the threat. Since 1980, for instance, thousands of regulations were written to restrict compounds that had caused cancer in rats or mice, even though these animal studies often fail to predict how the compounds might affect humans.
And with rare exceptions, Congress approved new laws without subjecting them to even rudimentary cost-benefit analyses. One reason was that during the 1980's, when the economy seemed healthier, there was far less pressure on Congress to consider the cost of environmental policy.
 
Overpriced and Misguided?
 Now a new Administration intent on strengthening environmental policy is settling into office when competition for scarce financial resources is keen. At the same time, a wealth of new research shows that some of the nation's environmental protection efforts are excessively costly -- though no one knows how much of this money is misspent -- and devoted to the wrong problems.
This view is the vanguard of a new, third wave of environmentalism that is sweeping across America. It began in the late 1980's among farmers, homeowners and others who were upset largely by the growing cost of regulations that didn't appear to bring any measurable benefits. Corporate executives had long been making similar arguments but had gone unheeded, even during 12 years of Republican rule, because often they were seen as interested only in saving money.
Richard J. Mahoney, chairman and chief executive of Monsanto, the chemical company, said the nation may start listening to industry now.
"People want to know, even with the environment, what we are getting for our money," he said. "The most positive thing since the election is that we are beginning to recognize that we do have finite resources, and one must make choices."
But leaders of the nation's conservation organizations believe the new view is misguided.
"We don't need a new paradigm," said David D. Doniger, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "For 35 years, the policy of the Government has been that when there is uncertainty about a threat it is better to be safe than sorry. When you are operating at the limits of what science knows, the big mistake would be to underestimate the real danger and leave people unprotected."
Still, in the last few years the wave has moved into universities, city halls, state capitols and even to the highest levels of the E.P.A., whose Science Advisory Board in 1990 concluded that environmental laws "are more reflective of public perceptions of risk than of scientific understanding of risk."
 
Law Follows Panic
 William K. Reilly, the E.P.A. Administrator at the time, agreed. And in a recent interview, he argued: "People have a right to expect that public officials are making the right choices for the right reasons. We need to develop a new system for taking action on the environment that isn't based on responding to the nightly news.
"We're misallocating large amounts of money," added Mr. Reilly, who is now a senior fellow at of the World Wildlife Fund. "What we have had in the United States is environmental agenda-setting by episodic panic. We've had Love Canal, Valley of the Drums, the Exxon Valdez and with virtually every case of a new environmental crisis, there is a new legislative priority and a new budget allocation. That has created a mix of programs that don't respect the biggest risks to health and ecology."
Richard D. Morgenstern, the acting administrator for policy planning and evaluation at the E.P.A., explains the problem this way: "Our society is very reactive, and when concerns are raised people want action. The problem in a democracy is you can't easily sit idly back and tell people it would be better to learn more."
The result, he added, is that "we're now in the position of saying in quite a few of our programs, 'Oops, we made a mistake.' "
President Clinton is clearly aware of this view. As Governor of Arkansas, he continually complained as a Federal toxic waste cleanup project in Jacksonville devoured $25 million in state, Federal and private money. State officials said nearly a decade of work has produced little more than piles of technical documents, exorbitant legal bills and public discord.
 
Greater Consequences
 To be sure, some of the $140 billion the nation is spending this year pays for environmental programs that are indisputably useful. As an example, few experts question the value of spending roughly $3 billion each year on new sewage treatment plants. Many experts, however, question the wisdom of spending billions of dollars to protect people from traces of toxic compounds.
The new school of thought has blossomed as policy makers confront planetary threats like global warming, ozone depletion and deforestation in which the consequences of wrong action are much greater. Unless the nation rethinks its approach to environmental protection, some experts say, the United States could repeat its mistakes.
"The President is aware of this dilemma, and there is leadership in this Administration for trying to change the way we do business in every aspect of governing, including environmental protection," said Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. "We have to allow for change to occur as new information becomes available. This is not an area where a solution will fit forever."
 
Policy Now
Costly Solutions Seeking Problems

Almost everyone involved, including community and local environmental groups, agrees that the toxic waste program stands as the most wasteful effort of all. It began 15 years ago when the nation rose in revulsion over the discovery of seeping chemicals at Love Canal in New York. Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes.
In response, Congress passed two laws: the Superfund law of 1980 and amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in 1984. A decade later, those laws have driven the Government to spend almost $2 billion a year for the Superfund, which cleans up toxic waste sites, and more than $8 billion more a year on similar programs in other agencies, even though many of the sites pose little if any danger.
The Superfund law, which is a foundation for the Government's toxic cleanup policy, established a formula for ranking the potential hazards of toxic sites, and then devised a rigid recipe for cleaning them up.
 
'Throwing Money at a Problem'
 "Does it make sense to spend millions of dollars cleaning up a site that only has a tenth of an ounce of contamination?" asked Dr. Richard Goodwin, a private environmental engineer in Upper Saddle River, N.J., who has overseen more than 20 toxic waste cleanups. "I say no. All we're doing in most cases is throwing money at a problem without improving public health or the environment."
Hugh B. Kaufman, a hazardous waste specialist at the E.P.A. who helped uncover the problem at Love Canal, said that in the few cases in which a site is near populated areas, "the best thing we can do is evacuate people if they want, then put up a fence and a flag that says 'Stay Away.' "
Mr. Kaufman said he knows that his idea represents a marked change in the traditional view of how the nation should care for its land. But he and other experts says it does not make sense to clean up these wastes at costs that frequently exceed $10 million an acre.
Even a principal author of the Superfund law, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, who was chairman of a House environmental subcommittee in the 1970's, now argues that inflexible rules mean that Superfund resources are too often devoted to making sites pristine.
"It doesn't make any sense to clean up a rail yard in downtown Newark so it can be a drinking water reservoir," he said, speaking rhetorically.
Toxic waste cleanups are one example of a program gone awry. Here are others:
*Early in the 1980's, Government scientists argued that exposure to asbestos could cause thousands of cancer deaths. Since asbestos was used as insulation in schools and public buildings, parents reacted with alarm. So in 1985 Congress approved a sweeping law that led cities and states to spend between $15 billion and $20 billion to remove asbestos from public buildings. But three years ago, the E.P.A. completed research that prompted officials to admit that ripping out the asbestos had been an expensive mistake; the removal often sent tiny asbestos fibers into the air. Now, except in cases when the asbestos is damaged or crumbling, the Government's official advice is: Don't touch it.
* In 1982, high concentrations of dioxin were discovered in the dirt roads of Times Beach, Mo., near St. Louis. Residents were alarmed; the Government had designated dioxin as one of the most toxic substances known. The furor came in the middle of a scandal at the E.P.A.; the agency's chief, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was accused of not enforcing environmental law and being too close to industry. And as that scandal dominated the news, the Reagan Administration decided to evacuate all 2,240 residents of Times Beach, a project that cost the Government $37 million. But new research indicates that dioxin may not be so dangerous after all. None of the former residents of Times Beach have been found to have been harmed by dioxin, and two years ago, Dr. Vernon N. Houk, the Federal official who urged the evacuation, declared that he had made a mistake.
Yet even as enormous sums of money were being spent on these problems, Washington was doing little about others. Here are two:
*Mercury, a highly toxic metal, has contaminated thousands of lakes across the nation, poisoning wildlife and threatening human health, state environmental officials say. Twenty states, including New York, have warned consumers not to eat lake fish because they are tainted by mercury, which can cause nervous system disorders. During debate on the Clean Air Act, in 1990, Congress considered limiting mercury emissions from coal-burning electric plants, but lawmakers decided not to act because they believed utilities had already been asked to spend enough to control acid rain, Senate and House leaders said.
*In the last two years, several Federal agencies have called exposure to lead the largest environmental threat to the nation's children. Although some scientists dispute that, several studies have shown that lead poisoning in children leads to reduced intelligence, learning disabilities and hyperactivity. The problem is that most houses built before the 1970's could have some lead-based paint, and the fear is that children are eating paint chips or inhaling lead-laden dust. Some experts have said removing the lead paint will cost at least $200 billion. This year, the Government will spend $234 million on the problem, far less than it spends on cleaning up toxic wastes.
 
The Path to Policy
When Politics Mixes With Fear

Even the advocates of change acknowledge that as science evolves, experts may change their views again on the dangers posed by these and other substances. But at the least, "sound science should be our compass," as Mr. Reilly put it two years ago.
After all, it was politics, misinterpreted or inaccurate scientific findings and a newly influential national environmental movement that combined to set America down its present path.
During the 1970's, the United States had successfully dealt with many obvious environmental problems. When the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire in 1969, as an example, Congress passed the Clean Water Act. About the same time came the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and other landmark environmental statutes -- laws that are now widely acclaimed.
 
Partisan Battles
 By the late 1970's, many Democrats in Congress believed the public wanted even stricter environmental law. But when Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, he promised to reduce regulation. While the White House and Congress battled over this, the national environmental movement, with help from the news media, took on the job of warning the public about new threats and enlisting popular support for new regulations. They were spectacularly effective at this, and Congress passed two dozen bills that laid down mandates.
In the 1970's, environmental statutes rarely ran more than 50 pages. In the 1980's, these bills seldom numbered fewer than 500 pages. The reason was that Congress wanted to mandate safety limits so specific that the Administration could not ignore or evade them. Mr. Reilly, the former E.P.A. chief, said he was largely unable to change the Government's thinking, despite his strong opinion that environmental policy was on the wrong course, because "this represented a pretty significant change of direction."
 
Legitimizing Pollution?
 At the leading environmental groups, staff members dispute the developing view that environmental policy is off track.
"It's an effort to legitimize pollution," said Daniel F. Becker, director of the Global Warming and Energy Program at the Sierra Club. "There are powerful forces who have an economic stake in de-emphasizing environmental damage."
But others who analyze environmental issues said these groups are in danger of becoming the green equivalent of the military lobby, more interested in sowing fear and protecting wasteful programs than in devising a new course.
"We are in danger of losing credibility and thus losing public support if we don't modify the whole way we go about protecting public health and the environment," said Dr. Devra Lee Davis, a senior research fellow at the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences.
 
A Case Study
Making Dirt Safe Enough to Eat

Perhaps no environmental program has come under more criticism than the Superfund and its progeny. The Federal programs to clear toxic or radioactive wastes will consume more than one-quarter of the roughly $38 billion that the Federal Government spends for environmental protection this year. Experts in and out of the Government assert, though, that the justification for these expenditures is often questionable.
Consider the case of Columbia, Miss. The E.P.A. is overseeing the last phases of a $20 million Superfund cleanup project there. Like many others around the country, this one was guided by the Government's assumption that children will eat dirt. Lots of it. And from that dirt, the Government theorized that they could develop cancer.
Some evidence suggested that this was an exaggerated concern. In 1981, a study for the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, which has been endorsed by the National Cancer Institute, found that only 1 to 3 percent of all cancers in people are caused by exposure to toxic chemicals in the environment. This finding, however, has had little influence on Federal policy.
The problem in Columbia was an 81-acre site that over its long life had been home to a lumber mill, a naval turpentine and pine tar plant and a chemical manufacturer.
Soil tests taken in 1986 showed traces of compounds the Government defines as hazardous. The concentrations rarely exceeded 50 parts per million, or about two ounces of chemicals mixed in a ton of soil. But that level exceeded the Federal limit, and the E.P.A. placed the land on its list of dangerous toxic waste sites.
Some experts told the E.P.A. that such tiny amounts of contamination were harmless. They said the safest and most economical way to solve the problem would be to spread a layer of cleaner soil and call it a day. The cost: about $1 million.
 
Most Expensive Solution
 But two years ago, the E.P.A. settled on the most expensive possible solution. The Government ordered Reichhold Chemical, the plant's former owner, to dig up more than 12,500 tons of soil and haul most of it to a commercial dump in Louisiana -- 450 dump truck loads, each one costing $7,500.
E.P.A. officials said they wanted to make the site safe enough to be used for any purpose, including houses -- though no one was proposing to build anything there. With that as the goal, the agency wanted to make sure children could play in the dirt, even eat it, without risk. And since a chemical in the dirt had been shown to cause cancer in rats, the agency set a limit low enough that a child could eat half a teaspoon of dirt every month for 70 years and not get cancer.
Last month, the E.P.A. officials acknowledged that at least half of the $14 billion the nation has spent on Superfund cleanups was used to comply with similar "dirt-eating rules," as they call them.
"I don't think any way you look at this it could be seen as a practical solution," said W. Scott Phillips, an engineer with Malcolm Pirnie, an environmental planning company that manages the cleanup. "It's a lot of money to spend moving dirt."
Next: The debate over ocean dumping.

HEADLINE: Inside White House: Long Days, Late Nights

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
It's not as if they've replaced the oil portrait of George Washington in the Cabinet Room with a velvet rendering of Elvis. And President Clinton was only joking the other night when he said, "We expect our own McDonald's to be completed by fall."
But he did invite an Elvis impersonator into the Oval Office last weekend. (Actually, it was Mark Alan Stamaty, creator of "Washingtoon," who turned up his collar, fluffed out his hair and broke out in an a cappella rendition of "All Shook Up" during a meeting for cartoonists.) 
 And though they have not had Big Macs yet in the White House mess, the President's minions have ordered that the kitchen stay open after hours to accommodate the work habits of Mr. Clinton and his equally compulsive aides.
After two months, the character of the Clinton White House is becoming clearer. In ways large and small, it reflects the character of Bill Clinton. If Richard M. Nixon's White House took on an air that sometimes approached paranoia and George Bush's was properly preppy, Mr. Clinton's White House is a mix of pure policy with controlled pandemonium.
It is a loose place, where doors are flung open and top aides wander fairly freely into the Oval Office. (One boasted this week that he had caught the President stepping out of the bathroom.)
Spontaneity is rampant. After Mr. Stamaty's recent performance, for instance, the President dispatched an aide to his living quarters to retrieve an autographed Elvis tie from his collection, which he then presented to the cartoonist.
 
Imposing Discipline
 Yet the White House has imposed some discipline on a rather undisciplined man. After all, Mr. Clinton lives right upstairs, so he's not as late for appointments as he was during the campaign and usually makes it to the Oval Office by 8:30 A.M., an hour after his senior aides start their staff meeting. He goes upstairs for dinner between 6:30 and 8 P.M., but often drifts back for more work. (Hillary Rodham Clinton has such a feverish schedule that she is rarely spotted with her spouse.)
Mr. Clinton still operates on little sleep, often not more than five hours a night. His pace has prompted some friends and close aides to warn Mr. Clinton to slow down, saying he does not need to be so deeply involved in every nugget of policy. But it is advice that he clearly has not taken.
Perhaps that is how he manages to read four books a week, always including a mystery novel. He rarely tunes into television news during the day but can play the Washington insider at night, watching Congress on C-Span. And though the President doesn't snack between meals (he sips constantly on decaffeinated cola and coffee and often chews on a fat unlit cigar), his hearty appetite for fried foods has not diminished.
Though there is no truth to the rumor that Mr. Clinton wanders through the West Wing at all hours, it is not uncommon for guests to roam the halls. On Wednesday, Ted Turner and his wife, Jane Fonda, had an appointment with Mr. Clinton.
"He's so smart," Ms. Fonda said of Mr. Clinton after looking into the office of a startled Howard Paster, the deputy for Congressional relations.
Even in the Oval Office, the scene can get pretty wild. There was the day that one of his advisers stood before the President's desk and came close to pulling his pants down after briefing Mr. Clinton for a speech. Paul Begala, a top strategist in the campaign who is a Texas native, mentioned to the President and Vice President Gore that he was wearing his burnt orange Texas longhorn boxer shorts to commemorate Texas Independence Day.
"Gore said: 'Come on, show him your underwear, anything goes! This is the Clinton Administration,' " Mr. Begala recalled. "So I showed the President my underwear in the Oval Office. I was standing in front of the President's desk. I did not drop my trousers. I sort of hiked my shorts up over the belt."
 
Well-Rounded Diet
 He may jog a few days a week and order highbrow dishes on forays to trendy restaurants (like the grilled San Pietro, a Mediterranean fish, at Galileo's on Monday), but don't think Mr. Clinton has adopted a watch-your-heart diet.
True, he usually eats a plain, untoasted cinnamon-raisin bagel at his morning briefings and often orders a tuna sandwich for lunch. But at times he cannot resist something more artery clogging, like French fries.
Once a steward returned from the White House mess to the President's private dining room with trays for Mr. Clinton and his more svelte Vice President. One had baked swordfish, a dried out baked potato and green beans. The other had the special du jour: the Mexican Fiesta Platter, loaded with tacos, enchiladas, rice and beans.
Mr. Clinton's aides laughed, certain about who ordered what. But the President had the last laugh.
"The truth was that Clinton ate the swordfish," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "I was as surprised as anyone."
 
How Time Flies
 For those whose job it is to make the President's day run on time, the little black box is the bearer of bad news.
In an office in the White House basement, a box behind the desk of Marcia Hale, the director of scheduling, tracks the comings and goings of her boss, known in White House jargon as "POTUS," President of the United States.
Green letters on a digital readout show where the President is at any moment and what time he got there. Often, it shows, he got there late.
His aides still find that he cannot quite stop from talking to people beyond the time allotted. They have done what they can, like scheduling 15 minutes of leeway into meetings.
"There's no such thing as a quick meeting with President Clinton," Ms. Hale said. "You wouldn't schedule even a phone call for five minutes because that's just not who he is. It just won't happen. He will engage and he will ask more questions."
His aides try to structure his days by giving him a briefing book each night that accounts for nearly every minute of the next day. It includes a summary of all his meetings, drafts of his speeches (which he almost never delivers word for word) and related background. No detail is too small.
"You depart shaking hands along the ropeline," Mr. Clinton is told in advance of a meeting with Treasury officials on Wednesday.
Knowing that they can push a President only so hard, aides are resigned to the boss's tardiness.
But a President gets a grace period mere citizens don't. As the commander of the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt was waiting for the President's helicopter to land on board recently, he looked at his watch and fretted that Mr. Clinton was more than a half-hour late. Then he stopped and said: "Hey, he's the commanding officer of the armed forces. He's never late."
 
Hunger for Details
 When she first worked for Governor Clinton in Arkansas, Carol H. Rasco, the White House domestic policy adviser, was taken aback when he would routinely call her as late as midnight to chat about policy. "My mother had taught me it was bad manners to call that late," recalled Ms. Rasco, a genteel Southerner of polished manners.
Eventually, Ms. Rasco got accustomed to the calls, which still persist. Many top aides, in fact, now know that when the phone rings between 9 P.M. and midnight, it is likely to be a call from the President. If they aren't home, their beepers will go off, with the message, "Pres US calling. Call WH operator." He'll call them to chat about minute policy details, or to keep abreast of the news. He called Mr. Stephanopoulos at 10:30 the other night to check on Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who was in the hospital.
But Mr. Clinton's true love of detail comes across best in the memos he scribbles to aides in his trademark wavy, indecipherable handwriting. Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, recently sent the President a memo specifying how the summer jobs money in the stimulus package would be allocated. It was full of details, but not enough for Mr. Clinton. He wrote, "I'd like to know which cities, how many jobs next year and projected for this year."
For Mr. Clinton's aides, the problem often is not carrying out his orders but understanding them.
"He has absolutely terribly handwriting," said John Podesta, Mr. Clinton's staff secretary, who handles the 300 or so pieces of paper that go to the President daily. "One of the people from the N.S.C. came in sheepishly the other day, asking us to decipher something. That happens all the time."
 
Reading List
 When he is not reading briefing papers, newspapers and letters, the President reads books -- a chapter here or there when he has time.
Stacked on the small table behind his desk in the Oval Office are the books he is reading this week.
*"Pandaemonium. Ethnicity in International Politics." A new book by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York.
*"A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings of Martin Luther King Jr." A collection edited by James Melvin Washington.
*"The Search for Temperance Moon," a mystery by Douglas C. Jones set in Fort Smith, Ark., in 1892.
*"Preparing for the Twenty-First Century," a new book on global challenges by Paul Kennedy.
 
Back to Reality
 It may sometimes resemble a college dormitory full of zany overachievers, but it is the White House. And every once in a while, aides are reminded of the weight of the office.
Ask Heather Beckel, Mr. Stephanopoulos's assistant. The President, looking for an article by the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted Haitian President, called Mr. Stephanopoulos, but he wasn't at his desk and Ms. Beckel picked up the phone, not noticing it was the long ring that means it's from the Oval Office.
"Hi, Heather, this is the President," Mr. Clinton said, nearly causing Ms. Beckel to freeze in place.
During the campaign, Ms. Beckel said she did not have such fears. "He used to just call and say, 'Hi, Heather, this is Bill.' "

HEADLINE: Called to Disturbance, Officers Slay Man

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
Police officers shot an unemployed doorman to death early yesterday morning after he pulled a gun on two uniformed officers as they investigated a disturbance at a 24-hour diner in Manhattan, the authorities said.
The man, Bekim Ahmeti, 20, of 83 Continental Place in the Mariners Harbor section of Staten Island, died at 8:15 A.M at St. Vincent's Hospital with four gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen, said Sgt. Anthony Barlanti, a spokesman for the New York City Police Department. 
 The shooting occurred at 5 A.M. when several officers responded to a radio call about gunshots being fired in a large fight at the Moonstruck Diner, at 400 West 23d Street, at Ninth Avenue, in Chelsea, Sergeant Barlanti said. When the officers arrived, he said, they found about 20 people standing outside the diner. The fighting had stopped, but the smell of gunpowder lingered, he said.
As the officers tried to find out what happened, Mr. Ahmeti started to run, said Officer Scott Bloch, a police spokesman. Lieut. Michael Herer, 37, and Officer Joseph Dalton, 32, of the 10th Precinct, called out that they were police officers and ordered Mr. Ahmeti to stop, he said. Mr. Ahmeti stopped, pulled out a .38-caliber revolver, turned and aimed it at the officers, Sergeant Barlanti said. Before he could shoot, the officers fired six shots, striking him in the torso, the sergeant said. The lieutenant fired two shots from his .38-caliber revolver and the officer fired four shots from his 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson semi-automatic pistol, Officer Bloch said.
 
Father Disputes Account
 While the police said that Mr. Ahmeti was struck in the chest and abdomen, his father, Arif, said that his son had been shot in the back.
"Even if my son did pull a gun on the officers, they should have shot him in the legs to stop him from running," the father said. "They should not have shot him to kill him."
The father, who said he emigrated to New York from Albania 21 years ago, said he had not known that his son carried a gun. He said friends who were with his son at the diner said that he might have tried to run because he did not want to be arrested for carrying an unlicensed gun. He said that two months ago his son had been shot in the back and right hand in a drive-by shooting.
The father, who works as a doorman on Riverside Drive, said his son, the youngest of four children, had told him that he was taking the car to pick up his brother, Gazmend, also a doorman, near 84th Street and Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. He said his son apparently stopped at the diner to get something to eat before his brother got off work at 7 A.M. The younger Mr. Ahmeti had been unemployed for about a year, his father said.
Another man was arrested, the police said, and it was unclear if he was with Mr. Ahmeti. Ray McElroy of 609 West 189th Street in Manhattan was arrested and charged with possession of a weapon, a 38-caliber revolver. Investigators said Mr. McElroy was wearing a bullet-proof vest under his coat.
Lieutenant Herer, a night platoon commander in the 10th Precinct, and Officer Dalton have been placed on desk duty pending the outcome of an investigation, Officer Bloch said, which is routinely done in such cases. The incident is being reviewed by detectives in the 10th Precinct, the Manhattan District Attorney's office, the firearms and tactics review board and the Internal Affairs Bureau.

HEADLINE: Park Cutbacks Over the Years Cause Distress

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Just a few yards from the edge of the manicured Long Meadow in Brooklyn's Prospect Park -- where the New York Philharmonic plays each summer -- are pathways so trampled that they now have deep holes. Nearby trees are diseased and dying. An ornate archway, recently refurbished, is besmeared with graffiti and many of the catch basins are clogged, destroying the park's intricate drainage system.
After three years of cuts that have whittled the Parks and Recreation Department's budget and work force by 20 percent, the problems in Prospect Park are indicative of the distress that New Yorkers can expect to find in the city's vast network of parks as the warmer weather of spring begins to bring people back outdoors. And officials say that a decline in personnel and maintenance will make the job of restoring the parks a costly and difficult challenge. 
 Following the budget crisis of the mid-1970's and the deterioration of the parks that followed, the city spent about $1 billion in the 1980's to refurbish and restore the park system to its best condition in years. But the recent budget cuts and slump in maintenance threaten that progress, department officials and advocates for the parks maintain.
 
A Vulnerable Department
 For the Dinkins administration -- as it was for its predecessors -- there is the thorny issue of how to balance the desire for graceful and brilliant parks with the growing, more palpable demands like housing the city's burgeoning homeless population and improving public safety. Indeed, most city agencies have seen their budgets trimmed since the recession gripped the city. And cutting money from the parks' budget seems more acceptable to the public, if not a universally popular means of enabling the city to hire more police officers or provide more services for poorer families.
But the cuts affecting the parks have been among the most severe. "The parks took the deepest cuts because, when you have to cut, you can't cut positions where your staff earns money for the city," said Barbara J. Fife, Deputy Mayor for planning and development. "You have mandated spending like environmental positions, jobs in water systems that can't be cut. So when you're being pressed everywhere to get your staff down, this is one agency where it is possible."
Of course, the grass in the parks is still being cut, and the trash is still being collected, making many parks appear at first glance relatively unaffected by the decline in maintenance. But the parks are nonetheless becoming frayed, with so much erosion in service and maintenance that some officials argue that many will soon need drastic and costly overhaul.
"There are countless examples of maintenance that has been deferred," said Julius Spiegel, the parks commissioner in Brooklyn. "Ninety percent of our time now is spent picking up garbage, and little time is spent maintaining our buildings, our sewers, our infrastructure," he said. "The public doesn't see it all the time, but the parks are suffering."
While the conditions vary from one site to another, the more than 1,500 parks share a common plight. Much structural repair work is being left undone, and the number of workers has thinned too severely to keep up with the litter and debris. A great deal of patrolling by rangers was abandoned long ago, decrepit buildings are unattended, thousands of trees stand rotting and scores of public toilets have been closed because of neglected plumbing or structural decline.
"There just hasn't been enough money spent on the kind of maintenance the parks need," said Linda Davidoff, executive director of the Parks Council, an advocacy group. "No matter how much capital expenditure there has been in the past, if you don't continue the maintenance, the pristine condition of the park will not last long."
Despite receiving the most attention and having full-time workers devoted to maintenance, long-term planning and supervision, the city's large flagship parks are suffering along with the smaller ones. Besides Prospect Park, Central and Riverside parks in Manhattan, Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay parks in the Bronx, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens and the Greenbelt in Staten Island, among others, show signs of the cutbacks.
In Pelham Bay Park, the city's largest, trees felled by last December's storm are still sitting on the ground. "A few years ago we could have taken care of that sort of thing quickly," said Cordell Schachter, an administrative manager with the Parks Department in the Bronx. And throughout the system, the snowstorm last weekend has added to the burden.
In Prospect Park, the lakes are being invaded by a tall, unsightly wild grass called phragmites -- there is no money to scour and reline the lake -- and graffiti has begun to resurface on buildings. The number of workers at Prospect Park stands at 42, down from 60 three years ago.
One of the biggest problems, park officials lament, is the near absence of nighttime security. "Because of the drop in security at night, we have seen a dramatic rise in vandalism, theft and break-ins in the park buildings at night," said Tupper W. Thomas, the administrator of Prospect Park. She added that nearly every building in the park needs substantial repairs, including in many cases repair of leaking roofs.
Today, 32 full-time workers maintain not only the vast Van Cortlandt Park, but also the dozen playgrounds and parks in the adjacent community board area. Three years ago, that job was performed by more than 50 workers.
In addition there are dozens of smaller parks -- like Julius Richman Park in the Bronx and the McDonald Playground in Brooklyn -- where daily maintenance has become a thing of the past. A decade ago most of these smaller neighborhood parks had at least one staff member who performed daily maintenance from sunup to sundown.
Now maintenance crews share responsibility for as many as a dozen sites and can visit each park only two or three times a week.
"We just can't do the kind of maintenance job we used to," said Frank Wright, a parks service worker, standing amid broken glass and litter in Julius Richman Park in the South Bronx. "And when you don't have the maintenance and people working in the park, that encourages the addicts and troublemakers to come into the park."
 
Cuts and Wounds
 Since 1990, the number of workers at city parks has dropped by more than 1,400, from 4,667 to the current 3,261. Long-term plans call for further reductions to about 2,600 in 1997. Meanwhile, the parks' budget has shrunk to $156.7 million for the current fiscal year, from $195 million in 1990. And plans for the next fiscal year call for the parks budget to drop a little more, by more than $1 million.
The decline is evident in other ways. In 1990 the Parks Department rated about two-thirds of the parks as being in acceptable condition; last summer the figure was about half. In the summer of 1989, 17 percent of the park's drinking fountains were inoperable. By last summer, 30 percent were broken. Also, the number of defective pieces of playground equipment had doubled between 1990 and last summer.
Despite the cuts in the annual maintenance, the Parks Department still has a capital budget of $100 million to finance long-term projects, such as reconstructing buildings, buying new playground equipment, purchasing new lighting systems or restoring park paths. But officials worry that without regular maintenance, the capital budget will be less effective.
"The effect of the cuts is that, 15 years ago, a park renovation would have lasted 15 years, if the park was properly maintained," said Kuo Ming Tsu, the park system's assistant commissioner for capital budgets. "But now, that time may now be cut by two-thirds."
Still, the involvement of some community groups has helped offset some of the cuts in maintenance. Also, there are the large, nonprofit civic organizations, which in the last two years have raised $54 million to finance projects ranging from restoring baseball fields and bridges in Central Park to restoring a carousel and planting new trees in Prospect Park. But some other community groups complain that these groups respond to the needs of just a handful of the city's most visible parks and maintain that many smaller, neighborhood parks are located in areas where residents don't have the financial resources to pay for refurbishing.
 
More Efficiency Sought
 Another way of compensating for the budget cuts is improving efficiency of the parks' maintenance workers. Betsy Gotbaum, the city's Parks Commissioner, said workers have begun developing more efficient work procedures. Mobile crews, for example, have started staggering their schedules of refueling, a process that often left drivers standing in city-operated gas lines.
And some classes provided by recreation centers -- such as aerobics or fencing -- are now provided for a small enrollment fee, rather than being financed by the city.
Still, many workers and parks officials say that, even with increased efficiency, they feel they are unable to keep up with the demands of maintaining the parks. "Our people are working harder than ever, and we have learned to do more with less," said Leroy Knowles, deputy chief of operations for the Bronx. "It's tough, but we're still trying to make it."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Aides Plan Strategy for High Court Nomination

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
President Clinton met with top advisers today to plot a strategy for choosing a new Supreme Court Justice, a process that aides said could take until the end of the Court term early this summer.
White House officials said no names were mentioned at the hourlong meeting. Nor did they discuss requirements for a Justice. Instead, they said, the talk centered on timing and mechanics. Participants included Vice President Al Gore, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff; Bruce Lindsey, the personnel director; Vince Foster, the deputy Presidential counsel, and Ronald Klain, associate counsel and a former law clerk to retiring Justice Byron R. White. 
 "They concluded that this can be a timely decision," said Mark D. Gearan, the deputy chief of staff, "but that we're not in a position of having to make an immediate decision. Justice White's timetable in terms of sitting through June allows for an opportunity to have a process that's deliberative and complete."
Though they want to be thorough, White House officials also said they did not want to linger so long as to cause weeks of speculation in the press over who would be nominated. Officials said they hoped Mr. Clinton would make his choice by the end of the current term in late June or early July, when Justice White said he would retire.
The 75-year-old conservative, the only sitting Justice appointed by a Democratic President, announced Friday that he would retire. While Mr. Clinton cited judgment, intelligence and experience as qualifications for a Justice, Mr. Clinton's advisers said that political considerations could not but help be a factor.
 
Mention of a Political Reward
 One close adviser to Mr. Clinton speculated, for example, that rather than a legal scholar, the President would pick a political figure from the battleground states of Illinois, Michigan or Ohio, which all went solidly for Mr. Clinton in last year's election. The adviser noted that the President had not given those states any reward for their support, which would be crucial for his re-election.
While they said names were not discussed at the meeting, White House officials said that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, the only person Mr. Clinton ever mentioned during the campaign as a prospective Justice, would certainly be under consideration.
In an interview today, Mr. Cuomo insisted that he did not want to discuss his possible candidacy, except to say: "I've talked enough about it. The last thing I'm going to do is have another go round like I did on the Presidency. It wasted everybody's time."
Officials of both the White House and the Senate Judiciary Committee said they were researching whether they would be restricted from picking a successor and seeking his confirmation before Justice White actually leaves the bench. Even if a new Justice cannot be confirmed by the end of the term, White House officials said they hoped the process could be in motion with a nominee selected. That way, the confirmation could be completed in the summer, giving the new Justice time to read petitions and briefs before the start of the fall term.
 
Giving Weight to Diversity
 White House officials also said the President would give weight to candidates of ethnic and sexual diversity, prompting an assortment of interest groups to begin pressing for particular candidates. In a reversal among lobbying groups not seen in years, liberal groups were positioning themselves for a large role in advising the Administration, while conservatives prepared to oppose a nominee that might not be to their liking.
Nan Aron, executive director of the Alliance for Justice, a liberal group, said, "We urge the President to look beyond the traditional settings of lawyering and make racial, ethnic and gender diversity one of the principal factors in his selection of the next Supreme Court Justice."
But conservatives urged moderation. "As to philosophy," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who serves on the Judiciary Committee, "I can only hope that President Clinton will, as did Presidents Reagan and Bush, avoid ideological litmus tests."
Mr. Clinton did not speak publicly today about the search for a Justice, but not knowing his remarks were being broadcast to reporters, he bantered about the process with friends and aides in the Oval Office before beginning his radio address this morning.
He joked about selecting the comedian Jay Leno for the Court. Then he teasingly mentioned James Carville, his colorful strategist during the campaign. "Carville's a lawyer," Mr. Clinton said. "I think that would be interesting, you know. Then we'd have our, the things that he and I say to each other like, 'Squeal like a pig under a gate' would be in a Supreme Court opinion."
After getting the one-minute cue for his address on the economy, Mr. Clinton put on a serious Presidential voice and said: "Good morning. Today I have decided to appoint James Carville to the United States Supreme Court. He has plans to get our country moving again."
Then, seconds before the radio broadcast, Mr. Clinton said, "I'm terrified I'm going to say something like that without thinking about it."

HEADLINE: Port Authority Crisis Is Over, but Problems Persist

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Three weeks after the bombing of the World Trade Center, the managers of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are caught in a paradoxical mood.
Despite the shock and disruption of the attack, agency officials are exhilarated at what they see as a successful all-out effort to restore the buildings and are confident that the bombing will not permanently damage the authority's operations. But beneath the can-do zeal that the agency has brought to the current crisis is a more sober assessment of long-range problems that have nothing to do with the Feb. 26 attack. 
 The managers are cheered because the first tenants temporarily evacuated from the stricken towers began moving back in last week, and others show little sign of wanting to leave permanently. Meanwhile, the rebuilding of the underground garage is going smoothly and the arrests of suspects in the attack have helped to quell the feeling of defeat that can arise from unpunished crimes.
 
Problems Persist
 But longer-range problems, rooted in economics and demographics, persist for the nation's biggest and richest public developer.
For one thing, the authority's books are lopsided, with some parts of its $1.9 billion in annual operations making buckets of money and others, notably mass transit, losing ever larger sums. While the Port Authority is still rich in cash and assets, growth in its profitable ventures is flat, while the losses are rising. Moreover, agency officials say, the New York-New Jersey metropolitan region is economically mature, with its greatest growth behind it and its population moving away from the authority's core waterfront area of operation.
These trends leave the agency with diminishing room to maneuver, when political leaders are looking to the Port Authority to take the lead in stimulating growth in employment and investment.
 
Tolls, Fees and Rents
 The Port Authority, created in 1921 to develop transportation and other development projects for New York and New Jersey, is a largely independent public agency run by a board appointed by the governors of the two states. Most of the agency's nearly $2 billion in annual income comes from Hudson River bridge and tunnel tolls, airport fees and rents in the World Trade Center, but it also operates the PATH system, several industrial development districts and -- its original mission -- the New York harbor shipping ports.
In the short term, the management of this vast operation may feel entitled to take some muted satisfaction from the aftermath of the bombing, despite the deaths of six people in the attack and the still-unreckoned costs of restoring the buildings.
 
Going to Funerals
 "There are two things going on here," said Richard C. Leone, chairman of the Port Authority Board of Commissioners, in a recent interview. "One is the emotion and sadness that was really draining for the top people who went from funeral to funeral after the bombing.
"But the opposite of that is the exhilaration many of us feel in seeing this group of literally hundreds of dedicated people working a sort of fighting-Sea Bees way to overcome and recover from this. I honestly think if you could bottle whatever we have here we would all stop worrying about American competitiveness."
Mr. Leone and the Port Authority's executive director, Stanley Brezenoff, stress the agency's determination to come out of the bombing with new vigor.
The $500 million renovation of the aging World Trade Center, begun two years ago, will resume once bomb-damage repairs are made, as will plans to link the region's three airports by rail to Queens and Manhattan. In the distance is the prospect of a second span over the Arthur Kill to Staten Island, paralleling the overburdened Goethals Bridge, at a cost of a half-billion dollars.
 
Failed to See Danger
 Insurance will cover most of the $5 million a week in lost rentals at the trade center, as well as the lawsuits that are sure to result from the bombing, officials say. But the agency must still deal with criticism that it failed to take adequate precautions against terrorism. Several times in recent years, Port Authority officials drew up antiterrorism plans that specifically noted the vulnerability of the World Trade Center garages.
"I don't want to minimize the human tragedy," Mr. Leone said. "I don't want to trivialize the lawsuits and the hearings and the entanglements that lie ahead. It will be open season on us all. But on the other hand I think we will come out of this with a renewed sense that it is worth having an institution such as this."
 
Long-Term Positive Effect
 Mitchell I. Moss, a New York University professor of urban affairs who has often charged the Port Authority with a lack of vision, suggested that the long-term effect of the blast might even be positive.
"Is this a Chernobyl for them?" he said. "No. I think people could argue that they are going to be safer at the World Trade Center than in other buildings after this, because the Port Authority is going to be more aware of the dangers. The real question is, is the Port Authority going to see this as an opportunity to rebuild their reputation and to take a leadership role in this region, or are they just going to go back to business as usual?"
But it is clear, people in and out of the Port Authority acknowledge, that the huge agency does not have the scope and breadth that it once did to reshape the very skyline of the country's biggest metropolis. Its most recent plan to rebuild Kennedy International Airport nearly from the ground up faltered after at least $100 million in wasted costs in 1989 as the recession bit deeper and the airlines balked at paying any additional costs. A year later, the agency lost $25 million building a commercial fish port in Brooklyn that failed to draw any fishing boats.
Long-promised plans for new industrial development sites and the Hunters Point housing project in Queens are still nowhere in sight, while in 1990, Los Angeles overtook New York in what was once the Port Authority's core business, ocean shipping.
 
Winter Storm Woes
 In December, meanwhile, a winter storm flooded several PATH tunnels under the Hudson river, adding to the costs of a service that is already the Port Authority's biggest single money-loser. And last weekend's blizzard added to the agency's woes by shutting down all four of its airports -- Kennedy, Newark International, La Guardia and Teterboro, N.J., the little suburban airport -- for 24 hours.
The Port Authority separates its operations into five categories: interstate transportation, air terminals, marine operations, world trade and regional development. Of those, only two, air terminals and world trade, made money last year. In interstate transportation, the bridges and tunnels were all immensely profitable, but the money disappears into the $230 million mass transit loss for PATH and Port Authority Bus Terminal operations.
Those losses are likely to increase at the rate of inflation, at least, said Barry Weintrob, chief financial officer, while the bridges and tunnels that subsidize them are nearing capacity, and income from them is projected to rise at only 1 percent per year.
 
No Toll Increases
 Mr. Brezenoff has committed the Port Authority to avoiding toll increases on the Hudson River crossings through next year. But with the agency's losses from unprofitable operations rising and profits from the money-makers essentially flat, officials on both sides of the Hudson expect that a new round of toll increases is inevitable, and likely to ignite a fight with New Jersey officials on behalf of the state's commuters, who pay the bulk of the tolls.
Mr. Leone and Mr. Brezenoff refused to concede the eventual need for higher tolls, but Mr. Leone granted that the authority has entered a period of austerity and retrenchment.
"Everybody has had to pull back," he said. "Some of our businesses are more mature. Aviation is not going to grow, real estate is not going to show the same meteoric rise in incomes, so we are not going to see the resources that we had when some of our riskier projects were started. Instead, a lot of our activities are going to be associated with improving our existing facilities."
The bold airport rail links will not depend on tolls. Assuming approval by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Port Authority's tax of $3 per departing passenger at the three main airports, imposed last year, will be extended to pay the estimated $2 billion that linking the airports with Manhattan will cost.
Before the bombing the Port Authority spoke of the air-link projects as tentative. But its leaders now describe the system with certainty, with the final stages due for completion after the turn of the century -- as if to underscore that the agency is still up to its old role as master builder.
"Those systems will be built," Mr. Brezenoff said.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
In Wake of Crises, Cuomo Makes Lemonade

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 19

 BODY:
After watching his poll ratings slide while struggling with the state's budget crisis, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo seems to have discovered that a different kind of crisis can sometimes work to his advantage.
In the past three weeks, the bombing of the World Trade Center, the crippling weekend blizzard and the struggle to save The New York Post have provided Mr. Cuomo with opportunities to cast himself in every politician's favorite roles -- general, dealmaker and hometown booster -- all of which play better on television than sparring with the Legislature. 
 "When the people see him now, they realize why they elected him," said John A. Marino, the state Democratic Party chairman and a top political aide to the Governor. "It's the personal Cuomo, the familial Cuomo, the father figure. And with budget negotiations and other things going on, that's not the way Cuomo has been coming out."
Now Mr. Cuomo is likely to receive another public relations boost in the form of speculation about whether he will be nominated to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by Justice Byron R. White.
 
A Welcome Diversion
 Political strategists believe the Governor's approval rating in New York improved each time he encouraged speculation about his Presidential ambitions. They assume the same thing will happen now, if only because attention will be diverted from the bad news of cutting budgets and raising taxes.
If Mr. Cuomo does not find himself on the Court, he is expected to run in 1994 for a fourth four-year term. Toward that end, he has been trying to burnish his popularity, a process that his aides realize must be incremental.
They know that the timely passage of balanced budgets will help, as will holding the line on tax increases. And they know they must take advantage of unexpected events that offer positive moments in the spotlight.
Mr. Cuomo's responses to the various crises have not by any means been exclusively self-promotional. To a large extent, he has done what leaders are expected to do at such times -- calm the public, restore morale and direct what Mr. Cuomo calls a "return to normalcy."
 
'Back Front and Center'
 But the crises gave Mr. Cuomo innumerable opportunities to appear in charge. He has been busy declaring emergencies, calling out the National Guard, monitoring rescue and cleanup efforts, rounding up newspaper investors and, as he has mentioned in almost every interview, conferring with President Clinton.
He also has been talking about his efforts in a stream of media interviews and news conferences. When not talking to Larry King or Charlie Rose, he was appearing on CNN's "Newsmaker Sunday," NBC's "Today" show, ABC's "Good Morning America" and a variety of local television and radio shows.
His presence in New York City has seemed almost more mayoral than gubernatorial, a perception that was exaggerated by the fact that Mayor David N. Dinkins was in Japan on the day the trade center was bombed.
"There's no doubt that Cuomo has been making the circuit," said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. "This has been a rare time when he's back front and center."
On occasion, Mr. Cuomo has shown a flair for the flamboyant, including Thursday's MacArthuresque return to his offices on the 57th floor of the World Trade Center, fulfilling a pledge to become the first tenant to reoccupy the building.
 
A Stress on Survival
 The Governor also claimed at a news conference several weeks ago that in the long run the bombing would be good for New York City because the city's calm response might soften the image created in recent years by disturbances in Crown Heights and the rape of a jogger in Central Park.
The trade center bombing and the snowstorm gave Mr. Cuomo new opportunities to reiterate a favorite political theme, that New York, and by implication its governor, have long been victims of outside forces.
"This is New York," he said on the Today show on March 1. "We'll survive this. We survived depressions, recessions, presidents who sent vice presidents here to make fun of us. After what we've been through over the last three or four years, this one we'll do with one hand."
And like Ronald Reagan, he has made effective use of anecdotes to personify the spirit of his state.
After the trade center blast, he spoke about Kevin Shea, a firefighter who was seriously injured while searching for survivors. This week, he has been telling the story of Karen Woodcock, a Saratoga County woman who gave birth to "a brand new New Yorker" after a state snowplow cleared her driveway, enabling an ambulance to take her to the hospital.
 
A Double-Edged Post
 Whether Mr. Cuomo will benefit politically from his role with The Post is more ambiguous. He is at least partly responsible for the emergence of Steven Hoffenberg as a potential owner for the paper, and by extension, for Mr. Hoffenberg's onetime ally, Abraham Hirschfeld, who despite an open rebellion last week from the paper's staff now seems to be the leading bidder for the troubled paper.
At the end of last week, Mr. Cuomo was trying to line up new investors to replace Mr. Hirschfeld.
Mr. Cuomo has portrayed his involvement with the paper as the ultimate act of political selflessness. His goal, he has said, is to save jobs and preserve an alternative editorial voice, even though that voice often has railed against him.
"In the end they're going to beat me up anyway, whoever owns the thing," he said on WNYW-TV's "Good Day New York" on Monday.
Even Mr. Cuomo's political opponents agree that he has helped himself in recent weeks. But some pollsters believe the public's image of Mr. Cuomo will be hard to change after a decade in office, and Republican leaders question whether the events of March 1993 will be remembered in November 1994.
"Three weeks in 10 years doesn't make a man," said the state Republican Party chairman, William D. Powers. "And it doesn't make a governor."

HEADLINE: Casino Issue Divides Mohawk Reservation in New York

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. REGIS MOHAWK RESERVATION, N.Y.

 BODY:
There is a postcard quality to the winter scene outside Dave George's door, where birch forests and snow-swept wheat fields meet the St. Lawrence River. But to many Mohawk Indians, it is a landscape of bad memories, the scene of a divisive, unsolved crime.
In May 1990, two Indians died near here in a gun battle between rival Mohawk groups. The shooting, for which no one has been arrested, was ostensibly over casino gambling on the reservation, but Mohawk leaders say it was rooted in more elemental conflicts over moral values, tribal traditions, money and power. 
 Today the casinos are shuttered and the guns silent, but the underlying tensions remain. And amid talk of reopening the gambling halls, Mr. George and others are keeping their rifles clean and close at hand, awaiting the spark that could reignite their simmering feud.
"Sure, there will be trouble again," said Mr. George, a broad-shouldered, 47-year-old fisherman who opposes gambling. "People are going to make a stand. It's going to be like the Civil War, North against South."
In the coming weeks, negotiators for the Mohawks and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo are expected to complete an agreement that once signed by Mr. Cuomo and the United States Secretary of the Interior, would allow casino games like roulette, blackjack and craps on the 14,000-acre Mohawk reservation. Some Mohawks say they can have a casino operating by summer.
 
Wariness, Not Open Arms
 The Oneida Indians of central New York State, who have been more united than the Mohawks in supporting gambling, have already reached a tentative agreement with Mr. Cuomo's office and are awaiting his signature to open a $10 million casino near Syracuse. It would be the first high-stakes casino in the state.
While for-profit casino gambling has been welcomed on scores of impoverished Indian reservations nationwide as a financial boon, many Mohawks in this border region are deeply wary of the immense wealth casinos are sure to attract.
Some Indians fear an invasion of disruptive neon-lit businesses and organized crime. Others say gambling engenders a fast-money mentality at odds with traditional Mohawk values. Still others contend casinos will infringe Mohawk sovereignty by opening the reservation to state police officers, gambling inspectors and possibly Federal tax collectors.
But for most, the strongest memories are of 1990, when anti-gambling Mohawks blocked roads, attacked businesses and virtually closed the reservation for five weeks in protests against eight casinos that had opened without state approval. When pro-gambling Mohawks tried to tear down the roadblocks, the conflict escalated first into fistfights and then into firefights, culminating in the two fatal shootings and the closing of the casinos.
 
Time Has Healed Little
 Time has done little to heal the wounds. Families have been riven by the dispute. Anti-gambling Mohawks refuse to patronize stores owned by pro-gambling Mohawks. Racketeering suits have been filed against state officials and pro-gambling Mohawks blaming them for the violence. Former friends and allies now accuse each other of links to organized crime. One pro-gambling chief has even accused another pro-gambling chief of accepting a bribe from a potential casino operator.
"What you have here is a community in dysfunction," said Harold L. Oakes, a Mohawk who is part of a group trying to mediate between rival factions. "A lot of it has to do with 1990. A lot of it has to do with blood feuds. A lot of it has to do with different religions. Gambling will just bring all the tensions to the surface."
The Mohawk dispute has also reverberated in the state capital. Some legislators say casino gambling could revive tourism in places like Niagara Falls and the Catskills, and they see gambling on Indian reservations as a first step toward allowing casinos elsewhere. Gambling opponents have called for Mr. Cuomo to reject the Mohawk and Oneida compacts to prevent casinos from spreading across the state.
 
Anything Charities Can Do
 But there is little Mr. Cuomo, who opposes casino gambling, or the Legislature can do to derail Indian gambling. Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, states are required to allow Indians to operate, for profit, any gambling game that charities and other nonprofit groups are allowed to run. In New York State that means most casino-style card and dice games, though not slot machines.
Mr. Cuomo can negotiate for state regulation of games, as he did with the Oneidas. But if he refuses to sign a gambling agreement, the tribes can ask a Federal judge to impose one.
Since the law was passed, 58 tribes in 18 states -- about one third of all the tribes outside of Alaska -- have signed compacts. According to industry estimates, Indian casinos generated $6 billion in revenues last year. The Oneidas have predicted that their casino could earn over $50 million in its first year, drawing mostly from Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.
Although a casino is scheduled to open in Quebec Province this year, the Mohawks say their casino can still attract a large clientele from Montreal and Ottawa, which are each a 90-minute drive away.
 
A Bitter Power Struggle
 Like advocates of Indian gambling elsewhere, pro-gambling Mohawks say casinos would create thousands of new jobs and provide money for a host of beneficial programs, from small business loans to college scholarships to housing for the elderly.
But unlike many other tribes, the Mohawks have been racked by bitter rivalries among factions divided by geography, religion and politics.
"It has been a power struggle over who is going to govern the reservation," said Chief John S. Loran, one of three members of the Mohawk tribal council, the elected governing body, which would run the casino under the state compact. "Gaming is just a vehicle some people have used to split the community."
The son of an ironworker and founder of a construction company, Mr. Loran, 34, represents a budding Mohawk business community, which has experienced robust growth in recent years from the sale of tax-free gasoline and cigarettes to non-Indians, many from Canada.
 
Christians and Non-Christians
 "Casino revenues will trickle down to help everyone," he said, estimating that earnings could top $100 million next year. "We'll have new restaurants, motels and shops."
But many Mohawks -- a third or more, by some estimates -- consider the tribal council part of the United States Government and will not participate in annual elections. These Indians are mostly non-Christians who consider themselves less assimilated than pro-gambling Mohawks, many of whom are baptized Christians. They have their own clan leaders, who deride gambling as a get-rich-quick scheme for an elite and consider it an offense to Mohawk values.
"We look at Las Vegas and everything is centered around money," said Charlie Patton, a member of the traditional, or longhouse, council. "Do we want to be a nation of Cadillac owners or a people who live in peace?"
Many Mohawks also fear that the tribe will fall prey to organized crime. One tribal council chief, L. David Jacobs, has accused Mr. Loran of accepting a bribe from a potential casino operator. Mr. Loran denied the accusation, calling Mr. Jacobs "a paranoid schizophrenic."
 
Warrior Society in Shadows
 A wild card in the gambling debate is a shadowy group known as the Warrior Society. Its members, whose numbers are not publicly known, promote a militant brand of nationalism that advocates reclaiming Mohawk land and opposes government intervention on the reservation, which they call Akwesasne. They have supported gambling as a means of giving Mohawks economic power.
But what role they will play in the current dispute is unclear. In 1990, Warrior members wearing bandanas across their faces and brandishing automatic weapons provided security for illegal casinos. Now, however, Warrior members say they oppose the proposed compact because it would allow state police and inspectors onto the reservation.
"When we want to open a casino, it will be on our terms," said Mark Montour, the Cornell-educated proprietor of "Smoke Cignals," a cigarette shop, who is an active supporter of the Warriors. "The way they want us to do it is like running Off Track Betting."
Geography has also played a role in the conflict. Akwesasne, the traditional name for the Mohawk land that straddles the border, has about 7,500 residents, about equally divided between the United States and Canada. Each side is governed by a separate council. The Canadian council strongly opposes gambling, which has been proposed only for the American side, and that stand has caused the American council to accuse it of interfering in the American side's affairs.
 
A Way Station for Smuggling
 The reservation's border location has made it a way station for smuggling drugs, weapons, cigarettes and people to and from Canada, law enforcement officials say. Opponents of gambling say casinos will only fuel such illegal activities by attracting criminal groups to the reservation.
The result, they say, will be violence, Mohawk against Mohawk, in a battle for the tribe's future.
"Gambling breaks down our cultural values," said Chief Jake Swamp, a leading opponent of gambling. "And what I hear from people is that they are not going to take it any longer."

HEADLINE: Neither Malthus Nor a Luddite Be

 BODY:
To the Editor:
George Sai-Halasz's commentary on "Stanching the Loss of Good Jobs" ("Count In the Computer Effect," Letters, Feb. 28) puts the blame for rising unemployment on computers. He asserts that as the cost of computers decreases and the tasks that they can do multiply, "the vast majority of the population, through no fault of its own, has no economic justification for drawing a sustenance." 
 Malthus would be proud of this. For Malthus, "a man who is born into a world already possessed . . . has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food." Malthus, too, never considered redistribution of income or wealth as a possibility.
Blaming tools, such as computers, for unemployment is the same as blaming the poor for the existence of poverty. If computers double our productivity, we can cut our working day in half, without a decrease in wages. What is so sacrosanct about the eight-hour day? It was a 16-hour day 200 years ago.
I agree with Mr. Sai-Halasz that the major problem of our society is the tremendous disparity in the distribution of wealth. However, until we correct this inequality, we will be constantly exorted by neo-Malthusian and neo-Luddite arguments to control populations or destroy machines.

HEADLINE: Cost of Heart Revival Put at $150,000 per Survivor

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., March 20

 BODY:
A hospital's practice of reviving patients whose hearts stop beating costs more than $150,000 for each survivor, a study has found.
The study found that most of those given cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, in hospital wards never regain the ability to breathe on their own. Instead, they spend their final days on respirators in intensive-care units, often running up high bills. 
 The study was conducted by doctors from Duke University, who followed 146 patients given CPR after suffering cardiac arrest in general medical and surgical wards from 1988 to 1991. Eighty-four patients, or 58 percent, were revived, but only seven patients, or 5 percent, got well enough to leave the hospital.
The researchers found that the total costs of saving the lives of the 84 patients was $1.1 million. But when the cost was measured in terms of those who went on to lead meaningful lives for a period, it was $150,000 for each of the seven. Nationally, CPR is tried on about one-third of all patients who die in hospitals. Many are elderly and terminally ill from heart ailments, cancer and other diseases.
After the patients are revived, their medical bills rise sharply because most are transferred to intensive care and put on expensive life-support systems.
"It's a medical avalanche," said Dr. Christopher O'Connor, one of the Duke researchers. "You trigger everything."
Dr. O'Connor and Dr. Mark Thel presented the findings on Tuesday at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology.
Dr. O'Connor said CPR first gained routine use during operations, when it often worked well. But it has since been used on patients in all parts of hospitals with little thought given to the cost of interrupting death.
Dr. O'Connor urged doctors to ask their patients how they would like to be treated if their hearts stopped beating. While hospitals are required to ask such questions, it is usually done by clerks rather than doctors.
 
Guidelines on Counseling
 And when doctors bring up the subject, he said, they should keep the price in mind. "We feel that the cost of CPR should be considered when the doctor counsels patients about whether they should get it," he said.
The researchers said doctors should be reluctant to recommend CPR to people who are gravely ill.
Typically, hospitals try to revive all patients after cardiac arrest unless a specific "do not resuscitate" order has been given by the patient.
"When you look at the way we treat patients at the extremes of life, it's plain there is no reason why we doctors can't allow people to die with dignity," Dr. Adolph Hutter of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said in an interview at the meeting.
The cost of caring for patients in the last months of life has become a matter of concern, especially as health economists look for ways to restrain costs.
In a similar study of life-prolonging treatment for critically ill cancer patients, published last month in The Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that very expensive care usually brought little added survival. Among the 150 patients in the study, those who spent any time in intensive care for reasons other than post-surgical recovery ran up subsequent hospital bills of $82,845 to $189,339 for each year of life gained.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Plants Said to Be Vulnerable to Bombings

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The bombing of the World Trade Center and the ease with which an intruder invaded the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in February suggest that nuclear power plants may be far more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than previously assumed, experts told a Senate subcommittee today.
The two incidents underscored a suddenly worrisome gap in current regulations, they said: plant owners are prepared for attacks by well-trained commandoes, but they are not required to safeguard against car bombs. 
 The experts are becoming increasingly concerned as details emerge about the World Trade Center bombing on Feb. 26 and an incident on Feb. 7 in which a former mental patient sped past the guard shack at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant near Harrisburg, Pa., crashed his station wagon through a metal door and drove 60 feet inside the turbine hall.
The man, although unarmed, was loose in the plant for four hours.
Ivan Selin, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told the subcommittee that the two events had prompted his agency to rethink its security regulations.
Mr. Selin, who acknowledged that his agency's assessment was based on "one part hard data and several parts judgment," said the commission thought that a nuclear plant was not an attractive target because destroying one would not gain sympathy or support for the perpetrators. He also said that the driver of a truck bomb would be on a suicide mission.
Others disputed him on both points.
Mr. Selin said that even if a big bomb was set off in a turbine hall, a radiation release was unlikely, but that a big enough blast could hurt safety systems and leave the plant "skating on thin ice."
Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at the Rand Corporation, said of the World Trade Center blast, "If amateurs using ordinary, commercially available materials can fashion a simple bomb and cause so much damage and destruction, one shudders to think what international terrorism's genuine professionals could accomplish.
 
'A Warning Earthquake'
 "One similarly shudders to think what professional terrorists, well-armed and trained in combat skills, driving something more formidable than a Plymouth station wagon, could accomplish should they decide that the defenses and security measures at this country's commercial nuclear power plants were permeable," he told the subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Regulation of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
The subcommittee chairman, Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said, "The break-in at Three Mile Island in February was a warning bell, and what happened a month later in New York was a warning earthquake."
At the hearing, Phillip Clark, president of GPU Nuclear Corporation, which owns Three Mile Island, showed a videotape of the route the intruder was believed to have taken, first by car and then on foot. Senator Lieberman observed that the plant "looked like a soft target."
Eldon V. C. Greenberg, representing two watchdog groups, the Nuclear Control Institute, which is concerned with weapons proliferation, and the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a safety group, said that for years the commission had assumed that truck bombs were not credible and that if they became credible, there would be warning. "In a span of less than three weeks, both those pillars have been demolished," he said.
But Harry B. Brandon 3d, the deputy assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said, "Our current assessment is that the threat is very low." There is no intelligence indicating a trend from either the Three Mile Island incident or the World Trade Center bombing, he said.
Mr. Selin told the subcommittee that regulations were designed not to prevent an attack but to assure that no radioactive material would be released. But utility executives said that if they thought bombs were likely they would invest in protective measures to protect many millions of dollars worth of nonnuclear equipment.

HEADLINE: A Bitter Storm Leaves Winners and Losers

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOMERSET, N.J., March 19

 BODY:
Last Friday, before the weekend blizzard blew in, Frank Santangelo Jr. had 46 tons of ice-melting rock salt piled in the lumber yard of his store, Franks Hardware, here. On Monday night, it was all sold, along with most of his snow shovels. Count him as one of the winners in the storm.
Also on Friday, Charles Peterson of Peterson's Nursery in Princeton had row upon row of daffodils, crocuses and mums carefully timed to bloom for what was supposed to be the first big weekend of the spring gardening season. As the snow fell and shoppers stayed home, the flowers bloomed and drooped. Count him as one who lost. 
 Throughout the New York metropolitan region, the Blizzard of '93 dispensed profit and penalty with magisterial symmetry. It liberated schoolchildren from classes but sent parents hunting for scarce baby sitters. It crushed roofs under the weight of snow and ice, and left roofers with more work than they could handle. To the familiar term "snowbound" it added a modern cognate, "plow-bound," for the thousands of driveways that became barricaded behind iced-over drifts heaped up by municipal plows, awaiting exhausted but happy private plow operators like Jim Zappi of Ossining, N.Y.
"What a storm!" Mr. Zappi cheered. "I wish we could have another one."
A final tally of what the storm cost can never be known, since the drifts were fought and prices paid in as many ways as there are households, and there are about 7.6 million of them, in the region. The three states have already begun asking Washington for help paying for state and municipal snow removal costs, which have amounted to an estimated $129 million for New York State, $30 million in New Jersey and $5.9 million in Connecticut.
 
'What Killed Us'
 Those numbers mean that for a lot of municipalities, annual snow removal budgets are already depleted for the year, with next fall's storms still ahead, not to mention any surprises that the spring may bring.
"What killed us was the ice on top of the snow," said Clifford Steele, head of administration for Paramus, N.J. "A normal storm would have cost us about eight grand in overtime, but with the ice, it just about doubled it. After the snow we've already had, that doesn't leave much left for the rest of the year."
President Clinton last week gave the states approval to apply for emergency snow removal reimbursements, which are based on a portion of the costs of clearing certain roads for emergency access. Because the emergency aid covers the cost of plowing only one lane on certain roads, the final level of aid will be far less than the total state and local plowing bill.
State governments are also trying to reckon the costs of wind and water damage, and early estimates suggest that because the storm moved inland and winds shifted offshore the next day, the harm done was far less than the heavy winds and high tides that struck before Christmas and again on March 4.
"We don't have a damage assessment yet," said Jon Shure, the spokesman for Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey. But, he said, "I don't think it will amount to enough to justify applying for Federal disaster relief."
 
Many Calls for Jobs
 The second big storm of the season, on March 4, lifted the shingles from Laura Lovgren's Monmouth Beach, N.J., home. The gaps were covered only with tarp, awaiting the roofer, when the snow and wind came a week later. Now she has a partially bare roof again and water damage to boot. Three storms in three months have made her and her husband, Thomas, second-guess their decision to move to the Jersey Shore community in 1991, doubts that may be harder to quell with each new storm.
Nancy Rumph, who helps her husband, Ben, operate Ben's Roofing in Monmouth, said she had fielded 300 phone calls seeking repairs for the storms. "We haven't caught up with work from the first storm," she said, "and the second storm caused work from the first one to blow away."
Mr. Zappi, the plow operator, who is president of John Dos Anjos Landscaping in Ossining, worked all weekend with his four employees, his dump trucks and loaders clearing parking lots in Westchester County and in Fairfield County, Conn. He gave up all but about seven hours sleep, he said, between Saturday morning and Monday morning, but made about $25,000 from the work.
But Richard McKnight, head of Manpower Temporary Services in Stamford, found that not all able-bodied workers were willing to spend a weekend of shoveling, even if it did pay $10 to $12 per hour.
"We got some requests for snow shovelers and we could find them, but not like we used to be able to," he said. "Snow shoveling has historically been a young people's job and a bottom-of-the-economic-barrel type of job, and it's getting tough finding people who are willing to do that kind of work."
 
Weekend Hibernation
 And home is where the people stayed, said Lou Funk, manager of the Davidson's supermarket in Princeton, N.J.
"Every time there's a storm forecast, it's madness around here," he said. "Everyone comes in for milk, bread and a dozen eggs. The only difference is that this time they also picked up about seven videos each."
Mr. Peterson, the Princeton nurseryman, figured that the storm cost cost him $10,000 in sales, and this weekend, with snow still heavy on the ground, would be little better.
Beyond money made or lost to the storm, Steven Montello of Mont Management, a Stamford, Conn., apartment management firm, counted the more intangible benefits of neighborliness as one of the storm's dividends.
"People in condos tend to stick to themselves and leave the snow removal to the management company, so I was just overwhelmed by the number of people who were just happy to be outside and pitching in," Mr. Montello said. "People were out in their parking lots all day, helping each other, and it was a great feeling."

HEADLINE: Wilbur Daniels, 70, Garment Union Official, Dies

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Wilbur Daniels, a former top officer of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and a civic leader, died yesterday at home in Manhattan at the age of 70.
The cause was a heart ailment, his family said. 
 Mr. Daniels served the union for 44 years, starting as a researcher fresh out of college at the age of 19. Originally trained in economics, he shifted to the union's legal staff after earning a law degree in night classes at New York University. He was the assistant to the union's president, David Dubinsky, and became a vice president in 1969 and executive vice president in 1973.
His work included negotiating major contracts, revising the union constitution, developing programs for immigrant members, lobbying to protect American jobs and handling other legal and legislative duties.
 
Organized Ad Campaign
 The "look for the union label" commercial, with a chorus of union members singing the jingle, was a project he helped organize. In 1981 he opposed new government rules allowing manufacturing at home, saying: "Lifting this ban simply will bring the sweatshop back into the home. It's something we thought we got rid of 40 years ago."
Mr. Daniels was the chairman of the State Advisory Council on Employment and Unemployment Insurance and was the vice chairman of the State Job Development Authority. He was also a former executive director of the National Board of the Coat and Suit Industry.
Since leaving the union in 1987 he worked as the executive director of the S. H. and Helen R. Scheuer Foundation, which promotes the arts and Jewish life and education.
He was the Metropolitan Opera's executive committee chairman and was also instrumental in finding the Roundabout Theater a new home in a former union auditorium. He also served on the boards of the Lincoln Center, United Housing Foundation, New York Urban Coalition and American Arbitration Association.
Born in Detroit, Mr. Daniels grew up in New York City.
His survivors include his wife of 29 years, the former Patricia Heyman; a daughter, Ann, of Oakland, Calif., and a granddaughter.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
A St. Patrick's Day Call From the White House

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
St. Patrick's Day was a political challenge for Mayor David N. Dinkins, who had sided with homosexuals in their unsuccessful effort to march openly under their own banner in the annual parade.
Mr. Dinkins's support of an inclusive parade -- and his refusal to march in the traditional affair put on by the Order of Ancient Hibernians -- no doubt will hurt him among some Irish-American voters this fall. But, because it was also the Mayor's lawyers who obtained a court order last week preventing the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization from staging its own march on Fifth Avenue before the parade, several advocates for gay and lesbian causes said that Mr. Dinkins might have lost support among some homosexual voters as well. 
 So touchy was the political balancing act on St. Patrick's Day that in midafternoon, mayoral aides suddenly announced that Mr. Dinkins would rush to an unscheduled meeting at the White House at 7 that evening. A request came about noon, the aides said, to meet with Robert E. Rubin, the chairman of President Clinton's National Economic Council. The subject: a Presidential task force on the "urban core" that was to hold its first session the following day.
The Mayor's shift in schedule required the cancellation of his planned appearance at a dinner with the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick here in New York. Skeptical reporters asked Mr. Dinkins if he was rushing off to Washington to avoid a potential confrontation with conservative Irish-Americans angry with the Mayor over the parade.
"I've been called to the White House by Bob Rubin," Mr. Dinkins said. "I think that is pretty important."
The Mayor noted that he hosted a St. Patrick's Day breakfast that morning at Gracie Mansion and that he had attended two other celebratory breakfasts. "I've been around," he said. "I've seen most of the players. I'm not avoiding anyone."
But a political adviser to the Mayor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that while Mr. Rubin's request had in fact come at the last minute, Mr. Dinkins's political strategists had also encouraged him not to attend the dinner out of concern that there might be a confrontation.
 
Unfair Political Advantage?
 It is an election year in New Jersey, and legislators are turning their hands to the task of eliminating what they say is an unfair advantage enjoyed by certain candidates. Just who those candidates are, of course, is very much in the eye of the beholder.
The Republican-controlled Legislature is pondering legislation that would forbid a sitting governor running for re-election from appearing in broadcast commercials promoting the state. Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, has been on the airwaves of late in public interest radio spots -- with the mother of the pop singer Whitney Houston urging prospective mothers to get prenatal care, with the Consumer Affairs Director, Emma Byrne, warning of telephone scams, and in promotions for "Jersey Fresh" agricultural products, among other things.
The man who made that kind of promotional technique famous, of course, was not Mr. Florio, but his predecessor, Thomas H. Kean, a Republican, who gained political and personal stardom with his tourism ads, "New Jersey and You -- Perfect Together."
That, of course, was different, the Republicans say.
 
Time With the President
 After 15 years as a New York City elected official, Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, does not often gush effusively about a fellow politician. But after a chance private encounter with President Clinton during a trip to Washington earlier this month, Ms. Messinger was downright euphoric. "Extraordinary" and "impressive" were among the barrage of adjectives she used to describe the experience.
The Borough President, it seems, was sitting in the second row of a hotel ballroom at a meeting of the National League of Cities, preparing along with about 3,000 other people to listen to the President discuss his economic plan. Scanning the audience before the speech, Mr. Clinton recognized Ms. Messinger -- whom he had met late in 1991 during the Presidential primary campaign and who became a strong supporter. The President waved and yelled hello.
A few minutes later, as Mr. Clinton began speaking, an aide invited Ms. Messinger to join the President's staff backstage. That led to an invitation from the President, at the conclusion of his speech, to walk with him to a nearby room for a photo session, which in turn led to a ride with Mr. Clinton back to the White House.
Before Ms. Messinger knew it, she was greeting Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White House and talking with the President about everything from the new art on the office walls to New York City's response to the World Trade Center bombing. And when the conversation moved to children, the Borough President said she took out the latest photographs of her 5-month-old granddaughter.
"It was a wild, wonderful afternoon," Ms. Messinger said. "I have not ever spent a better hour in public service."

HEADLINE: Man Admits Lie About Dog Attack on Son

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dog that seriously wounded a 2-year-old boy in Brooklyn last week was not a stray but was adopted the previous day by the boy's father.
The father, Anthony Calvacca, 24, admitted on Friday that he had lied to the authorities. 
 "I didn't want no one to know, that people would think it was my fault what happened to my son," he said.
The dog, which was part pit bull, was killed at an animal shelter Friday afternoon for tests, said Joan Paylo, a spokeswoman for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The tests determined that it did not have rabies.
Mr. Calvacca, an unemployed deli clerk, and his son, Anthony Jr., were attacked by the dog Thursday afternoon in their apartment in Williamsburg, the police said.
The boy suffered "a very severe mutilating injury to his lip, cheek and face, near his eye, which required more than 50 sutures to repair," said Dr. Howard Langstein, a plastic surgeon at Bellevue Hospital.
Mr. Calvacca said in a telephone interview Friday that he was carrying his son inside his apartment building when a stray dog chased after his collie, running up the stairs and into his first-floor apartment.

The Next Crisis

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
North Korea's decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and bar international inspectors from its soil is revealing a historic shift in attitudes here. For 40 years South Koreans worried about whether the U.S. would be tough enough in combating threats from the North. Now they're worried that Washington will be too tough.
The truth is that South Koreans were wrong to doubt American resolve in the past, and are right in sensing that the U.S. is likely to be tougher than they in the present crisis. 
 President Clinton is not going to run off half-cocked and force a showdown with Pyongyang. Nor is President Kim Young Sam, the newly installed leader in Seoul -- perhaps the first truly democratically elected one in this peninsula's history -- going to lie down and play dead.
But South Korean and American officials realize that just below their surface unity sits a fundamental clash in perspective. Diplomats on both sides will devote a great deal of energy in coming weeks to denying the breach. But they know it's there, and they know it will weaken their shared hand unless they face their differences honestly and work out a creative common strategy.
In a nutshell, this is the clash: Seoul, understandably frightened about war on its soil, will go very far to avoid a confrontation with the North, perhaps even to the point of living with a North Korean bomb, or at least with some ambiguity about whether or not the North has the bomb. Washington, with its global commitment to preventing the spread of nuclear arms, will be prepared to push Pyongyang harder and take greater risks to eliminate the nuclear threat.
President Kim seems alert to the problem and eager to massage it. He told me he would be "firm" in dealing with the crisis and wanted to "thank the U.S. for its firmness."
But in official circles generally, there is a gnawing anxiety about Washington and about war. Many leaders here fear that President Clinton will see North Korea as his Iraq and President Kim Il Sung as his Saddam Hussein, and start a war to prove he's tough.
"If you corner a rat, he will turn around and bite," mused one leader. "Then," he said, pointing out the window at the panorama of the city, "30 years' hard work will be destroyed in a blizzard of missiles from North Korea."
South Koreans, of course, can't produce a shred of evidence that Mr. Clinton will act with such haste or abandon. So far, he has been every bit as cautious and patient in trying to resolve the crisis as the South Koreans themselves. But the wildness of their speculations betrays the dimensions of their fears.
Though they hate the North's leaders, officials here will go out of their way to tell you about the North Koreans' poverty, insecurities and isolation, and warn about driving them toward irrational acts. Though they profoundly mistrust Pyongyang, they search for relatively benign excuses to explain the current crisis.
Seoul officials say Kim Jong Il, the son of Kim Il Sung and his heir apparent, started it to show his military how tough he is or to blackmail the West for more economic goodies or to claim he thwarted an imminent U.S. attack or to frighten the West into lowering its nuclear inspection standards.
In fact, most officials here will offer almost any explanation but the one right in front of their noses. Pyongyang wants the bomb and either wants or already has chemical and biological arms, and it is quite ready to precipitate a crisis to protect the facilities that make them.
Perhaps the two Northern Kims, bad guys like Saddam, really believe they need the bomb to stay in power and fulfill their ambitions. Perhaps the lesson they learned from the Persian Gulf war was that Saddam made the mistake of attacking Kuwait before he had the bomb. Perhaps they think that if Saddam had waited until he had it, the U.S. might have given in to his demands.
If that is Pyongyang's game -- as I believe it is -- the U.S., South Korea and every other sane nation will have to be careful and tough and, above all, united. If North Korea gets the bomb, others -- Japan, Taiwan and South Korea itself, to name a few -- will not be far behind. This new crisis with Pyongyang is nowhere near a diplomatic settlement, as some here like to pretend. It is just beginning.

HEADLINE: Like U.S., State Governments Look to Affluent to Pay More Tax

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
In the 1980's, one state after another followed the Federal Government's lead in cutting top income tax rates and eliminating loopholes. Lately, however, states have made a U-turn. More and more of them are raising taxes on their more affluent citizens -- or thinking about it.
Since 1990, when Congress raised the top Federal income tax rate to about 33 percent from 28 percent, a dozen states have increased their taxes on the more affluent. Promises by conservatives like Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts to cut taxes have been shelved. 
 And in at least half a dozen states, including New York, politicians are considering proposals to raise the top tax rate or replace flat rates with progressive ones.
 
Higher Income, Higher Taxes
 "It's something that's percolating, and it's the direction toward which states are going to move," said Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the Rockefeller Institute.
What is clear is that the more affluent could face a double whammy. Forty-one states now have income taxes and rely on them for about one-third of their revenue.
President Clinton's proposal would push the top tax rates, or marginal rates, into the high 30-percent and 40-percent range for taxpayers with incomes of at least $140,000.
At present, states have marginal tax rates of up to 11 percent.
"You start to look at some brutal situations in terms of marginal rate," said Kevin Phillips, a political consultant in Washington.
 
An Emphasis on 'Fairness'
 During the Reagan era, the gospel around state capitals was that a tax system characterized by low rates and a broad definition of taxable income -- that is, few loopholes -- not only pulled in the most revenue, but also did the least possible economic damage.
But that view has been modified by budget strains, disappointments with the 1980's tax changes and a new emphasis on "fairness," which generally means the return to a more progressive tax system.
 
West Virginia's Proposal
 West Virginia is a case in point. Back in 1987, the state slashed its top income tax rate to 6.5 percent from 13 percent while eliminating a number of tax loopholes. But Gov. Gaston Caperton, a Democrat, recently introduced a bill to push the rate back up to 7.5 percent for people with taxable incomes of more than 100,000. The bill, intended to raise an additional $10 million a year, would affect more than 8,000 taxpayers.
Proposals to raise taxes on higher earners are under consideration in several other states. Experts say that they stand the best chance of adoption -- though not necessarily this year -- in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Missouri, Indiana, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
In New York, the Speaker of the State Assembly, Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, has introduced a proposal to raise the top rate on high-income taxpayers to nearly 9 percent from 7.88 percent. The bill is opposed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, recently vetoed a bill to raise income tax rates on the top taxpayers.
Both Governors indicated they were concerned that the higher taxes would discourage companies from locating in their states.
In West Virginia, legislative assistants say Governor Caperton's proposal to raise the marginal tax rate faces a tough fight.
But in Nebraska, the prospects appeared brighter for a tax increase proposed by Gov. Bob Nelson, a Democrat. Eric Byrd, a budget analyst at the Legislative Fiscal Office in Lincoln, said: "This is fulfilling one of the Governor's campaign promises. We pushed hard last year. It's probably going to happen this year."
 
A Late-Session Phenomenon
 Harley Duncan, executive director of the Federation of Tax Administrators in Washington, said: "In my experience, these things often arise late in sessions. As people start to focus on spending, they realize more revenue is necessary, and the income-tax-rate increases tend to serve as a balancing element in those sorts of packages."
The move to raise personal tax rates seems to be continuing even as states are beginning to see tax collections from sales and services revive along with the economy. Many states have already raised, or are considering raising, taxes on cigarettes, soft drinks or alcohol. If Congress adopts the President's plan to raise tax rates, that would automatically result in tax increases in three states -- North Dakota, Vermont and Rhode Island -- whose rates are directly linked to Federal rates.
Currently, a two-income couple with two children and a gross income of at least $200,000 pays about $40,808 in Federal taxes, according to a new study by the Minnesota Department of Revenue. In New York, a similar family paid another $13,309 in state taxes. New Jersey's top rate is 7 percent, but in Connecticut, where the income tax is relatively new, the top rate is 4.5 percent.
 
Problems Go Beyond Recession
 The strains on state and city budgets go beyond the recent recession. Medicaid, education and prisons eat up ever-larger portions of state and local spending. And business tax revenue stopped growing even before the recession started.
In addition, some states -- Alabama, Missouri and Oregon among them -- face imminent court decisions on school financing that may result in more mandated spending.
"What's driving the trend is frustration with the inability to fund state services," said James Papke, director of the Center for Tax Policy Studies at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. "In the Midwest taxes are still a bad word. But in many cases the budget situation is so severe that they're going to have to look on the tax side."
In Indiana, where Gov. Evan Bayh, a Democrat, recently proposed deep cuts in Medicaid, some legislators have talked about introducing a new 5 percent tax rate as an alternative to the cuts or to an increase in the state sales tax.
Another reason for raising state taxes is the growing sense among voters that the affluent should pick up a bigger share of the tax burden.
"People used to talk about economic growth and efficiency in taxation," said Professor Papke. "Now people don't just look at the effect on business or the economy but on the burden on the poor and middle class."
 
Disappointment With Changes
 Finally, there is a feeling that the tax changes of the 1980's produced disappointing results. The Reagan Administration's notion that lower tax rates would increase savings and investment was not borne out, and now the thinking is drifting back toward employing special preferences, or loopholes, to influence saving and investment decisions.
"In the 1980's, economic development strategy was to reduce taxes on the wealthy and the upper-middle class," said Ronald Snell at the National Conference of State Legislatures. "That assumption may be in question, and if it is, it makes it easier to raise incomes."
Nonetheless, economists point out, several forces are likely to inhibit states, preventing a return to the super-high rates that prevailed in the late 1970's. For one thing, unlike Washington, states have to worry about becoming uncompetitive vis-a-vis their neighbors.
"When you get too far out of line you have to be concerned about the impact of taxes on decisions about where to locate," said Robert Cline, director of Tax Research at the Minnesota Department of Revenue.
More important, the affluent are likely to fight back.
"They have lobbies," said Mr. Phillips, the political consultant. "The politicians in legislatures are going to hear from these people. They know they're a target, and they will fight these packages at a state level."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 6, 1993, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A chart on March 21 with an article about changes in state taxes for affluent people omitted the year on which the data were based. It was 1991. Thus the chart only partly reflected the effect of the 4.5 percent income tax phased in by Connecticut in 1991. In later years, a typical Connecticut couple earning $200,000 a year would owe $9,000 -- not $3,000 -- in state and local taxes, close to what similar couples pay in Georgia, Kentucky and Virginia.

THE CATHOLIC ETHIC AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM
By Michael Novak.
334 pp. New York: The Free Press. $24.95. 
 ELEVEN years ago, Michael Novak set out in "The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism" to prove that capitalism "rightly understood" is compatible with Roman Catholic social doctrine. This was no small achievement, given the modern papacy's century-old suspicion of capitalism as the invention of Protestant individualism, and Mr. Novak, once a self-declared "social democrat," found himself something of a pariah among American Catholicism's liberal intelligentsia. Never mind that Catholic higher education in the United States, led by the Jesuits' urban universities, pioneered the creation of undergraduate schools of commerce in order to facilitate the passage of immigrant Catholics into business. Never mind that by the 1980's Catholics were as likely as Protestants to be heads of major corporations, or to vote for Republicans. Mr. Novak's sin, if sin it be, was to bring a convert's enthusiasm to capitalism's entrepreneurial spirit, and to confer a lay theologian's blessings on it. Worse, in his critics' eyes, he did all this from the sheltered confines of the American Enterprise Institute, a not-for-profit Washington think tank financed by captains of industry.
In essence, Mr. Novak argued that democratic capitalism is morally superior to socialism: that the triangular nexus of a market economy, a democratic polity and a pluralistic culture not only produces a higher standard of living but is also more consonant with Christian values than the command economies and socialistic policies of Eastern Europe. What he couldn't do was square his conclusions with the received wisdom of his own religious tradition. Paul VI, Pope from 1963 to 1978, was no friend of American capitalism or of multinational corporations, and John Paul II, at that point, was advocating (with his Polish homeland very much in mind) a modified form of socialism: workers sharing in the ownership of productive means while state planners insure a just distribution of goods and services. Rome, Mr. Novak concluded, still had much to learn from the American experience in political economy.
Socialism is now history in Eastern Europe, and John Paul II himself has embraced market economics with an ardor that signals a new departure in papal social thought. Mr. Novak's hour has come round at last: his earlier book has become not only a primer for Poland's post-Communist intellectuals but also a major influence on John Paul II, a fellow Slav with whom Mr. Novak has been known to dine at the Vatican and to whom he dedicates this book.
In his latest volume, "The Catholic Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism," Mr. Novak reiterates the substance of his previous arguments, but angles them in new directions. Now that the Pope (in his 1991 encyclical "Centesimus Annus") agrees with his way of thinking, Mr. Novak wants to set the historical record straight. Max Weber was wrong, he writes, to suppose that capitalism depends for moral legitimation on the ascetic Protestant spirit. In any case, it is now Catholicism's turn to provide the necessary ethics for grounding and applying capitalism's wealth-producing magic, especially in the heavily Catholic countries of Eastern Europe and Latin America.
In Mr. Novak's view, Catholic ethics brings two dowries to its betrothal to capitalism: an appreciation for "social dimensions of the free economy" and a rich understanding of human inventiveness and creativity, which he celebrates as "the spirit of capitalism."
By the first, he means businesses and other voluntary associations that capitalism necessarily brings into existence in order to produce goods, services and profits. In calling attention to these associations, Mr. Novak hopes to show that capitalism is inherently social, not individualistic; that by nourishing the development of institutions and the personal virtues (of thrift, honesty and practical wisdom) necessary to sustain them, capitalism enriches the social and moral life of its constituents.
By the second, Mr. Novak means that capitalism is fundamentally as much an exercise in human creativity as are literature, science and the arts. Imagination, it should be said, has long been a central concern in Mr. Novak's writings on theology, philosophy, education, literature and sports. But now that John Paul II has declared that all workers are called to be "co-creators" with God, Mr. Novak is moved to declare that "in fact, the true moral strength of capitalism lies in its promotion of human creativity," and that a democratic capitalist society, however imperfect, is "perhaps the most responsive to the social implications of the Gospels yet developed by the human race."
This is theological cheerleading of the baldest type. Mr. Novak has never worked in the milieu he romanticizes. His book says nothing about the disruptions to family life demanded of ambitious executives; of the ruthless dispatch of colleagues by competitors on the way up the corporate ladder; of American workers displaced by companies in search of cheaper, foreign labor; of the get-rich-quick ethics of Wall Street; of the blindness of the marketplace to values that transcend its own. Like John Paul II himself, Mr. Novak glamorizes work at the expense of leisure; surely much of what passes for a career, in professions no less than in business, is high-paid toil of dubious personal or social value. To be sure, Mr. Novak insists that the capitalist spirit must be chastened by a culture informed by higher values. And now that capitalism is the only game in town, that might be his most important message. Certainly he is right in declaring that the church has a special obligation to help inspire private enterprise in the emerging economies of Eastern Europe and in the submerged economies of Latin America. But as he himself argues, capitalism is mother of its own inventions; in biblical language, its spirit bloweth where it will. In the past, the popes may indeed have been blind to capitalism's considerable merits. But they did well to insist that this modern genie be tethered once it is outside its bottle.

HEADLINE: At Tilles, It's Come to the Cabaret

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
HOW to describe the experience of cabaret performing?
To Craig Carnelia it is an innermost thing, "a journey through a life." 
 Andrea Marcovicci describes it as "the most personal expression of a performer's heart and soul and accumulated knowledge."
"It's what I always wanted to do," Mary Cleere Haran said, "sing and talk about movie songs of the 30's and 40's to a roomful of people as obsessed with great songs as I am."
Ms. Marcovicci sings old and new songs, including Mr. Carnelia's, and has an array of acts at the ready, all "tailor-made to the occasion."
Mr. Carnelia sings his own songs, which concentrate on character and context and have lately become more personal in their explorations of emotions, delicate imagery and musical structure.
 
Renaissance in Recital Hall
 With their distinct styles, the three performers are at the forefront of a flourishing cabaret renaissance in Manhattan. All are scheduled to appear in the second half of Club T, a concept and not a hot spot, in the Hillwood Recital Hall at Tilles Center on the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in Brookville.
Mr. Carnelia will perform on Friday, Ms. Marcovicci in a Jerome Kern evening on April 17 and Ms. Haran on May 15. The shows begin at 8:30 and 10:30 P.M.
The concept, of course, is cabaret, "an art form onto itself," Ms. Marcovicci said. It is also an adventurous one, for it is a new subscription series for audiences accustomed to classical concerts and recitals. Yet starting with Club T's first show, in November, a Gershwin revue with seven Broadway performers, cabaret has been a hit. All 8:30 shows have been sold out by subscription.
Given the luster of the first two soloists in the series of six events -- Karen Akers in January and Julie Wilson last month -- it is clear that top-of-the-line cabaret is the newest form of entertainment to make an impact on the Island, where year-round professional Actors Equity playhouses have all but vanished. Thus, cabaret becomes a viable alternative to theater, especially in a theater without the clutter of ice cubes and dishes.
"Taking the cabaret artists out of the clubs and putting them into the theater" is precisely the mission of the American Cabaret Theater, an organization in Manhattan devoted to promoting cabaret as an art form. "It's still too new to the general public," said Peter Ligeti, who founded the group 14 months ago. Mr. Ligeti has produced cabaret shows at the John Drew Theater in East Hampton, the latest featuring Mr. Carnelia.
It took five years for cabaret to arrive on the Island with such a classy lineup. After a 20th-anniversary production of "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris," which starred Ms. Akers in January 1988, the 491-seat Hillwood, usually used for student activities, was given over to chamber music, children's theater and now-and-then performances, one by Elly Stone and another by Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
Last fall John Aulbach, then the production manager of Tilles, thought up the term "Club T." "And it caught on," said the director of the center, Elliott Sroka. "We had to add 10:30 shows, and they are attracting mostly single-ticket buyers who might not come here otherwise. They're generally a younger audience."
 
'It's a Special World'
 He added that cabaret "creates the atmosphere of sophistication and drama without layers, without extra stuff, without redundant spectacle, without barriers."
"It's focused on human reality -- direct feelings, ideas, contact," Mr. Sroka said. "It's a special world. And it's about virtuosity, technique and excellent musicianship. So it's natural for audiences used to classical music to cross over to cabaret."
Mr. Carnelia, who was born in Floral Park, added: "Now that it's been introduced on the Island, cabaret needs to be defined not in a Las Vegas vein. It is theater at its most intimate and intense, when it really cooks. Then it's nothing except a song and a singer, and that singer can take you on a trip, invite you in if he or she is truly in the song. But when it's bad, it can be like someone putting on a show in a garage."
Jack Globenfelt of Garden City, who is producing Club T and owns two record labels, Cabaret and Elba, said: "Cabaret demands that you sit there and listen, and this is the time for it on Long Island. People don't want to traipse into Manhattan to see performers they hear about."
"The revues like the Gershwin are more costly, complex and require more rehearsals and space, but bringing the best cabaret artists to the Island has to be continued," Mr. Sroka said. "This is a new culture otherwise unavailable. But can we come up with another series as powerful as this one? We have to be careful and selective, but we know this is a major art form of the 90's and it has to continue. Our sponsor, Banfi Vintners of Old Brookville, has confirmed that it will. We don't have to worry about economics based on food and drink. With two shows playing back to back, it can be self-sustaining."
No doubt about it. Island audiences who want to go to the professional theater can come to the cabaret. As theater.

HEADLINE: Parking Lots, Reborn as Beauty Spots

BYLINE: By ARTHUR Z. KAMIN

DATELINE: FREEHOLD

 BODY:
PARKING lots do not have to look like parking lots. They can be bathed in greenery. They can be havens for bicycle riders. They can have pedestrian walkways, shops and museums.
Passers-by may even have to look twice to see the cars in a parking lot. And when the vehicles are gone, a lot can take on another role, as a park or marketplace. 
It's all possible, and that was the message the Monmouth County Planning Board wanted to get across with its 32-page booklet called "Not for Cars Only -- A Guide to Innovative Parking Lot Design," published in October. It's turned out to be something of a smash.
Most of the 500 copies printed were gone by December, snapped up at $6 a copy, mainly by municipal officials, planners and developers, and the demand for more has led the county planners to order a second printing.
"Little did we realize we had a best seller on our hands," said Harriet Strickler, a senior planner for the county, who compiled the guide with Louise Allen, head of the board's general planning section.
The booklet was based largely on "Carscape," a 1988 parking handbook published by the Irwin-Sweeney-Miller Foundation in Columbus, Ind., that contains ideas generated by a competition sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts.
"Designers have typically been allowed to plan unattractive parking lots, which stand in striking contrast to the well-designed structures they serve," Ms. Strickler said. "Generally, ordinances require a few feet of grass along the lot's perimeter and little or no greenery inside the lot."
The Monmouth booklet began modestly and with little fanfare, intended to help governing bodies and planners in the county's 53 municipalities, who had asked for help in making their towns more attractive.
Starting with a historical perspective -- Julius Caesar's solution to parking problems was to ban chariots from Rome's central business district -- the guide defines today's problems, noting that parking lots tend to be crowded eyesores. It suggests solutions including hiding parking lots behind facades of buildings and trees and dividing large lots into smaller, more attractive pieces.
Demand for the guide was stimulated when it won two important awards -- from the New Jersey Chapter of the American Planning Association and the New Jersey Planning Officials, a group of planning and zoning board members. Both awards praised the project's contributions to the planning process.
 
Vine-Covered Parking
 The booklet is filled with illustrations of landscaping options. In one, a canopy of vines forms a leafy roof over an entire parking lot. Another shows a vine-covered trellis enclosure surrounding a lot.
Requests for the booklet have been received from all over the state. "I'm ordering 30 copies," said Robert E. Rosa, a professional planner and a landscape architect in Woodbridge, Middlesex County, and a consultant to the Planning Board and Zoning Board of Adjustment in Rahway, which is working to revitalize its downtown business district.
"Good parking is going to be a key element of this project," Mr. Rosa said. "I want everyone on the task force to see the parking lot guide. I think it can help us in Rahway."
Mr. Rosa said he was enthusiastic about landscaping in and around parking lots.
"I think the trees, the flowers, the shrubbery and the landscaping give people peace of mind," he said. "It's like when people go for a walk in the woods. For a few minutes they are taken out of the city." He does not see a security problem in landscaped parking lots, he added.
Anton Nelessen, an associate professor in the department of urban planning and policy development at Rutgers University in New Brunswick and a private planner in Princeton, served as a consultant in the booklet's preparation. He said he was happy to learn that the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which operates the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, had requested several copies.
"That's one of the worst-looking parking lots in the state of New Jersey," he said. "A sea of asphalt sameness. They've got a lot of work to do there." He cited Disney World in Orlando, Fla., as an example of what parking lots should look like at a large entertainment complex.
John Samerjan, the sports authority's director of public affairs, said that "looks are not the important thing" in the Meadowlands lots, which can handle 25,000 vehicles but sometimes must cope with 30,000 for Giants games.
"We want our lots to be safe, and we want them to function well," he said, noting that as a public agency, the authority might not be able to afford landscaping for its lots.
But he added that the sports complex was "in the business of hosting guests," and that the Monmouth parking booklet could contain some tips for the Meadowlands planners.
Mr. Nelessen, who has been at Rutgers for 19 years and has been a consultant to design projects throughout the nation and in Europe, including the redevelopment of whole downtown business districts, said: "A parking lot is very often the first thing you see in a town. It should create a positive image."
 
Company's Design Praised
 He gives high marks to the parking design at Johnson & Johnson's headquarters in New Brunswick, saying the company "solves potential parking problems with generous landscaping." He said the lots were totally screened from view, including one parking deck that had been incorporated into an old stone wall.
Noting that surface parking covers as much as 30 percent of the downtown area in some towns, Ms. Strickler and Mrs. Allen said that improving the lots was critical. They wrote in the guide that "the solutions presented can be used to humanize the scale and eliminate the visual monotony generally associated with parking lot design."
Lighting, signs and security are covered in the booklet, along with examples of local parking ordinances that show how to encourage improvements.
But not everybody is so enthusiastic about these new frontiers in parking. Harold Gottesman, chief executive of the Edison Parking Corporation, based in Newark, said he had not seen the guide and wasn't sure he wanted to.
 
Shrubbery as 'Wasted Space'
 "From a business point of view, all that shrubbery is wasted space," said Mr. Gottesman, whose company owns and manages 175 parking complexes nationwide, including about 25 surface lots in downtown Newark. "It's not productive. Space is at a premium -- especially in cities. Our customers want fast and safe service. That's what we try to give them."
Mr. Gottesman said attempts to beautify Newark parking lots had not been successful. "Urban settings don't always provide the best growing environment," he said. "And it's tough to maintain all those plants."
The guide received good marks from Mel Israel, president of an architectural and planning concern in Tinton Falls, where he is president of the local Business and Professional Association.
"It's time many municipalities came to grips with parking design concept in the 1990's," said Mr. Israel, who is also chairman of the Economic Development Commission in Highlands, also in Monmouth County. "We build parking lots for the Christmas shopping season. The rest of the time most of the lots are empty."
He also said many local ordinances required individual parking spaces that were too big. "Many towns want 10 feet by 20 feet," he said. "Nine feet by 18 feet would do -- and even 8 feet by 17 feet. Everyone doesn't drive a Lincoln."
Further praise for the guide came from Richard Cramer, a planner with T & M Associates, a planning and engineering firm in Middletown, Monmouth County, that serves municipalities throughout the state.
"Parking lots have gone out of control," he said. "They have become a big no man's land -- uninviting and unattractive."
He said he applauded any attempt to encourage more landscaping and to beautify the lots. "In the long run, developers will be saving money," he said. "Believe me, some shrubs and trees and landscaping won't make or break a project. Some of the better developers realize this."
Ms. Strickler and Mrs. Allen may begin to see the fruits of their labor soon, as they look out of their Planning Department offices in Freehold, the Monmouth County seat. Working with Guy Leighton, a planner and landscape architect in the county transportation section, they are providing free advice to the borough's downtown revitalization effort, being coordinated by the Freehold Partnership, which includes residents, businesses and local and county government.
 
Taking Ideas from Guide
 William J. Mehr, a Freehold lawyer and partnership president, said one parking lot in Freehold, across from the County Hall of Records, would include some of the concepts from the guide.
Plans also are being drawn for the Market Yard parking lot, in the central business district, which would harmonize with a series of promenades and sidewalk cafes.
"We want our parking lots to be user-friendly, to have an abundance of green areas and to blend right in with and link up with the community," Mr. Mehr said. "We want friendly parking lots -- the gateway to our business district."

HEADLINE: New Venture Delivers Success (and Dinner)

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: RYE

 BODY:
RAIN, snow and gloom of night are the elements most prized by the owners of Cuisine on Call here, a company that has built a business by delivering restaurant meals to homes and offices.
"The worse the weather, the better for our business," said Sheryl B. Lutsky, who started the business in October with her partner, Deena S. Grotto. "But what's most important is the repeat business we're getting that has nothing to do with weather, so we feel we've found a niche for ourselves." 
 Cuisine on Call takes orders and delivers for 36 restaurants in the Sound Shore area. "In giving them a delivery service, we're able to do something that would be too expensive and take too much time for the individual restaurants to do successfully on their own," Mrs. Lutsky said.
Customers receive a dining guide containing menus from the restaurants. "The variety is tremendous, 14 different cuisines including French, Mexican and Indian," Mrs. Grotto said. She added that the idea for the business grew from the partners' own desires for delivered meals beyond pizza and Chinese food.
Mrs. Grotto's husband, Robert, a former textile executive and now a consultant to Cuisine on Call, devised the company's business plan.
"Deena and I had the idea in mind when we moved here from Chicago 14 years ago," he said. "In Chicago there are restaurants of all sorts that deliver, but when we moved to Tarrytown and the kitchen in the house we bought was out of commission for about two weeks, we found when we started calling restaurants we could not find any in the area that delivered. I remembered thinking, 'Here's a good business opportunity for someone.' But we never did anything about it. I was running a textile company, and Deena was teaching a special-education class."
 
'We Missed That Convenience'
 But the idea arose again last summer, Mr. Grotto said.
"We were spending the weekend with friends in Great Neck, L.I., and they were raving about a new restaurant service out there called Eatin' In," he said. "They called, and half an hour later we were eating really good Mexican food on their patio. That did it. We got back home, and Deena called Sheryl, and she and her husband, Ira, who are friends and neighbors of ours in Rye Brook, kicked around the idea."
Mrs. Lutsky, who says she has always been interested in food and caters parties as favors for friends, was enthusiastic.
"We used to live in Manhattan, where you can get everything delivered, and we missed that convenience," she said. "So Deena and I, with our husbands supporting the idea, started a market-research program consisting of going to restaurants. It was very pleasurable. We knew if our business was to be successful, we had to have good restaurants."
Ten pounds later, "we had eaten very well, and we had developed a solid business plan," Mrs. Lutsky said. "We were encouraged by the reception we got from some of the best restaurants in the county. They thought enough of our idea to sign six-month contracts with us."
 
Start-Up Costs Underestimated
 Cuisine on Call opened officially on Halloween 1992.
"All things considered, the launch went pretty smoothly," Mr. Grotto said. "As with most entrepreneurial enterprises, the start-up costs were more than anticipated. Originally, we thought we could swing it on an investment of $15,000, but we ended up investing $40,000 -- half from us and the other half from the Lutskys." Most of the start-up money went for printing a dining guide and for computers to process orders, he said.
Customers can get sushi from Noda's Japanese Steak House and Sushi Bar in White Plains, spending approximately $25 for two, or a 14-ounce fillet mignon with baked potato or rice from the Willet House in Port Chester, spending approximately $50 for two, delivered hot in insulated bags by a driver-waiter in a tuxedo shirt.
"For someone who was computer illiterate when we began this operation, I've become very proficient in processing orders," Mrs. Lutsky said. When a customer calls, the order is entered into a custom-designed computer program that sends the order to the restaurant by fax. "A dispatcher of ours, using two-way radio, coordinates the order with one of our drivers with the restaurant for the pickup and delivery," she said.
 
Drivers Are an Essential Factor
 Customers pay the driver either by credit card or cash, and the prices are the same as at the restaurants, plus a $3 delivery charge, "not per meal but per restaurant," Mrs. Grotto said. "The driver also unpacks the food and puts it on the table."
Good drivers, who know their way around Westchester's streets, are essential to the success of the business, she said.
"That was a big headache, trying to find the right ones," she recalled. "I remember the first ad we ran for drivers brought us more than 100 replies from out-of-work executives, former real estate brokers, even bankers -- and they were all looking for work, which I think says something about the economy. But this is essentially a part-time job, and through trial and error we found the best people suited to our hours were college students.
"We now have a cadre of 20 of them, from SUNY, Westchester Community College, Iona and Marymount, and they are all independent contractors who use their own cars to make deliveries. The restaurants pack the food in their own insulated containers, which are sealed tight until they are opened in front of the customer."
 
Where's the House Number?
 Because of Westchester's haphazard system of numbering houses, difficulties can arise. "Drivers are told, 'It's the large white house halfway down the block,' or, 'You will find our name on the tree,' " Mrs. Lutsky said. "But even with the obstacles, deliveries are made within the hour. You quickly get to know customers on a first-name basis, especially the regulars who will ask: 'What's good for dinner? What do you suggest?' just as if they were in a restaurant."
The company makes between 50 and 80 deliveries a day.
The partners said they hoped to develop more corporate business -- delivering to individuals at offices and catering parties.
"We catered an Around the World luncheon for 55 people last week at Seagram's Conference Center on Corporate Drive in White Plains," Mrs. Grotto said. "The food came from six different restaurants, including Indian, Mexican and Chinese. We supplied the plates and the utensils and set up the food in chafing dishes. This type of volume business is very desirable for us, and we'd like to generate more of it."
The partners said they had not yet drawn salaries.
"We are expanding, but we have not had to add to our original investment, which we think is good," Mrs. Lutsky said. "The money that we make is going right back into growing the company."

HEADLINE: When Being An Old Hand Becomes A Handicap

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
BRACING himself against a wintry blast that whipped across the platform at Greystone Station here one recent morning, Roy Podorson waited with the throngs of commuters for the next express train to Manhattan. The silver-haired advertising executive, who has been out of work for seven months, was continuing to make the rounds -- sending out resumes, phoning prospective employers and scheduling interviews.
Mr. Podorson -- 52 and vying with many aggressive younger workers -- said he was undaunted by a stiffly competitive job market and an economy that is, at best, merely crawling out of the recession. 
 Although his spirits sometimes flag, Mr. Podorson -- who swims seven miles a week -- said his stamina continues to be like that of a much younger man. "Some days I don't know how I keep going, but I do," he said. "I'm like an Energizer battery."
As an art director, Mr. Podorson designed the block-long Camel cigarette sign in Times Square and handled accounts for Sony, Volvo and Perdue chickens, among others. And he believes that his creativity, honed by years of experience, will eventually prevail over job seekers many years his junior, who often come with a lower price tag.
To the north, in Somers, Thomas R. Thyne -- an engineer with New York Telephone in Valhalla for 24 years -- is also out of work. Like Mr. Podorson, he is finding the business of looking for a new job frustrating, and at times, disheartening. In his field, too, younger workers appear to have an advantage, he said.
Mr. Thyne, who is 46, said he felt betrayed four months ago when he learned that his services with the phone company were no longer needed. "I planned to be there for life," he said. "And then I found myself sitting across from a 25-year-old supervisor who was telling me that I didn't have a job anymore."
Mr. Thyne has joined a long list of plaintiffs who are suing New York Telephone and its parent, the Nynex Corporation, for job discrimination. The former workers are charging that the companies terminated their employment in violation of the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the New York Human Rights Law.
 
'I Was Not a Bad Employee'
 "What I want most," said Mr. Thyne, who is divorced and raising two teen-age children, "is an acknowledgement that they wronged me; I was not a bad employee."
The suit claims that New York Telephone discharged Mr. Thyne and hundreds of other employees last Dec. 11 as a result of a reduction-in-force plan that discriminated against workers 40 years or older because of "a corporate culture disfavoring older employees."
Judith P. Vladeck, a lawyer with Vladeck, Waldman, Elias & Engelhard, a Manhattan firm handling the class-action suit, said: "This whole youth cult thing is a dreadful mistake. And, unfortunately, with corporate restructurings we are going to be seeing more and more older workers who are scrapped."
The American Association of Retired Persons, in Washington, reported that it has seen an increasing number of complaints from older workers as companies cut back.
Examples of age bias, said Sally Dunaway, a staff lawyer for the association's worker equity department, include an older worker who traditionally received high job-performance ratings, then begins to get "fair" or "poor" evaluations and finally is discharged, a long-time employee who is no longer invited to staff meetings, the worker who has responsibilities taken away, or an older employee who is transferred to a division where there are likely to be layoffs.
Telephone company spokesmen denied that employees' ages influenced who was laid off last year. Henry Gomez, staff director for media relations at Nynex, said no one group had been singled out during the recent cutbacks, in accordance with a strict company policy forbidding that.
"It is important to our bottom line that we have a diverse work force to reflect our diverse customer base," Mr. Gomez said. "That's just smart business policy."
But experts in the human resources field, many of whom are working with older employees who have lost their jobs, said that despite what companies say publicly, they are motivated by economic reasons to shed older workers who often command larger salaries and are in line for expensive retirement packages.
 
Incentives Not Based on Age
 "The 40-to-60-year-olds are especially vulnerable when it comes to layoffs," said Joan D. Learn, president of the Greenwich Group, a Connecticut-based consulting company specializing in outplacement services for corporations in Westchester and Fairfield Counties. "Let's face it: they cost more."
Like Mr. Gomez at Nynex, other spokesmen at large corporations in the county denied that age discrimination was a factor in layoffs or that it influenced who was offered early retirement packages.
At the International Business Machines Corporation, for example, John Boudreaux said his company's efforts to reduce its work force by offering incentive packages had little to do with age.
"I can't speak for corporate America in general, but our packages are for all ages and all skills, for people who may wish to leave the company for a variety of reasons," the I.B.M. spokesman said. "To describe them as early retirement packages only or packages for just older workers would be innacurate."
 
'An Enormously Difficult Adjustment'
 But he added that it was "only natural" that such packages appealed to older workers, because a 30-year-old employee, for example, would not have accrued enough time on the job to earn substantial retirement benefits.
William J. Adock, a 48-year-old former director of finance and planning at I.B.M., recently took advantage of an incentive package that left him with a year's salary and lifetime benefits. "After 23 years with the company, I felt there would be more opportunity out there for challenge," said the Pound Ridge resident, who was earning "in the low six figures" before he left.
Even if age discrimination is not a factor, and whatever the reasons for leaving a job -- layoffs or enticements -- finding new employment has been a difficult business for many older workers.
"It's traumatic, an enormously difficult adjustment," said David B. Opton, executive director of Exec-U-Net, a Weston-based job search and career management information network.
"If you lose a job at 30, so what?" Mr. Opton said. "But with two kids in college, it's a different ball game altogether."
 
Dropping Out of the Work Force
 For Mr. Adock, whose children are grown but who is still paying off the mortgage on a large house on 9.5 acres, life outside I.B.M. has not been as easy as he thought it would be. Like Mr. Podorson and Mr. Thyne, the former I.B.M. executive said he was finding the job market "very, very slow."
Michael Simon, president of Michael Simon Associates, a career transition and outplacement firm in Valhalla, said, "There are declining curves in hiring all over, but for older workers, it's even worse."
At the State Labor Department, a regional economist, Frank M. Surdey, reported that many older workers were simply dropping out of the work force. "These are the discouraged workers," he said, "those who believe there are no jobs available for them."
Although the national average unemployment rate in 1992 for workers in the 45-to-54-year-old bracket was lower than for all workers -- 5.1 percent compared with 7.4 percent -- the figures do not reflect the number of workers who are no longer looking for work, Mr. Surdey said.
Mr. Simon in Valhalla recommended that older workers upgrade their skills for what has become an increasingly technological workplace.
 
Looking at Other Options
 "Age won't matter much if a worker keeps developing skills of value," he said. "It is not just a matter of a youth cult. People have to keep up with the times."
At the Greenwich Group, Ms. Learn said she was counseling older workers, especially former executives and managers, to begin looking at other options.
Some older workers, she said, are taking jobs with smaller companies that are looking for experienced leaders.
Others, like Mr. Thyne and Mr. Adock, are considering the possibility of starting their own businesses.
"I had to ask myself, 'Do I really want to go back to corporate America?' " said Mr. Thyne, who recently decided to use his severance package, including nine months' pay, to open a restaurant. "Maybe it's time to use other talents and seek fame and fortune in a different way," he said.
 
An Eye Toward Modeling
 For Mr. Adock, who uses the secretarial, networking, counseling and other outplacement services of the Greenwich Group, the solution, he said, may be purchasing a small manufacturing company.
And for Mr. Podorson, the alternative may be a career in modeling. Although he said that his first choice is to land a job as a senior art director again, he has also registered with model agencies in several cities. In a recent project completed for a computer graphics course that he took to upgrade his skills, he designed a book jacket that read, "The Hilarious Story of Roy Podorson, Art Director for Over 20 Years Turned Model."
"All of this is pretty serious business," he said. "But you still have to keep your sense of humor, or at least develop one if you didn't have it before. Laughter definitely is the best medicine."
Those interested in the Association of Retired Persons' free pamphlet "Age Discrimination on the Job" should write to A.A.R.P.-Fulfillment, 601 E Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20049.
The Westchester County Office for the Aging runs two programs for low- and middle-income workers to help place them in jobs in government and business. For more information, the number to call is 682-3000.

HEADLINE: Roosevelt Unbound

BYLINE: By Robert Dallek; Robert Dallek is the author of "Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy, 1932-1945" and, most recently, "Lone Star Rising: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1908-1960."

FDR
Into the Storm 1937-1940: A History.
By Kenneth S. Davis.
691 pp. New York:
Random House. $35. 
 TWO hundred and seventeen years after our declaration of independence from royal rule, America's preoccupation with its Presidents, their wives and their children suggests a longing for a royal family that can bring us together and promote national well-being. At the same time, as good egalitarians in an age of anything-goes journalism, we enjoy hearing the intimate details of our leaders' lives -- and the more sensational the better. A dignified former high official I recently interviewed for a biography of Lyndon B. Johnson began our conversation with a bit of what he called "human-interest detail that biographers crave." Did I know, he asked, that Johnson had never been circumcised? "No," I muttered, wondering what possible use he thought I could make of this "revelation" in a volume on Johnson's Presidential years.
To Kenneth S. Davis's credit, his fourth and penultimate volume on Franklin D. Roosevelt spares us excursions into the 32d President's sex life. Not that he shuns the private man; he has plenty to say about Roosevelt's moods and health and about his relationships with Eleanor, his children, and his associates and friends, but all with an eye to explaining the frustrations, agonies and occasional triumphs of Roosevelt's second term. Besides, as Mr. Davis says in a note about his sources, this study "is concerned less with the discovery and presentation of hitherto hidden facts about Franklin Roosevelt and his years than it is with comprehending in interpretive ways, and from a clearly defined point of view, factual information that has long been at hand in vast bulk."
Yet what makes "FDR: Into the Storm 1937-1940" distinctive is not the interpretations or the "clearly defined point of view," which seem all too familiar, but rather the mass of detail on all the major and many minor events of Roosevelt's second term. Here, in a richer recounting than we have ever had before, are the domestic struggles to sustain and expand the New Deal, the effort to pack the Supreme Court, the attempted purge of conservative Democrats, the successful battles over the wages-and-hours, farm tenancy and housing bills, and the victorious 1940 re-election campaign against Wendell Willkie. Nor does Mr. Davis slight foreign affairs; he recounts in even greater detail American responses to the crises in Spain, China and Czechoslovakia, and later throughout Europe with the outbreak of World War II.
There is an almost encyclopedic quality to Mr. Davis's narrative that will fascinate scholars and aficionados of Roosevelt, but will probably be more than any general reader, even one keenly interested in Presidential biography, will care to read. If Mr. Davis had confined himself to reconstructing in voluminous detail Roosevelt's maneuvering through the various political, economic and international crises of these years, his biography might have been more palatable than it is. But the lengthy background descriptions of the Spanish Civil War, the Munich crisis of 1938 and the development of atomic physics, to give just three examples, are more distracting than enthralling. No one wants the life without the times, but there are degrees and degrees.
Mr. Davis's affinity for the big picture, for all the background detail, might have made more sense if he saw it as essential to explaining Roosevelt's many difficulties. But that is not so. Mr. Davis's Roosevelt in the years 1937-40 is not a man plagued by uncontrollable events at home and abroad, but a stumbling political leader who miscalculated in domestic affairs and exercised excessive caution in foreign ones.
The analysis of the fight over the Supreme Court in 1937 illustrates the point. Roosevelt's landslide victory in the 1936 election, Mr. Davis asserts, encouraged in him "an egotistical mood, a sense of omnipotence, that was far less conducive to sober thought than it was to a willful assertiveness, a reckless disregard of opposition."
"Corrupted by a heady sense of limitless power," Mr. Davis says, the President at the start of his second term moved to overcome the Supreme Court's anti-New Deal, pro-business decisions of the previous two years. Roosevelt's method was a subterfuge: he proposed adding up to six justices to the Supreme Court as a means, he explained, not to rescue and expand the New Deal but to make the Court more efficient. Historians generally agree that Roosevelt was too clever by half, and that he miscalculated badly in assuming that he had the political muscle to alter the size of the Court. But to see him as carried away by excessive egotism, as Mr. Davis does, diminishes the importance of his intense concern with salvaging the New Deal and advancing the cause of those who were "ill housed, ill clad and ill nourished."
Similarly, Mr. Davis sees the failure of the United States to lead or join a collective security action against Japan in 1937, after its renewed aggression in China, as due principally to Roosevelt's inadequate leadership. More specifically, Mr. Davis believes that Roosevelt had the opportunity to press the case for a renewed internationalism after the public's strong positive reaction to his "quarantine the aggressors" speech in October 1937. In Mr. Davis's view the President could have "worked against the disastrous 'appeasement' policy of the British and French, while preparing and easing the way of the democracies toward the kind of collective action that was ultimately required for the survival of Western civilization." But Mr. Davis finds that a lack of "requisite resolve, nerve, energy and clarity of mind" combined with Roosevelt's "isolationist sentiments" to deter him from leading the nation onto a new path in foreign affairs.
YET Mr. Davis concedes that the favorable response to the President's speech largely centered on his denunciation of aggressor nations, and that only a distinct minority in the United States wanted a more active policy. He thinks that Roosevelt missed a chance to use the influential leaders of this minority to convert a majority of Americans to collective security. But given the bitter and lengthy struggle Roosevelt had to make in the more perilous conditions of 1939-41 to drag the country toward involvement in the war, the author's conclusion seems dubious at best.
Mr. Davis's opinion of Roosevelt as a poor leader extends to his actions on everything from the recession of 1937-38 to the Nazi threat of 1939-40. No one familiar with Roosevelt's performance in these years would argue that he was without serious shortcomings. But Mr. Davis's picture of a cautious, ineffective leader is overdrawn, giving too little weight to the restraints on Roosevelt's powers and the limited but striking gains of his second term. The Farm Security Administration, the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Wagner-Steagall Housing Act stand along with the President's success in aiding Britain's fight against Hitler in 1939-40 as achievements any President would be proud to claim.
Mr. Davis's massive biography, despite its many questionable judgments, will take its place in the Roosevelt literature as a standard against which other, more sympathetic historians will have to argue. More important, it will be an enduring tribute to the significance of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the history of the 20th century. For as Mr. Davis himself says, we cannot understand the contemporary United States and the world without reference to Roosevelt's decisions "during the 12 crisis years in which he, as President of the United States, occupied a pivotal position in world affairs."

DON'T ASK
By Donald E. Westlake.
327 pp. New York:
The Mysterious Press. $18.95. 
 DONALD E. WESTLAKE has written his eighth novel featuring the ingenious and larcenous John Dortmunder and his familiar gang of thieves -- the picklock Andy Kelp, the driver Stan Murch and the mammoth Tiny Bulcher. Together they occupy an almost fairy tale world of New York crime in which genuine evil seems to have no place. It is small potatoes, small beer, crime as operetta -- with blundering forces matching wits and half-wits for minuscule economic gain. In this era of thrillers about serial killers and child molesters, Mr. Westlake's psychology-free capers are balm for the nerves. "Don't Ask" is one of his best.
This latest Dortmunder adventure has a particularly outlandish and lighthearted plot that revolves around the competing efforts of two rival and newly misbegotten Eastern European nations, Tsergovia and Votskojek, to gain admittance to the United Nations. There is literally a bone of contention, the 800-year-old femur of the martyred St. Ferghana, a medieval slut turned saint who was murdered and eaten by her cannibalistic peers in the 13th century. This sacred relic, claimed by both Tsergovia and Votskojek, has great political significance: the country with the actual bone will gain admission to the United Nations, the authenticity of said bone to be determined by the august and senile Archbishop Minkokus.
The Tsergovian forces, who occupy a Second Avenue storefront embassy recently occupied by a dry cleaner, hire Dortmunder and his companions to recover the bone from the floating "embassy" of Votskojek, the Pride of Votskojek, a boat whose principal occupant, Hradec Kralowc, is his tiny nation's Ambassador to the United States. Kralowc's principal duties appear to consist of escorting showgirls on and off the boat, and protecting the bone, aided by the deranged Dr. Karver Zorn. Complications further ensue, involving the purloined art collection of the New York hotel magnate Harry Hochman, who is lobbying to build his Happy Hour Inns throughout Eastern Europe, dreaming of the slogan, "From the Rockies to the Urals, a Hochman pillow will rest your head."
If the plot is of no great concern, it is the effortlessness, wit, and sheer good-heartedness of the telling that make "Don't Ask" such a consistent delight. Mr. Westlake's prose is as deft as ever -- he describes the Queens side of the East River as a "Dickensian warren of riverside grunge," and his characterizations ("this woman was about the size and shape of a mailbox") are models of brevity. His affection for his characters is infectious, and because the stakes are so low, the book has the unhurried pace of the best of the shaggy dog stories; the pleasure is all in the journey rather than the destination.
There is also something Joycean in Mr. Westlake's love not only of New York's pettiest crooks, but also of its very geography. The descriptive handle "stately, plump Joe Mulligan," echoing the opening of "Ulysses," resonates because Mr. Westlake's affection for the details of New York resembles Joyce's encyclopedic knowledge of Dublin. Murch's explanations of his driving routes -- "with the construction on the Bruckner, I think I'll stay on the Henry Hudson. It's a toll across Spuyten Duyvil, but it's worth it" -- are a kind of music to any New Yorker's ears. One does not simply drive around New York; one devises strategies out of Clausewitz simply to go from Manhattan to the Bronx. Dortmunder and his gang are fish out of water once they leave the boroughs; a trip to Vermont is like a safari in Africa. They are New Yorkers to the bone; outside the city, they seem tentative, unfamiliar with the rules.
One can only admire Donald Westlake's continued Runyonesque infatuation with New York's low life. At a brutal time in the city's life, it is a major act of faith.

HEADLINE: Sea-Dumping Ban: Good Politics, But Not Necessarily Good Policy

SERIES: What Price Cleanup? -- Second article of a series.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
For millions of people from Montauk to Maryland, the broiling summer of 1988 will be hard to forget. It was the hottest year ever recorded. Repulsive trash slicks covered the Eastern shoreline. And borne upon a tide of public outrage, garbage emerged as a potent political issue.
In New York and New Jersey, where most of the waste appeared, health officials closed beaches by the score depriving sweltering people of relief. Pictures of used syringes, dead dolphins and human excrement scattered across the sand became a staple of the news. 
 Anger required action. So that fall, without registering a single vote of opposition, Congress banned the dumping of sewage into the ocean. The law prohibited New York City from dropping its processed waste into the sea and forced officials to find costly new ways to get rid of it.
 
The Rush to Ban
 "This is a turning point in human history," said a euphoric Representative William J. Hughes, Democrat of New Jersey, after the vote. Other officials agreed, rushing to embrace the law as one of the most important environmental measures ever enacted.
There was just one problem.
Ocean dumping had absolutely nothing to do with the garbage that washed up on the sand that year. In fact, the problems that caused the mess on the beaches in 1988 -- overtaxed sewage systems -- were largely ignored, and the health risks they present are as serious as they have ever been.
Most scientists agree that using the sea as a garbage can was unpleasant and are pleased that it is no longer legal. Still, some argue that dumping sewage in the Atlantic Ocean 106 miles from the shore -- which saved New York and other cities billions of dollars over the years -- is less hazardous than most of the disposal methods that have replaced it.
But Congressional leaders, relying almost solely on the summer's vivid images of filth, pushed through a ban on ocean dumping. As Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, put it immediately after the vote: "It is unfortunate that it takes a situation like we have today with medical waste washing up on our beaches, to capture the attention of the American public and of Congress. But perhaps it is a blessing in disguise, since it has resulted in our action today to put a halt to the ocean dumping of sludge."
Representative Thomas J. Manton, Democrat of Queens, opposed the act at first, saying it would simply shift waste from sea to land, including land in his own district. But looking back to that time, he recalled: "If you opposed the bill you were treated like a leper or an environmental terrorist. Nobody wanted to discuss the relative risks or the merits. It had been a bad summer, and we all wanted to be able to say we did something. So we passed a law. I tried to have a debate. And it was like I was trying to destroy the planet."
Because of the Ocean Dumping Act, New York City spent $2 billion on giant plants that turn sludge into fertilizer. The city plans to spend at least $300 million a year over the next decade to dispose of its sludge in this way and in others -- many times more than it would cost to dump it in the ocean.
 
Better Ways to Spend
 Even some of the ban's most enthusiastic proponents at major environmental organizations, none of whom would be quoted by name, concede that the money might have been better spent on other problems, like fixing the extensive system of storm sewers that caused the waste to wash up on the beaches in the first place.
Indeed, the ocean dumping ban is a striking triumph of environmental politics over science, a clear demonstration of how environmental policy can often be directed by symbols and fears than by reasoned discussion of benefit and risk.
In 1988, and still today, the real problem came from New York's aged, 6,200-mile network of sewer pipes that mix household waste with rainwater. Normally, it is all treated together. But during storms, sewage treatment plants are quickly overwhelmed, and sewer pipes carry millions of gallons of raw waste directly to the rivers and harbors surrounding the city.
In fact, officials have closed beaches in the summers since 1988 more often than they did before the ban went into effect.
"There is no question that the New York City sewer system is the greatest cause of water pollution in the region; that has almost always been true," said Howard Golub, acting director and chief engineer of the Interstate Sanitary Commission, a regional regulatory agency that for 20 years has been trying in vain to convince people to pay attention to the problem.
"But a sewer system isn't sexy," he added. "It's expensive to fix, and nobody wants to hear about it. So people focused on what they understand -- and they understand that sewage and the sea don't seem nice together."
 
The Real Problem
Wallflower At a Political Dance
 Modern sewerage usually consists of two systems: storm sewers that carry off excess rainwater, and sanitary sewers that handle sewage that needs treatment.
But older, combined systems, like New York City's, serve almost 20 percent of the nation's population, about 50 million people living in the America's oldest cities. For decades they have been the major cause of beach closings and dangerous levels of bacteria in coastal waters. They generally work well enough in normal times; sewage and rainwater are treated together and then discharged.
During a heavy storm, however, so much water washes into the combined system that it is overwhelmed. The treatment centers cannot handle the load and everything -- storm water and sewage -- floods untreated out the pipe.
To solve the sewer problem, New York would have to build enormous subterranean tanks to hold waste water during heavy downpours, and the city Department of Environmental Protection says that could cost several billion dollars. Without them, many beaches in the area will continue to be closed after particularly heavy storms. Every time more than three-quarters of an inch of rain falls, 500 million gallons of mixed sewage pours into area rivers and harbors, the city says.
A report by the State University of New York estimated that sewage overflows cost New York and New Jersey $3 billion to $7 billion in lost jobs, lost fishing days and forfeited economic opportunities in the previous decade.
That report was published in 1988, just as the sewers were flushing syringes and other trash from streets and gutters onto the beaches. Still, almost nobody seriously questioned the need for an immediate ocean dumping ban.
 
'Congress Acted on Emotion'
 As Alan Rubin, a senior Environmental Protection Agency official in charge of determining the risks of disposing of sludge, put it in a recent interview: "By 1988, ocean dumping had become taboo, about as politically incorrect as any disposal of waste can be. Maybe it was a good thing that happened. Maybe not. But it was not decided on the merits. Congress acted on emotion, not on data."
Those who supported the ban now argue that two rights cannot make a wrong. They say that ocean dumping needed to stop and that bills get passed when they can, not always when they make the most sense.
"You take care of emergencies first in life and in politics," said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, the New Jersey Democrat who was a leader in the fight to end ocean dumping.
Senator Lautenberg agreed that sewage overflows pose a serious health risk, but he added: "Sludge dumping was the equivalent of a fire we could put out. Just because you have earthquakes on the horizon doesn't mean you should let the fire rage."
Mr. Lautenberg asserted that it was not as clear in 1988 as it is today that storm sewers, not ocean dumping, were to blame for most of the trash that appeared on the beaches. But he did agree that the barges heading out to sea provided an image that was too useful to ignore.
"There is simply a point when you have to look at the broader picture," he said. "When we passed the law, it was at the height of a couple of ugly seasons. The waste may not have been a direct result of the ocean dumping, but it did alert people to the fact that we need to stop pouring garbage into the ocean."
 
Unsavory Practice
Where to Put A City's Sludge
 Few people are genuinely unhappy about the demise of a practice in which 1.5 billion gallons of distilled sewage sludge was dumped each day 106 miles off the coast of New Jersey. Even those who say it makes sense to consider using the deep sea to store dangerous wastes acknowledge that the sludge was beginning to find its way into the food chain on the ocean floor.
And while most industrial waste, heavy metals and dangerous contaminants were removed from the sludge before it was dumped in the ocean, it was never possible to extract all the poisons found in a huge sewage system.
For decades, New York dropped its sludge only 12 miles off the coast -- turning vast aquatic reaches into home to nothing but slime. Environmentalists fought for years to end ocean dumping. As a compromise, the Federal Government decided to permit New York and several neighboring cities to shift its dumping to the edge of the continental shelf, where E.P.A. officials said it would do no harm.
But even at 106 miles, where there is no scientific proof that waste disposal causes illness in humans, ocean dumping of waste has proven to be less than ideal. Although researchers first thought sludge dumped there would never reach the bottom of the ocean, scientists now know that some of it does. And when it gets there, it is eaten by animals that are eventually eaten by man.
But scientists argue that it may be just as troublesome to dump the sludge anywhere else. Sludge in landfills can seep into ground water. Even beneficial uses, like turning sewage to fertilizer, costs millions in processing and shipping.
Whatever the ancillary benefits the ocean dumping ban may have offered, it also cost New York a great deal of money. And many officials now say that money could have been put to far better use by trying to resolve the more complicated -- and pressing -- dilemma caused by combined sewer overflows.
"Am I sad that we no longer dump sludge in the Atlantic Ocean? Absolutely not," said Albert F. Appleton, commissioner of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection. He has made clean water a major focus of his tenure. "In a perfect world we simply wouldn't dump our waste at sea. But is that how I would have spent our next $2 billion? Never in a million years."
 
Other Solutions
A Victory Draws Questions
 Tough new laws passed since the mess of 1988 govern the disposal of medical waste. So syringes and intravenous bags no longer show up on beaches with much frequency. And Coast Guard boats now skim coastal waters for other visible debris. But the levels of microscopic organisms that the E.P.A. considers harmful to humans and fish -- the real problem -- are no less serious than they have ever been.
"When environmentalists see a problem they tend to say, 'Let's have a total solution,' " Mr. Appleton said. "They don't say, 'How much bang can we get for our buck?' They don't say, 'Where is the garbage going to go if it isn't in the ocean?' " '
Mr. Appleton certainly considers himself an environmentalist. But he and many others like him say the movement risks its credibility by placing so much emphasis on crowd-pleasing maneuvers like the ban on ocean dumping.
Nina Sankovitch, a senior project lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council who worked for the ocean dumping ban, countered: "Environmentalists have a huge agenda. We can't sit around and calculate what percentage of a problem will any particular law solve. Priorities matter, but they aren't always easy to fit into neat little flow charts. Is dumping sludge worse than burning garbage? Is money spent on recycling better than money spent on clean water? There aren't answers to those questions. So when we have the opportunity to improve the environment we go for it. And the Ocean Dumping Ban Act was a great opportunity."
Ms. Sankovitch says she now focuses much of her attention on the problem of combined sewers. But she said she sees nothing wrong with using the images of 1988 to help ban dumping -- even though the two problems were not connected.
"A victory for the environment is a victory for the environment," she said.
But it is not completely clear that a ban on dumping was such an environmental triumph. The negative effects of burying sludge close to the shores have been documented with precision. But the dangers of dumping it in deeper water are less clear.
Studies have shown that sludge deposited 106 miles out does reach the ocean floor and, in the words of Dr. Frederick Grassle, director of the Rutgers Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences, "it has a minute but measurable impact on the deep-sea ecosystem." However, Dr. Grassle also said that health risks from the dumping appeared to be minimal -- primarily because the ocean rapidly diluted the waste below dangerous concentrations.
Some researchers have proposed the nearly lifeless plains at the bottom of the oceans as a relatively inexpensive, and safe, disposal site for sludge. They argue that at the deepest levels of the sea -- several hundred miles away from any coastline and under nearly 16,000 feet of water -- the sludge will rest undisturbed and harmless.
 
Short-Sighted Proposal?
 However, many environmentalists and some scientists view the research proposals for deep-sea burial of sludge as short-sighted.
"It will take 10 seconds of logic and $10 million to prove that this too will have adverse effects on the environment," said Dr. Elliott A. Norse, a marine ecologist who is chief scientist for the Center for Marine Conservation.
But John Edmond, professor of chemical oceanography at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: "There are going to be impacts on our society of anything we throw away. That includes ocean dumping. But there is a real crisis in land disposal of our waste, and we have acted to ban even the consideration of ocean dumping.
"Even if we don't use the upper ocean -- and perhaps we should not -- we should think about the sea floor. But people are so emotional about these issues that they can hardly see or think straight."

HEADLINE: Seeking New Ties and Clout, Korean Grocers Join Voices

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
The Korean-American Grocers Association of New York had a surprising guest give the invocation at its annual awards meeting last month: the Rev. Al Sharpton.
The grocers, for whom memories of a black-led boycott in Brooklyn are still fresh, have also sponsored spots on black radio stations honoring heroes like Thurgood Marshall. The Korean Produce Association ran a scholarship program for minority students in conjunction with The Amsterdam News. 
 On another front, the Korean-American Small Business Service Center of New York is fighting a city plan for zoning changes that would allow bigger food stores into the city, as well as lobbying the City Council to crack down on illegal food vendors.
 
Community Relations Efforts
 On a range of issues, Korean business owners in New York are using the strength of their numbers to try to increase their political influence, improve their business opportunities and, perhaps most important, mend their often bitter relations with other ethnic groups in the city.
"Our guys are small, corner store owners," said Myong Y. Juch, president of the grocers' group. "But they are not small when they get together."
The grocers have elicited municipal help to set up a huge new food cooperative to cut their costs drastically. Community relations initiatives by them and others have included taking black leaders on tours of South Korea and sending black students to study there.
And on a political level, the Korean immigrants are banding together to push their concerns by voting as a bloc in this year's mayoral race. Mayor David N. Dinkins, as well as his likely challengers, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Andrew J. Stein, are already campaigning among Korean-Americans.
"If it's possible to get together to support one single candidate, I think it's a great idea," said Bong Jin Sa, executive director of the Korean Produce Association.
In part, the new collective efforts have been prompted by resentment and fear -- resentment over what the Koreans see as misconceptions about them, and fear that they may be vulnerable to ethnic violence. Those concerns were fueled by the bitter black-led boycott of a Korean store in Brooklyn in 1990, and by the anti-Korean violence during the Los Angeles riots last year.
"They have made a collective response," said Pyong Gap Min, a sociologist at Queens College. "They realized they had to be united to survive."
For an immigrant group owning proportionately more small businesses than others, it is hardly surprising that the collective approach is centered around business concerns and articulated by businessmen. In the past, the Koreans have organized fierce and effective boycotts against suppliers who cheated or harassed them.
But this time, their emerging collective approach is necessarily more public. For one thing, the organizations are trying to change the behavior of Korean business people so that they are less likely to spur a negative response. This has been done partly through extensive advertising in New York's four daily Korean newspapers and three cable television channels, among other outlets.
A message repeated over and over is: "Be a Korean-American, not a Korean-Korean."
The business owners are also trying to reach out to other groups. More non-Koreans are being employed in stores, and seminars are being offered to teach Koreans to smile more frequently, something they say is rare in their culture.
 
Consorting With Giants
 "We have to keep contact with our neighbors, because they misunderstand," said Sang Y. Choi, who owns a grocery store on Staten Island. "Sometimes they feel Korean people are angry when they're not."
Mr. Juch counts 300,000 Koreans in the metropolitan region, a slightly higher estimate than some sources. He says they own more than 10,000 businesses, of which 3,500 are groceries, delis or supermarkets. These account for 15 percent of such businesses in the city.
Their total sales approach $1.5 billion. It was thus hardly surprising that the giants of the food industry, from Anheuser-Busch to General Mills, streamed to the association's second annual Food and Trade show last month.
"Just name the company," Mr. Juch declared. "All the largest ones were there, and some small, local companies, too."
Mayor Dinkins and Mr. Stein spoke, and President Clinton and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo sent greetings.
"From the corner deli to the supermarket, Korean-American businesses play a vital role in our communities and country," the President said in his letter.
 
Advice on American Customs
 The grocers' association began in Brooklyn in 1985 with 20 businesses as members, and now has 2,500. Its first task, a continuing one, was to help grocers, most of whose English was at least somewhat lacking, adjust to American business customs.
New shopkeepers learn where to get plastic bags and commercial quantities of ice cream. They also are repeatedly told that four or five Korean grocers are killed annually, and that they must never try to resist robbers.
Hany Sal Ma, an employee of a store in Flatlands, Brooklyn, that was held up by three armed men last week, absorbed the lesson. "We gave them everything that was in the register," he said. "It's better than giving them your life."
Above all, the grocers have been urged to learn American ways. "Turn on your TV and watch it, even if you don't understand it," Mr. Juch implores.
It has been a long, uphill climb for Koreans who began flowing here in 1965 after immigration laws were eased. They gravitated to food stores because language was not such a barrier in that business, and because they could scrape together enough to buy stores in marginal areas. The success of the first wave of immigrants -- who developed the formula of being open long hours and offering glistening fresh vegetables -- spawned imitation.
 
Following a Well-Worn Path
 But many of the grocers fervently hope that their children will be able to escape their own 17-hour workdays by finding other careers. One of Mr. Juch's sons aspires to be a computer expert, while the other hopes to be a cartoonist.
The Koreans see their still-evolving path as almost identical to that followed by other immigrants. "We are no different than the Jews, Italians and other Europeans," Mr. Juch said.
Mr. Juch predicts that there will be a slight increase in the number of Korean grocers over the next decade, then a decline as today's grocers -- who were found to average 42.3 years old in a survey -- retire and are not replaced. The Koreans who remain in the food business, he thinks, will operate much larger stores or be wholesalers.
In the shorter term, the businessmen are banding together to try to accomplish specific objectives. Sung Soo Kim, president of the Korean-American Small Business Service Center, said his group has recently convinced the city's health, consumer affairs and sanitation departments to alter their enforcement procedures for small businesses in ways that make it more predictable.
"Mom-and-pop stores should be firmly protected," Mr. Kim said.
The most pressing issue for Korean merchants is clearly the proliferation of sidewalk food vendors. Mr. Juch says many vendors work for companies holding perhaps 100 licenses, with each employee working a shift, so carts are seldom idle.
 
Fighting Sidewalk Competition
 These competitors have none of the overhead of stores, including insurance, utilities and 14 kinds of direct and indirect taxes. They can also commandeer the best locations.
More than any other issue, it is peddling that is energizing Korean store owners to register and vote. Their goal is to force the city to crack down on illegal vendors and more tightly regulate legal ones.
"We're really going to cry out," Mr. Juch promised, saying he hopes to deliver at least 6,000 votes to the mayoral candidate whose stand on vending seems best. "That's the only way we're going to show our power," he said.
Mr. Sa of the produce group said Koreans' bitter memories of Mayor Dinkins's handling of the year-long boycott in Flatbush, Brooklyn, which was also criticized by the United States Civil Rights Commission, may offer help to his challengers.
"Generally speaking, the Korean community is not quite happy with Dinkins's achievements for the Korean community," he said, stressing this is not necessarily his personal view.
 
Getting Along With Neighbors
 Perhaps the most ambitious project of the Korean businessmen is the New York Korean-American Cooperative, which is moving beyond the research stage after a year and a half. The idea is to escape buying from wholesalers by banding together to buy as a group, and thereby attract lower prices directly from manufacturers.
If this is successful, other such centers may follow. The idea, Mr. Juch emphasized, is not to exclude other ethnic groups but to invite them to join. In particular, he has been calling Dominican organizations to try to interest bodega owners.
But everything will depend on how well the Koreans are able to get along with their neighbors. They remember all too well the nine-month boycott of the Brooklyn grocery in 1990, and the Los Angeles riots, in which many Korean businesses were destroyed. "I thought my store was going to be burned down," Mr. Juch said. "I was giving up on life in New York."
One thing that is certain is that Korean attempts to be involved in the neighborhoods where they do business will be more visible.
For years, in relative anonymity, Korean grocers have given turkeys to the needy, and Korean dry cleaners have distributed unclaimed clothes. By contrast, the 10 minority students winning $1,000 scholarships in the grocers' "Share the Dream" essay contest, co-sponsored by Coca-Cola, will be honored at Harlem's Apollo Theater.
The Rev. Timothy Mitchell, the black pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Flushing, Queens, said the Korean efforts at community outreach as represented by the scholarships are helping. "But there has to be a step further than the giving of moneys," said Mr. Mitchell, who also rents a building to a Korean church group for services. "There's got to be an approach for people to know each other on a personal, comprehensive level."
Mr. Mitchell's hope is that Korean-Americans and blacks can come together in joint commercial ventures. "The problem is that, many times, we don't see the best of each group," he said. "Joint ventures would give us a chance to see the objective reality."

HEADLINE: Russia and Realpolitik

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
As events unfold in Moscow with dizzying speed and unpredictability, the Administration is struggling to temper its strong support for President Boris N. Yeltsin with a dose of Realpolitik.
Ultimately, the Administration knows that what is most important in Russia -- the continuation of democratic and economic reform -- transcends the personal fortunes of one man. 
 In the short term, however, the Administration is clearly reluctant to loosen its embrace of Russia's only democratically elected leader, even when his actions fall short of Western standards of democracy. That is because there is a strong sense in Washington, particularly among those who know and respect Mr. Yeltsin, that he makes the reform movement stick and gives it its dynamism.
 
Russia's de Gaulle?
 To hear some officials talk, Mr. Yeltsin is a sort of Russian-style, present-day de Gaulle poised to deliver his country from chaos by assuming authoritarian powers the way the French war hero did in 1958.
The impulse to forgive Mr. Yeltsin and the conviction that he is more democratic than many others was captured in statements today by Madeleine K. Albright, the chief American representative at the United Nations.
On the ABC News program "This Week," she said, "He is the only one in 1,000 years of Russian history that has been elected by all the Russian people. The others -- the Parliament -- was elected in peculiar ways and contains a lot of very hard-liners." She characterized Mr. Yeltsin as a person who, by ordering national balloting, rightfully wants his fate to be decided directly by the Russian people.
She added that "taking something to the people seems to be the appropriate thing to do as you're evolving democratic institutions."
When asked whether that meant that the Communist-era Constitution and those elected under it are without legitimacy, she replied, "They certainly, in my mind, have less legitimacy."
 
U.S. Supports 'All Reformers'
 But there is another emerging view in the Administration: that while Mr. Yeltsin best embodies the reform movement, he is by no means its only advocate. For that reason, Mr. Clinton and his advisers made sure that in the carefully drawn statement of support for Mr. Yeltsin on Saturday, they pitched a tent large enough to include all those who favor reform in Russia.
It is not that the Administration is drawing up lists of "all the reformers" as potential successors to Mr. Yeltsin, but that Washington recognizes that process is more crucial than personality. Mr. Clinton made that point when he said on Saturday, "What matters most is that Russia is and must remain a democratic country moving toward a market economy."
The importance to the United States of democratic reform and free enterprise -- the process -- in Russia will be the centerpiece of a speech in Chicago on Monday by Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
He is expected to say what he has already articulated piecemeal: that for every American, the stakes of reform in Russia are monumental; that if reform succeeds, it will enhance global security well into the next century. But if it fails, the price will be an increased nuclear threat, a return to higher military spending and a setback for democracy.
Mr. Christopher is likely to emphasize the importance of helping Russia on its long road to reform, which he has called the country's greatest national security problem over the next decade.
 
Sensitive Issue for Clinton
 Part of the Administration's problem in deciding how vigorously to support Mr. Yeltsin stems from the extreme sensitivity to criticism that Mr. Clinton is over-personalizing his diplomacy. Mr. Clinton himself criticized President George Bush during the campaign for investing too much political capital in President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during the Soviet leader's final months in power.
But senior Clinton Administration officials argue that Mr. Bush clung to Mr. Gorbachev even after it became clear that he was resisting the reforms Mr. Yeltsin was propelling forward. They say Mr. Clinton is supporting Mr. Yeltsin because he is a democratically elected leader committed to more, not less, reform.
Leading lawmakers are looking beyond Mr. Yeltsin, even as they continue to embrace him.
Representative Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told interviewers on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" today that while it is in the national interest to support Mr. Yeltsin now, "there are many other democrats in Russia, and we must be prepared to support them."
And Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the group that, of course, the United States supports Mr. Yeltsin, but should be talking to other "key players" as well. "It's not Yeltsin exclusively," he said.
In an effort to hear alternative points of view, Mr. Clinton met quietly last week at the White House with Valery Zorkin, the head of Russia's Constitutional Court. Although Mr. Zorkin helped Mr. Yeltsin compromise with the Russian Congress last December, on Saturday he declared Mr. Yeltsin's assumption of virtually unlimited powers unconstitutional.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN MOSCOW;
Europe Cautiously Supports Yeltsin

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, March 21

 BODY:
Germany, France and other European countries sided cautiously today with President Boris N. Yeltsin as the elected leader of Russia in his showdown with the Russian Parliament, a holdover from the Communist era.
In statements that reflected a consensus that Mr. Yeltsin was the best hope for continued democratic and economic change, European leaders expressed hope that the confrontation would be short-lived and peaceful. 
 The German Government said in a statement that Mr. Yeltsin represented "the unhindered continuation of democratic and free-market reforms" in Russia. The President had Germany's understanding, the statement said, for his declaration of "special rule."
The statement said Bonn backed President Yeltsin because "the last Congress of People's Deputies unilaterally threw into doubt the principle of separation of powers, a key element of any democratic constitution, to the disadvantage of the freely elected President of Russia."
Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, welcomed the Russian Government's profession of continued support for democracy.
 
France Renews Call for Summit
 France renewed its call for a special summit meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries to consider ways of channeling more aid to Mr. Yeltsin and the forces for democracy and economic change in Moscow that he represented. A special summit meeting was "more necessary than ever," Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said.
The French President, Francois Mitterrand, has been pressing to hold such a summit concurrently with President Clinton's planned meeting with the Russian President in Vancouver on April 3 and 4.
Mr. Clinton has also supported calls for more economic aid for Russia, but has apparently not agreed to an emergency Group of Seven meeting.
The German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said today that foreign and finance ministers of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Canada and Britain -- would probably meet in Tokyo on April 20 to discuss a new aid package.
 
Japan Called Obstacle to Aid
 The main obstacle to more aid for Russia, Mr. Kinkel said, was Japan, which has refused to discuss it until the Russians agree to discuss the return of four northern islands that the Soviet Union seized in World War II.
Germany says that since 1989, it has provided more aid to Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union than any other country, a total of nearly $50 billion, including debt forgiveness. But, Mr. Kinkel said on German television, "We were not supported by all our partners."
"The Japanese are the biggest holdouts," he said. "We and the Americans have to press the Japanese harder to help."
The German and French foreign ministers said Mr. Yeltsin's move had not come as a surprise. The Russian leader told Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Moscow early this month that extraordinary measures might be necessary, and in Helsinki last Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, told foreign ministers of states bordering on the Baltic Sea that he had been called back to Moscow to an emergency meeting.
 
G-7 Governments Were Briefed
 Mr. Yeltsin also told President Mitterrand in Moscow last Tuesday that he might have to take strong measures, according to Mr. Dumas.
German officials said that on Saturday evening, at least 90 minutes before Mr. Yeltsin went on Russian television to announce his moves, Mr. Kozyrev called in ambassadors of the Group of Seven countries in Moscow. Separately, he also briefed the Danish ambassador, who represents the current presidency of the 12-nation European Community, these officials reported.
Despite such assertions, neither Germany nor any other European industrial democracy now appears to be able or willing to provide large amounts of economic aid to keep the Russian economy from collapsing.

Support From Japan
 TOKYO, Monday, March 22 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Government expressed optimism today that President Yeltsin's reform policies would be supported by the Russian people in a vote on April 25.
The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Masamichi Hanabusa, said that Japan "strongly expects that President Yeltsin's reform policies will gain the support of the Russian people, and that with stable relations between the Administration and Parliament, the reforms that President Yeltsin has thus far pursued will be continued."
Japan is attempting to organize a meeting at the Cabinet level in Tokyo in mid-April of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations, as part of what Mr. Hanabusa termed "further efforts toward reaching a consensus" about how to support Mr. Yeltsin's reforms.

HEADLINE: The Price Of Tobacco: The Basics

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, March 21

 BODY:
Ever since the Depression, the Government has lent tobacco farmers a hand by bolstering the prices paid to them on the market. But the farmers like to point out that unlike the growers of other crops whose prices are supported by the Government, they receive help that entails no net cost to the taxpayers -- that is, no "subsidies" in the usual sense.
The tobacco growers' boast, although accurate today, has been strictly true only in the last 11 of the 60 years since the Federal price-support program for tobacco was adopted. And even during this latter period, the Government has had to step in to bail the growers out once, in 1986. The cost was $1.1 billion. 
 The tobacco support program shores up the farmers' prices by limiting production of their crop, setting a minimum price for it at market and providing for loans from a Government agency to farmers' cooperatives.
Along with price-support programs for other crops, it began as a New Deal effort to help bring farmers out of the Depression. It sought to lift prices by limiting the acreage that a given farmer could plant, and it also frequently provided the farmer a subsidy.
In fact, the farmer could receive two subsidies: the Government paid him for acreage that he had been allocated but did not plant, and it made up the difference if the price that he received for his crop at market fell below a target price that had been set for that year.
 
The First Change
 By the end of World War II, the tobacco growers were eager to administer their own support program. So the Government began relinquishing much of that task, at the same time abandoning direct tobacco subsidies.
To replace the old system, Congress in 1946 created a group of farmer-administered "stabilization associations," or cooperatives. Through annual referendums among farmers, the associations set production allotments. The Government's continuing role was to set minimum prices for tobacco and, through its Commodity Credit Corporation, provide loans to the associations. The associations used the money to buy, at the Government-set floor price, any part of a farmer's tobacco allotment that he could not sell on the open market.
The tobacco bought by the farmer associations was stored until it could be sold -- most often at a discount but occasionally at a price higher than the floor. The proceeds were earmarked to pay off the Federal loans and the interest on them.
From time to time, though, the associations came up short. Of the $5 billion in Federal loans granted to the tobacco support program through 1982, $57 million was not paid back. In addition, unpaid interest on the loans amounted to $152.8 million, and agricultural economists say that because of accounting anomalies, that figure actually understates the amount of unpaid interest the Government was forced to write off.
 
Attack on the Industry
 By the early 1980's, tobacco growers were under heavy attack by a coalition of anti-smoking forces and groups opposed to any program that protected farmers through Government-sanctioned limitations on supply. Scrambling to remake the program before the coalition could gain any more allies, Federal lawmakers from the Southeast tried to eliminate anything that could be viewed, even remotely, as a tobacco subsidy.
Under the reshaped program, which took effect in 1982, the farmer associations continued to borrow from the Commodity Credit Corporation, at interest rates pegged to the Government's own cost of borrowing. But they also began to impose an annual assessment on farmers to build up a reserve for times of cash shortfall. No longer would the Government be asked to absorb a loss.
That was the idea, at least. But in 1985, cigarette manufacturers' increasing use of cheaper tobacco grown abroad sent sales of domestic tobacco plummeting. The farmer associations borrowed heavily to buy up the unsold crop, and the assessments on farmers soared to 25 cents for every $1.40 they were receiving at the market. (By comparison, that rate of assessment is roughly 20 times the rate that prevailed last year.)
 
Aid Reduces Assessments
 Against a backdrop of growing crisis, the manufacturers agreed to buy up a surplus of 547 million pounds of tobacco over the next several years (although at deeply discounted prices) and to join the farmers in paying annual assessments, sharing the cost of running the price-stabilization program. In addition, a new mechanism was established to predict more accurately manufacturers' needs for domestic tobacco in any given year, an effort to avoid the market glut of 1985.
The Government pitched in, too. In 1986, it wrote off $1.1 billion in loans that it had made to the farmer associations, a step that allowed the assessments on individual farmers to begin dropping back to normal.
These days the program is back on footing that allows a tobacco grower to be absolutely truthful when he says it imposes no net cost on the taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Mayoral Race Is On (Well, Sort Of);
It's Unofficial, but Dinkins Is Squaring Off With Four Rivals

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The Democratic mayoral primary is six months away, with the general election two months after that. None of the major candidates for mayor has formally announced his candidacy, and the radio and television airwaves have yet to be littered with self-aggrandizing commercials.
But make no mistake about it: the New York City mayoral race has begun, though in a quiet way. 
 The mayoral candidates and their handlers are in a sort of political spring training, trying out themes and honing messages away from the glare of publicity that will magnify every action and remark in the campaign's later stages.
In his first overtly political appearances of the race, Mayor David N. Dinkins last week sketched out the framework of his campaign, asserting that New York was a safer, more fiscally secure and more just city than when he took office in 1990 -- despite the deep and prolonged recession.
For their part, the three other Democrats and the Republican who want his job have been appearing before community groups in all five boroughs, depicting a very different city. Each in his own way has argued that the Mayor's efforts have failed and that New Yorkers are still fearful of crime and worried about the local economy.
Last week, for the first time, Mr. Dinkins and his three Democratic challengers -- City Council President Andrew J. Stein; Herman Badillo, the former Bronx borough president, and Roy Innis, the president of the Congress of Racial Equality -- appeared separately at a candidates' forum, held on Tuesday at Wagner College by the Staten Island Democratic Committee.
The previous week, both Mr. Badillo and Mr. Stein inadvertently picked the same day to attack the Mayor at City Hall. Mr. Badillo stood on the front steps to criticize Mr. Dinkins for what he described as a deliberate policy of cutting back on arrests of street-level drug dealers. Mr. Stein chose City Hall Park for a rally with about 100 senior citizens opposing the Mayor's proposed budget cuts at centers for the elderly. And the Mayor's probable Republican opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former United States Attorney in Manhattan, has also been campaigning informally, speaking almost daily, but with little fuss or fanfare, to neighborhood and community groups throughout the city.
Political strategists' conventional wisdom is that voters do not really concentrate on an election until a campaign's final days, and so candidates' oratory is not likely to begin heating up until the weather does.
Even so, like avid baseball fans, New York City politicians have been eagerly awaiting the official opening day of the 1993 mayoral race, which most have long presumed would be Mr. Stein's formal announcement that he was challenging Mr. Dinkins.
 
Stein Trailing in Polls
 Mr. Stein, trailing the Mayor by almost 30 percent points in several recent polls, has been promising an unusually early and very expensive media campaign to bring his candidacy to the voters' attention. The Council President has maintained that once New Yorkers were aware of what he proposes to do as mayor, his showing in the polls would improve dramatically. In fact, Mr. Stein said last month that by mid-April his television campaign would so improve his standing that he would be within 6 or 8 percentage points of Mr. Dinkins.
But Mr. Stein acknowledged in an interview on Friday that he was behind schedule. He said he now expected to begin airing his television ads in about a month. Asked why his timetable had been set back, he said, "It's a creative and complicated process."
He argued that he would still be on the air much earlier than the other candidates, and much earlier than virtually all previous mayoral campaigns. "We're getting started a little later, but we're still giving ourselves plenty of time," he said.
Mr. Stein also dismissed speculation that he was considering a withdrawal from the race. He said he would definitely run and insisted that he was still supremely confident he would win. "I think that in the spring, in May or June, this will be a very tight race," he said.
But even without a formal announcement or the start of the elaborate television campaign that Mr. Stein envisions -- including Perot-style "infomercials" and audience participation specials -- he has been busy campaigning.
At the forum on Staten Island, he sounded themes he has been polishing in appearances around the city. Mr. Stein contended, for example, that Mayor Dinkins had failed to make city workers more productive, that he had not adequately addressed concerns about crime and that he had not done enough to counter the recession.
He noted that the Mayor often cites statistics that show crime decreased significantly in the city over the last two years. "He said that people feel safer in this city," Mr. Stein said. "Mr. Mayor, what city do you live in? I don't think it's this city because I don't think people feel safer."
 
'Not Arresting Anybody'
 "The reason crime statistics are down is that they are not arresting anybody," he added. "People are selling drugs all over this city in broad daylight, and this administration's official policy is not to arrest them.
"They are also closing jails. Dave, when I'm mayor I'm going to open the jails and I'm going to put those drug addicts in them because that's where they belong."
Mr. Stein also outlined proposals to get municipal workers to be more productive by introducing the element of competition, with private companies bidding to do work now performed by city employees. He said he would change Civil Service rules so the city could pay incentives to workers who do a good job and penalize or even dismiss those who do not.
He pledged to "fundamentally change the way the city does business," and he contended that by doing so, he could simultaneously enhance city services and reduce taxes.
Mr. Badillo and Mr. Innis also derided the Mayor's claim that crime was declining. Mr. Innis, perhaps the most conservative of the four Democrats, criticized school officials for introducing the disputed curriculum for teaching respect for homosexual families and for distributing condoms. Mr. Badillo said he would press for higher standards and better performance in public education.
The Mayor, who spoke first at the forum, offered a different perspective. "It's been my task to lead our city through some of the most difficult challenges in our modern history," he said, citing soaring unemployment and welfare caseloads. "Under difficult circumstances I think we've done a pretty extraordinary job of making the tough choices."
Mr. Dinkins listed at length what he views as his administration's accomplishments, from reducing the size of the municipal work force to freezing corporate and property tax rates to balancing the city budget each year.
He also described his major initiatives: the expansion of the police force and a shift toward community policing; the opening of new primary-care health clinics in poor communities, and the creation of so-called beacon schools, which are open from early morning to late evening and offer adult education, recreation and social services. On Friday, he said for the first time that he hoped to make the mayoral race a referendum on his proposal to restructure the Board of Education to give the Mayor control over the schools.

HEADLINE: Motor Vehicles Moves to Shed Its Poor Image

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
Aware that they run New York State's most hated bureaucracy, officials in the Department of Motor Vehicles are planning a broad overhaul of services that promises to make the agency trimmer, more efficient and much more user-friendly within 18 months.
The officials, who have requested $6 million from the Legislature for the changes, say that their primary aim is to improve customer service and that they hope to eventually shed the unpleasant image that has long been associated with their agency. 
 For years, the reasons for dissatisfaction have been obvious to anyone who visited a district office: endless waits, surly clerks, poor information and a bureaucratic system that often forces people to spend half a day on a transaction that might take only 15 minutes in another state.
Mob scenes that have characterized the department's New York City offices will now be eased, officials say. Some changes are as simple as they are overdue, like an automatic queuing system that allows a person to take a number and a seat rather than stand in line. The system will be installed in the Staten Island office this week and in others by the end of next year.
 
'We Need a Cultural Change'
 Other changes are more ambitious, like tightening management so that the atmosphere in district offices is more businesslike and less openly antagonistic. Some recent customer experiences, like being yelled at after waiting in line seven hours, and being caught in a stampeding crowd at opening time, may become rarer.
"We are the beast of state government," acknowledged Patricia B. Adduci, New York State Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. "We need a cultural change."
The need for an overhaul, she said, is widely recognized among officials in Albany. After all, she noted, this is the department that in 1984 was dead last in the nation to put photographs on drivers' licenses.
Ms. Adduci said the department's plan was developed after Gov. Mario M. Cuomo asked late last year for a proposal on how to improve service. The plan will be made public if financing is approved in the budget due April 1.
Some changes have already begun. Identification numbers have been cut from 19 digits -- even Ms. Adduci did not know why the numbers were so long -- to 9 digits on new licenses. The department has also made it easier to get special license plates.
 
Private Driving Tests
 More substantive changes, Ms. Adduci said, will be made within 18 months: private driving schools will give written and road tests, and telephone service will have more and better-trained operators who can give answers about a license or registration, reducing the number of people who need to visit a district office.
There are plans to open "quick stop" offices in midtown Manhattan and suburban malls, with automatic tellers to renew a license or registration. This year, three more offices will open, one in Brooklyn at Coney Island, and two in Queens, in College Point and Rockaway.
At the existing Queens office, at 165th Street and 92d Avenue in Jamaica, an overhaul is long overdue. Its dank, mustard-colored waiting room, usually crowded with a thousand or so drivers and car owners shuffling slowly in long, snaking lines, is a picture of lethargic bureaucracy.
Of the three dozen clerks in the main hall at 2 one recent afternoon, about half sat far behind the counter, chatting and laughing or wandering about without any apparent purpose. Those actually at work by the counter were unsmiling and slow moving.
 
A Trick: Go at Closing
 "You want to know the quickest way to get through here?" asked Edward Young, a limousine driver waiting to pick up new license plates. "You come at 4:30, just before they close. The clerks want to go home, and they help everyone as fast as they can."
Indeed, after 4 P.M., almost all the clerks who had been chatting two hours earlier were now serving customers at the counter.
Dozens of people besides Mr. Young were willing to tell a favorite story about the department's problems. But no one could top the experience of Roy Brown, who waited in lines for seven hours one day late last month only to be told he would have to come back another day.
"I may have to kill somebody," Mr. Brown said, his frustration competing with exhaustion. "I really don't understand why it has to be this way."
Mr. Brown arrived at 9:45 A.M. to renew the registration for the seven ambulance vans that are the centerpiece of his family's business. He waited in line for an hour to be told that for multiple renewals he had to go to another line, at the window for bulk transactions. There was no sign.
 
Yelled At After 7 Hours
 A clerk explained that the bulk window closed at 9:30 A.M., 30 minutes after opening and 15 minutes before he arrived. The van registrations expired the next day, so Mr. Brown was determined to renew them even if it meant standing in the regular line seven times, once per van.
By 4 P.M., having run outside every half-hour to put 50 cents in a parking meter, Mr. Brown was in a long line of weary car owners for the fourth time, and was nearing the end of his patience. His mother, Edna Brown, cut her afternoon classes at York College to come help, and she would apply to renew one of the vans herself. Or maybe two, she said, if the clerk seemed nice.
Mother and son ended up at adjacent windows. The clerk serving her approved two van registrations. His clerk, who recognized him from an earlier transaction, rejected the one he submitted and yelled: "Get out of here! We told you already: bulk window for bulk transactions!"
Sheila Seabrook, director of the Queens office, would not answer questions about why identical applications, submitted at adjacent windows, were treated differently. She referred all questions to the department's headquarters in Albany.
 
Improved, but Under Review
 Robert Waters, executive deputy director of the department, said that the handling of multiple transactions would be reviewed as district office management is improved.
But he insisted that service had improved in the past two years. As more drivers renew a license or registration by mail, he said, average waiting times have dropped.
He also cited Brooklyn's new office, which opened last September on Hudson Avenue at Flatbush Avenue to replace the former office on Schermerhorn Street. The office was laid out to keep lines orderly, and in a recent visit there, the clerks were seen to be noticably more courteous than their counterparts in Queens.
Yet the Brooklyn office is not without problems. One day recently Orlando Ivey took his place in line outside the office about 6:45 A.M., more than two hours before the doors opened, hoping to beat the crowd.
 
Guard Watches Stampede
 When the doors opened at 9 A.M., however, Mr. Ivey watched in dismay as the line dissolved and several hundred people stampeded through the doorway, shoving one other as a lone security guard watched helplessly.
"I don't understand why they don't do something about this," said Mr. Ivey. "It wouldn't be that hard for them to first let in the people who arrived early."
Department officials hope that the changes will eventually produce economic efficiency. But Ms. Adduci could not offer a timetable for the savings. And in the coming fiscal year, she acknowledged, the plan requires more money, not less.
It counts on $6 million in new financing that is part of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's $178 million budget proposal for the department, which requires legislative approval. Michael J. Bragman of Cicero, chairman of the Assembly's Transportation Committee, said that most of his colleagues would support anything likely to improve service by the department -- a heavy source of constituent complaints -- but added that only part of the budget increase may be approved.
 
Concern Over Private Testing
 Another proposal that may draw opposition is the plan to transfer all the written and road tests to private driving schools. Ms. Adduci said that it makes sense for new drivers to be tested at the same place where they learn to operate a car. She said the plan would allow the department to concentrate on other services, like issuing licenses and registrations.
However, driving examiners fear that putting the testing into the hands of private driving schools will encourage abuse.
"It's an obvious conflict of interest to have the same school teach students and then give them a road test," said Arthur Handel, a supervisor in the Motor Vehicles office in Yonkers, who worked as a driving instructor until he joined the department a dozen years ago. "You could easily have schools skimming over the instruction, and approving anyone who paid a full fee."
Ms. Adduci responded that supervision of the schools could be tightened.
For many New York drivers, the department will have to change greatly, but for others, the irritation is not as bad as it could be.
Bai Youngmin, 39, a security guard who arrived from China two years ago, said the office in Queens where he stood in line for two hours was nothing like the bureaucracy he encountered in his native land.
"It took me four years to get a driver's license in China," Mr. Bai said. "This is easy."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Amsterdam News's Blunt Publisher Still Has Visions of Running The Post

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
To many, the news that The New York Post's prospective owner, Abraham Hirschfeld, had agreed on Friday to rehire Pete Hamill, the newspaper's editor, seemed to suggest that there would be no role at the paper for Wilbert A. Tatum, the publisher of The Amsterdam News, whom Mr. Hirschfeld had previously announced as his choice for editor.
But for Mr. Tatum, there is no such assumption. "I will be the co-publisher and editor in chief-designee," he said in an interview Friday night. "As co-publisher, I am essentially going to be Pete's boss. As co-publisher, I am in a position of authority." 
 Indeed, these have been days of uncertainty and controversy for Mr. Tatum, the 60-year-old publisher of the largest weekly newspaper aimed at black New Yorkers. He is accustomed to controversy.
In the 22 years Mr. Tatum has led The Amsterdam News, he has been cheered and vilified by readers for editorial positions: his defense of Tawana Brawley; his printing the name of the Central Park jogger who was raped; his stinging weekly diatribes against Mayor Edward I. Koch. While the staff of The Post last week gained attention by publishing dozens of unflattering articles about Mr. Hirschfeld, they also attacked Mr. Tatum and his journalistic values.
A man who speaks in a clipped, declamatory, almost theatrical manner -- he will even suggest the punctuation for his own quotes to an interviewer -- Mr. Tatum is a bundle of complexities.
 
Subordinates Are Careful
 Few among his staff at The Amsterdam News would speak about him for attribution. But privately, they describe a man who expresses passionate views on fairness for minorities, yet who is so stubborn and occasionally petty that he alienates even those who agree with him.
Andrew Cooper, publisher of The City Sun, a competing black weekly newspaper based in Brooklyn, is also a detractor. "He is egomaniacal and, more than anything, he likes to frequent those social affairs at which he can rub elbows with rich white people," said Mr. Cooper, a writer and columnist for The Amsterdam News from the mid-70's to the early 80's.
Mr. Tatum "controls everything that goes into that newspaper," he added. "If you're talking about editorial integrity, it ain't there."
But the publisher has his admirers, as well. "He is bold and daring," said Chuck Sutton, president of Apollo Theater Productions, an arm of the Inner City Broadcasting Company, in which Mr. Tatum is a major shareholder. "He has provided leadership on a number of political issues," Mr. Sutton said. "You might not agree with him, but he's refreshing."
Mr. Tatum describes himself as a manager who "gives people a chance to use their heads to the fullest and let them run with the ball."
Of Mr. Cooper's criticism, he said: "Cooper is unimportant. He is making an effort to ride the reputation of The Amsterdam News, to make a place in the sun for himself. For all intents and purposes, he is without class."
Some of the harshest criticisms against Mr. Tatum have included accusations of anti-Semitism, based on the critics' interpretations of some of Mr. Tatum's editorials. "It is a bald-faced lie," he said of the charge. "There's no one in the world who can point to a single statement I have made that could be construed as being anti-Semitic."
Some of the anti-Semitism accusations arose from Mr. Tatum's defense of Leonard Jeffries, a black professor who was removed last spring from his position as head of African-American studies at the City College of New York because of his comments about blacks and Jews "In the Jeffries case, I insisted on his right to say whatever he wanted to say," Mr. Tatum said.
Through all the controversy, his Amsterdam News has usually held its own financially, surviving recessions that have killed or badly bruised other black publications.
The paper is privately owned, and few details of its financial condition are known. Selvin Michael, its controller and vice president, said The Amsterdam News, which is the principal component of the Amnews Corporation, has been profitable for 7 of the last 10 years.
 
Response to Strike
 A notable year of unprofitability was 1983, when the paper endured a six-month strike by reporters, editors and advertising personnel of the Newspaper Guild. When the strike was over, Mr. Tatum cut the staff by a third and slashed other costs.
But losses continued until 1986, when the paper had increases in local and national advertising amid improvement in the broad economy. Mr. Michael said that final figures for 1992 had not been compiled, but that "it looks like it will be a profitable year." The paper had revenue last year of about $4 million, Mr. Michael said, twice the level of 10 years ago.
The Amsterdam News was founded in 1909, and Mr. Tatum's stewardship represents only the third ownership group in the paper's history. He bought the paper with a group of investors, among them Percy E. Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough President; H. Carl McCall and John L. Edmonds, a lawyer.
All but Mr. Edmonds sold their shares. The ownership by Mr. Tatum and Mr. Edmonds has been characterized by a relentless battle over who, in fact, has a controlling interest in the paper. Mr. Tatum contends that he owns 65 percent of the shares, with Mr. Edmonds owning the balance.
Mr. Edmonds has contended in a lawsuit that Mr. Tatum illegally issued additional shares in the company to dilute Mr. Edmonds's stake.
Some who have studied the black press say that Mr. Tatum has given The Amsterdam News a distinctive voice. "He has given the paper more toughness and has increased the coverage beyond the black community locally," said Roland E. Wolseley, a retired journalism professor at Syracuse University and author of "The Black Press, U.S.A."
Mr. Tatum has long had an interest in running The New York Post. In 1988, he made a $35 million bid to acquire it, with the backing of Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert, which agreed to provide financing. But The Post, then owned by Rupert Murdoch, was instead sold to Peter S. Kalikow.
A 60-year-old native of North Carolina who lost his Southern accent by speaking in high school oratory contests, Mr. Tatum began in journalism working for three small newspapers founded by his father to provide information to black farmers.
Moving to New York, he became active in the community, and in 1966 was named by Mayor John V. Lindsay as assistant director of community relations for the Buildings Department. Later, he held urban-renewal posts.
Mr. Tatum and his wife, the former Susan Kohn, a Jewish refugee from Czechoslovakia, own a real estate holding company. They and their 22-year-old daughter live in a restored town house in the East Village.
 
But Why The Post?
 In the interview, Mr. Tatum said his interest in The Post was fed by the belief that "nowhere in America is there a major journalistic organ that can combat racism in the media." He added, "There is no voice in journalism that can take a lie one hears from radio, television or reads in a paper, and explain why that lie was told."
He said Mr. Hirschfeld had offered him a "significant" equity stake in the Post, but that the details had not been made final.
Asked what Mr. Hirschfeld was up to in rehiring Mr. Hamill, he replied: "I give up."
As to the notion of The Amsterdam News and The Post being combined in some way, which Mr. Hirschfeld briefly tossed out early last week, he said there was no plan for a merger, but that if it happened, "there will be joint marketing and distribution only."
"The Post will have nothing to do with the editorial policy of the Amsterdam News, and vice versa," he added.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN MOSCOW;
Muscovites Answer Yeltsin, And Their Verdict Is Mixed

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 21

 BODY:
As demonstrators gathered by the Russian Parliament building today on the banks of the Moscow River, President Boris N. Yeltsin got his first set of early returns from the Russian people, who will be asked in a month to break the country's political stalemate.
By midafternoon, two opposing crowds had formed, facing off across barricades reinforced by rows of parked jeeps and buses. One was rallying under a forest of red Soviet flags, symbol of the Communist-nationalist opposition to Mr. Yeltsin's Government; the other, across the street, was waving the white, red and blue of the Russian tricolor, which has become Mr. Yeltsin's emblem. 
 The two crowds never met, but the mood on both sides reflected a deep division in Russian society between those loyal to Mr. Yeltsin and his program of economic and political change and those who blame him for the collapse of a system, a country and a way of life that they still hold sacred.
 
Yeltsin's Ratings Up
 It is too early to tell which way the balloting will go on April 25, the date set by Mr. Yeltsin for a vote of confidence in his leadership and on his proposals for a new constitution. His rating rose slightly in recent public opinion polls -- from 30 percent to 36 percent -- after the recent session of the Congress of People's Deputies, where he received a drubbing at the hands of the majority.
By contrast, his archrival, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the Speaker of the Congress -- whose sarcastic asides and harsh oratory are regarded by many as unseemly -- was given positive ratings by only 12 percent of Muscovites polled by the Independent Institute of Sociology and Parliamentarism.
After Mr. Yeltsin's appeal to the nation and his assumption of virtually unlimited powers on Saturday, only a few thousand pro-Yeltsin demonstrators turned out in Moscow today. The anti-Yeltsin crowd outweighed his supporters in numbers and in vehemence. At one point, a group of jeering Communists attacked an ABC News camera crew, a sign of the anti-Western sentiment that is rising among the opposition.
Milling around the parking lot behind the White House, as the Parliament building is called, a mostly elderly crowd held up an eclectic collection of Stalin portraits, signs mourning the loss of the Soviet Union and banners accusing Mr. Yeltsin of staging a coup and declaring a dictatorship.
One sign, a parody of an old slogan that says Lenin still lives, captured the demonstrators' contempt for Russia's first elected President. "Yeltsin drinks, drank and will always drink," it read, to the delight of passersby.
 
Echo of Resistance
 On the other side of the road, among the "democrats" as the old opponents of Communism are still called, there was a faint echo of the passions that had collected around the White House in August 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin was leading the resistance to an attempted coup against Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
"We elected him as President, and we will stand by him until the end," Bogdan Titov, a 45-year-old historian, said of Mr. Yeltsin. "What we have now in the country is a vacuum of power, and that is frightening."
Mr. Titov described the two demonstrations as opposing electrical fields, one positive and one negative.
"For retired people, with little money, these are difficult times," he said. "Before, people could count on having enough money to pay for their own burial. Now they can't. Those are people who think only about today. Here, we already think in a more modern way. Our world has become wider in these last few years."
 
Elsewhere, Calm
 Beyond the area around the White House, Moscow was quiet, as most Russians went about their Sunday business, absorbing the latest in a series of political shocks that have jolted their lives over the last few years. But most people were well aware of Mr. Yeltsin's speech, and the reaction it spawned among his opponents and supporters.
For some, the President's speech came as a relief, the first resolute step that might finally end the political cacophony that has filled their television screens for several months now.
"We need to come to some kind of decision," said Olimpiada Blinova, a 54-year-old engineer. "I think he should have done this a long time ago, and now I am afraid it is too late."
Support for Mr. Yeltsin has waned over the last year, as people struggle to survive with inflation that has been rising at a rate of 25 percent a month. "I was for Yeltsin during the coup and afterward," said Vika Revazova, an 18-year-old art student. "I thought he would somehow improve our lives and this country. Now I've lost confidence."
But for all the grumbling, Mr. Yeltsin still has no serious rivals for the people's affections. "There is no one else to support but Yeltsin," said Aleksandr Sidarov, a 30-year-old doctor. "At this moment, there is no one else out there."
"Life is hard," said Mariya Voloshina, a 53-year-old doctor from Yekaterinburg, Mr. Yeltsin's hometown. "I think that in the country, people don't really understand what this is all about. We haven't had human rights and freedom for that long. People don't know what freedom is."

HEADLINE: CLINTON CONSIDERS MEASURES TO HELP TROUBLED AIRLINES

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, seeking to reverse the financial plight of the nation's airlines, is considering loan guarantees and tax relief for the companies and the lifting of restrictions on foreign ownership of airlines.
The proposals are part of a broad approach that includes creation of a 15-member commission that will have 90 days to come up with recommendations. The commission has been authorized by the House; the Senate is expected to approve the idea shortly. 
 In coming to the aid of the airline industry, which has lost $10 billion in the last three years, the Administration is poised to play a far more active role than its market-oriented Republican predecessor.
Representative Norman Y. Mineta, Democrat of California and chairman of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation, said that during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, "whenever there was a problem, the Department of Transportation felt, 'Let the marketplace do its thing,' " adding, "This Administration will be much more proactive."
 
Four-Point Strategy Urged
 The General Accounting Office, the research arm of Congress, earlier this month recommended a four-point strategy; relax restrictions on foreign investment and control; enhance access abroad for United States airlines; reduce barriers to competition, including frequent-flier programs and computer reservation systems that favor the airline owning the system, and examine pricing practices, especially those of bankrupt airlines.
Yet for all the planning, there is a growing consensus in and out of Washington that an improved economy will solve many of the industry's problems, helping fill airplane seats and presumably leading to higher fares.
"Boeing told us that the best way to improve their business in Seattle was to improve the economy," Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said in an interview in his office overlooking the Potomac River. "That's the foundation of our strategy."
While some airlines, particularly weaker ones, have been courting foreign partners, an alternative under discussion in Washington is Government-sponsored loan guarantees.
 The guarantees would help airlines get lower-interest loans for the renovation or replacement of 2,600 older aircraft by the year 2000, a move required by a 1990 law that directs the airlines to use newer, quieter aircraft. This could prove a boon to the United States aircraft manufacturers, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which President Clinton has promised to help in the face of stiff competition from Airbus Industrie of Europe.
 
 
Example of Chrysler and Conrail
 "We've done that before, as a matter of domestic policy, to help Chrysler and Conrail and other transportation sectors," Mr. Pena said. "What's so different about the airline industry?
"If we think it's important to have domestically owned American airlines, we have to make sure we support that policy and not simply assume that we should allow foreign investment to occur willy-nilly and wake up in the year 2010 and realize that every airline in the U.S. has substantial ownership by foreigners."
A cautious note was sounded by Representative James L. Oberstar, Minnesota Democrat and chairman of the Aviation subcommittee, who warned: "It may be that the best thing we can do is not do anything. My biggest concern is that people are looking for a quick fix."
 
 
Industry Is Divided
 The airline industry itself is divided on several key issues. While the weaker airlines want an easing of restrictions on foreign ownership as a way of obtaining much-needed investments, stronger airlines oppose the move on the ground that it would give foreign airlines greater access to the United States domestic market but may do nothing to secure more competitive foreign markets for American carriers that fly overseas.
The stronger airlines seek tightening of the bankruptcy laws, a move opposed by the airlines that have already filed for protection from creditors. America West, T.W.A. and Continental Airlines are still in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Although many airline woes are self-inflicted -- overcapacity, overexpansion of routes and fare wars -- the White House and many legislators believe some problems stem from unfair competition from overseas airlines.
"Our domestic carriers don't have the same opportunities to access foreign markets as do foreign carriers accessing domestic markets," Mr. Pena said. "If you look at some of the bilateral agreements, they were not drafted in such a way as to give our carriers open access to European markets.
 
 
'I'm the Equalizer'
 "I'm the equalizer," he continued. "My job is to open those markets, and make sure that our domestic carriers get a fair shake and a fair break." Thus, in approving last week the British Airways investment in USAir, the Clinton Administration stipulated, in effect, that Britain had one year to provide a better operating climate for United States airlines.
Signaling his new role, Mr. Pena in February approved complaints against Japan and Australia for restrictions on American airlines that he said violated their agreements with the United States. Unless these practices are ended, Mr. Pena is empowered to limit the access of foreign airlines from those countries to the United States.
Mr. Pena is on record as favoring the current 25 percent limit on voting stock owned by foreign investors and the 49 percent limit on their overall investment, but he said that the commission would study the issue. Mr. Oberstar said the 25 percent limit should be loosened "only if foreign carriers give us the same opportunity for ownership."
 
 
Some Outdated Concerns
 The G.A.O. has noted that some of the reasons the restrictions were adopted -- protecting a fledgling industry, for example -- are no longer a concern. Allowing greater foreign investment could help some United States airlines remain competitive, the agency said, but it also acknowledged national security concerns and recommended that Congress authorize the Defense Department to review foreign ownership transactions.
Washington is sympathetic to the airline industry's request for tax relief. The industry has been hit hard by the alternative minimum tax, which assures that corporations and individuals with substantial deductions have to calculate their taxes in a manner that assures some payment.
"We have the unconscionable situation in which our carriers have lost a great sum of money but have been obliged to go out and borrow money to pay taxes," said James E. Landry, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents the major American carriers.
The AMR Corporation, American Airlines' parent company, reported a loss of $280 million for 1990 and 1991 but paid an alternative minimum tax of $234 million for those two years, said Michael J. Durham, the airline's senior vice president and chief financial officer.
 
 
Tax Relief Sought
 Since the airlines will be hit by the proposed increase in the fuel tax, some Washington policy makers say that the carriers deserve some relief from the alternative minimum tax. "If you take the cumulative effect of all these taxes and charges, it clearly affects the industry," Mr. Pena said.
The stronger airlines also want a review of the bankruptcy laws to prevent the numerous extensions received by some airlines in bankruptcy protection, under which they do not have to pay all their bills.
Mr. Durham of American Airlines said: "We failed to foresee a situation in which failed carriers would be artificially kept alive, thus perpetuating capacity excess to the market's needs. Airlines that have obviously failed and are being sustained only by the life-support system of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code are imperiling the future of all U.S. carriers."
Representative Mineta noted that "America West just got its fifth extension," adding: "This puts other carriers at a disadvantage. They have to pay all their bills on a daily basis. Bankrupt airlines are always looking for ways to increase their cash flow and offer lower fares."
 
 
Bankrupt Airlines Defended
 Representative Oberstar disagreed. "Bankrupt carriers are not the problem," he said. "It wasn't Continental or T.W.A. that offered 50 percent fares or allowed parents to fly free with kids, it was American and Northwest. To blame the bankrupt carriers for the problems of the industry just doesn't add up."
Another change Washington is contemplating is rolling back the passenger ticket tax to 2 percent from 8 percent. Also under review will be the $3 passenger charge imposed by some airports. "A great many worthwhile projects have been built with this money," Mr. Mineta said, "but a new and largely uncontrolled cost burden has also been put on the airlines at precisely the time they can least afford it."
Lowering the consumer's cost by cutting ticket taxes and passenger charges may encourage more travel, airline officials say.
The airlines also strain under the weight of what Mr. Durham of American Airlines called "unnecessary, cost-inefficient regulation."
 
 
Relief from Regulations
 One regulation that the Clinton Administration may change for airlines is the 1988 drug-testing requirement. Airlines, like trains, bus and truck companies, are required to test half their employees at random every year. "I think the alcohol and drug testing went too far," Mr. Oberstar said.
The Government is also likely to review a security measure imposed in 1989 that required airports to install elaborate computer-based employee screening systems at 270 airports. Although the initial cost estimate was $168 million, the cost now exceeds $500 million, according to Mr. Landry of the Air Transport Association.
"We now have crews unable to get to their aircraft without being escorted by security personnel," Mr. Landry said.
The airlines also say they need more runways and expanded air-traffic control capacity. Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration announced an additional 14-month delay in its modernization program, already four years behind schedule, for the air-traffic control system.
The National Business Aircraft Association, which represents the major airline associations, attributed the delay to overly optimistic schedules, a shortage of qualified F.A.A. officials, outside contractors, internal organizational problems, supervision lapses and policy mistakes.

HEADLINE: Apple Offers New System For Desktops

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 19

 BODY:
In a shift that would have been unthinkable a decade ago, Apple Computer Inc. will introduce on Monday a line of multi-user computers designed to make the company's desktop systems more appetizing for corporate buyers.
The new computer family, which features three "server" computers to store and retrieve data for networks of desktop machines, is a sharp contrast to the "one worker, one computer" credo on which Apple has stood since it was founded in the mid-1970's. 
 The new computers, called Workgroup Servers, are the first major products from Apple's enterprise systems division, a new organization that is part of the strategy of Apple's chairman, John Sculley, to place the company in a range of markets from hand-held computing to centralized corporate systems.
So-called client-server computing based on specialized data storage computers connected to desktop machines is rapidly displacing the traditional mainframe and mini-computers of the 1960's for cost and performance reasons.
 
Seeking Market Inroads
 Apple is hoping that it can defend its installed base of Macintoshes and make inroads into the rapidly growing server market by taking advantage of Macintosh ease-of-use features.
"No one has really figured out the server market at the application level," said Douglas A. Cayne, a market researcher in the Santa Clara, Calif., office of Dataquest Inc., a market research company. "Apple is absolutely in the ball park, but the big challenge is to break out of their image of being a Mac-only niche player."
The Apple Workgroup servers will range from $3,000 to $5,000 for the low-end model 60 and $9,000 to $15,000 for the high-end model 95. The systems have two to four times the data- transfer performance of Apple's top-of-the-line Quadra models.
Apple executives said there was a clear demand for the new systems from the company's customers, including classroom users and desktop publishing operations.
They also said they believed that the new Apple systems would make inroads in markets based on specific applications provided with the new computers.
 
'A Credible Offering'
 "We believe we have a credible offering and will be able to go head to head with servers offered by Compaq, I.B.M. and clone makers," said Morris Taradalsky, vice president and general manager of Apple's enterprise systems division.
Apple is counting on its ability to simplify complex programs like Oracle's relational data base management to attract corporate buyers who see ease-of-use as a cost-saving factor, Mr. Taradalsky said.
The company is also counting on interest in an innovative text-search program originally developed in Apple's advanced technology group as a research project. The program, called Applesearch, is designed to index unstructured text documents stored on a central server computer.
Applesearch is an early example of what computer scientists call "agent" software technology. These are programs that can be trained to perform some specialized task -- digesting a news wire, for example, and formatting it into a daily newspaper displayed on a computer screen.
Applesearch will also allow a computer user to search through thousands of documents quickly and find the closest relevant match to a particular query.

HEADLINE: Shakespeare Festival's Boss: Idealistic, Romantic and Busy

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
It was about a month ago, George C. Wolfe recalled, that he was asked by the executive committee of the New York Shakespeare Festival's board if he'd be interested in taking over the reins of the institution from JoAnne Akalaitis. He was. Then they asked him what he'd do with it.
"I told them what I'm passionate about," he said in an interview. "I said you can't create an oasis for writers but you can create a home for them. You can say to someone, 'I like your play; I'm going to produce it.' And then when the play is falling apart in previews, you can say, 'I'm going to produce your next play.' In New York, everyone wants a new virgin they can put on display, but careers happen over time, by feeding and nurturing. That's where you get brilliant work." 
 He also spoke to the committee about establishing a working environment for actors, where the polished and experienced work in tandem with the youthful and promising "so there's a passing on of information and technique." And he spoke about producing a regular program of classics and of his "overriding passion" for diversity in programming and casting.
"We've got to create a theater that looks, feels and smells like America," he said. "You don't wait until February to discover Negroes. You don't do Latin writers for a week."
 
'Idealistic and Romantic'
 Mr. Wolfe, a man who barely needs prodding to vault into loquacity, managed to restrain his enthusiasm for a moment. "Of course this is very idealistic and romantic," he said. "But I haven't started yet. It's the time to be idealistic and romantic."
Romance and idealism are, unfortunately, only a couple of the requirements of the task Mr. Wolfe assumed with the board's announcement of his appointment last Monday. He will, the board hopes, restore the vibrancy and eminence of the festival and its primary venue, the Joseph Papp Public Theater, that many felt had been dissipated since Papp's death in October 1991. Like Ms. Akalaitis, Mr. Wolfe comes to his new post with estimable credits as an artist, but few as producer and none as administrator or fund-raiser.
He is taking the reins of an institution that has been running at a deficit for eight years, and whose reserve fund -- largely the money earned by "A Chorus Line" which the Shakespeare Festival produced -- has dipped from $19 million to about $15 million since 1985.
"The fiscal picture is sobering but not fatal," said Larry E. Condon, the chairman of the board's executive committee.
A three-year-budget, enacted by the board in 1992 in response to the institution's slipping fortunes, cut administrative expenses by 40 percent and staff by 50 percent, though at the same time the budget for productions was increased slightly, the idea being that it is what the festival puts on the stage that draws not only audiences but also corporate and private donor interest. To put it another way, the more excitement the place generates, the more people with money want to be associated with it.
 
Donations Run Behind
 Board members confirmed, though not for attribution, that one reason they soured on Ms. Akalaitis was that her artistic choices -- her reputation is for favoring a bleak-viewed and somewhat arcane strain of drama -- did not create that kind of buzz. Indeed, charitable donations from both private and business sources are running slightly behind board projections this year. Among board members there was evidently some irritation at Ms. Akalaitis's choosing to present a limited run of a large, expensive production -- " 'Tis Pity She's a Whore,' " which she directed herself last year -- while several stages at the Public remained persistently dark.
Of course it remains to be seen whether Mr. Wolfe's choices as producer will prove more economically prudent, more multifarious or more ingratiating. But already there are signs that philanthropic sources have perked up.
"We've gotten inquiries from several people who want to join the board," said John Breglio, a lawyer for the festival, adding that a number of them are wealthy. "They want to sit on the board because they think there's real hope here."
Mr. Condon said the committee briefly considered candidates other than Mr. Wolfe. "But there was no one else we approached directly," he said. "We looked at his work historically; we looked at his recent work. And Joe had wanted George to have a role at the Public. He'd wanted him to have a theater. It's important to put the Joe connection in there. Ultimately the choice was quite natural."
 
Busy Days and Nights
 But it isn't as though he needed the job. Mr. Wolfe, who is just 38, already had plenty on his plate. He has been spending his days lately directing rehearsals of "Angels in America," Tony Kushner's long-awaited play, part one of which opens on Broadway next month, and many of his nights finishing the editing of "Fires in the Mirror," a film version of Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman show he's directing for American Playhouse. Then there are the cast changes in "Jelly's Last Jam," the Broadway musical he wrote and directed. Mr. Wolfe has been helping Ben Vereen and Brian Mitchell -- who are replacing Keith David and Gregory Hines, respectively, over the next several weeks -- get ready for their roles.
"January February March have been this vrrrooom!" Mr. Wolfe said, using, characteristically, an onomatopoeic plosion to make a point, and punctuating it with a sweeping hand gesture meant to approximate a whirlwind.
Mr. Wolfe is a slight man, bespectacled, a little owlish, with a brand-new short-short haircut whose graying stubble he runs his hands over a lot. Expressive in manner, maybe a little moody, he can go from belly laugh to teasing wisecrack to rumination in a couple of winks. He pays attention and reacts quickly, occasionally with a birdlike darting of his head, as if searching for answers in thin air.
A supremely confident writer and director, he is perfectly willing to call himself arrogant -- not unlike Joseph Papp -- and freely says he has a reputation among actors and playwrights "for being incredibly strong-willed, for not giving in, for always getting my way."
But it appears that also like Papp, he inspires intense loyalty among those who work with him. Indeed, Mr. Wolfe's reputation for ebullience and high energy was clearly part of his appeal for the festival board. Though board members cite, as the reasons for their selection of Mr. Wolfe, his interest in establishing an "inclusive" theater, his insistence on a classical presence at the festival and his desire to nurture writers, these were all stated goals of Ms. Akalaitis as well. It's also true that Ms. Akalaitis was chosen to succeed Papp by Papp himself.
 
Courage if Not Charisma
 Ms. Akalaitis is also frequently described by her supporters -- and indeed, even by the board members who ousted her -- as "an uncompromising artist," a woman "with the courage of her convictions." But what few people would grant her is Mr. Wolfe's charisma, a quality that for an institution competing for both artistic talent and charitable funds, is obviously a plus if not a necessity.
George C. Wolfe grew up in Frankfort, Ky., where his mother was a teacher, then the principal, of the all-black grade school he attended. His father was a clerk in the state government. As he described his growing up, it was clear where his ambition and outlook come from.
"I was 13 or 14 before I was thrust into the white world," he said. "And ever since then it's become clearer and clearer to me that I was part of a generation of black children who were raised like integration soldiers, who were groomed to invade white America.
"I don't know how conscious it was, but with my parents it was definitely: 'They think you're less than; you've got to be better than.' There's this warrior energy I learned early on that has served me well in the theater."
Mr. Wolfe attended Pomona College in California, where he studied acting and design. After graduation he went to Los Angeles, where he began writing, directing plays and teaching at a culture center in the inner city.
He moved to New York in 1979, he said, "and I struggled for six or seven years." Then in 1986 his play "The Colored Museum" was produced at the Shakespeare Festival. "That's when my career started to feed me," he said.
Since then he has written "Spunk," an adaptation of three stories by Zora Neale Hurston, which he also directed at the Shakespeare Festival. There, he also directed Thulani Davis's adaptation of Brecht's "Caucasian Chalk Circle." He was responsible for bringing "Fires in the Mirror" to the Shakespeare Festival two years ago, and he has twice produced, at the Public, a series of performance pieces by artists of color.
It was three years ago, Mr. Wolfe said, that Joseph Papp approached him with a proposal to give him a theater to run under the auspices of the New York Shakespeare Festival. He turned the offer down to work on "Jelly's Last Jam," which was about to go into workshop at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.
 
Entirely in His Hands
 But as of this moment he has got the whole shebang. He'll be overseeing a festival production budget of roughly $4 million next year, the schedule for which will be entirely in his hands. Given his other obligations, he said, "I'll obviously have to move in in stages."
For now, Mr. Wolfe said, he'll be concentrating on learning the organization; his plans, he said, include changes in both artistic and business personnel. Asked if he found his looming administrative responsibilities daunting, Mr. Wolfe scoffed. "Daunting is the responsibility of trying to create a cultural institution that allows old and new ideas to blend," he said. "Daunting is making the place into a reflection of my passion for what theater can and should do." As for his administrative role, he added: "I'll get better at it every day. I can learn rules."
The one pressing artistic decision is to fill a hole in the summer Shakespeare program in Central Park -- Ms. Akalaitis has withdrawn from her scheduled direction of "Henry VIII" -- which he will do in conjunction with the festival's newly named artistic associate, Kevin Kline.
And the rest of next season? "It's too soon," he said. "But I've got lots of exciting things in my head. Stay tuned."

For Toronto, the Change May Not Be for the Better

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUNEDIN, Fla., March 21

 BODY:
Making changes, one baseball theory goes, is good for a championship team because it keeps the remaining players from becoming complacent.
"It depends on the changes," Jack Morris, who has been around long enough to know all of the theories, said today. "I don't think it helped the Tigers much in the mid-80's. They made a lot of changes and it didn't help that club at all. They got progressively worse until 1990." 
 Morris pitched for those Detroit teams and knows whereof he speaks. As he spoke, however, he hoped he wasn't presaging the future of his current team, the Toronto Blue Jays. Between the time they won the World Series last October and the start of spring training, the Blue Jays made wholesale changes on their roster, shedding 9 of the 25 players (36 percent) who brought the World Series and the world championship to Canada for the first time.
 
/Winfield Key Loss
 Gone, among others, is the soul of the championship effort and the man who drove in the Series-clinching runs, Dave Winfield; gone is the man who hit a critical home run in the final game, Candy Maldonado; gone is the left side of the infield, Manny Lee and Kelly Gruber; gone is half of the starting pitching rotation, David Cone and Jimmy Key; gone is the relief pitcher who saved two of the four victories, Tom Henke.
"Sure, we lost a lot," Manager Cito Gaston readily acknowledged, "but we're not going to make any excuses. We'll have a different ball club this year."
But will they have as good a club? As Harold Reynolds, a veteran second baseman who moved from Seattle to Baltimore this off season, said Saturday: "Chemistry has so much to do with a team over the course of a season. Losing Dave Winfield might hurt them a little bit. He's a winner. He understands those principles. I think they'll miss him. You can look at the A's when they got rid of Dave Parker. They became a whole different club. There's something to be said about the stability of a ball club. Statistics don't tell you everything about a club."
 
Key Acquisitions
 The Blue Jays lost most of their departed players as free agents, some of whom they tried to re-sign, some they let go by economic design. To counter some of the losses, they signed two productive veterans, Paul Molitor to take Winfield's place as their designated hitter and Dave Stewart to shore up their starting pitching.
Duane Ward will replace Henke as the closer and Mike Timlin will try to take Ward's place as the closer's setup man, but the other positions remain unsettled two weeks before the start of the season.
Gaston most likely has a firmer idea of what he wants to do than he indicated today, but he named groups of players whom he said he is considering for left field, third base, shortstop and the fifth pitching spot. The jobs should go to Derek Bell for left, Ed Sprague for third, Dick Schofield for short and Pat Hentgen or Al Leiter for the starting rotation.
"What we lose," Gaston said of the changes, "is experience and defense. "We have a little more speed and less power unless some of the kids come through."
Morris, who with Winfield was brought in last year to drive the Blue Jays over the last hurdle, said he thought the team was good enough to win again but added: "It's a question of whether we have the attitude to win again. Do we have people willing to sacrifice like they did last year to win?"
Morris indicated that he hasn't seen that attitude this spring but quickly noted that it was still early. After the Blue Jays lost to the Texas Rangers, 5-2, today, they had a 4-13 exhibition record, but they won last year after having the next-to-worst exhibition record among American League teams.
Todd Stottlemyre, one of the remaining starters, suggested that some of the players who didn't contribute as much to the championship season as some of those who have departed will have to perform better this season. The right- hander, who had a 12-11 record, said he was one of those players.
"It's not like the club said O.K., we won, now we're going to cut and slash; we don't care," said Stottlemyre, whose spring record dropped to 0-2 when he gave up all five Texas runs in the fourth inning today. "This organization cares. One thing about this club is when they lose a player, they seem to bring in someone who is equal or better."
 
Weaker, Says Consensus
 The general feeling among baseball people, though, is the Blue Jays emerged from the flurry of changes with a net loss.
Molitor, playing for only his second major league team after 15 years with the Milwaukee Brewers, said it was too early to make that judgment.
"It's a difficult thing to measure," he said. "The irony is this is a championship ball club and it has such a different look from last year. There have been dramatic changes. There will be inevitable comparisons. When you're successful and you make changes and then if you don't do well, people will say if it ain't broke, why fix it."

HEADLINE: Let This Home Port Die

 BODY:
Every community affected by the Clinton Administration's plan for military base closings is in an uproar, and New York is no exception. The Staten Island home port means jobs and economic activity in a recession-strapped city. But its champions no longer have a convincing argument.
The Navy's elaborate and costly system of dispersing the fleet to every Congressional district with a port never had a strong military rationale and was always a classic example of "port barrel" politics. But the Government claimed that the country needed a network of naval bases for national security and established 21 of them. 
 The end of the cold war weakened the argument that dispersing the Navy's ships would reduce America's vulnerability to surprise attack. As part of a broader base-closing plan, Defense Secretary Les Aspin proposes shutting down all or part of six home ports, including the Staten Island base.
Those elected officials fighting for the port, including Mayor David Dinkins, Borough President Guy Molinari and Senator Al D'Amato, would do better to pursue Federal aid to smooth the transition to civilian employment. President Clinton proposes spending $20 billion over five years to help defense workers find new jobs.
Elected officials have a key role to play, too, in devising productive uses for the home port's property and resources. There is no way that losing nearly 3,000 civilian and military jobs can be pain-free. But realistic leadership in New York and Washington can at least soften the blow.

HEADLINE: Now That Home Port's Dead, Let's Put That Land to Good Use

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A list of proposed base closings that accompanies "2 California Bases Spared From List of Military Cuts" (front page, March 12) includes the Staten Island home port. But your article makes no comment on the local case. Now that Guy Molinari, Staten Island Borough President, and Representative Susan Molinari, his daughter, no longer have a friend in the White House, even former supporters of the base apparently see its closing as inevitable. 
 Not quite 10 years ago, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato stood on the deck of the aircraft carrier Intrepid and told us about all the economic benefits that would come to our city once this new base in the Stapleton section was completed. Pathetically few jobs ever materialized, though $200 million or more of Federal funds went into building a facility that many knew from the start was unnecessary and, worse, potentially catastrophic for this region once nuclear missiles were stationed there.
Now it is up to Senator D'Amato to make sure that as the base is decommissioned, this valuable waterfront land does not lie fallow behind barbed wire fences. At the very least, access to the pier for fishing and other public recreation must be promptly established and a few of the buildings must be immediately renovated to provide vocational training and other space needed by Staten Islanders.
Full redevelopment of this site requires careful study by city or state agencies. Even then, Senator D'Amato, Mayor David N. Dinkins and other elected representatives must see to it that the process is expedited so the home port becomes truly a port for its hometown, Stapleton, as soon as possible.

Obey The Law Of S.& D.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the long-ago days when I was a hotshot flack, I hired a young woman to place our clients on radio and television shows. She was terrific in ways it is no longer correct to use as criteria -- quick mind, great legs, go-get-'em attitude -- and after six months at $65 a week, she asked for a $10 raise.
Look, kid, I said with insufferable avuncularity, you deserve the 10 bucks. But there's this economic thing that restrains me called the Law of Supply and Demand. 
 She asked me to explain it in human terms. I pointed out how very few jobs existed with the glamour and excitement of radio-TV press agent -- ergo, low supply. And every ambitious, bright knockout in New York City wanted her job -- which meant high demand.
Put that high demand together with the low supply and you had a downward pressure on her salary; the result was a coolie wage, a term not then an ethnic slur. Sorry, kid, I told her, no raise yet; someday you'll thank me for the economics lesson.
That cruel-world episode was brought to mind when I was trying to discern the economic philosophy of the Clinton Administration.
On the redistribution of income, the Robin Hood approach is apparent in this week's budget resolution: steal from the rich and give to the poor and portray anybody who objects as the Sheriff of Nottingham.
On the control of health care costs, however, the shore is but dimly seen. We know that 37 million uncovered people (they're not naked; they just don't have insurance) are to be given coverage, thereby increasing demand.
What is to be done to increase the supply of medical services to offset the upward pressure of that new demand? We don't know; but before any long-range "managed competition" or "global budgets" are to be put in place, insiders murmur, Mrs. Clinton's secret committee plans to limit increases in health insurance premiums and place a ceiling (now rakishly worn as a "cap") on charges by hospitals, doctors and pill rollers.
Price control. The very phrase sends a chill up my spine, as it is the ultimate government interference with the free market's fundament, the Law of Supply and Demand.
If health-service cost is to be controlled by fiat, it follows that supply must be rationed. For price control to work, money can no longer determine what is bought, except on black markets.
Price control also ultimately means wage control: not just reducing the fevered swelling of the incomes of doctors, but freezing the wages of the hospital attendant who crashes your gurney into the elevator door.
Could it be that the task of Hillary's task force is force? A few weeks ago, trying to deep-background my way into the mind of a Clinton intimate, I was stunned by a counter-question: Wasn't it true that I had written President Nixon's speech of Aug. 15, 1972, imposing wage and price controls?
Look, kid, I said, reverting to type, that's not something for anybody, least of all a right-winger, to be proud of. Controls, a border tax, suspending the convertibility of gold, the whole statist works -- I wrapped it in words, even labeled it the New Economic Policy until somebody discovered in the nick of time that that was the name of Lenin's program. Some of the guys broke into the Watergate; I wrote the price-control speech -- where was the greater sin?
Peacetime price control was a colossal flop. Even Nixon, never big on contrition, rolls his eyes when he remembers that ignoble experiment. We put on a lid that distorted the free economy, and inflation was worse when the law of Supply and Demand demanded enforcement.
Hillaryites! Whatever you do to redistribute health care -- and we can all agree on the need to curb patient greed -- forget price control. It is always justified as an emergency measure, starts off popular, and winds up an unpopular mess. Instead, base your changes on the inexorable workings of the Law of S.& D.; make its freedom work for you.
Years after I denied that young woman a raise, I was impelled to call her with congratulations when she became the first journalist to break the million-dollar-a-year salary barrier.
"You remember that cockamamie law you told me about when we were a couple of kids?" said Barbara Walters (for it was she, as the sportscaster Bill Stern used to say). "It works both ways!"

HEADLINE: To the Barricades With Mr. Yeltsin

 BODY:
In a grim stab at arresting Russia's slide into chaos, President Boris Yeltsin is appealing to the people to shore up his flagging authority. By backing him, President Clinton has put the United States firmly behind efforts to build a new Russia that rests on the consent of the governed.
That is the right role for this country. America has no interest in taking sides in Russia's internal struggle over the proper relationship of the president and the Parliament. Nor can it prescribe the exact economic path for Russia to take. But it has an enormous stake in Russia's peaceful transition to democracy and prosperity. 
 The most immediate threat to democracy may not be authoritarian rule but the breakdown of all legal authority. For any economy, whether state-run or market-oriented, to work, contracts must be legally enforceable. For any democracy to function, the government needs the ability to act, with the support of its citizens.
Mr. Yeltsin has taken two steps to renew his own ability to govern, both of which the Parliament has begun to challenge. He has scheduled a referendum for April 25 to renew his popular mandate and to endorse a new constitution. In the meantime, he intends to rule by decree.
Former party hacks and state industry managers in the Parliament are using its authority, based on the outmoded Brezhnev Constitution, to wage a legalistic war against Mr. Yeltsin. He is turning to the people for authority, and a new constitution, to offset his opponents' destabilizing efforts.
Some of Mr. Yeltsin's opponents want to create chaos in order to restore the old order. And state managers are exploiting disorder to line their pockets. The central bank, under Parliament's protection, keeps printing rubles in order to keep their enterprises going and their profits flowing. But that is fueling hyperinflation. The resulting political ferment could sweep the hacks and the managers away, along with Mr. Yeltsin.
That's just one danger among many. Mr. Yeltsin also faces a battered and cynical public, breakaway regions of Russia and a restive military.
As Senator Sam Nunn suggests, Washington can rally the West to help Mr. Yeltsin by providing direct aid to those in need, like inoculations for the country's children and housing for demobilized military officers. At the same time the White House needs to think about what may follow if Mr. Yeltsin fails.
Until now Russia has had a remarkably bloodless revolution from above, directed by more or less reformist elites. Deep divisions in the elites now put that revolution at risk. By siding with Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Clinton is trying to keep it going.

Fights Loom as U.S. Nears Debt Limit

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
An old show is about to play Washington again -- the debt ceiling fandango. It hasn't been seen, mercifully, since the fall of 1990, when the Government bumped up against its limit on borrowing seven times from August through November.
Since then, the Government and Congress have enjoyed the longest respite from such scenes since World War II. But they will have at least two encounters this year over whether to raise the debt limit. 
 The stage was set for the showdowns last week with a ritual letter from Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to the leaders in the House and the Senate. He rounded up the usual reasons and the usual subjects as hostages -- Social Security recipients.
 
April Deadline Looms
 "Currently, our best estimate is that the Treasury will run out of cash and room under the current $4,145 billion debt limit on April 7 as Social Security recipients and others attempt to cash their checks," he wrote.
As in previous seasons, that deadline will occur during a Congressional break. Congress is scheduled to leave Washington for a district work period on April 2. Congressional desires to go home on time might undermine any attempts to use the issue as a platform for debate on the Federal budget and the record budget deficit, if not worse mischief.
The stakes are high. Congress's failure or refusal to approve appropriations has led to the partial closing of the Government, the last episode being in the fall of 1990. But that is mild compared with debt ceiling battles, which have brought the Government to the brink of default, forced the cancellation or delay of regular Treasury auctions and even led the Government to dip into Social Security funds to avoid a crisis.
April 7 is the so-called drop-dead date for the Treasury. That is when the Treasury is expected to run out of cash and bump up against the debt ceiling, meaning it could not borrow to pay its bills.
 
Bentsen Asks for More
 Mr. Bentsen has asked Congress to approve an increase in the debt ceiling by Friday. The temporary limit would be $4.37 trillion and would likely accommodate Government needs through Sept. 30, the end of the 1993 fiscal year. At that time, the Treasury would seek another increase based on the budget and deficit-reduction plan that Congress is now considering.
If Congress does not act on Mr. Bentsen's request by Friday, the Treasury may have to announce its one-year bill auction for April 1 with the cautionary statement that the auction will not be held if the debt ceiling has not been raised.
 
Room to Maneuver
 These deadlines, however, are not precise. Much depends on the flow of money, like the corporate tax payments now coming in to the Government.
Louis Crandall, the chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said that his analysis showed the Government might be able to get past April 7 without additional borrowing authority.
The reason, he said, is that the Government's total borrowing will bump up against the ceiling for just one day, April 7. Because of the accounting of Social Security payments, the total Government debt will decline by several billion dollars the following day, giving the Treasury a little room for more borrowing.
This will happen because the Government will sell the securities in the Social Security Trust Fund on April 8 and 9 to cover the checks that go to recipients on April 2. These Treasury securities are included in the total debt calculation. As they are sold, the Government's borrowing total will fall below the debt ceiling, Mr. Crandall said.
With this breathing room, the Treasury could borrow more, he said, and probably make it to April 15.
The Treasury could even avoid bumping up against the debt ceiling, he suggested, by borrowing a little less in the 20-day cash management bill sale that is expected at the end of the month. If the Treasury reached the ceiling, it would not pose a serious problem as long as the Government had the cash to pay bills and did not need to borrow. But if the ceiling is reached and the Treasury waits until the decline in outstanding debt on April 8-9 to do more borrowing, the one-year bill auction expected on April 1 might have to be canceled.
 
Is Crisis Possible?
 Mr. Crandall is not advocating such a course. But his analysis shows how hard it can be to pin down the Government's drop-dead date and the potential for maneuvering to avoid a crisis. Treasury officials want to convince Congress that it must act, but they are also thinking of some angle to protect against default if Congress balks.
Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, said he did not see any leeway for the Treasury. But if the pace of corporate tax payments is faster than expected, the drop-dead date could be postponed because the Government would have the cash it needed on hand, he added.
When asked about Mr. Crandall's views, a Treasury official said Friday that current estimates show the Treasury will not have enough cash to pay all the bills due on April 7 even if it borrows up to the debt limit. Therefore, the Treasury has no room to maneuver, he said, to take advantage of its ability to resume borrowing after April 7 as the total debt declines.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN MOSCOW;
CHRISTOPHER BACKS YELTSIN VOTE PLAN; SEEKS MORE U.S. AID

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 22

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher today endorsed President Boris N. Yeltsin's call for a national referendum, and coupled it with an appeal to the American people to support increased financial aid to Russia.
In the Administration's fullest statement on Russia since Mr. Yeltsin claimed emergency powers on Saturday, Mr. Christopher described the Russian political crisis as the "greatest strategic challenge of our time." He gave strong backing to the embattled Russian leader, signaling that the United States would support him as long as he acted peacefully and guaranteed civil liberties. 
 In his first policy speech as secretary, at the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. Christopher issued a clear warning to Mr. Yeltsin's opponents that the only hope for maintaining Washington's new friendship was a continued movement toward democracy and a market economy.
 
Faith in the People
 "President Yeltsin has called for a national plebiscite to resolve the constitutional impasse," Mr. Christopher said, referring to the referendum that Mr. Yeltsin announced on Saturday for April 25 in which the Russian people will have the opportunity to endorse Mr. Yeltsin's program and call for a new constitution and a new Parliament. "In doing so, he has again demonstrated his faith that the only force that can guarantee reform is the people, the Russian people," Mr. Christopher said. [Excerpts, page A13.]
"The most important point is that Russia must remain a democracy moving toward a market economy," he added. "This is the basis, the only basis for our new U.S.-Russian partnership."
Mr. Christopher's speech was part of was a steadily increasing campaign of support for Mr. Yeltsin by the Clinton Administration that followed Washington's initially hesitant reaction last week to the unfolding events in Russia. On Tuesday, the President is expected to take up the effort at his first formal White House news conference, scheduled for 1 P.M. Eastern time.
 
A Hint to Wealthy Nations
 Mr. Christopher's speech had numerous purposes beyond trying to shore up Mr. Yeltsin: to show America's leadership on the world stage, to rally the American people and Congress behind aid to Russia at a time when domestic concerns are foremost, and more broadly to persuade Americans not to move into isolationism. He also seemed to be trying to nudge some of the other industrialized nations, most notably Japan, to come to Russia's aid.
Mr. Christopher delivered his speech today in the subdued, nearly deadpan manner typical of the lawyer-turned-diplomat. But the language was unusually categorical for a Secretary of State as he pledged stepped-up economic aid to Russia and tried to make a case for spending more money overseas.
"Helping the Russian people to build a free society and a market economy -- this is the greatest strategic challenge of our time," he said. "Bringing Russia, one of history's most powerful nations, into the family of peaceful nations will serve our highest security, economic and moral interests."
Before an audience of about 800 business executives and Government officials, he added: "For America and the world, the stakes are just monumental. If we succeed, we will have established the foundations for our lasting security into the next century."
Mr. Christopher warned that if Russia plunged into anarchy or despotism, the United States could pay a severe price, including a renewed nuclear threat, higher military spending, the loss of new markets and spreading instability.
Asserting that the United States must not walk away from its role as world leader, Mr. Christopher compared the choice America now faces to those faced in two of the century's watershed moments.
"We stand again at a historical crossroads," he said. "It is very reminiscent of the crossroads that we faced in 1918 and 1945. Then we were summoned after conflicts to lead the world by building a new peace. After World War I we chose to retreat, and the consequences were disastrous. However, after World War II, our leaders had the wisdom to answer the call."
 
Support for Reformers
 Mr. Christopher did not predict who would win the showdown between Mr. Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament, but he did say that there would be ups and downs in Russia's moves toward democracy and that Washington must continue to back the democratic reformers even when they are down.
"Our engagement with the reformers must be for the long haul -- when they're out as well as when they're in, when they're down as well as when they're up," he said.
Mr. Christopher said Mr. Clinton would outline his plans for helping Russia when he meets with Mr. Yeltsin in Vancouver, British Columbia, on April 3 and 4. Nonetheless, his speech hinted at several aid programs that the wealthy nations may be planning to help Moscow.
He talked of the need for a safety net for Russia's neediest children, old people and unemployed workers. He also said that it was important to provide more help to Russia's decaying oil industry, which he said could ultimately provide huge amounts of export income for Russia, and talked of providing more help for Russia's privatization efforts and for dismantling its nuclear weapons.
 
Meeting of Wealthy Nations
 He said that the foreign ministers and finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations might meet in April to discuss an aid package for Russia. He also disclosed that President Yeltsin had been invited to the meeting of Group of Seven leaders scheduled for Tokyo in July. The Group of Seven includes the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
"We should extend to the Russian people not a hand of pity, but a hand of partnership," he said.
He said this was vital because Russia was carrying out three simultaneous revolutions, all of them difficult: from totalitarianism to democracy, from a command economy to one that is market-based, and from an empire into a modern nation-state.
"Russia's reformers are now looking to the West for support in this moment of extreme difficulty," he said. "The United States has a deep self-interest in responding to this historic challenge."
Mr. Christopher said he did not intend to neglect Ukraine or other former Soviet republics. But he asserted that he was focusing on Russia partly out of concern for the welfare of all, saying "the future security of Russia's neighbors depends so heavily on the success of Russia's own democratic revolution."

HEADLINE: The Health Agenda: 6 Weeks and Counting -- A status report.;
Clinton Health-Care Planners Are Facing Delicate Decisions

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
In a marathon series of meetings over the weekend, Administration officials started to whittle down the options and to draft recommendations for President Clinton's ambitious plan to reinvent the American health-care system.
The President and his health team already know their general approach to curbing runaway medical costs and extending coverage to all Americans: a vast change in the way medical care is organized and delivered. Most patients and doctors would join groups like health maintenance organizations, accepting limits on their choices in return for lower costs. 
 But in the six weeks remaining in the President's timetable, as the planners refine details and begin to confront fiscal reality, Administration officials face some painful choices.
 
Ideas and Hazards
 They have said they want not only to guarantee coverage for more than 35 million people who are now uninsured, but also to include costly items like long-term care, prescription drugs and mental health care among the basic benefits guaranteed to all Americans.
But the politically hazardous prospect of additional taxes, on top of those already proposed in the President's economic package, may force the Administration to scale back its desires, and in coming weeks the health task force and Mr. Clinton may have to drop some cherished goals.
From public statements by officials, interviews with members of the President's health team and internal documents, it is possible to outline many of the main choices that must still be made by May 1, when Mr. Clinton has said he will send his proposal to Congress.
Such a status report discloses that many of the most politically sensitive decisions remain to be made, including what new requirements to impose on small businesses, whether to levy new taxes on employee health benefits and what kinds of cost controls to install. Already, though, it is clear that Mr. Clinton will propose one of the most far-reaching changes in American social policy in a half-century. The health care industry industry accounts for one-seventh of the nation's economy, and the President's proposal will touch the lives of virtually all Americans.
"Reforming the health-care system will involve Government-led changes on a scale not attempted since Social Security," says Ira C. Magaziner, the manager of Hillary Rodham Clinton's Task Force on National Health Care Reform.
As numbingly complex as it is far-reaching, the proposal is certain to become a focus of bitter debate, and its prospects in Congress are unclear. Some liberals fear that the plan may give too much power to large insurance companies, while some conservatives say it will mean too much government meddling with the freedom of doctors and patients. Hospitals, doctors, insurers, employers and consumers will all be profoundly affected and can be expected to try to reshape the details or the basic approach.
Even some of Mr. Clinton's allies say the initiative may be too ambitious, too complex and too costly.
But Administration officials insist that a comprehensive proposal, reorganizing the entire health system, is necessary for both humanitarian and pragmatic reasons: to aid the millions of people who have inadequate health insurance or none at all, and to control costs that have soared to a level of nearly $1 trillion a year, 14 percent of the national output last year.
 
Basics Are Decided
 The President has decided on the basic strategy: "managed competition" by networks of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies, operating within the framework of a national budget for all health-care spending, public and private.
What that means is a transformation of American health care, offering the prospect of lower costs and more security, in return for less choice by consumers and doctors, most of whom may be forced to join prepaid plans like the health maintenance organizations that many people belong to now.
A snag in the complex process developed over the weekend when Mrs. Clinton's father suffered a stroke. She scrapped her health-care-related meetings today, and the White House said she has not decided when she will leave Little Rock, Ark., where her father is hospitalized, and resume her schedule.
What follows is a guide to issues in the debate and options that are currently being considered.
 
The Strategy
Health Coverage For Everyone
 Some critics of Mr. Clinton's managed competition approach argue that a system like Canada's, in which the Government pays for most health care with tax money, would be simpler and more fair. But that system would collide with strong anti-government sentiment in American politics, while the managed competition approach combines free-market forces with Federal regulation.
The Clinton plan would guarantee coverage for all by requiring employers to provide a package of basic benefits to their workers, with the Government paying for the unemployed. The plan would seek to hold down costs by creating a more competitive market.
At the heart of the plan would be large purchasing groups, representing at least a million people in a state or region. These, and the big private employers, would shop around for high-quality health care at a low price. The purchasing groups would act as bargaining agents for their members, which would include small employers and individuals, negotiating prices with networks of doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. Most networks would operate like health maintenance organizations, offering a wide range of services in return for fixed monthly payments.
 
The H.M.O. Dispute
 Forty million Americans are now clients of in health maintenance organizations. Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, many more Americans would be pushed into such prepaid group plans, one of the most disputed aspects of the approach.
Health economists say H.M.O.'s offer the best means of standardizing the quality of care and curbing costs. They note that while patients might lose some accustomed freedoms, they could gain peace of mind because the Government would guarantee comprehensive coverage at predictable prices, even if workers changed jobs or developed serious illness.
Consumers could buy extra coverage with their own money. And they would have a wider selection of practitioners as more doctors joined the local network.
But many people are apt to resist a change in the family doctor, and some experts fear that competition over price among health groups could lead to dangerous scrimping on care.
 
<The Employer's Role
The Burden Is on Business
 By requiring employers to provide insurance for workers and their dependents, Mr. Clinton's plan would have business, not Government, pay most of the bill for covering those who are now uninsured. Roughly 85 percent of the uninsured live in families headed by workers.
Now White House officials are trying to decide how to define "employer" and "employee." The question is important because more and more workers hold part-time jobs, and many small businesses say they cannot afford to pay for health benefits. Mr. Clinton's plan is certain to generate hostility from some small businesses or those that pay low wages. Should an employer have to buy health insurance for an employee who works 17 hours a week? Or 25 hours? Or for an employee earning the minimum wage?
Work papers from the task force say, "Employers will be required to make at least a partial payment for the cost of each worker's health insurance."
The employer's share ranges from 50 percent to 80 percent under the various options. If the employer's contributions were limited in this way, there would be a strong incentive to choose the cheapest plan. Neither employers nor employees would have the option of choosing to remain outside the system.
 
The Basic Benefits
Health Insurance Becomes a Right
 Under the plan being considered, all Americans would have a legally enforceable right to a standard package of benefits. The package will probably be modeled after that now required of H.M.O.'s. It will cover medically necessary doctors' services and hospital care. It will emphasize basic and preventive care, including prenatal care, immunizations, mammograms and routine check-ups.
Congress could prescribe the benefits in great detail, or it could leave those decisions to a national health board. Any forum for discussion of the standard package will be a cockpit for fierce lobbying, as doctors, dentists, podiatrists, equipment suppliers and others, plus consumer groups, seek coverage of particular services and new technology.
If a national board tries to cut costs by eliminating coverage of treatments deemed ineffective or too costly, consumers and patients are sure to complain that the Government is depriving them of necessary care.
Administration officials say they also want to cover prescription drugs, mental health care and long-term care. Despite strong political and medical reasons to include such items in the standard package, health-care experts say it is difficult to calculate and control costs of these services.
 
The Financing
Delicate Debate On More Taxes
 Administration officials estimate that it will cost the Government anywhere from $30 billion to $90 billion a year to guarantee health care for all Americans. Businesses will cover most of the uninsured, but new taxes are inevitable because the savings in national health spending under the plan will come slowly and will be spread throughout society.
Mr. Clinton has said he favors higher taxes on cigarettes as a source of revenue. The Federal tax is now 24 cents a package. The Administration is considering proposing an increase to $1 or $2 a package.
The Government collected $5 billion in tobacco taxes last year. A $2 cigarette tax might produce as much as $20 billion a year. But it would also probably reduce smoking, and Federal officials are trying to refine their revenue estimates to take account of that.
Businesses can now take a tax deduction for the full amount they pay for employee health plans. The Administration is considering a proposal to limit such deductions to the value of the standard package of benefits, as offered by the cheapest H.M.O. in a region. This would in theory lead companies to encourage their employees to join low-cost plans.
Similarly, the Government could impose a limit on the health benefits that employees receive tax free, but for political reasons, the Administration is unlikely to propose what would be, in effect, a new tax on workers.
While Congress clearly wants to act on health care, many lawmakers will be reluctant to approve tax increases this year beyond those in the President's economic plan.
 
The Cost Controls
Complicated Search For Spending Limits
 To curb the soaring cost of health care immediately, if for no other reason than to staunch the flow of tax money into Medicare and Medicaid, Mr. Clinton may ask Congress for the power to impose "interim cost controls" on doctors, hospitals, drug companies, clinical laboratories and suppliers of medical equipment.
Such a regulatory regime sounds simple, but would be difficult to design and enforce because the health-care industry is infinitely complex and continually changing asnew technology appears.
Work papers from the task force show Mr. Clinton is considering several options: "an absolute freeze" on prices charged by doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers; Federal limits on increases in private health insurance premiums, or a Federal decree stipulating that private insurers must use formulas for computing payments to doctors and hospitals similar to those established over the last decade for Medicare, the Federal insurance program for the elderly.
By restricting increases in private health insurance premiums, the Government would limit the revenues of health insurance companies, which would then have a strong new incentive to limit payments to doctors and hospitals. Health-care providers warn that such limits may lower the quality of care.
 
The Timetable
Striving to Hasten A Tangled Process
 The Administration is determined to make a swift transition to the new health-care system, if only to show some results before the 1996 elections. Work papers from the task force say it will take at least 20 months for the new system to begin operation after a bill is signed into law.
Under one option listed in the documents, the Federal Government would establish health insurance purchasing cooperatives in each state within six months or a year after Congress authorized them. Another option says that "states shall designate" such purchasing groups within six months or a year. The Administration is considering various forms of "financial and technical assistance" to encourage the rapid growth of consumer purchasing groups and networks of health-care providers like H.M.O.'s.
Federal officials suggest that they have no desire to make immediate changes in Medicare, so elderly people can probably keep the doctors they use now. But officials are considering gradual changes to make Medicare compatible with the new program. For example, the scope of Medicare benefits might be increased or decreased, and there would be new incentives for elderly people to join H.M.O.'s.
The Administration is also considering big changes in Medicaid, the Government medical program for low-income people, leading perhaps to its elimination as a separate program. Medicaid recipients would eventually be expected to get private insurance coverage through large purchasing groups, still paid by Federal and state governments.
 
 
 
The Language of Health-Care
Employer mandate. A requirement for employers to provide or arrange health insurance coverage for their employees. Typically, such proposals require coverage of workers' families too.
 
Fee for service. An arrangement under which doctors or other health-care providers are paid separately for each service they perform. Some economists say this method of payment may give doctors a financial incentive to provide more care than is needed.
 
Global budget. A limit on all health-care spending, public and private. The limit could be enforced through regulation of doctors' fees and hospital charges. But such price controls are not always included in the idea of a global budget.
 
Health insurance purchasing cooperative (HIPC, pronounced "HIP-ick"). An entity that buys insurance coverage and medical care for a large number of people, including employees of small businesses.
 
Health maintenance organization (H.M.O.). A prepaid group health plan, which provides a wide range of services in return for fixed monthly premiums.
 
Managed care. A method of delivering, supervising and coordinating health care, often through H.M.O.'s and other networks of doctors and hospitals. The purpose is to eliminate inappropriate services, control costs and assure access to effective treatments.
 
Managed competition. A health policy that combines free-market forces with Government regulation. Large groups of consumers and businesses buy health care from organized networks of doctors and hospitals, which are supposed to compete by offering low prices and high quality. President Clinton has embraced this idea, proposed by health-care executives and policy analysts who meet in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
 
Medicaid. Program that provides health care for low-income people, including children and pregnant women, as well as some elderly residents of nursing homes. It is financed jointly by the Federal Government and the states.
 
Medicare. Federal health insurance program for the elderly and the disabled. Eligibility is not based on a person's income.
 
Tax cap. A limit on Federal tax breaks for health insurance. The limit could apply to employers or employees or both. Under current law, employers can deduct the full amount of premiums paid for workers' health insurance, and none of the benefits are considered taxable income for the employees or both.

HEADLINE: CRISIS IN MOSCOW;
Excerpts From Christopher Speech on Russia: 'Monumental' Stakes for U.S.

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 22

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech today by Secretary of State Warren Christopher on relations with Russia, delivered to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations:
Bringing Russia, one of history's most powerful nations, into the family of peaceful nations will serve our highest security, economic and moral interests. For America and the world, the stakes are just monumental. If we succeed, we will have established the foundation for our lasting security into the next century. 
 But if Russia falls into anarchy or lurches back to despotism, the price that we pay could be frightening. Nothing less is involved than the possibility of renewed nuclear threat, higher defense budgets, spreading instability, the loss of new markets, and a devastating setback for the worldwide democratic movement.
This circumstance deserves the attention of each and every American. Over the days and weeks ahead, the Clinton Administration will set forth a comprehensive strategy to support Russia's democracy and its efforts to build a market economy.
My intention today is not to announce a detailed program of new initiatives. Rather, what I'd like to do is try to provide a strategic context for the approach that we will follow. I want to explain the tremendous interest we have in doing everything we can to help Russia's democracies succeed.
Let me stress here today that by focusing on Russia, I do not mean to neglect the other new independent states. The well-being of Ukraine, of Kazakhstan, of Belarus, of Armenia, and indeed each of the former republics, is a matter of utmost importance to America.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
 
Dependent on Russia
 Indeed it is partly out of concern for their welfare that I want to concentrate on Russia today, for the fact is that the future security of each of these neighbors of Russia depends so heavily on Russia's own democratic revolution.
Let me step back for just a moment and analyze with you the breathtaking benefits that the end of the cold war has brought to the United States and the world.
To mention just a few of the results: Historic agreements have been reached to slash the nuclear arsenals that threatened our country with annihilation. The nations of the former Warsaw Pact are now free of Soviet domination and of the burden of Communism. The possibility of a superpower conflict on the European conflict -- continent -- has now all but vanished, allowing us to bring home thousands of troops and to reduce our defense budgets.
Around the globe totalitarian regimes that look to the Soviet Union for help and support are now isolated and on the defensive.
And from Vilnius on the Baltic to Vladivostok on the Pacific, vast new markets are opening, opening slowly, but nonetheless opening to Western business.
With a reforming Russia, all of these historic achievements were possible, but without it, many will not be sustainable.
 
A Historic Crossroads
 So we stand again today at historic crossroads. It's very reminiscent of the crossroads that we faced in 1918 and 1945. Then we were summoned after conflicts to lead the world by building a new peace. After World War I, we chose to retreat. The consequences were disastrous.
However, after World War II, our leaders had the wisdom to answer the call. We fostered institutions that rebuilt the free world's prosperity, and we helped to lead a democratic alliance that contained and ultimately drained Soviet Communism.
Today, for the third time in a century, we have an historic opportunity to build a more secure world. We must redouble our efforts to help the Russian people as they struggle in an effort that has no historical precedent.
With great courage they are attempting to carry out three simultaneous revolutions. First, transforming a totalitarian system into a democracy. Second, transforming a command economy into one based upon free markets. And third, transforming an aggressive, expansionist empire into a peaceful modern nation-state. If they succeed in this tremendous experiment, we will all succeed.
Now it appears that another turning point has been reached in Russia's transition. For months a constitutional crisis between President Yeltsin and the Parliament has paralyzed Russian politics.
That crisis came, as you all know, came to a head over the weekend. President Yeltsin has called for a national plebiscite to resolve the constitutional impasse. In doing so, he has again demonstrated his faith that the only force that can guarantee reform is the people, the Russian people.
We welcome President Yeltsin's assurance that civil liberties, including freedom of speech and of the press, will be respected at this difficult moment. We also welcome his firm rejection of imperial and cold war policies.
The most important point is that Russia must remain a democracy during this period moving toward a market economy. This is the basis, the only basis, for the U.S.-Russian partnership.

 	 	 		. . .	 	On that basis Russia can be assured of our full support in the days ahead.
Now, today's crisis in Russia results from one indisputable fact: The pain of building a new system virtually from scratch is exacting a tremendous toll. The patience of the Russian people is wearing thin, a fact that is reflected in Russia's current political stalemate. Nevertheless, we should notice that over the last year President Yeltsin and Russia's other democrats have demonstrated their commitment to reform in many ways.
Civil liberties have been dramatically expanded; the military budget has been significantly cut; prices have been freed in most sectors -- and the result has been the once long lines that formed outside Russia's stores have come to an end. Tens of thousands of shops, restaurants and other firms have been put into private hands, and a real start has been made on the most difficult process of even privatizing the large enterprises.
As a result of these steps, the share of the work force engaged in private commerce has more than doubled over the last two years.
I'm glad to say that over the weekend President Yeltsin recommitted his Government to economic reform. He laid out in clear and strong language the key elements of such a program: continued privatization of firms, selling land to farmers, stopping inflation and stabilizing the ruble.

 	 	 		. . .	 	To succeed we must first change our mind-sets. We must understand that helping to consolidate democracy in Russia is not a matter of charity but a security concern of the highest order. . . .
 
Meeting With Russian
 Tomorrow and the next day in Washington, President Clinton and I will meet with the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev. We will communicate to him our support for Russia's continued democratic development, and we will reiterate that the current situation in Moscow must be resolved peacefully and in a way consistent with civil liberties.
At his meeting with President Yeltsin next month in Vancouver, President Clinton intends to spell out the tangible steps we will take to assist Russian reform. The President is still considering the specific measures he will announce, but our bottom line is it will be increasing and accelerating our support for Russia's democracy.

 	 	 		. . .	 	One area of possible assistance where America's vital interests are directly engaged is our effort to dismantle the nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union.
The $800 million program established through the leadership of Senators Nunn and Lugar to destroy these weapons is a direct investment in our own security.
Unfortunately, some bottlenecks, both here and in Russia, have allowed only a small fraction of the $800 million to be spent up to this point.
Part of it has been caused by bureaucratic delays in Washington, and we are fully determined to remove these obstacles. We want to see these weapons dismantled in the very shortest possible time.
Another important goal we should have is strengthening the groups in Russia that will form the bulwark of a thriving democracy.
There are public opinions in Russia, too, as you know, and time after time they show one thing. By large margins it's the younger generation that expresses the greatest sympathy for democracy. . . . Ultimately, whatever the results of today's political turmoil, this is the group that will carry the day for Russia's successful transition to democracy.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
 
Free Media Needed
 The existence, to take another example, of a strong independent media, is also essential for a democratic society. While Russia's free press has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, there is still a real need for professional training of reporters, editors and newsmen. Here technical assistance can make a real difference.

 	 	 		. . .	 	At a time of great domestic challenge, some would say that we should delay bold action in the foreign realm. But history will not wait. As Abraham Lincoln advised his countrymen, we cannot escape history; we will be remembered in spite of ourselves. . . .

HEADLINE: Revoke Bail, Prosecutor Says to Court

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 22

 BODY:
A prosecution campaign for the immediate jailing of three former Glen Ridge football players convicted of sexual assault last week is to go before New Jersey's Supreme Court on Tuesday.
The court's seven justices have been asked to revoke the modest bail for the three and send them to the Essex County jail on the grounds that they are a danger to their community and might flee before their sentencing, scheduled for April 23. 
 In their request to the state's highest court, trial prosecutors also cited a third and "possibly most compelling reason" -- what they called a "community belief" that the justice system has a racially inspired double standard for convicted defendants.
 
'Treated Differently'
 "There is a sense in the community that defendants convicted of gang rape are treated differently depending upon their social status, race or ethnicity," one Glen Ridge prosecutor, Elizabeth Miller-Hall, said in a legal brief. "In particular, there exists a perception that defendants who are poor or members of a minority group are more likely than other defendants not so situated to be remanded to jail post-conviction."
Ms. Miller-Hall's trial colleague, Robert D. Laurino, made a similar argument to the trial judge, R. Benjamin Cohen, last Tuesday, immediately after the three men, Christopher Archer and Kevin and Kyle Scherzer, were found guilty of assaulting a mildly retarded schoolmate with a baseball bat and broom handle in March 1989.
Ms. Miller-Hall's filing of the brief was the first time that the authorities had injected race or socio-economic status into the four-year-old case. All parties involved are white and grew up in an upper-middle-class community of 7,000 about five miles west of downtown Newark.
In an opposing brief to the Supreme Court, a defense attorney, Thomas Ford, who represents Mr. Archer, called the state's assertion groundless and "frightening." Mr. Ford said it would be unconstitutional to use race or ethnicity as a basis for bail.
 
Allegations of a Rape
 Ms. Miller-Hall argued in her brief that the three young men were "sexually aggressive" and contended that Judge Cohen made a "clear error in judgment" when he rejected the prosecution's request to revoke bail immediately after the conviction.
Regarding Mr. Archer, she repeated Mr. Laurino's courtroom allegation that Mr. Archer had "raped" a female college student several months after he was arrested in the Glen Ridge case. No charges have been filed in this case, and documents relating to it have been sealed.
After graduating from Glen Ridge High School in June 1990, Mr. Archer attended Boston College for two years. Mr. Ford said in his brief that the "alleged rape" occurred in October 1990 and noted that no criminal or civil charges had been filed, and none are "contemplated."
"Consequently, since these charges have not been proven, they should not be a basis for the revoking of bail at this point in time," Mr. Ford said.
In her brief, Ms. Miller-Hall said that Kevin Scherzer had exposed and fondled his genitals in high school classes before he graduated in 1989 and that he had once told opponents in a baseball game about a "rape we did." She offered no explanation of what Mr. Scherzer was referring to.
Ms. Miller-Hall also noted that Mr. Scherzer was arrested by a New Jersey state trooper for drunken driving on March 7 -- three days after jury deliberations started in the Glen Ridge trial -- after he drove through a red light.
Her brief contained no specific comments about Kevin Scherzer's 22-year-old twin, Kyle. His lawyer, Louis Esposito, noted in his brief that "the state has not made one allegation concerning Kyle Scherzer."
Mr. Esposito argued that the twins had been prompt and attentive throughout the five-month trial and have "extremely strong and longstanding roots" in Glen Ridge.
 
'Meager' Bail Amounts
 He argued that Kevin Scherzer's drunken-driving charge and the assertion he had fondled himself in high school classes did not show he was a danger to the community.
Mr. Archer and Kevin Scherzer have been free on bail of $2,500 and Kyle Scherzer on bail of $2,000 since shortly after their arrests in May, 1989.
Ms. Miller-Hall called the amounts "meager," in light of the "substantial prison sentences" the three face. Mr. Archer and Kevin Scherzer were convicted of two first-degree assault charges, which carry a maximum term of 40 years. Kyle Scherzer was found guilty of one first-degree and one second-degree count of assault and faces a maximum sentence of 30 years. Their actual sentences could be considerably less, however, because of discretion granted the sentencing judge.
The state's motion asks the Supreme Court to reverse Judge Cohen and revoke bail immediately. In the alternative, Ms. Miller-Hall asked for higher bail or for a full hearing on the bail issue before Judge Cohen.
The court is to consider the matter in a private conference.

HEADLINE: Senate Republican Plans to Force Vote on Social Security Tax Rise

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
A test vote in the Senate this week on President Clinton's proposal to raise taxes on the Social Security benefits of the most affluent retirees will offer the clearest insight to date on whether Democratic lawmakers are willing to cast politically unpopular votes to support the President's program.
Social Security is one of the most venerated aspects of Democratic dogma. By forcing a vote on the matter, a vote that will have no binding effect, Republicans hope to embarrass and divide the Democrats. 
 The vote, which could come as early as Tuesday, will be part of the Senate's consideration of Mr. Clinton's overall budget plan and a companion measure to spend $16 billion in the next two years to stimulate the economy and create jobs. The House of Representatives approved the budget framework and the stimulus bill last week.
A central element of the Clinton plan to lower the budget deficit is the proposal to raise to 85 percent from 50 percent the portion of Social Security benefits that are subject to income taxes for couples with total incomes of more than $32,000 including retirement benefits and single retirees with incomes above $25,000. The Social Security payments of taxpayers with incomes below those thresholds are not now taxed and would not be under the Clinton plan.
 
Senator Plans Amendment
 The proposal would raise about $30 billion over the next five years, one of the largest tax increases in the Clinton budget.
The budget package went before the House last week under parliamentary rules that restricted amendments, so the Social Security tax never came to a vote. But the Democrats will not be so fortunate in the Senate, where Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, plans to force their hand.
The budget resolution before the Senate merely sets overall tax and spending levels and does not address which taxes should be raised or cut or how much money should be spent on which programs. But Senator Lott plans to submit an amendment that would reduce the total tax level by precisely the amount the Social Security tax increase would raise. A preamble to the amendment states that its purpose is to scrap Mr. Clinton's Social Security proposal.
"It's a clever way to push the Democrats into a hard vote," said Lawrence T. Smedley, executive director of the National Council of Senior Citizens.
Mr. Smedley and most others who lobby on behalf of retirees are opposing the Lott amendment, saying it would be politically unwise to do otherwise.
Two weeks ago in the Budget Committee, Mr. Lott offered an amendment similar to the one he plans to offer to the full Senate. The amendment failed in committee on a party-line vote, but several Democrats who voted against it then said they were sympathetic and might change their votes when they really counted. "Many of us have concerns about it," said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, referring to the tax increase.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that only the most affluent 23 percent of retirees would be affected by the new tax next year, a figure that would rise to 30 percent by 1998.
The Clinton Administration argues that the proposal would raise revenue important for reducing the deficit, while protecting most people with low and moderate incomes from additional taxation.
The Administration maintains that the tax increase would actually amount to a spending cut, since its practical effect would be to limit Social Security benefits to some retirees.
Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said, "We have to limit the rate of growth of entitlement programs, including Social Security. Entitlements are gobbling up the budget."
The Administration, Mr. Altman noted, has promised to use all revenue from the additional tax to shore up the Medicare program, which provides medical insurance for retirees. This is mainly a bookkeeping promise, but it has helped keep the lobbyists for retirees at bay.
A study by the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan branch of the Library of Congress, found that, to take one example, a retired couple with $15,000 in Social Security benefits and $35,000 in other income from a private pension, interest and dividends, would owe an additional tax of $551 under the Clinton proposal.
Normally, such a couple, with an annual income of $50,000, would not be considered particularly well off. But since even the most generous private pension plans rarely pay ordinary retirees more than about $20,000 a year, the couple would probably have to have an investment portfolio of several hundred thousand dollars.
Votes in the Senate on issues like this are difficult to handicap. But the best bet now is that the Clinton forces will squeak by, at least this week.
"The pressure for Democrats to stick together should carry the day this time," said a staff assistant who has been following the issue closely. But no one is predicting what will happen several weeks from now when the Senators actually vote on the tax and not just on a symbolic amendment.

HEADLINE: For Mayor of Detroit, This Race Is Different

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 22

 BODY:
For nearly two decades, the Detroit mayoral race has taken exactly the same course: Coleman A. Young runs, and Coleman A. Young wins.
But Mr. Young is now 74, and the city that made him its first black mayor in 1974 has suffered a sharp decline in population and economic health, and has become one of the most violent and drug-ridden cities in America. 
 As Mr. Young contemplates a run for a sixth four-year term, many of his allies have concluded that his time has passed and are contributing to other Democratic candidates. Polls show that up to 80 percent of the city's registered voters want the Mayor to retire.
Mr. Young, who rarely ventures out of the executive mansion these days, has given no clear signal of his intentions. The filing deadline for the Sept. 14 primary is June 22.
 
He Can Still Bite
 Regardless of how Mr. Young's political allies now feel, the Mayor's popularity in this city of 1.2 million people, about 70 percent of whom are black, has been enormous. Mr. Young controls a $4 million campaign fund and still has some political bite, snapping at friends who have turned on him.
Of Dennis Archer, the former State Supreme Court Justice who has mounted the most serious challenge for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Young reminded reporters last month, "He got his job as judge through my recommendation."
Of Dave Bing, the former basketball star for the Detroit Pistons who supports Sharon MacPhail, another opponent and former Young protegee, the Mayor said, "Right now, my people are putting together a package trying to rescue Dave's steel company."
Mr. Bing says his business is not in need of the city's help.
In response to criticism that Mr. Young has allowed Detroit's ills to fester, the Mayor says the auto industry slump and white flight to the suburbs have caused unemployment, which in turn has promoted crime and drug use.
 
Different Election Likely
 Jack Moore, an independent poll taker here who found in a survey last month that nearly 80 percent of the voters believe Mr. Young should not run again, said the next mayoral election could be very different from those of the last two decades. "There's no doubt that the erosion of quality of life in the city over the last four or five years is going to be a factor," he added.
But political analysts say it is far too early to count Mr. Young out. Even voters who want him to retire say they will vote for him again if he runs.
"If I was him, I would step down," said Rheuben Blackmon, a 68-year-old parking attendant. "But I voted for him before, and I'll vote for him again."
By putting pressure on Mr. Young to retire, editorialists and political opponents may only re-ignite his zest for public office. "I've told the newspapers that if they'd leave him alone he may go, but no politician wants to be run out of office," said Paul Hubbard, a former City Hall intern who now heads a not-for-profit urban leadership coalition and is considering a run for mayor.
Privately, many of Mr. Young's confidants say he is seriously ill and is considering retirement. Bob Berg, the Mayor's press secretary, concedes that Mr. Young has emphysema, a respiratory illness that can be fatal, but scoffs at reports that he is too ill to serve. "The first stories about him needing oxygen started in 1974," Mr. Berg said.
On Feb. 26 Mr. Young appeared briefly at his annual fund-raising event, a $300-a-ticket affair that netted $1 million for his campaign fund.
Despite his large war chest, it is clear that the Mayor has lost the support of many corporate leaders, many of whom are now lining up behind Mr. Archer. Charles Fisher 3d, chairman of NBD Bancorp, skipped the Feb. 26 event and said he hoped Mr. Young would not run again. The Mayor responded by withdrawing his campaign money from Mr. Fisher's bank.
 
Most Serious Opposition
 Mr. Archer, who like nearly every power broker in the city is black, represents Mr. Young's most serious opposition since he became Mayor. Mr. Archer, who was born in Detroit, taught in the city's public schools before receiving a law degree from the Detroit College of Law. He was appointed to the State Supreme Court in 1985 and joined a prestigious law firm here in 1990. Almost immediately after leaving the bench, his name was circulated as a potential mayoral candidate.
In a Detroit News and Free Press poll, Mr. Archer led the Mayor and several other potential candidates. But his 32.3 percent of the vote, compared to 13.5 percent for Mr. Young, would only put him in a runoff election.
As of February, Mr. Archer reported raising only $155,000 in campaign contributions, far less than the $600,000 to $700,000 that previous mayoral candidates estimate is necessary to run a credible campaign. But many influential business leaders, including Joseph Antonini, chairman of the Kmart Corporation, signed up for Mr. Archer's $500-a-couple fund-raising event on March 12. It grossed about $150,000.
Mr. Archer, pushing an agenda of economic development and public safety, is offering an olive branch to white business interests that have fled to the suburbs. But there is a danger in this tactic: A great deal of Mr. Young's support has been built on opposition to white racism; the Mayor could try to arouse voters by accusing Mr. Archer of toadying to white, well-to-do interests from the suburbs.
"There's no doubt the Mayor would try to paint Archer as the great white hope and attack him for wooing the suburbs," said Bernard Klein, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan at Dearborn. "The questions would be whether he can make the charge stick, and whether Detroit voters would be influenced by such a charge."

HEADLINE: Anheuser In Mexican Beer Deal

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
America's biggest brewing company, the Anheuser-Busch Companies, said yesterday that it would pay $477 million for an 18 percent stake in Mexico's largest brewer, which makes Corona and other brands.
The arrangement, expected to be made final by the early summer, represents another step in the globalization of the brewing industry. With foreign markets growing faster than the American market, Anheuser-Busch recently entered a joint venture in Japan, and the Miller Brewing Company bought stakes in Mexican and Canadian brewers. 
 The Anheuser deal is also an example of the type of cross-border investment expected under the North American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico, which is undergoing final revisions in Washington.
Anheuser's stock moved up $1 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, to $52.75.
 
 
Access to Expertise
 The deal gives the Mexican company, Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V., access to Anheuser's marketing expertise. It calls for key marketing, planning and financing managers from both companies to spend a few years at each other's headquarters. The cash infusion will also help the Mexican company pay the costs of its eighth brewery, which is now being built.
Under the contract announced in St. Louis and Mexico City yesterday, Anheuser-Busch's Budweiser and Bud Lite brands will continue to be brewed in the United States and exported to Mexico for distribution by Grupo Modelo, as has been the case since 1989.
Both companies will continue to brew their own brands at home for export abroad; new distribution arrangements are not part of the deal. Four of Grupo Modelo's brands will continue to be distributed in the United States by two private companies, Barton Beers of Chicago and the Gambrinus Importing Company of San Antonio.
For Grupo Modelo, a strong incentive for the deal was the free-trade agreement, Valentin Diez, a Grupo Model senior vice president, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.
"We knew that because of Nafta," he said, "it would be very convenient for any company to have a good and strategic alliance with the No. 1 brewer in the world."
Modelo's Corona is the top-selling beer in Mexico and accounts for some 55 percent of the country's total beer exports. The company has had success in the United States since the mid-80's with Corona, a light-tasting beer -- often served with a wedge of fresh lime -- that has become popular with many young adults.
Last year, Grupo Modelo sold 15 million cases of Corona, Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo, Pacifico and Corona Light in the United States, where the overall beer market exceeds 191 million cases.
Anheuser-Busch sold about one million cases of Budweiser and Bud Lite in Mexico last year. Mexico's beer market exceeds 16 million cases, and has been growing by 6.5 percent a year over the last five years.
The chairman of Anheuser-Busch International Inc., Jack H. Purnell, said Anheuser-Busch had been hurt by Mexico's existing 20 percent tariff on imported beer, which could make a six-pack of Budweiser in cans as much as 70 percent more expensive than a six-pack of Corona in bottles in a typical Mexican supermarket. Under the free-trade treaty, however, that tariff will be phased out over eight years.
Mr. Purnell said that even if the free trade agreement was signed, Budweiser would still cost more than Corona in Mexico, although the price differential would be narrowed. But he said the real thrust of the contract was to capitalize on international sales and overseas markets that are growing faster than the United States market.
"Nafta would be the icing on the cake, but the cake itself is very appetizing," Mr. Purnell said.
Anheuser-Busch recently entered a joint venture with the Kirin Brewery Company in Japan that gives each company the right to market the other's products at home. Also recently, the Miller Brewing Company, a unit of the Philip Morris Companies, bought a 7.9 percent stake in a large Mexican brewer, Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A., as well as a 20 percent stake in Molson Breweries of Canada.
Anheuser-Busch will get three seats on Modelo's board, while a Modelo representative will be appointed to Anheuser-Busch's board.
 Mr. Purnell said Anheuser-Busch had an option to increase its equity holdings in Grupo Modelo to 50 percent. Grupo Modelo is privately held by a group of Mexican familes. Officials from both companies said that management of the Mexican company would remain in Mexican hands.

HEADLINE: U.S. Stocks Shrug Off Turmoil in Russia

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Investors at first shivered but then shrugged over Russia's turmoil yesterday, as stocks recovered from steep opening losses to close only moderately behind.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 24 points within minutes of the opening and soon lost further ground as the bond market also declined. But the Dow came back to close at 3,463.48, off 8.10 points. Big Board decliners outnumbered gainers by about 12 to 7 on moderate volume of 233.2 million shares. 
 Analysts were impressed with the market's resiliency yesterday, although some were cautious about the longer outlook. In the view of most investors, said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company: "Any price concession is bargain time. Some call it a confident market; others would call it a complacent market."
 
 
European Markets Sink
 European markets showed no such assurance, with several of them falling more than 1 percent.
American strategists worried that if President Boris N. Yeltsin was replaced by hard-liners, the anticipated cutbacks in American military spending and the resulting deficit reduction would be postponed. Some recalled the market's sharp decline and recovery after a coup temporarily pushed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev from power in August 1991.
"At this point, I think we've dodged the bullet," said David B. Bostian, chief investment strategist at Herzog, Heine & Geduld. Just as in the earlier power struggle, he said, "The probabilities favor the forces of democracy."
The concerns that could pull stocks down come April, he said, might include the Clinton health-care strategy and Senate tampering with the Administration's budget.
But even if military uncertainties grow, he said, the capital goods and cyclical stocks that have ridden the economic recovery so far might continue to shine. Forest products, metals and oils were among yesterday's better performers. Weyerhaeuser, Louisiana-Pacific, Inland Steel and Nucor were each up at least 1 point.
Meanwhile, some food, beverage and tobacco issues declined, with H. J. Heinz off 1 1/4, to 39 3/4, and Kellogg down 1 1/4, to 61 1/8.
Secondary stocks, typically more volatile, fared the worst yesterday, as the Nasdaq Composite index fell 6.10 points, to 676.62. Software and other computer technology stocks fell, as BMC Software lost 3 1/2, to 46 3/4, and Sun Microsystems dropped 1, to 29 1/8.
Still, some biotechnology stocks advanced, with Chiron gaining 1, to 51 1/2.
European markets posted steep losses, with London's Financial Times 100 index falling 36.20 points, or 1.25 percent, to 2863.90. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 23.41 points, or 1.19 percent, to 1,939.28, and Frankfurt's DAX index dropped 37.41 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,661.40.

HEADLINE: Report Says Man Killed by Police Was Shot in the Back

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
New York City's chief medical examiner said yesterday that a man who was shot and killed by the police outside a 24-hour diner in Manhattan early Saturday morning was shot in the back three times, a finding that contradicted the initial Police Department account that he had been shot in the chest and stomach.
The case of the killing of Bekim Ahmeti, a 20-year-old unemployed doorman from Staten Island, will be presented to a grand jury, as is standard in fatal shootings by police officers. It is also being investigated by a department firearms review board and the Internal Affairs Bureau, also standard procedure. 
 The police report said Mr. Ahmeti was shot about 5 A.M., after police officers responded to a fight at the Moonstruck Diner at 400 West 23d Street at Ninth Avenue. The police version said Mr. Ahmeti tried to run away, then turned and pointed a handgun at the officers. A .38-caliber revolver was recovered at the scene.
 
No Police Comment
 The police yesterday would not comment on the finding by the medical examiner, Dr. Charles Hirsch, which was first reported yesterday in Newsday. Suzanne Trazoff, the department's deputy commissioner for public information, said yesterday that she could not comment until the investigations had been completed. But, she added, she had received no information to indicate that the shooting departed from departmental guidelines.
According to the department's patrol guide, officers can use deadly physical force to stop a fleeing felon only under certain circumstances. One circumstance in which such action is considered justified is when the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect is armed with a deadly weapon.
The medical examiner, Dr. Hirsch, said, "There's no question the bullets struck him in the back." He added that a bullet also entered the man's left hand.
Although the initial police report said Mr. Ahmeti had been shot in the chest, Ms. Trazoff said investigators at the scenes of shootings cannot always readily determine whether the wounds are entrance or exit wounds.
 
Reasons for Gun Wounds
 She said it was possible that when the first of six shots fired by the two officers struck Mr. Ahmeti, it spun him around so his back was turned. Or, she added, he may have turned his back at the last moment in an instinctive move to protect himself.
Ms. Trazoff said that when the officers arrived at the scene, about 15 to 18 people had spilled from the diner into the street. One, not Mr. Ahmeti, carried a lead pipe.
Mr. Ahmeti ran from the police, Ms. Trazoff said, possibly because he was on probation on a gun charge and did not want to be caught with the gun, which was unlicensed. In February 1992, he pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal possession of a deadly weapon after his arrest for shooting at some bus shelters on Staten Island, and received five years' probation.
Mr. Ahmeti's father, Arif, said that he did not know his son carried a gun but that about two months ago he had been shot in the back and right hand in a drive-by shooting.
 
Just 'Trying to get Away'
 Ms. Trazoff said she did not know whether Mr. Ahmeti turned toward the officers with the gun or not, but she added that when Mr. Ahmeti began to run, he was seen by at least one officer to reach into his waistband, and an officer yelled that Mr. Ahmeti had a gun.
Lieut. Michael Herer, 37, fired two shots from his .38-caliber revolver and Officer Joseph Dalton, 32, fired four rounds from his 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson.
Several friends of Mr. Ahmeti have disputed the police account of the shooting.
One of them, Omar Hernandez, 22, who was about 20 feet away when the police began to chase Mr. Ahmeti, said yesterday that he heard an officer yell that Mr. Ahmeti had a gun. But Mr. Hernandez said that he never saw Mr. Ahmeti reach for or draw a gun and that Mr. Ahmeti never turned toward the officers or made a threatening move.
"He was just running, trying to get away," Mr. Hernandez said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Advance Slightly

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities bounced around yesterday and ended slightly higher as concerns about inflation seemed to keep traders and investors in check.
The intensifying struggle in Russia between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Parliament did not have a major impact on the American bond market. But traders noted that the tension was a cause of declines in both bond and stock markets in Europe. 
 In Germany, long-term bonds were off about 1/3 point in moderate trading. In France, bonds were down slightly and did not seem to get a lift from the better than expected performance of the conservative coalition in the first round of elections Sunday. In London, bond futures were off about half a point, in part because of the announcement of an auction on Friday.
 
Problems In Russia Cited
 In the United States, the problems in Russia seemed to give a little support to shorter maturities, some traders said. But because the dollar did not strengthen, it does not appear that there is a significant flight to the relative security of United States investments.
The auction of two-year and five-year Treasury notes this week is on the mind of every trader, and analysts will be looking to see if the results give any signal about the direction of the market, which has been locked in a narrow trading range for two weeks.
Early in trading yesterday, the focus turned to inflation and the jump in the closely watched Commodity Research Bureau index of commodity prices, like lumber. The index rose to a 1993 intraday high of 214.27 before easing back to finish the day at 213.03, down from Friday's closing high for the year of 213.67.
Since Feb. 8, the index has jumped from 198.46. If the rise continues, traders and analysts could find it more difficult to argue that moderate economic growth will bring the index back down again. Already, the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index for February have risen more than expected.
Nancy Lazar, an economist at the ISI Group, said that if the index broke though the 214 level, she would begin to be worried about her prediction that the rate of inflation will decline this year. The expectation of a decline in inflation is why many investors are still interested in buying long-term Treasury issues even though their yields are at their lowest levels in many years.
There have been several instances in the last two years when the CRB index has jumped higher but then fell back again, Ms. Lazar said. The largest of these short-lived increases was a 7 percent jump, and if the index can break though 214, that would be more than a 7 percent rise.
"We're fighting the tape given the rise in the CRB and the bad readings in the P.P.I. and the C.P.I.," she said of her forecast.
But she said that she still expected the CRB index to fall because her forecast is that the economy, instead of picking up steam, will continue to move along at only a moderate pace. There are several reasons for this, she said, including the very slow growth in the nation's money supply; the continuation of layoffs around the country, and the recent decline in indexes of consumer confidence.
Other forecasters are watching the CRB index closely but are less worried. Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, said that he will not worry about the index until it pierces the 225 level.
 
30-Year Bonds Prices Are Up
 In late trading yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond was up4/32 , to 104 6/32 and the yield was down to 6.80 percent, from 6.81 percent Friday. The price of the 10-year note was also up 4/32 as the yield inched down to 5.93 percent from 5.95 percent.
The effect on short-term rates from the turmoil in Russia may have been reflected in the weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills. The average discount rate was 2.94 percent for the three-month bill, down from 3 percent a week ago, and the average discount rate was 3.05 percent for the six-month bill, down from 3.12 percent.
In the when-issued, or pre-auction, market, the two-year note was trading at a yield 3.90 percent, down from 3.97 percent Friday, while the yield on the five-year note was at 5.17 percent, down from 5.20 percent. The two-year note will be auctioned tomorrow, the five-year note Thursday.
Following are the results of the three-month and six-month bill auction yesterday:

Dollar Stages an Advance As Fears Mount on Yeltsin

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar staged a tentative advance against leading European currencies yesterday amid mounting unease about the future of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
The lackluster advance, however, underscored the weakness of the dollar, which has failed to break out of its current trading range against the German mark despite lower German interest rates and Russian unrest. 
 Gold prices rose modestly. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $332.90 a troy ounce, up $1.10 from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold ended at $332.70 an ounce, up $1.20.
Yesterday, President Yeltsin stood firm against hard-liners' efforts to impeach him. The Constitutional Court convened to weigh the legality of a decree by Mr. Yeltsin declaring emergency rule.
 
Pall Over Currency Markets
 The unrest shook European stock and bond markets and cast a pall over their currency markets.
"The situation in Russia has put a floor under the dollar for the moment," said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "What you had was more selling of D-marks and selling of European currencies rather than any inherent dollar strength."
The dollar's luster as a safe investment haven has been dulled by a slow United States economic recovery and a soaring Japanese yen. Government officials in Japan and the United States have pronounced their support for a stronger yen as a way to whittle Japan's bulging trade surplus with foreign countries.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 116.02 yen, down 0.08 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 115.67 yen. The dollar continued to fall in New York, briefly touching a new low of 115.30 before settling at 115.63 yen, down from late Friday's 116.10 yen.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.4880, from $1.4895 late Friday. In New York, sterling fetched $1.4870, less than late Friday's $1.4915.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6380 German marks, up from 1.6340; 1.5140 Swiss francs, up from 1.5080; 5.5705 French francs, up from 5.5685; 1,581.00 Italian lire, up from 1,575.00, and 1.2473 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2465.
