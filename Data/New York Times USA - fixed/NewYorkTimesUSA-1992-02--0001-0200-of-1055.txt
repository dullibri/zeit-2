 BODY:
Low interest rates have left many bank customers scrambling to find safe investments that pay higher returns than savings accounts. A higher return means taking increased risks, and savers should know what the risks are before they take their money out of certificates of deposit, savings accounts or bank money-market accounts and thus give up Federal deposit insurance protection. Here are some alternative investments and their risks.
 
Alternative Risk 

Money funds Like bank money-market accounts, but they pay dividends, not interest, and are fairly safe, with principal guaranteed by the sponsor, usually a brokerage. No money fund has ever failed.
 
Common stocks: Risk lies in selecting stocks that are not overpriced and thus are likely to increase in value.
 
Bonds: Debt issued by companies and governments. The safest are United States Treasury bonds; they pay the lowest returns, but are exempt from state and local taxes. Before buying a state, local or corporate bond, check the issuer's credit rating in Standard & Poor's or Moody's Investors Service.
 
Mutual funds: They invest in products like stocks, bonds and mortgages, and sell shares in their portfolios. Share prices can go down and investors can lose money. Some funds specialize in growth stocks, in blue-chip stocks, in stocks that offer relatively steady returns, or in other types of business.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Filing is Made By T.W.A.

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Trying to avoid the fate of competitors that have been forced to liquidate, Trans World Airlines Inc. made an unusual Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing yesterday that is likely to rid it of $1 billion of debt and give it a good chance to survive.
T.W.A. will continue to fly while it operates under court protection, and its passengers are not expected to notice any changes in service. T.W.A. said that all previously issued tickets and frequent-flier miles would be honored and that all existing flights would continue. The bankruptcy filing does not entail any layoffs or cutbacks. 
 The filing, made in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., resembles a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy in that the airline enters the proceedings with agreements in place from its creditors to reduce its debt and cut its interest expenses by $160 million.
 
Owned by Icahn
 The bankruptcy filing had been expected since July, when the airline's chairman, Carl C. Icahn, averted a showdown with creditors that could have resulted in the seizure of many of its planes. The filing opens a new chapter in the history of an airline that once spanned the globe and had Howard Hughes as its major stockholder.
T.W.A. has not been a public company . since 1988, when Mr. Icahn took it private in a leveraged buyout. At the time, he took out $469 million in cash for himself while adding greatly to the company's debt.
By last year Mr. Icahn had become disillusioned with the airline, which suffered huge losses during the Persian Gulf crisis, when fuel prices doubled and the number of passengers plunged. To raise cash, he sold off the airline's prized London routes.
T.W.A. follows several other American airlines into bankruptcy court in recent years, including two that are still flying, Continental and America West, and three that have been or are being liquidated: Eastern, Pan Am and Midway.
Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company, said that while the filing would enable T.W.A. to get through the next year, which is expected to be a difficult one for the industry, the airline's long-term prospects remained in doubt.
"He's not out of the woods yet," said Mr. Murphy, who was at a news conference held by Mr. Icahn and his top managers at the St. Regis Hotel in midtown Manhattan. Mr. Murphy noted that T.W.A.'s fleet of 194 planes was one of the industry's oldest, averaging about 16 years. The industry average is about 10.5 years.
Mark Buckstein, the head counsel for T.W.A., estimated that the carrier should emerge from under Chapter 11 in about six months.
T.W.A. was unable to complete all the papers and agreements in time for a formal prepackaged bankruptcy deal. A delay would have pushed the filing into April, analysts said, when traffic picks up and a move into bankruptcy court might have hurt bookings.
 
Creditors Go Along
 Most bankruptcy filings result in the company's management and creditors haggling, sometimes for months or years, over how much each side will give up in reaching a plan to reorganize the bankrupt company and emerge from court protection.
But Mr. Icahn was able to persuade all of T.W.A.'s main groups of creditors to go along with his plan, stressing that weakening the airline more could leave bondholders with little. He enticed them with a plan to go after business travelers with lower fares and he also agreed to help build up T.W.A.'s cash with about $35 million of his own money.
Mr. Icahn has portrayed himself as an industry maverick who, instead of ordering new planes and loading his company with additional debt, held back and now has all the old planes he needs at low lease rates.
The airline's filing is different from those made by carriers like Pan Am, which was close to running out of cash when it filed for protection last January and ended up being liquidated.
Wilbur Ross, the lawyer who represented bondholders in the negotiations with T.W.A.'s management, said the carrier had $500 million in cash and would have an additional $300 million once it completed the sale of several international routes and its Travel Channel, a cable television service with news and features about travel. It will also arrange $200 million of "debtor in possession financing" with various banks. Lenders of such financing are first in line to be repaid.
 
Cash From Other Unit
 Mr. Icahn said he was prepared to dip into the funds of his other companies, chiefly ACF Industries, a leasing and rail transportation company, to put up the $200 million in financing. That move is a fairly safe bet for him, since he would be paid off first in the event that T.W.A. is eventually liquidated.
T.W.A. also said it had completed an agreement with its largest union, the machinists, making it likely that it will have labor peace with those workers until at least 1995.
In return for wage increases of 18 to 20 percent over the next two and a half years, the airline won changes in work rules to improve productivity and will receive some concessions on its health-care costs. A protracted strike by machinists played a role in forcing Eastern to liquidate early in 1991.
Mr. Icahn has prided himself in not having ordered many new planes, since he has been able to get older planes at leases of up to 70 percent less than a year before, cutting his operating costs.
But Mr. Murphy said that many of the planes would not be able to meet coming Federal noise standards and would have to be retired or have their engines modified at considerable cost. The agreement leaves T.W.A. bondholders with big losses, with the total debt of $1.7 billion to be cut by $1 billion. Under the agreement, bondholders holding 15 percent notes agreed to have the amount owed lowered to $215 million, from $231.4 million, at an interest rate of 8 3/4 percent.
The holders of $334 million in 16 and 17 percent bonds will give up $105 million in return for 35 percent of an issue of new common stock, while the remaining $229 million of bonds will pay an interest rate of 8 percent. These holders, however, were able to have their bonds backed by collateral, including planes and engines.
 
The Biggest Risk
 The holders of $607 million in 12 percent bonds will take the biggest risk, since they agreed to take common stock, the value of which will depend on how well the airline can leave its troubles behind.
The largest T.W.A. creditors are Chemical Banking; Fleet National Bank of Providence, R.I., and Worldspan L.P. of Atlanta.
Mr. Icahn and his managers said they had hoped to file a prepackaged bankruptcy under which a company can emerge from court quickly, having agreed in advance on a reorganization plan. Mr. Ross said that the negotiations were delayed by discussions over what planes and engines would serve as collateral.
Mr. Icahn said that the carrier would concentrate on attracting business travelers with lower fares. He also disclosed that the airline would acquire 40 used McDonnell Douglas DC-9's to improve service at Kennedy International Airport, from which the airline operates most of its international flights. Its main domestic hub is at St. Louis.
Domestic flights to Kennedy are now used mostly to bring passengers from around the country to connect with international flights. Mr. Icahn hopes that by increasing the frequency of domestic flights from points like St. Louis, and by lowering fares, that business flyers will begin using the airline to fly to New York.
He also said he would run the risk of a proxy fight in a year if the five nonmanagement members of the Trans World board wanted to put up an alternative slate to replace the six managment directors. He said the company would pay the outside members to wage the proxy fight if they chose to do so.
Mr. Icahn will also end up owning from 15 to 40 percent of the common stock, since he is a major holder of the 12 percent bonds.
He said that he lost money on the bonds. "T.W.A. bonds are the worst investment I made in a decade," he said, smiling.
Mr. Icahn gained control of T.W.A. in 1985 in a bitter fight for control with Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of the Texas Air Corporation. With major concessions and good will from its unions, the carrier did well for a few years. It even acquired Ozark Airlines to strenghten its St. Louis hub.
Mr. Icahn and his staff also proved adept at switching planes to domestic service and to the Caribbean at a time when terrorist attacks caused a sharp drop in international travel.
After selling the London routes last year, Mr. Icahn sought to sell the airline, but found no takers. Since then he has worked to lower debt and expenses in the hope that T.W.A. could struggle along until an economic recovery might spur interest from other airlines.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT AT THE U.N.;
WORLD LEADERS, AT THE U.N., PLEDGE TO EXPAND ITS ROLE TO ACHIEVE A LASTING PEACE

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Proclaiming that the cold war's end has raised hopes for a safer, more equitable and humane world, leaders of the 15 countries on the United Nations Security Council pledged today to strengthen the United Nations and play a larger role in its peacekeeping operations.
President Bush, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and other leaders, who were attending the first meeting of the Security Council at the head-of-Government level, asked the new United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Ghali, to make proposals this summer for strengthening the United Nations' capacity for resolving escalating disputes before they turn violent. They also asked for proposals on expanding the organization's ability to preserve peace in trouble spots across the globe. 
 The Council declaration said the spread of democracy and respect for human rights would play a critical role in making the world a safer place in the post-cold-war era. And they called for firm new steps to halt the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as for cuts in all nations' arsenals. [Text of the declaration and excerpts from speeches, pages 4 and 5.]
 
Day of Lofty Speeches
 The Council's daylong meeting here brought together President Bush, Mr. Yeltsin and the leaders of France, Britain and China -- the permanent Security Council members with a special responsibility for preserving peace under the Charter.
Also attending the summit meeting were the Government leaders of Japan, Austria, Belgium, India, Morocco, Venezuela, Ecuador and Cape Verde and the Foreign Ministers of Hungary and Zimbabwe. They are serving two-year terms on the Council.
It was a day of lofty public speeches in which the Council's members acknowledged that the cold war's demise had freed the United Nations from the political paralysis that has hindered it for most of its 46 years of existence. The meeting also underscored the new era of Russian-American cooperation -- highlighted by Mr. Yeltsin's calling the Western countries his allies.
The leaders also met among themselves, and more or less ignored the swell of different protesters in the streets.
President Bush, Prime Minister John Major of Britain and several other leaders praised the role the United Nations played in driving Iraq out of Kuwait last year, destroying President Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons and bringing Libya to account for the bombing of two airliners.
But no concrete decisions were made on strengthening the organization's activities or on dealing with its deepening financial difficulties. Member states currently owe more than $800 million in unpaid dues.
The summit declaration said, "The members of the Security Council consider that their meeting is a timely recognition of the fact that there are new favorable international circumstances under which the Security Council has begun to fulfill more effectively its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security."
Today's high-level meeting, and the declaration it adopted, came at the suggestion of Britain's Government, which is this month's president of the Council. It has been suggested that a principal reason was Prime Minister Major's desire to enhance his stature before elections expected later this year.
Today's meeting, held around the horseshoe table in the Security Council's chamber, provided an opportunity for many bilateral contacts, including President Yeltsin's first meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. And it allowed the Chinese to break out of the ostracism imposed by most of the world since Beijing cracked down on the democracy movement in 1989.
 
'Common Ground' Sought
 President Bush set the tone for many speeches today when he told the meeting, "We meet at a moment of new beginning for this institution and, really, for every member nation." He added that "the collapse of imperial communism and the end of the cold war breathe new life into the United Nations."
"It's an exciting opportunity for our United Nations and we must not allow it to slip away," he said. "Right now across the globe the United Nations is working day and night in the cause of peace."
The President called for agreement on a worldwide ban on chemical weapons by the end of the year and said he would continue "the search for common ground" on mutual arms reductions when he meets with the Russian leader on Saturday.
President Yeltsin, who was making his first appearance here since Russia took over the defunct Soviet Union's position at the United Nations, gave a similarly emphatic commitment to peace, cooperation and disarmament.
"Perhaps for the first time ever, there is now a real chance to put an end to despotism and to dismantle the totalitarian order, whatever shape it may take," he told other Security Council members.
Saying Russia now "considers the United States and the West not as mere partners but rather as allies," President Yeltsin called for further disarmament measures, including deep cuts in strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, limiting and eventually eliminating nuclear testing, cuts in conventional armaments and the creation of a global anti-missile shield to be developed cooperatively with the United States.
President Yeltsin also stressed his Government's commitment to political freedom and human rights, saying the last 10 political prisoners were freed a few days ago.
"There are no more prisoners of conscience in free Russia," he told the Council.
Afterward, President Yeltsin told a news conference that his plan for a global anti-missile shield would protect countries against accidental or unauthorized missile launchings and encourage nuclear disarmament. It would also provide work for Russia's nuclear and other military scientists and stop them from "drifting abroad" and spreading dangerous technologies.
 
Arms Moved to Russia
 Mr. Yeltsin said that all land-based tactical nuclear weapons have now been withdrawn to Russia from Kazakhstan and Belarus and that evacuation of those weapons from Ukraine would be completed by July. The weapons will be stored and eventually destroyed, he said.
Mr. Yeltsin also announced that his Government would recognize the breakaway former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Slovenia at the end of next week and said that action would help resolve the civil war there.
The declaration is particularly tough on countries violating the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty by selling machinery and information on making atomic weapons, saying the Council will take "appropriate measures" against them.
Prime Minister Major told a closing news conference that this means the Security Council is ready to use its considerable enforcement powers against countries spreading nuclear weaponry.
The declaration also breaks new ground by saying that "non-military sources of instability in the economic, social, humanitarian and ecological fields" can also become threats to peace and security and thus merit the Council's attention.
The idea of holding such a meeting to take stock of the United Nations' future in a world freed of east-west tension was first suggested last year by President Francois Mitterrand of France.
Several leaders made practical suggestions for strengthening the United Nations peacemaking and peacekeeping capacity.
President Mitterrand went furthest, saying France stands ready to provide the Council with 1,000 soldiers for peacekeeping duties within 48 hours and to double that number within a week.
But he also called for activation of the Military Staff Committee, a long moribund group of senior officers that is supposed to advise the Security Council on the use of troops put at its disposal but which never found a role for itself in cold-war days.
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky of Austria called on the United Nations to deploy peacekeeping forces in tense areas before fighting starts and without necessarily getting the agreement of both sides. Prime Minister Wilfried Martens of Belgium suggested creating an emergency peacekeeping reserve fund to finance the early stages of such operations.
But some countries also aired pet grievances about the way the Security Council works now that it is becoming more influential in world affairs. Japan, Venezuela, India and Zimbabwe all said that the Council was unrepresentative of the present-day world.
Prime Minister Li Peng of China stressed his country's traditional belief that outside organizations' criticism of the way governments treat their citizens constitutes interference in their internal affairs.
And India, which has exploded a nuclear device, entered a reservation over the Council's strong stand against the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.

HEADLINE: Senate, Heeding Consumers' Ire, Votes to Limit Cable TV Rates

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Defying both the politically powerful cable-television industry and the Bush Administration, the Senate handed a victory to the broadcast industry today by voting to impose local and Federal regulation on cable rates and telling cable companies to pay for broadcasters' programming.
Spurred by consumer complaints of rising charges and poor service from cable operators, the Senate adopted legislation that would require the Federal Communications Commission to establish national guidelines for basic cable-television rates. The F.C.C. would then regulate rates itself or allow local authorities to do so provided they followed the national guidelines. Most of the cable industry's rates were deregulated in 1984. 
 The Senate bill would also for the first time allow local television stations, some of them owned by ABC, CBS and NBC, to begin collecting fees from the cable industry for the retransmission of the stations' signals, a big setback for that industry.
 
Bipartisan Support
 The Senators voted 73 to 18 for the bill today, with a majority from both parties supporting the new regulation.
The House has consistently been more enthusiastic than the Senate in recent years about regulating the cable industry. Similar legislation is pending in the House as leaders have waited to see whether the Senate, which blocked a cable-regulation bill in 1990, was willing to change its position.
The Bush Administration threatened on Monday to veto the Senate version, contending that recently proposed legislation to allow telephone companies into the cable industry would create enough competition to hold down cable-television rates and improve service.
Consumer groups backed today's bill because it would control rates and force cable-television programmers to sell their own channels, like CNN and ESPN, at "reasonable" rates to all cable-and satellite-television companies. About 3.6 million mostly rural families in the United States rely on home satellite dishes, often because they cannot hook up to cable.
 
Warning by Cable Operators
 The average rate charged to cable subscribers climbed 61 percent nationwide from 1986 to 1990, with rates doubling and tripling in some cities. But the cable industry says that because the number of available cable channels was also increasing during this period, the rate per channel was rising by only slightly more than the inflation rate.
The cable industry contends that consumers will actually be hurt if the extra fees paid to broadcasters are high enough to push up monthly cable rates. If regulators set rates too low, the cable industry has warned that it may be forced to spend less money to develop new or better programs.
"This so-called consumer protection bill, designed for the benefit of the conventional broadcasting industry, would force cable subscribers' dollars to go to support CBS and NBC, at the expense of cable channels like Discovery and CNN," said James P. Mooney, the president and chief executive of the National Cable Television Association.
The besieged broadcast industry, which has lost a seventh of its market share to the cable industry in six years, could collect as much as $3 billion in annual fees for the retransmission rights under the legislation voted today.
"The Senate has taken a giant leap toward insuring the long-term viability of universal, free, over-the-air television service," said Edward O. Fritts, the president and chief executive of the National Association of Broadcasters.
Consumer advocates say the new fees to broadcasters will not be high enough to prevent cable rates from falling with regulation, although no one actually knows what the broadcast retransmission fees will be.
Cable companies would be allowed to refuse to retransmit the signal of any broadcast station whose fee they found exorbitant, so the fee per subscriber cannot be predicted. But as much as three-quarters of the cable industry's viewers mainly watch retransmitted broadcasts.
Cable companies would be forced to transmit those broadcast signals that are given to them without charge.
Representative Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat who is a member of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, said that because of the lopsided majority in the Senate today, he expected the House to pass broad cable-regulation legislation within two months. "That's an extremely strong vote, that's way beyond a veto-proof majority, and I think that will accelerate House passage of a very strong bill," he said.
Two years ago the House passed by a unanimous voice vote a bill that would have authorized the F.C.C. to regulate virtually all basic cable-television service plans, while local governments could petition for F.C.C. regulation of the next more expensive tier if rates became unreasonable. The basic plans would only have included local broadcast stations and public service channels.
Another bill pending in the House is nearly identical to the Senate bill, but it excludes retransmission payments from cable companies to broadcasters. The bill was introduced by Representative Dennis E. Eckart, Democrat of Ohio, who has also sponsored a separate bill calling for such retransmission payments.
 
F.C.C. Sets Definitions
 Congress barred local rate regulation in 1984 except where there was no "effective competition" from broadcast stations. The F.C.C. initially ruled that effective competition existed in any city with three or more broadcast stations, a decision that left 97 percent of the industry free of government price restrictions.
But effective Oct. 25 last year, the F.C.C. tightened its standard to six or more broadcast stations, a ruling that authorized rate regulations for two-thirds of the nation's cable systems and a third of the nation's cable subscribers. Local rate regulation has been limited, however, to basic service plans that must include local broadcast stations and public service channels but little else.
In response to the F.C.C.'s action and the threat of Congressional legislation, some cable systems have taken popular channels like CNN and ESPN out of their basic plans and offered them as premium services.
 
If Complaints Are Lodged
 Today's Senate bill would authorize rate regulation for almost all of the nation's cable systems. Basic service plans would be regulated immediately, while the F.C.C. would be given the authority to regulate more expensive service plans if it receives complaints of unreasonable rate increases.
The Senate bill would also address the dwindling variety in basic service plans by prescribing regulation for the next more expensive service plan in any city where the basic service plan attracts less than 30 percent of all cable subscribers.
Critics of the F.C.C. have suggested that it will draft a weak set of regulatory guidelines if the Senate bill is signed into law. But the Federal agency's decision to tighten its definition of effective competition has also demonstrated the staff's alarm at rising cable rates.
The Motion Picture Association of America opposed today's legislation because it made no provision for Hollywood to receive part of the retransmission fees. But the powerful lobby of movie producers has traditionally had more influence in the House than the Senate.
Underlying the entire debate over cable-television legislation today was a division over whether regulation or competition would be the best way to protect consumers from abusive pricing and service in the cable industry.

HEADLINE: Bleak Economy Shatters Job Security in Banking

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Jan. 26

 BODY:
Mark Hollowell was 17 years old and just out of high school when an Arizona bank took him on as a mail clerk. Banks were clean and respectable places, with nice benefits, nice hours, nice people and above all, job security. In time, he became an assistant vice president earning $35,000 a year.
Today, at 32, Mr. Hollowell is one of tens of thousands of American bank employees who have lost their jobs over the last two years. His wife, Tammie, has a $32,000-a-year job as a systems analyst that keeps their family afloat, but her own prospects are dimming. She, too, works for a bank, Valley National, which has laid off 1,000 people since the late 1980's.
 
Worse Before It's Better
 "Can you believe?" Mr. Hollowell said. "We both got into this thinking we were set for life." 
 The recession that has been the most brutal in memory for white-collar workers has been especially jolting for bank employees, who had reason to expect they had been hired until they reached retirement age. Once a staid and strait-laced business with courthouse-like buildings that were quiet as churches, banking hurtled into a decade of easy lending, giveaway credit cards, 24-hour automatic teller machines and branches as ubiquitous as the gas stations they have come to mimic.
The overstaffing and overexpansion of the 80's brought on thousands of layoffs when the recession hit. The Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 22,000 jobs, from chief executives to tellers, were lost in commercial banks nationwide last year, falling to 1.5 million. In savings institutions, 27,000 jobs were cut, to 331,000. Many of those layoffs were in New York City, the nation's banking capital, which lost about 7,000 commercial and savings bank jobs, dropping to 150,000.
And for banking, the turmoil is likely to continue well after the recession ends. The Federal Government's sales and closings of floundering savings institutions, more than 500 to date, are far from over. And more mergers of giant banks, like the pending combination of Bank of America of San Francisco and Security Pacific of Los Angeles, spell 100,000 more layoffs this year in commercial banks alone, predicts Towers Perrin, a management consulting firm.
The upheaval in banking is a stark example of the contraction and metamorphosis invading much of the American workplace, pushed along by the recession. Below the top management ranks, temporary and part-time workers with negligible benefits are displacing full-time workers with generous benefits. And even for full-timers, an old understanding is evaporating: the idea that dedicated work will be rewarded with a career-long job and regular promotions.
Lorraine Broshears, 42, profited from the changes in the 80's that let women move out of the teller cage and back office. In Phoenix, she ran the 23-branch northern division of Pima Savings and Loan with a staff of 113. She earned $49,000 a year, which with the salary of her husband, Ed, a pilot for America West, gave her an easy life. But the airline has been ailing and is operating under protection of bankruptcy court, and the Bank of America has taken over Pima and shut it down. "All of a sudden you're given two weeks' notice and you're gone," Mrs. Broshears said.
 
Go-Getters, and Takers
 Mrs. Broshears relished banking's hustle and bustle. To be sure, in the 80's, the industry bred self-dealing gunslingers like Charles H. Keating Jr., whose headquarters were in Phoenix, and the competitive fervor of the times blinded banks' judgment in making loans. But Mrs. Broshears said it also produced a smarter and better business, with banking employees getting out of their offices to corral deposits and make loans.
"Careers depend on making sales," she said. "That's something 20 years ago you never saw." She disagrees with laid-off bank workers who think consumers have lost something in the new style of banking. But like them she condemns shoot-from-the-hip personnel policies. "Corporations won't find that dedication they would years ago," she said. "That's the consequence -- the disillusionment of the work force. Why be loyal when it won't be reciprocated?"
Among states, banking in Arizona has taken a colossal beating, the result of frenzied lending to underqualified customers for houses, offices and shopping malls and the subsequent collapse of real estate values. Harold Feeney, the state's new superintendent of banking, says only one small savings and loan institution survives of the 12 based in the state in the mid-1980's, while the number of commercial banks has shrunk to 37 from 50.
Of 26,000 bank employees four years ago, nearly one in five had lost their jobs through last June, the last date for which the state employment service has data. The figure is certainly higher now: the state unemployment rate leaped to 8.6 percent in December, from 7.1 percent in November and 4.5 percent in April.
 
Help-Not-Wanted Ads
 One of the few help-wanted ads for banking employees these days is an offer by Citibank's Arizona subsidiary for a collection agent to track down consumers who have stopped payments on the mortgages and personal loans that it made so freely in the 80's. Personnel offices of surviving banks are so swamped with job seekers that one has been running an advertisement that says, "M& I Thunderbird Bank has no current openings and is not accepting applications at this time."
Executives of banks that have been letting people go say they have little choice. They have to push down costs to survive in a less regulated world of competitors that includes banks from out of state, mutual funds, insurance companies and stockbrokers. "Business does not walk in the door," said Robert W. Wahlstrom, senior vice president and head of human resources at Valley National, the state's biggest bank. "It is no longer a placid, laid-back environment."
In earlier recessions, employment officials here say, people could still find jobs as tellers or lending officers. "Banking was always an industry you would recommend to someone who wanted a career change," said Richard Polito, manager of Arizona's job placement and training service in downtown Phoenix. "It was a safety net occupation. It was recession-proof."
Every Tuesday, an organization of unemployed executives known as Azpen, for Arizona Professional Employees Network, gathers at a Mennonite church in the affluent northern part of Phoenix. Many were bankers or had jobs tied to banking.
More than 200 people, mostly aged 35 to 60, most in coats and ties and twice the usual number, showed up at the meeting on Jan. 21. They heard lectures from fellow members on building self-esteem and on networking to help one another find jobs.
One job seeker attending that day was Mike Miller, 49, laid off as a branch administrator for M& I Thunderbird. "I was caught in a rif, a reduction in force," he said. "The section I was in was decimated. They moved the things we were doing to other areas of the bank." Mr. Miller took a part-time job helping the Federal Government review loans of banks it was taking over, but that work dried up.
"Banking used to be fun," he said. "You knew your customer. It's like working in a factory now."
Richard Nosky, who recruits executives for Arizona companies, used to have to look far out of state to find officers for the state's booming banks. Now he says he has a file of dozens of banking executives who earned $60,000 to more than $200,000 a year and who are looking for work.
In Mr. Nosky's files is J. Michael Materie, 53, whose credentials suggest that he is better equipped than most bankers for the current environment. Regulators would recruit him to stabilize sinking savings and loans so they could be sold. He earned $220,000 a year fixing up one that was taken over by the Bank of America, and the Government let him go without a severance check.
 
Giving It Up
 Mr. Materie has sold his Mercedes and kept his Chevrolet Blazer. He thinks he and his wife, Helen, who does not work outside the home, can get along until he starts collecting a pension in about 10 years. But what he wants more than a salary is a top management job, and not necessarily in banking. "I'd most like to be running a company," he said. "I think I was good at it. I've been a senior vice president or higher in everything I've done since 1975."
Some people here have given up on banks. Last November Gail Stapleton, 36 and single, accepted a voluntary layoff from Valley National after 14 years there, most as a personal banker. "I wanted to work for a bank," she said. "I loved math. And I loved people. What could be better than banking?" But in the 80's, Valley National turned up pressure on personal bankers, giving them loan quotas to meet. Ms. Stapleton has gone back to school and is pondering a career in the arts -- working in a gallery or designing fabric.
To avert layoffs of solid performers in future recessions, Mr. Wahlstrom said, Valley National is forming a core of 6,500 permanent employees, 500 fewer than now on the payroll. Part-time and temporary workers would take the heat of recessions, Mr. Wahlstrom said. Already, he said, several hundred of Valley National's 1,300 tellers are part-timers. "You can no longer afford to carry a person who is partially productive," he said.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Clears Way for Return of Haitians

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Supreme Court cleared the way tonight for the repatriation of thousands of Haitians even while a Federal appeals court was deciding the legality of the policy.
In reaching its order, the High Court voted 6 to 3 to grant the Justice Department's motion to stay a Federal court's injunction against the forcible return of Haitians who fled their country after its first democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was ousted in a coup in September. 
 The ruling gives the Administration the authority to start repatriating the Haitians, 9,000 of whom are being held at the United States Navy base at Guantanamo, Cuba, even though the issue is still being argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, said a senior Justice Department official who insisted on anonymity.
 
One Ruling Withdrawn
 "As a practical matter, it means the Government is free to begin the forced return of Haitians until the 11th Circuit's decision," said Ira Kurzban, a Miami lawyer representing the Haitian Refugee Center.
The High Court's order simply said that the injunction issued by a Federal judge in Miami "is stayed pending disposition of the case" by the appeals court.
Earlier today, the appeals court said it had erroneously announced that it ruled in favor of the Government. The court later withdrew the order, saying it was a clerical error.
After the announcement favoring the Government, Attorney General William Barr immediately said the Government had clear authority to repatriate the Haitians. Another Government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the process could begin "in the very near future."
 
Thousands Have Fled
 The United States and the Organization of American States have refused to recognize the army-supported regime that replaced Father Aristide, and responded by imposing a harsh economic embargo on Haiti to press for his return.
More than 14,000 Haitians have fled the Caribbean nation since the coup, but the United States says the that the Haitians are fleeing poverty, not political repression, and therefore are not entitled to political asylum.
An increase in the number of Haitians fleeing by boat in recent weeks and the deteriorating political climate in Haiti have apparently convinced the Administration that hopes for a political solution in Haiti have all but disappeared, and the Administration is having to consider a whole new range of policy options.
 The United States Ambassador to Haiti, Alvin P. Adams, Jr., was recalled this week to discuss policy options after a political meeting called by the Prime Minister-designate, Rene Theodore, was stormed by plainclothes policemen. Washington strongly condemned the Haitian military Government.

Spurred by consumer complaints of rising charges and poor service, the Senate voted 73 to 18 for the bill, which requires the F.C.C. to establish national guidelines for basic cable-television rates. [Page 1.] How Senators voted. [46.] 
 The Government index devised to forecast the economy fell 0.3 percent in December, its second straight decline. The leading indicators now stand at the lowest level since June. [35.]
Sales of new homes tumbled 6.6 percent in December, the Government said, wiping out nearly all of November's gains and dragging down the year's total to the lowest level in nine years. [35.]
Prices paid to farmers for raw products were unchanged from December to January, the Agriculture Department said. [46.]
Treasury Secretary Brady tried to convince the captains of American industry that a recovery was on its way. The surprise was that his audience needed little convincing. [35.] The White House stepped up efforts to give political momentum to Bush's economic proposals. [8.]
The Administration will delay a proposal to eliminate tax benefits for Americans who buy annuities. The shift came after insurance executives expressed concern and insurers' stocks plunged. [35.]
Members of a Senate subcommittee criticized the S.E.C. for not forcing companies to clarify how they pay top executives. [39.]
The recession has been especially jolting for bank employees, who had expected to have jobs until retirement. [1.]
 
Companies
Trans World Airlines made an unusual type of bankruptcy filing, having previously won agreements from most of its creditors to reduce its debt by $1 billion. The filing is an attempt to avoid the fate of competitors that have been forced to liquidate, and it gives the airline a good chance to survive. [1.]
As Macy's enters bankruptcy, Bloomingdale's is emerging from it with a new top merchant and a new attitude. [35.]

HEADLINE: SUMMIT AT THE U.N.;
Yeltsin, on Summit's Stage, Stresses His Russian Identity

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 31

 BODY:
As heir to the Soviet Union's Security Council seat, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia made his debut today on the stage of international summit talks, heading off comparisons with Mikhail S. Gorbachev by portraying himself as a man from a different country.
From the moment his IL-62 jet touched down at Kennedy Airport on Thursday night with the word Russia emblazoned across its side, Mr. Yeltsin made it clear that he represented a nation rising from the debris of the former Soviet state. 
 His was "free Russia," a Russia that had "just shaken off the yoke of Communism," a Russia he said had a "new Russian foreign policy" and wanted to be a full ally of the United States.
In his efforts to bring a free market to this new Russia, Mr. Yeltsin took time for just one sortie outside the meeting of 15 leaders of Security Council countries at the United Nations -- a private dinner at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with about 80 executives from government, business and banking. Those present included the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan; the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Gerald E. Corrigan, and the Secretary of the Treasury,Nicholas F. Brady.
As Vitaly Churkin, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said Mr. Yeltsin wanted to "cover three elements" in the United States: the Bush Administration, Congress and New York business.
Mr. Yeltsin's proclamation of the new Russia and the appeal to American business leaders went hand in hand, aides said, as both were aimed at dispelling old doubts about Soviet intentions and presenting instead a Russia that was democratic and committed to free markets.
"He's presenting Russia as a new phenomenon in international life," Mr. Churkin said. "There has been a qualitative change. Now that we're fully regarded as fully part of the democratic world, we would like to build our relations with other countries belonging to that world as friends and maybe as allies."
President Yeltsin portrayed his present economic-reform efforts as simply a continuation of the battle against Communism and the failed coup in August by Soviet hard-liners.
He said that among the major steps to a free market would be a presidential decree "granting concessions, along with a law on mineral resources that in particular will create great opportunities for attracting foreign capital and technologies into the raw-materials sector."
He also raised the possibility of unspecified most-favored-nation treatment for trading partners and concessions for individual and possibly group enterprises, as well as the creation of "joint corporations" in automobile manufacturing, energy production, farming and highway construction.
 
Mentions Technology Transfer
 In return, Mr. Yeltsin asked for "reciprocity" and noted that there were now American limits on the transfer of technology.
He also called for an early agreement between Russia and the United States on the protection of investments and mentioned the possibility of a Russian-American international insurance fund for private investments, in which other nations could take part.
Those pledges were aimed at businessmen and bankers in private -- people invited to the meeting like John F. McGillicuddy, chairman and chief executive officer of the Chemical Banking Corporation, and Walter V. Shipley, Chemical's president and chief operating officer, as well as William R. Rhodes, a vice chairman of Citicorp.
The Russian economy also came up in Mr. Yeltsin's meeting with the Chinese Prime Minister, Li Peng, which focused heavily on economic cooperation between China and the republics that form the new Commonwealth of Independent States.
But in his United Nations speech, Mr. Yeltsin's only passing references to the economy were a phrase blaming the Communists for creating an "economy mutilated by ideological diktat and built contrary to all common sense" and a pledge that Russia was "to embark upon a most difficult economic reform."
 
No Begging, However . . .
 This past July, after Mr. Gorbachev sought financial support for the Soviet Union at the meeting of leaders of seven large industrial democracies in London, he said pointedly that the President of a great power should not go around asking for handouts.
Mr. Yeltsin and his aides remembered those words. "Yeltsin will not ask" for Western money, one adviser Dmitri Volkogonov said, though he added that such scruples did not prevent lesser figures in the Russian Government from doing so. Still, Mr. Yeltsin seemed exasperated that the industrial democracies had not yet provided Russia with assistance like a fund to stabilize the ruble.
"We've been talking about this for seven months and unfortunately, so far, nothing has been done," he said at a news conference. "And that's very dnagerous. Today, Russia is facing the last opportunity to defend democracy and the entire world has noticed.
If the effort fails, he said, "once again there will be mass repression, once again we'll have the arms race and the world will be put into a completely new orbit."
He added that he expected the ruble to become a floating, convertible currency by 1993.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT AT THE U.N.;
Excerpts From Speeches by Leaders of Permanent Members of U.N. Council

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from speeches delivered today at a Security Council summit meeting by leaders of the Council's five permanent member nations. Translations were provided by the Russian, Chinese and French missions.
 
BORIS N. YELTSIN
President of Russia
 This summit meeting of the Security Council, the first of its kind on the political Olympus of the contemporary world, is a historic and unprecedented event. The end of the 20th century is a time of great promise and new anxieties. The never-ending search for truth and an insight into what the future has in store for humanity seems to be getting its second wind. 
 Perhaps for the first time ever there is now a real chance to put an end to despotism and to dismantle the totalitarian order whatever shape it may take.
I trust that after all the unthinkable tragedies and tremendous losses that it has suffered, mankind will reject this legacy. It will not allow the 21st century to bring new suffering and deprivations to our children and grandchildren.
The process of profound change is already under way in various spheres of life and above all in the economy.
 
Problem for All Humanity
 It is a problem that concerns not just individual nations or states, but the entire humanity. After all, an economy mutilated by ideological diktat and built contrary to all common sense forms the principal material basis of totalitarianism.
A profound awareness of this causal relationship has led the Russian leadership to embark upon a most difficult economic reform. We have taken that risk in a country where an all-out war was waged against economic interests for many decades.
I am grateful to the world community for its support of our efforts and for the understanding that not only the future of the people of Russia, but also that of the entire planet, largely depends on whether or not the reforms are successful. I am also grateful to Russians for their courage and patience. They should take a great deal of credit for the fact that the world community is breaking with its totalitarian past.
Democracy is one of the major assets of human civilization. All times and all countries have known people who stood up to defend it without sparing themselves. The people of Russia defended democracy near the walls of our Moscow White House.
 
Democratic Guarantees
 Now we must accomplish the most difficult task, that is, the creation of legal, political and socioeconomic guarantees to make democratic changes irreversible.
All of us carry a huge burden of mutual mistrust. It is no secret that a most profound abyss has separated the two states that until recently were referred to as the superpowers. This abyss must be bridged. That is the wish of our nations and the will of the Presidents of the United States of America and the Russian federation.
The new political situation in the world makes it possible not only to advance new original ideas but also to make even the most ambitious of them practicable. Our proposals have been outlined in our messages to the United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Boutros-Ghali, and the U.S. President, Mr. George Bush.
Russia believes that the time has come to considerably reduce the presence of means of destruction on our planet. I am convinced that together we are capable of making the principle of minimum defense sufficiency a fundamental law of existence of contemporary states.
 
Real Opportunities
 Today there are real opportunities for:
*Implementing deep cuts in strategic offensive arms and tactical nuclear weapons;
*Resolutely moving towards significant limitations on nuclear testing and even towards its complete cessation;
*Making ABM defenses less complicated and costly and eliminating anti-satellite systems;
*Considerably reducing conventional armaments and armed forces;
*Ensuring practical implementation of international agreements on the prohibition of chemical and bacteriological weapons;
*Enhancing the reliability of barriers to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
 
Problem of Arms Experts
 The problem of experts engaged in the development and production of such weapons, including nuclear physicists, has lately become a top priority. No county has the right to use its talents for political gains at the expense of international security. Russia is fully aware of its own responsibility and is taking steps to provide social security to such experts.
At the same time we support the idea of establishing international centers that could coordinate appropriate research and support the most promising areas of work.
I think the time has come to consider creating a global system for protection of the world community. It could be based on a reorientation of the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative to make use of high technologies developed in Russia's defense complex.
We are ready to actively participate in building and putting in place a pan-European collective defense system, in particular in the Vienna talks and in the upcoming post-Helsinki II talks on security and cooperation in Europe.
Russia considers the United States and the West not as mere partners but rather as allies. It is a basis prerequisite for, I would say, a revolution in peaceful cooperation among civilized nations.
We reject any subordination of foreign policy to pure ideology or ideological doctrines. Our principles are clear and simple: supremacy of democracy, human rights and freedoms, legal and moral standards.

 	 	 		. . .	 	A few days ago the 10 remaining political prisoners were granted pardon by a decree of the President of the Russian federation. There are no more prisoners of conscience in free Russia.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We will make use of the effective role of the United Nations and the Security Council and take part in the search for lasting solutions to the Yugoslav and Afghan problems and for a normalization of the situation in the Near and Middle East and in Cambodia and in other regions.
I believe that we need a special quick-response mechanism to insure peace and stability. Upon a decision of the Security Council it could be expeditiously activated in areas of crisis.
We are prepared to become practically involved in United Nations peacekeeping operations and contribute to their logistical support.
My country firmly supports steps aimed at asserting the rule of law throughout the world. It is necessary to enhance the prestige of the International Court of Justice as an effective instrument of peaceful settlement of international disputes.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
GEORGE BUSH
President of the United States
 We meet at a moment of new beginnings for this institution and really for every member nation.
And for most of its history, the United Nations was caught in a cold war crossfire. And I think back to my days here, in the early '70s, as a permanent representative, of the way then polemics displaced peacekeeping. And long before I came onto the scene and long after I left, the U.N. was all too often paralyzed by cruel ideological divisions and the struggle to contain Soviet expansion.
And today all that's changed. In the collapse of imperial Communism and the end of the cold war breathe new life into the United Nations. And it was just one year ago that the world saw this new, invigorated United Nations in action, as this Council stood fast against aggression and stood for the sacred principles enshrined in the U.N. Charter.
And now it's time to step forward again, make the internal reforms, accelerate the revitalization, accept the responsibilities necessary for a vigorous and effective United Nations.

 	 	 		. . .	 	It's an exciting opportunity for our United Nations, and we must not allow it to slip away. Right now, across the globe the U.N. is working night and day in the cause of peace. And never before in its four decades have the U.N.'s blue helmets and blue berets been so engaged in the noble work of peacekeeping, even to the extent of building the foundation for free elections. And never before has the United Nations been so ready and so compelled to step up to the task of peacemaking, both to resolve hot wars and to conduct that forward-looking mission known as preventive diplomacy.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Democracy, human rights, the rule of law, these are the building blocks of peace and freedom. And in the lives of millions of men and women around the world, its import is simple. It can mean the difference between war and peace, healing and hatred, and where there is fear and despair it really can mean hope.

 	 	 		. . .	 	In my first address here to the United Nations as President, I challenged the Soviet Union to eliminate chemical weapons, and called on every nation to join us in this crusade.. . . What greater cause for this great body -- to make certain the world has seen the last of these terrible weapons. And so let us vow to make this year the year all nations at long last join to ban this scourge.
There is much more to do regarding weapons of mass destruction.
 
Anti-Nuclear Steps
 Just three days ago, in my State of the Union message here, I announced the steps, far-reaching unilateral steps that we will take to reduce our nuclear arsenal, and these steps affect each element in our strategic triad -- the land, the sea and the air.
In addition to these unilateral steps, we are prepared to move forward on mutual arms reduction. I noted his constructive comments here today; and tomorrow, in my meeting with President Yeltsin, we will continue the search for common ground on this vitally important issue. He responded with some very serious proposals just the other day.
Our triumph in the gulf is testament to the U.N.'s mission -- that security is a shared responsibility. And today, this institution spearheads a quarantine against the outlaw regime of Saddam Hussein. It is the strong belief of my country that we must keep sanctions in place and take the following steps to preserve our common security.
We must continue to focus on Iraq's capability to build or maintain weapons of mass destruction. And we must make clear to the world and, most important, to the people of Iraq that no normalization is possible so long as Saddam Hussein remains there, remains in power.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Two weeks ago, this Council, in unity, sent a very strong message to Libya. And let me repeat today Resolution 731, passed unanimously by this body, by the Security Council, calls on Libya to comply fully with the requests of three states on this Council. And I would just like to use this meeting today to call on Libya to heed the call of the Security Council of the United Nations.
 
LI PENG
Prime Minister of China
 Human rights and fundamental freedoms of the entire mankind should be universally respected. Human rights covers many aspects. They include not only civil and political rights, but also economic, social and cultural rights. As far as the large numbers of developing countries are concerned, the rights to independence, subsistence and development are of paramount importance.
In essence, the issue of human rights falls within the sovereignty of each country. A country's human rights situation should not be judged in total disregard of its history and national conditions. It is neither appropriate nor workable to demand that all countries measure up to the human rights criteria or models of one or a small number of countries.
China values human rights and stands ready to engage in discussion and cooperation with other countries on an equal footing on the question of human rights -- on the basis of mutual understanding, mutual respect, and seeking consensus while reserving differences. However, it is opposed to interference in the internal affairs of other countries using the human rights issue as an excuse.
 
JOHN MAJOR
Prime Minister of Britain
 I hope this meeting will set in hand work to strengthen the United Nations.
New ideas focus on new opportunities in preventive diplomacy and in peacemaking and peacekeeping. By preventive diplomacy we mean action to avert, or at least to contain, crisis. Let us exploit the unrealized potential of the U.N. Charter.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The Secretary General should take the initiative boldly in drawing potential conflict to the attention of the Security Council. In the past he has been hobbled by the political rivalry between member states, often reflected most sharply in the Council.
In the future, the Council must be prepared to act before tension becomes conflict. The Secretary General deserves an assurance of our good faith in his judgment. This meeting can give him that assurance.. . .
Peacemaking and peacekeeping should run in parallel. Demand is not likely to decrease; we should like to enhance the U.N.'s ability to respond. We recognize the load placed on the organization and the skills and experience of its staff. But we want the U.N. to be able to carry out its mission even more effectively. That is why we propose that the Council should invite the Secretary General to give his ideas on how this might be done.
The report might look at the U.N.'s role in identifying and dealing with causes of instability and potential crisis, as well as the contribution to be made by regional bodies in helping the work of the Council.
 
FRANCOIS MITTERRAND
President of France
 This collective security will be very quickly jeopardized unless we can establish modern conditions for it. Past experience has not been convincing. Nothing is possible without the determination of states, and especially the major powers, to reject the law of the jungle, the 'might is right' principle. This determination is enshrined in the United Nations Charter. This Charter was blocked for a long time and yet now it is usable in all its provisions, which we have to apply immediately.. . .
I would like to inform you that a country such as France is ready to make available to the United Nations Secretary General a contingent of 1,000 men for peacekeeping operations, at any time and on 48 hours' notice. The number could be doubled within a week. This deployment would clearly mean activating the military staff committee which is provided for by the Charter.
Secondly, we have to develop preventive diplomacy. This is essential. The members of the Security Council must undertake systematically to provide the Secretary General with information on international security and give him a mandate to enter into regular contact with his counterparts, leaders of regional organizations.. . .
Lastly, we should also make use, as much as necessary, of new forums to address the specific needs on relations between disarmament and development. Suggestions have been made, such as those by Germany, and they are good ones.
This is why France is recommending the establishment of regional funds for conversion which would promote the transfer of research and military development to nonmilitary production -- initially for the benefit of new states, republics which have an urgent need; also for the benefit of certain states which are heirs to the former Soviet Union and also of many other countries, in the Middle East among others.

HEADLINE: Administration Delays Plan To End Annuity Tax Benefit

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Bush Administration backed down tonight and said it would delay a proposal to eliminate the tax benefits enjoyed by the hundreds of thousands of customers who each year buy annuities.
The action came after top life-insurance executives expressed concern over the proposal and after insurance industry stocks fell in trading today, with Aetna Life and Casualty down $2.50 a share, to $41.50, and Cigna losing $1.125 a share, to $54. 
 As proposed, the bill sent to Congress by the Administration would have been effective Saturday, raising the likelihood that annuity sales would dry up immediately. But the Treasury said late today that it would revise the proposal to make it effective only after it was approved by Congress. A tax provision often takes effect the day the bill is introduced, which can be many months before it is actually passed by the Congress and signed by the President.
The Treasury decision is likely to lead to a surge in annuity sales, as buyers rush to get tax advantages that could soon be lost.
Some two-thirds of the life insurers' business is now devoted to annuities. Those sales would likely fall off sharply if the President's proposal ending the tax-deferred status of annuity earnings became law.
Meanwhile, executives of top Wall Street brokerage firms expressed opposition to the President's proposal that would tax the unrealized gains that brokerage firms often enjoy on their inventory of securities.
Although annuities have long been sold as a form of insurance against living too long -- beyond one's ability to pay for retirement -- in recent years annuities have become a popular vehicle for accumulating savings tax-free. Some people use annuity proceeds to supplement retirement income late in life, paying for everyday expenses, but others have viewed annuities as akin to bank certificates of deposit on which they can earn interest tax-free.
It is the latter use that the Government is trying to curtail. Under the budget plan that President Bush detailed in his State of the Union Message this week, the interest earned on annuities that lacked a significant "life contingency" would be taxed, just as the interest on bank C.D.'s is taxed.
In other words, if an annuity were designed so that the annuity customer or the customer's heirs were guaranteed a minimum payout regardless of when the customer died, the Government would take the position that the annuity was really a savings vehicle that deserved to be taxed.
At the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, Ted Athanassiades, a senior executive vice president, estimated that 90 percent of the annuities that the Met sold would not meet the Government's test for having a life contingency. Mr. Athanassiades argued that nevertheless the vast majority of annuity buyers did purchase their contract to supplement retirement savings and that the President's proposal would punish the majority in order to thwart a minority who viewed annuities as tax dodges.
"This is a great vehicle for long-term savings -- maybe because of the tax-deferred status," Mr. Athanassiades said. "Yet, the way the Government wants to require life contingencies, it would make the product unsalable."
 
Insurer Calls Proposal Unfair
 At Aetna, another major seller of annuity contracts, Tom West, a senior vice president, said the President's proposal was unfair for two reasons. For one thing, he said, it would require purchasers of annuities to decide when they bought their contracts (rather than at retirement) whether they wanted a payout with a life contingency.
"When people buy annuities, they don't know whether they will be married when they begin receiving their annuity, whether their spouse will be alive, or what their financial or health condition will be," Mr. West said. "And in any case, people should know that if they do die early their estate will get a refund of the unspent amount."
But at Indiana University, Prof. Joseph Belth, the editor of a prominent life insurance industry newsletter, the Insurance Forum, said that "in terms of pure tax theory, you could make an argument for what the Treasury is doing." He continued, "Their argument would be that as long as there is not a substantial insurance element to an annuity, it should not be treated as insurance for tax purposes."
He said that not even the American Council of Life Insurance, the industry's Washington-based trade group, questioned the tax logic of the President's proposal. Instead, Richard Schweiker, the former Senator from Pennsylvania who is now the council's president, focused on the possibility that the proposal would slow savings in the economy.
A similar theme was voiced by the Securities Industry Association, a Wall Street trade group, which argued that requiring brokers to pay taxes based on the increased value of securities they hold in inventory would weaken the industry's competitiveness versus foreign brokers and could actually draw capital out of Wall Street at a time when the public is concerned about the strength of financial institutions of all types.
"We are the only industry that is being asked to take things that are in inventory and treat them as sold," said a Merrill Lynch spokesman, speaking on condition that he not be identified.

Security Council Summit Declaration: 'New Risks for Stability and Security'

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Following is the text of the declaration issued at the Security Council summit meeting here today:
The Security Council met at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York on Jan. 31, 1992, for the first time at the level of heads of state and government. The members of the Council considered, within the framework of their commitment to the United Nations Charter, "the responsibility of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security." 
 The members of the Security Council consider that their meeting is a timely recognition of the fact that there are new favorable international circumstances under which the Security Council has begun to fulfill more effectively its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.
This meeting takes place at a time of momentous change. The ending of the cold war has raised hopes for a safer, more equitable and more humane world. Rapid progress has been made in many regions of the world toward democracy and responsive forms of government, as well as toward achieving the purposes set out in the Charter. The completion of the dismantling of apartheid in South Africa would constitute a major contribution to these purposes and positive trends, including to the encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
 
Liberation of Kuwait
 Last year, under the authority of the United Nations, the international community succeeded in enabling Kuwait to regain its sovereignty and territorial integrity, which it had lost as a result of Iraqi aggression. The resolutions adopted by the Security Council remain essential to the restoration of peace and stability in the region and must be fully implemented. At the same time the members of the Council are concerned by the humanitarian situation of the innocent civilian population of Iraq.
The members of the Council support the Middle East peace process, facilitated by the Russian Federation and the United States, and hope that it will be brought to a successful conclusion on the basis of Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).
They welcome the role the United Nations has been able to play under the Charter in progress toward settling longstanding regional disputes, and will work for further progress toward their resolution. They applaud the valuable contribution being made by United Nations peacekeeping forces now operating in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe.
The members of the Council note that United Nations peacekeeping tasks have increased and broadened considerably in recent years. Election monitoring, human-rights verification and the repatriation of refugees have in the settlement of some regional conflicts, at the request or with the agreement of the parties concerned, been integral parts of the Security Council's effort to maintain international peace and security. They welcome these developments.
The members of the Council also recognize that change, however welcome, has brought new risks for stability and security. Some of the most acute problems result from changes to state structures. The members of the Council will encourage all efforts to help achieve peace, stability and cooperation during these changes.
 
New Challenges to U.N.
 The international community therefore faces new challenges in the search for peace. All member states expect the United Nations to play a central role at this crucial stage. The members of the Council stress the importance of strengthening and improving the United Nations to increase its effectiveness. They are determined to assume fully their responsibilities with the United Nations Organization in the framework of the Charter.
The absence of war and military conflicts amongst states does not in itself insure international peace and security. The non-military sources of instability in the economic, social, humanitarian and ecological fields have become threats to peace and security. The United Nations membership as a whole needs to give the highest priority to the solution of these matters.
The members of the Council pledge their commitment to international law and to the United Nations Charter. All disputes between states should be peacefully resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.
The members of the Council reaffirm their commitment to the collective security system of the Charter to deal with threats to peace and to reverse acts of aggression.
The members of the Council express their deep concern over acts of international terrorism and emphasize the need for the international community to deal effectively with all such acts.
To strengthen the effectiveness of these commitments, and in order that the Security Council should have the means to discharge its primary responsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security, the members of the Council have decided on the following approach.
They invite the Secretary General to prepare, for circulation to the members of the United Nations by July 1, 1992, his analysis and recommendations on ways of strengthening and making more efficient within the framework and provisions of the Charter the capacity of the United Nations for preventive diplomacy, for peacemaking and for peacekeeping.
The Secretary General's analysis and recommendations could cover the role of the United Nations in identifying potential crises and areas of instability as well as the contribution to be made by regional organizations in accordance with Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter in helping the work of the Council. They could also cover the need for adequate resources, both material and financial. The Secretary General might draw on lessons learned in recent United Nations peacekeeping missions to recommend ways of making more effective Secretariat planning and operations. He could also consider how greater use might be made of his good offices, and of his other functions under the United Nations Charter.
The members of the Council, while fully conscious of the responsibilites of other organs of the United Nations in the fields of disarmament, arms control and nonproliferation, reaffirm the crucial contribution which progress in these areas can make to the maintenance of international peace and security. They express their commitment to take concrete steps to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations in these areas.
 
Arms-Control Issues
 The members of the Council underline the need for all member states to fulfill their obligations in relation to arms control and disarmament; to prevent the proliferation in all its aspects of all weapons of mass destructions; to avoid excessive and destabilizing accumulations and transfers of arms, and to resolve peacefully in accordance with the Charter any problems concerning these matters threatening or disrupting the maintenance of regional and global stability. They emphasize the importance of the early ratification and implementation by the states concerned of all international and regional arms-control arrangements, especially the Start and C.F.E. treaties.
The proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The members of the Council commit themselves to working to prevent the spread of technology related to the research for or production of such weapons and to take appropriate action to that end.
On nuclear proliferation, they note the importance of the decision of many countries to adhere to the nonproliferation treaty and emphasize the integral role in the implementation of that treaty of fully effective I.A.E.A. safeguards, as well as the importance of effective export controls. The members of the Council will take appropriate measures in the case of any violations notified to them by the I.A.E.A.
On chemical weapons, they support the efforts of the Geneva conference with a view to reaching agreement on the conclusion, by the end of 1992, of a universal convention, including a verification regime, to prohibit chemical weapons.
 
Monitoring Arms Transfers
 On conventional armaments, they note the General Assembly's vote in favor of a United Nations register of arms transfers as a first step, and in this connection recognize the importance of all states providing all the information called for in the General Assembly's resolution.
In conclusion the members of the Security Council affirm their determination to build on the initiative of their meeting in order to secure positive advances in promoting international peace and security. They agree that the United Nations Secretary General has a crucial role to play. The members of the Council express their deep appreciation to the outgoing Secretary General, His Excellency Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, for his outstanding contribution to the work of the United Nations, culminating in the signature of the El Salvador peace agreement. They welcome the new Secretary Gcapeneral, His Excellency Dr. Boutros Ghali, and note with satisfaction his intention to strengthen and improve the functioning of the United Nations. They pledge their full support to him, and undertake to work closely with him and his staff in fulfillment of their shared objectives, including a more efficient and effective United Nations system.
The members of the Council agree that the world now has the best chance of achieving international peace and security since the foundation of the United Nations. They undertake to work, in their own efforts and in close cooperation with other United Nations member states to achieve this, as well as to address urgently all the other problems, in particular those of economic and social development, requiring the collective response of the international community. They recognize that peace and prosperity are indivisible and that lasting peace and stability require effective international cooperation for the eradication of poverty and the promotion of a better life for all in larger freedom.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Debate;
Bush's Economic Programs Are Target of 5 Democrats

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The five major candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination assailed President Bush's economic recovery program tonight and offered alternative visions in a nationally televised debate that revolved as much around policy as personal swipes.
Tonight's debate reflected the pragmatic, meat-and-potatoes tone of this campaign as candidates aim their appeals at the hard-hit voters of New Hampshire, whose Feb. 18 primary is just a little more than two weeks away. The economy dominated, beginning with the candidates' biting response to President Bush's State of the Union Message Tuesday night. 
 Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska characterized the President's speech as "all hat and no cowboy." Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas said Mr. Bush did not seem to understand "the magnitude" of the nation's economic plight. "They just don't get it," he said. And Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa said Mr. Bush was promising simply "more of the same."
But there was some aggressive intramural jockeying among the candidates. Mr. Kerrey tried to present Mr. Clinton as a candidate who tried to be all things to all people, on issues from the Congressional raise to health care.
"At least tell the American people what you're for, what you're prepared to stand up and fight for," Mr. Kerrey said, asserting that Mr. Clinton attacked the Congressional raise in advertising after praising it in a private conversation. Mr. Clinton denied that.
Mr. Harkin tried to cast his rivals as being too close to the Republicans in their tax policies, particularly on the issue of capital gains. The Senator from Iowa, who presents himself as the most faithful Democrat in the race, asserted that support for a cut in the tax on capital gains, "however you slice it, favors the rich."
Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who supports such a cut if it is devised to enoucrage investment, noted that his rivals had treated him far more gently when they considered him less of a threat. "I've moved up in the polls and now I'm Darth Vadar," said the former Senator, who is second in many of the New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Clinton seemed to relish a return to the issues tonight, in his first major debate appearance since a supermarket tabloid published accusations that he had a 12-year sexual affair with an Arkansas state worker and sometime singer. Mr. Clinton has denied the accusations.
"I'm glad to be attacked by my opponents tonight; this is kind of refreshing," said Mr. Clinton, whose rivals took aim at his record as Governor of Arkansas but steered clear of the personal assertions , until the closing moments.
Then, Edmund G. Brown Jr., former Governor of California, raised the woman's assertions, an issue that Mr. Kerrey quickly denounced as "not legitimate." Mr. Clinton himself said that he had addressed the matter sufficiently.
Mr. Kerrey, still trying to ignite his campaign, spent much of the two-hour session emphasizing his commitment to cutting the deficit and reorganizing and streamlining the Government. He also touted his plan for national health insurance, which sparked one of the sharper exchanges of the night when Mr. Harkin asserted that Mr. Kerrey's plan was far too costly to the average taxpayer.
 
Special Interests Assailed
 Mr. Tsongas continued his efforts to present himself as the truth-teller, willing to avoid the easy path of tax cuts for the middle class, which are the centerpiece of Mr. Clinton's platform. "I'm not running to be Santa Claus," said Mr. Tsongas. "I'm running to be President."
And Mr. Brown argued, once again, that the source of the nation's woes was a political system in the control of special interests.
The debate, the second of seven to be held during the Democratic primary season, was broadcast on PBS and held at the WETA-TV studios in suburban Virginia outside Washington. It was moderated by Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer.
After Mr. Lehrer suggested that Mr. Harkin's ideas were throwbacks to the New Deal, the Senator readily agreed. "The New Deal unleashed the greatest productive capacity Americans have ever seen," he said.
At one point Mr. Clinton jumped in and answered "yes" to a question posed to Mr. Kerrey about pumping up industry. That led Mr. Kerrey to take a swipe at Mr. Clinton, saying, "You're saying 'yes' to a lot of people these days."
While the candidates agreed that the Government must take more drastic steps to enhance the economy, they offered varied remedies.
Mr. Harkin said the most important thing the Government could do was to invest more in the manufacturing base. "I say the Federal Government has a responsibility to invest the resources of this country to building up the economic base," he said. "We're the richest country in this world. If we're so rich, then how come we're so poor?"
Mr. Tsongas took issue with Mr. Harkin, saying that businesses would not invest more without financial incentives. "I challenge you," he said to the Senator. "You go out in the real world to people trying to survive and you tell them what you said tonight."
The candidates also engaged in heated exchanges over their proposals for health care. Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Tsongas insisted that their plans were the most thought out, as Mr. Harkin argued that neither of them addressed the issue of prevention.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Harkin Searches for the Main Campaign Highway

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 30

 BODY:
Twice in one afternoon this week, Senator Tom Harkin's campaign motorcade abruptly pulled off the side of rural New Hampshire roads, doubled back and eventually found its way to events with voters.
They were apt side trips for a campaign that despite some enthusiastic crowds still seems like a stranger in the state that will hold the nation's first Presidential primary on Feb. 18. 
 Though Mr. Harkin was one of the first contenders to campaign actively in New Hampshire last year, the Iowa Democrat's organization somehow veered off course. He has remained at or near the bottom in polls of likely voters, and many strategists say his campaign lacks a political presence.
Unlike other Democrats who have fine-tuned their message or their delivery, Mr. Harkin continues to preach the same themes he did when he started here. But he has taken several steps to energize his campaign.
 
Adding Specifics to Message
 Most notably, he doubled the number of days he traveled in New Hampshire this week, making as many as 10 stops a day. To counter criticism that his message was too general while his rivals were offering details, Mr. Harkin produced a 35-page booklet that he cites at every stop. The booklet lays out his plan to revive the economy by spending less abroad, toughening trade policies and investing more in rebuilding the country. He also delivered a foreign policy speech at Harvard University, outlining his vision for slashing military spending and relying "less upon brute force and more on economic strength."
And to drive home his message, Mr. Harkin is starting to broadcast a third set of television commercials that emphasize his plan to stimulate the economy with new jobs and investment. They build on advertisements that the campaign began using last week, showing the Senator talking about creating jobs while the camera pans an abandoned mill in New Hampshire.
One new advertisement again uses the mill as a backdrop for Mr. Harkin, who recounts how he has defeated Republicans for 17 years and how he is "not trying to be all things to all people" and is the only "real Democrat" in the race. In a second commercial, Mr. Harkin speaks to an interviewer off camera about his opposition to tax breaks for the rich.
 
Drawing His Largest Crowds
 Mr. Harkin said these efforts were paying off. Indeed, he drew some of his largest crowds during his swing through the state this week. One reason for that, though, may be that the campaign only this week began using advance workers to help plan events and bring out crowds.
After speaking at a union hall here Wednesday night, Mr. Harkin was surrounded by several enthusiastic people, some of whom said they appreciated his folksy, traditional Democratic appeal. "I've been looking for someone like a next-door neighbor that I can vote for," one man shouted at Mr. Harkin.
As his van pulled away from the appearance, Mr. Harkin cited the event as evidence that voters were now focusing on the race and on his candidacy. "We've built a strong foundation," he said in an interview, "not on media hype, not on puffery. I've built my foundation on people who believe deeply in the things I believe in."
Despite the positive signs, even Mr. Harkin's supporters concede that he is still struggling to win notice.
"Why he doesn't seem to be catching on, I don't know?" said Michael Rowan, a New York consultant who has managed campaigns in New Hampshire and is informally advising Mr. Harkin. "He's got this ability to strike emotional chords, but it's not an ability that's been used. Everybody's struggling. How do you get the guy's message out?"
 
Accentuating the Positive
 Searching for even the most meager signs of momentum, Barry E. Piatt, the campaigns press secretary in New Hampshire, boasted that Mr. Harkin's support in the polls had quadrupled. But it was hardly a surge: from 2 percent to 8 percent in one survey.
While Mr. Harkin has insisted that he wants to challenge Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas on the issues, not on assertions about his personal life, the Senator's aides say the campaign is positioned to gain from Mr. Clinton's troubles.
"Clinton has kind of stalled in his tracks right now," said Kathi Rogers, the Harkin campaign director in New Hampshire. "We're moving up."
But rather than gain from Mr. Clinton's troubles, Mr. Harkin has been overshadowed by them.
On Monday, the Senator traveled across New Hampshire visiting disabled people to celebrate what he called his greatest legislative achievement, the Americans With Disabilities Act. The sometimes emotional visits drew scant attention in the local press, which was filled with news about Mr. Clinton's trials.
Even with his stab at specificity on an economic blueprint, Mr. Harkin's basic speech remains unchanged. He prefers anecdotes about growing up "on the wrong side of the tracks" and the one-liners about "whipping George Herbert Hoover Bush," sarcastically changing one President's middle names from Walker.
"People are looking not for someone to solve all their problems but for a fresh approach," said Representative Dick Swett, a New Hampshire Democrat who is staying neutral in the primary. "I don't know if that's the reason they haven't flocked to Harkin."
 
'It Hasn't Changed'
 After listening to Mr. Harkin's speech in Portsmouth, Finn Connell, an entrepreneur, complained: "It's the sixth time I've heard it and it hasn't changed. The same questions. The same answers. The same speech."
Joseph Miller, a doctor from Plymouth, said, "I'm an old-time liberal and I'd like to go with Harkin, but he doesn't stir fire in my gut yet. At the moment, I feel he's haranguing rather than presenting a thoughtful discussion of the issues."
But Mr. Harkin is counting on people like Marie Shaginaw, an elementary school teacher who shivered for nearly an hour in the cold the other day before Mr. Harkin appeared to meet residents of Andover, N.H.
"He seems sincere when he talks," she said. "I like the way he comes across. And I think the way a candidate comes across sometimes is more important than what they say."

HEADLINE: Spotted Owl Dispute Jolts Another Timber Region

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RESERVE, N.M., Jan. 24

 BODY:
Six months ago, the sawmill in this remote mountain town was the area's largest employer, humming 20 hours a day and providing jobs for 140 people as mill hands and loggers.
These days, though, the work forces here and at other mills in the Southwest have been reduced by about 40 percent, a reflection not of the sagging national economy but of an environmental dispute usually associated with a very different part of the country. 
 The issue here is the Mexican spotted owl, a cousin to the northern spotted owl, which lives in the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest and is the focus of a bitter dispute involving the Federal Government, logging interests and environmentalists.
In June 1990, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service designated the northern spotted owl a threatened species, saying excessive logging of its habitat was a major cause of its decline. The agency has since proposed restricting logging on 6.9 million acres to save the owl from extinction.
Two months ago, the wildlife service determined that logging in the Southwest was rapidly destroying the dense forests in which the Mexican spotted owl lives and proposed that that owl also be listed as a threatened species.
Because logging accounts for only a small part of the Southwest's economy, the spotted owl debate here has not risen to the fevered pitch that it has in the Pacific Northwest. Still, timber-reliant towns in New Mexico and Arizona, the states where the most Mexican spotted owls have been found, are suffering.
Under a plan to protect the owl while it is studied, the United States Forest Service has temporarily closed thousands of acres of Federal land in the Southwest to logging. Michael Gardner, a Forest Service ranger, said timber production in the Gila National Forest, which surrounds this town of 500 people, was down 50 percent from a year ago and was expected to drop another 25 percent next year.
 
A Rippling Effect on Town
 The town of Reserve is already reeling. Public school enrollment has fallen 20 percent, teachers have been laid off and businesses have lost customers as families moved away in the search for jobs.
"It's been like a stone dropped in the water," said Sue Spurgeon, the school district's business manager. "The ripples are going everywhere. Some people think that protecting an owl is more important than making a living."
But area environmental advocates say officials of the Forest Service and the logging industry, not spotted owls, bear responsibility for any turmoil.
"There has been overlogging going on in the Southwest for years," said Robin Silver, a doctor and environmentalist in Phoenix who petitioned the Government to protect the Mexican spotted owl. "And one result is that there are hardly any old trees left for wildlife."
Forest Service officials estimate that 2,000 Mexican spotted owls live in the United States, about one-third the number of the northern spotted owl. To the casual observer the two look almost identical, but the Mexican variety has darker background plummage and larger and whiter spots, giving it a somewhat brighter appearance.
A big question in the public debate is whether the two owls, while similar in appearance, differ in habits.
 
Questions About Habitat
 Forest Service officials, who oppose designating the Mexican spotted owl as a threatened species, maintain that the bird behaves differently from its northern cousin and as a result is not in danger. They say that while the northern variety is typically found only in ancient forests with dense canopies, the Mexican variety has adapted to a wider range of habitats.
Wildlife researchers who want the Mexican spotted owl protected say that while it does inhabit a diverse area, older and denser forests are its principal habitat. A further danger from logging, they say, is that it has opened the area to two predators of the Mexican spotted owl.
Whatever its preferred home, the Mexican spotted owl has become a symbol of a larger debate over public lands and logging. James Norton, regional director for The Wilderness Society, said his group was pushing hard for protection of the Mexican spotted owl because Forest Service officials plan to open steep mountain slopes in several national forests to logging. "Those are the last places in the Southwest that haven't been logged," Mr. Norton said.
While the primary method of logging here differs from that in the Northwest, Mr. Norton and some scientists say the effect on the owls is the same. The favored technique here, known as shelterwood, involves cutting all older trees in an area and then periodically harvesting other trees when they reach a particular size.
Mr. Norton said, "the net effect of shelterwood is the same as clear-cutting," the primary method in the Pacific Northwest in which all trees in an area are cut at the same time.
Jerry Drury, a manager with the forest products division of Stone Container Corporation, said he believed that such concerns were overstated. "We are being forced to carry the Northwest's environmental baggage," said Mr. Drury, whose company operates the sawmill in Reserve.
Public hearings on whether to protect the Mexican spotted owl are under way, and a decision by Federal wildlife officials is expected in about a year. But as people here await that decision, the discussions in coffee shops and on street corners in communities like Reserve echo those 1,000 miles away in the Northwest.
"This isn't just about wildlife," said Vic Jenkins, a rancher. "It's about a way of life."

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasury Securities Inch Higher

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in light trading yesterday, a bounce that most traders said represented a slight correction to big declines posted earlier in the week.
Credit market participants have been ignoring reports of continued economic weakness all week, and data released yesterday, including a three-tenths of a percent drop in the Government's index of leading economic indicators during December and a 6.6 percent decline in new-home sales, were no exception. 
 Instead, traders spent much of the session speculating on the Treasury's coming quarterly refunding auctions, and whether the size of the bond auction will be cut from the $12 billion sold in November.
 
Anticipated Size of Auction
 "The market is looking for the size of the bond auction to be cut by $2 billion to $4 billion," said Stephen W. Gallagher, a money market economist at Kidder, Peabody. "Since Treasury has spent so much time talking about the issue, I would expect some selloff if they don't cut it."
Comments by Richard G. Darman, the Federal budget director, reinforced the notion among traders that the size of the bond auction would be pared. An announcement on the refunding auctions is expected from the Treasury on Wednesday.
After saying his remarks should not be construed as indicating that a decision had been reached, Mr. Darman told the Senate Budget Committee that any move to issue fewer 30-year bonds would represent a "prudent, modest shift" toward shorter-term maturities.
The remarks helped to push up bond prices slightly, but market participants said the session was mostly one of preparing for what promises to be a full week.
"There are a lot of important events coming up next week that will likely set the market tone for February," said William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
In addition to the refunding announcement, the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled to begin a two-day meeting on Tuesday. And on Friday, January employment data are expected from the Labor Department.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading at a price of 10226/32 , up 9/32 , to yield 7.75 percent, compared with 7.78 percent late Thursday and 7.70 percent on Jan. 24.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10119/32 , up 7/32 , to yield 7.26 percent. And the 4 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9919/32 , up 5/32 , to yield 5.09 percent.
 
Rates on Bills Slip
 Short-term Treasury bill rates moved lower. Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.82 percent, down two basis points, or two-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.90 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 4 percent, down four basis points.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT AT THE U.N.;
Bush Asks Security Council To Put Sanctions on Libya

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 31

 BODY:
In meetings with members of the United Nations Security Council, President Bush sought today to shore up support for a new resolution imposing sanctions on Libya for its refusal to extradite two suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 for trial in the United States, Administration officials said.
In his meetings at the United Nations, Mr. Bush spent 20 minutes with Prime Minister Li Peng of China, the first meeting between the leaders in nearly three years. 
 With the Administration facing another fight with Congress over the extension of China's trading privileges, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said Mr. Bush had told Mr. Li that the Chinese record on human rights was "insufficient" and needed "significant improvement."
 
Response 'Not Acceptable'
 But Mr. Baker indicated that Mr. Li had merely dismissed Mr. Bush's concerns by saying that China did not accept the idea that its record on human rights can be judged by other countries' standards, a position that is increasingly likely to result in Congress's placing conditions on favorable tariff treatment for Beijing.
Mr. Baker said Mr. Li's response was "not acceptable under our standards."
Mr. Li's address to the Security Council earlier, which made the same point on human rights, offered little comfort to American officials.
Earlier today, Mr. Baker said Mr. Bush and President Francois Mitterrand of France, who met this morning at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, had discussed the wording of the proposed new resolution against Libya, which American officials said was being drafted and could be presented in early February.
The United States wants the resolution to go beyond merely condemning Libya for not complying with a resolution passed unanimously by the Security Council on Jan. 21 demanding that the two suspects in the 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, be surrendered.
"Terrorists and their state sponsors must know there will be serious consequences if they violate international law," Mr. Bush said in an address to a summit meeting of the 15 Security Council nations, seeking to link the Western standoff with Libya to the Council's concerted action against Iraq after it invaded Kuwait.
The Bush Administration wants some sort of sanctions imposed against Libya, at a minimum an embargo on airline flights to and from Libya and on sales of aircraft parts, officials said. "There's not much support at the Security Council for more than that," one official said today.
 
Policy Produces Little
 Although Mr. Bush pressed Mr. Li to improve China's human rights record, American officials said Mr. Bush had already concluded that the current leadership in China is unlikely to do that.
They conceded that his policy of "engagement" with Beijing since the nationwide crackdown on dissent in China in 1989 has produced little in the way of results.
Still, the officials said, Mr. Bush is likely to veto any measure by Congress that would attach conditions to the extension of China's most-favored-nation tariff treatment. Such legislation could be passed as early as next week.
In this political climate, officials said, Mr. Bush hoped primarily to get through the meeting, which the Chinese requested, with as little embarrassment as possible.
"It was our judgment that we had to do this meeting and we're trying to do it with as little attention as possible," a senior official said.
 
Preparing for Yeltsin Meeting
 While Mr. Bush met with his fellow leaders in New York, the Administration was preparing for the meeting at Camp David on Saturday with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
Officials traveling with Mr. Bush said the two were expected to announce a date for a formal summit meeting sometime between April and July. One said an earlier date seemed the likeliest possibility.
But American officials said arms control was not at the top of either leader's list of issues for their first meeting since the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the emergence of Russia as the successor to the old Soviet state.
Mr. Bush is eager, however, to get more details from Mr. Yeltsin on his recent arms control proposal.
The Russian leader's plan was a response to Mr. Bush's suggestion that both sides eliminate land-based multiple-warhead missiles -- the heart of Russia's deterrent force -- in exchange for a one-third cut in the number of nuclear bombs the United States keeps aboard submarines.
Mr. Yeltsin replied by calling for even deeper cuts than Mr. Bush suggested, and by proposing that the United States abandon its "Star Wars" antimissile program in favor of a global network to protect against missile attack.
The Bush Administration's initial response to that proposal was cool.
Because the two proposals remain inchoate and because the United States is still unclear about Mr. Yeltsin's arms control philosophies and the depth of his knowledge and engagement on the issue, the two leaders are expected to confine their pronouncements on nuclear disarmament to a vague commitment to "continue the process."
"Bush expects most of the discussion tomorrow will be on economic reform," a senior official said in New York.

HEADLINE: Donors Give Again and Again to The Times' Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
"This is the first time I am making a second contribution to the Fund," began an anonymous letter attached to a $100 donation to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. "Although I expect to lose my white-collar professional job, and I also expect to have a difficult time finding work, I realize that I have many more resources to fall back on than many and that no matter how bad things get there are many others that are far worse off than I."
As the 80th annual Neediest appeal enters its final month, many people who gave earlier in the campaign have sent additional contributions. Rather than holding off because this year's campaign has already raised a record amount of money, they have responded because of their concern that the recession and government cutbacks have left New York's poor, sick and disabled more dependent on private charity. 
 Matthew D. Wachsman of Scarsdale has made at least three separate contributions. One of them -- a check for $100 -- honored his mother: "My mother and her husband have escaped to the beaches of St. Thomas, where they are doubtlessly luxuriating under warm sun. However, they know that the city that awaits their return is still filled with hopelessness and despair. They are sensitive to the seriousness of the situation and speak of 'answers.' I have, on many occasions, spoken with them about homelessness, welfare and the effects of a slow economy. We do not always agree. However, we all agree that your Neediest Cases Fund is an important part of what helps to keep many of the neediest going."
Diane Siebert Reed of Edison, N.J., made her first contribution in December when she asked her company to donate the money it usually spent on employee gifts to the Neediest Cases. "However, great ideas start at home, so with that in mind, enclosed is my donation," she wrote. She sent $50.
Philip and Fay Cohen of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., gave an additional $2,000. "We recognize that you provide a sorely needed service in alleviating the suffering of those unable to meet their basic needs," they wrote.
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's destitute. The newspaper covers all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected can be passed on directly to seven charities.

HEADLINE: Shoe Chain For Gap Seen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Gap Inc., the highly successful retailer of casual clothes, plans to start a separate chain of shoe stores, according to a published report.
New York Newsday reported yesterday that the Gap's real estate offices on the East and West Coasts were searching for sites for the new stores. 
 A Gap spokesman said the company would not comment on the article.
It had been expected that the Gap, which is expanding at an explosive rate, would begin looking for other retailing directions to move in. As the company reaches its saturation point in stores, it must find other ways to continue to grow financially.
The company, based in San Francisco, had 1,221 stores at the end of December, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Besides its flagship Gap stores, the company also has Gap Kids and Banana Republic outlets.
The Gap's sales have been soaring despite the recession that has sliced into sales and profits for other big retailers. The chain's moderately priced sweaters, shirts and jeans appeal to a wide range of customers.
The company's sales at stores open at least a year -- considered the best yardstick of a retailer's performance -- rose 12 percent during the first 11 months of the 1991 fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Acts of Hate From the Past: Bias Crimes in New York City Are Nothing New

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Thirty-four years ago, Luis Garden Acosta was a pudgy 13-year-old eager to show off the streets of Brooklyn to a country cousin newly arrived from Puerto Rico. But when he refused to step aside for six black teen-agers on De Kalb Avenue, he found himself shoved, cursed and dragged screaming down the street until blood seeped through his shredded clothing.
Days later, a gang of Hispanic youths surrounded him and shouted, "Get the chink!" refusing to believe that the boy with almond eyes was not Asian until he spewed out a torrent of Spanish pleadings. 
 Mr. Garden has been thinking a lot about 1958 lately.
For many New Yorkers who came of age in working-class neighborhoods in the 1950's and 1960's, last month's bias attacks and retaliations have jarred loose recollections of an era when such beatings were not uncommon and often unreported.
"Somehow we accepted the danger of not making it to school in one piece," said Mr. Garden, 46, the executive director of El Puente, a youth center in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. "It was a kind of purgatory. If we got through and atoned for whatever sins, we would reach the promised land of adulthood."
In many ways it is a different world. There are legal guarantees against segregation and penalties for bias crimes. With the public more sensitive to these issues, victims of bias crimes no longer have to endure their indignities in silence while the offenses are swept under the rug.
But while there is no valid comparison of the crimes then and now, and the tensions between race and turf may be harder to sort out, there are those who wonder how far the city and race relations have advanced in the decades since they ventured through the streets.
"All that stuff existed, you know," said Dion DiMucci, who was a Bronx teen-ager who rose to fame as leader of the singing group Dion and the Belmonts. "There was a lot of denial in the 50's. It was all suppressed."
 
'It's a Blindness'
 Many times, neighborhood youths would declare they were going to chase after some black youths, even though nobody knew why. "That always struck me as a real peculiar shortcut to becoming a man," said Mr. DiMucci, now 52 and living in Florida. "If I could just put somebody under me because he's poorer, Puerto Rican, black, Chinese or whatever. It's a blindness."
As a teen-ager in love with rhythm-and-blues, he traveled often between his Italian Bronx neighborhood and the recording studios and Harlem stages where he jammed with the black musicians he admired. Once, he brought Frankie Lymon, the boyish heartthrob who sang with the Teenagers, to his block only to be surrounded by his friends bristling with anger at the sight of a black person in their close-knit neighborhood.
"My friends wanted to beat him," Mr. DiMucci recalled. In fact, he said, he defused the situation by breaking into impromptu street singing.
But he was less successful when the neighborhood's first black family moved next door to him on Prospect Avenue and East 183d Street, provoking a barrage of rocks and invective from the neighborhood toughs.
"I remember walking into my house one day and catching the eye of one of the family next door," he said. "Time kind of froze for me because I was looking at this person there. Is this supposed to be an enemy? He looked a lot like me. In the eyes, anyway."
 
The Wrong Look
 Growing up on the Lower East Side, Carlos Mateo knew that when he ventured too far from the Vladeck Houses and gave someone the wrong look, he could expect a fight. He and his Puerto Rican friends, who belonged to a clique they called Club 16, learned to avoid walking past the candy store on Henry Street where the May Rose, a clique of Italian and Irish youths, often taunted and fought with them.
"Our situation was more in groups that had a certain area they wanted to control as a group," said Mr. Mateo, 50, who now lives on Long Island. "There was always the name calling, they'd call you spic and you'd call them wop. But that was just the way we talked."
By the time Ernest Kelly became a teen-ager in the 60's, the turf battles grew in intensity and consequences. This was the dawn of the street gangs. He joined the Dirty Dozens, a gang with many black members.
Entire neighborhoods were off limits, like Soundview and Parkchester where white gangs like the Golden Guineas would clash with outsiders, drawing certain retribution.
The recent spate of bias crimes unleashed memories of those clashes and prompted the 38-year-old youth counselor to speak to the teen-agers at his Bronx center about the futility of retribution.
The only consolation he and others took was that such crimes were being highlighted today, although sometimes they felt they were being milked for sensationalist value by the media.
Richard Price, the Bronx-bred author of such novels as "The Wanderers," an account of street gangs, said the notion of a bias attack is only a convenient handle for something that has been going on for ages. "It seems to me that it's every group's God-given right to hate every other ethnic group," he said sarcastically.
He said that current concern over these crimes often degenerates into ethnic scorekeeping as groups trade accusations.
"It's like 'You did it!' 'No, our boys were victims!' 'Oh yeah, what about that girl?' Nobody is talking about it, they're just taking sides," he said.
Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the clashes and attacks that have occurred since the 1986 death of Michael Griffith in Howard Beach show that the city hasn't come that far since the 50's and the advances of the civil rights era.
He said that city officials and civic leaders have to go beyond condemning the bias crimes and put together a strategy that goes to the economic and sociological roots of the problem.
"In the absence of that," he said, "the bully back on the street corner gets the silence and gets the impression that it's O.K. to beat up on people."

HEADLINE: Brady Finds Upbeat Message Reciprocated

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAPLES, Fla., Jan. 31

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady came to this opulent Florida seaside resort today to convince the captains of American industry that an economic recovery was on its way and that the President's economic proposals would hasten it. The surprise was that his audience, which has been struggling for three years in the toughest economic times since the early 80's, needed little convincing.
"I think we're ready to take off," said Dexter F. Baker, the chairman and chief exeuctive of Air Products and Chemicals Inc. in Allentown, Pa. "We have all the ducks lined up. Washington has done enough." 
 The affable Mr. Baker, who accompanied President Bush to Japan last month, is chairman of the annual meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers here this weekend.
Despite their disappointment with the swollen Federal budget deficit and Washington's unwillingness to do more for them, the executives generally said that the President's economic package presented this week would help their companies. Virtually all the executives interviewed here said they expected a modest rebound later this year and no significant decline before then.
"My personal forecast is that the economy will start to turn by summer," said Stanley C. Gault, the chairman and chief executive of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio.
But most executives were not quite as upbeat as Mr. Baker or Mr. Gault. They said they planned to act cautiously in hiring and spending on inventories and on new plants and equipment.
"We're not counting on a 3, 4, 5 percent recovery," said Larry D. Brady, the executive vice president of the Chicago-based FMC Corporation, which makes chemicals and industrial equipment.
A minority of executives, including Mr. Baker and Mr. Gault, reported evidence of a rebound already. "January is off to a good start," said W. H. Clark, the chairman and chief executive of the Nalco Chemical Company, which is based in Naperville, Ill.
 
Goodyear Recalling 900
 Consumers are finally starting to replace the tires on their cars, said Mr. Gault. The result: Goodyear is producing 9,000 more tires a day and has just recalled 900 furloughed workers. "We're delighted to be leading the crusade," Mr. Gault said.
Mr. Brady, the Treasury Secretary, said in a speech that his own neighborhood economic consultants -- his car mechanic, his grocer, his convenience store manager -- also saw a turnaround. "There's been a change in feeling out there," he said. "It's not abrupt, but it's a sea change."
But for most of the executives at the Naples meeting, business remains sluggish. "We haven't seen a pickup, though we've seen no deterioration, either," said Jack Hartley, the chief executive of the Harris Corporation, whose products include communications and office equipment
The executives cited lower interest rates, low inflation, successful cost-cutting and brisk buying by foreign customers as setting the stage for an economic rebound.
Cooper Industries, a maker of electrical equipment and power tools in Houston, said Robert Cizik, its chairman and chief executive, is saving tens of millions of dollars this year in interest costs. FMC's interest savings this year are the equivalent of a 5 percent jump in its operating earnings, the company said.
 
Expecting Quick Demand
 After several years of cutbacks, companies expect a quick pickup in production once demand improves.
"We've gone through restructuring," said Daniel J. Krumm, the chairman and chief executive of the Maytag Corporation in Newton, Iowa. "We froze salaries and all that; inventories are way down, and so, more importantly, are our dealers' inventories. The minute business turns up, we'll crank up our factories, and that will mean more jobs."
Manufacturers have discovered that selling in foreign markets is a boon in bad times. "That's where the rubber meets the road," said Mr. Baker of Air Products, which is selling more oxygen plants in Japan than in the United States these days.
Mr. Krum of Maytag reported record exports, with sales booming in the former East Germany. "I didn't know they had carpets over there, and now we're selling vacuum cleaners like gang busters," he said.
 
Being Optimistic
 The Treasury Secretary urged the executives to "err on the side of optimism." But while a number of the executives said they were spending more on new plant and equipment last year and hiring selectively, others said they would remain cautious.
"We will be frugal in our investment, frugal in our inventory," said Mr. Brady, the FMC executive vice president. "We will continue to bet on the downside rather than the upside."
Mr. Bush's economic package, which includes tax breaks for investment, first-time home purchases and the real estate industry, won the executives' approval. "The right issues are being addressed," said Mr. Brady of FMC. "They need to be addressed on a permanent basis."
The Treasury Secretary said that Jerry J. Jasinowski, the president of the manufacturers' association, had a hand in the Treasury's crafting of the investment tax allowance and alternative minimum tax relief.
 
$10 Billion to Be Raised
 The Treasury estimates that the combination of the investment tax allowance and the changes in the alternative minimum tax will raise corporate cash flow by more than $10 billion, a prospect especially appealing as companies are finding it difficult to raise prices in order to lift profits.
Mr. Brady of FMC said his company had not made up its mind to increase investment beyond the $30 million hike already scheduled over last year's $230 million.
But some companies have already decided that Mr. Bush's inducements are too good to refuse. Mr. Baker of Air Products said his company would dig into the $100 million backlog of projects that had been postponed this year. "We will increase investment 10 or 15 percent above what we had planned," he said.
 
Sampling Others' Thoughts
 Even as this gathering takes place, many executives are forming their plans by mingling with others, most of them in candy-colored golf clothes.
"Executives are sampling each other's opinions," said Mr. Jasinowski, the association's president. "What they get out of this meeting will be big input into their plans."
And this approach has the approval of Treasury Secretary Brady himself. "I don't base my judgment on economic statistics," he said. "The way to tell where the economy is going is to talk to people."

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Precious Metal Prices Rise Despite the Slack Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Precious metals futures advanced yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange despite economic news that could signal a dwindling need for the metals.
Gold for February delivery settled $3.60 higher at $357 an ounce; March silver was 3.5 cents higher at $4.18 an ounce. 
 Investors in precious metals futures normally look to a healthy economy before buying. Silver prices often rely on industrial demand for the metals. Gold is bought as an investment hedge against inflation.
Economists, noting weak housing starts, fewer orders for durable goods and continued layoffs, said the nation's gloomy outlook was likely to continue through the first half of the year.
Despite that outlook, traders have been reluctant to let precious metals fall below certain key levels, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments Inc. in New York.
"I think the market is just reacting to the oversold conditions from yesterday," Mr. Cardillo said yesterday. "There's nothing really out there to cheer about."
Energy futures were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude prices were held to a narrow range as traders mark time ahead of the Feb. 12 meeting in Geneva of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which could make significant cuts in production to prevent prices from collapsing.
Crude for March delivery settled 4 cents higher at $18.90 a barrel; February home heating oil advanced 0.71 cent, to 52.85 cents a gallon; February unleaded gasoline rose 0.38 cent, to 55.89 cents a gallon; March natural gas advanced 1.4 cents, to $1.180 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Corn and soybeans futures prices ended mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade at the close of a lackluster session. Wheat advanced.
Wheat for delivery in March settled 4 1/2 cents higher at $4.40 1/2 a bushel; March corn was 1/2 cent higher at $2.64 a bushel; March oats were 4 cents higher at $1.52 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans were 3/4 cent lower at $5.72 a bushel.
Investors in corn and wheat futures were hoping the Agriculture Department would announce as early as next week new purchases of the crops. The former Soviet republics get their next export credit allocation at that time, and there was some thought that the Government would move up other aid disbursements. Traders hoped that President Bush might announce more United States aid to the Commonwealth of Independent States after a meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia this weekend at Camp David.
"People were afraid to sell ahead of that just in case something comes out of it, which it probably won't," said Dan Cekander, a grains analyst with Rodman & Renshaw Inc. in Chicago.
Wheat also gained on tight supplies and strong near-term export demand.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Post Sharp Drop

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Sales of new homes tumbled 6.6 percent in December, the Commerce Department said today, wiping out nearly all of November's gains and dragging down the year's total sales to the lowest level in nine years.
Sales fell in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 522,000, after a revised rise of 7.9 percent in November. It was the biggest decline since a 10.8 percent drop in January 1991, when sales fell to 414,000 as the Persian Gulf war began. 
 The actual sales total for 1991 was 504,000, down 5.6 percent from 1990. The decline made 1991 the third straight year of falling sales. Sales were the lowest since 1982, also a recession year, when they slumped to 412,000.
 
Looking for a Tax Break
 Nonetheless, some housing industry analysts remained upbeat about the prospects for 1992, especially if Congress approves the $5,000 tax break for first-time home buyers that was proposed by President Bush in his State of the Union Message.
"Needless to say, we are looking forward hungrily to the prospect of a tax cut," said Dave Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders.
Economists also said they were heartened by Monday's report of a slim rise in sales of existing homes in December. The gain, nine-tenths of 1 percent, put those sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.34 million. The rise, the third straight monthly increase, was reported Monday by the National Association of Realtors.
 "We still have evidence, in combination with existing-home sales, that fourth-quarter 1991 new-home sales were generally on an upward path, and we think that continued in January," said Dick Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 
A Significant Sector
 Although new-home sales are a smaller proportion of the housing market than sales of existing homes, they are a more sensitive barometer of consumers' willingness to take on large financial commitments. Many new homes are bought by people moving up to larger, more expensive houses as their financial circumstances improve.
The Commerce Department said the biggest drop in the December sales rate was in the South, where sales fell to 210,000, from 258,000 in November. Sales also fell in the Midwest, to 90,000 from 96,000.
The sales rate rose in the West to 164,000, from 155,000 in November, and climbed in the Northeast to 59,000 from 50,000.
Mortgage interest rates, although still close to their lowest levels since the 1970's, have risen slightly in recent weeks.
Interest rates on longer-term Government bonds strongly influence the rates offered to homeowners seeking 30-year mortgages. The bond rates were coming down sharply until two weeks ago, when they began rising.
 
The Industry's Outlook
 Mr. Seiders, whose association includes thousands of small building contractors, said: "We are forecasting a 15 percent increase for sales of new homes in 1992 because we believe there is a lot of pent-up demand that lower interest rates so far have not let loose. But the red herring is that recent backup in long-term interest rates. It is of great concern to us."
 On a year-to-year basis, the median price of a new home fell in 1991 for the first time in more than 20 years.
The median price -- at which half the homes cost more and half cost less -- was $120,000 in 1991, down from $122,900 in 1990. The last decline occurred in 1970, a drop to $23,400, from $25,600 in 1969.
Today's report said the median price in December was $123,800, up 5.5 percent from the November level.
In a separate report released today, the National Association of Realtors said new homes became less affordable in December because prices were creeping upward.
The realtors group said a family earning the median income of $36,696 had 124.2 percent of the income needed to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced house, down slightly from 124.4 percent in November.
Still, the group said that homes remain more affordable than they have been in more than a decade.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
How to Evaluate Early Retirement

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
With corporations across America reducing their payrolls, thousands of older workers are being offered early retirement. Evaluating the offer is the first big decision, and if the answer is yes, a series of important choices follow.
"Where an employee truly has a choice as to whether to keep working or to retire early, all income and expense aspects of continuing to work must be balanced against those of retiring," Sidney Kess, co-editor of Commerce Clearing House's audio cassette series that accompanies its Federal Tax Advisor information service, said recently. 
 Addressing a continuing education conference sponsored by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Mr. Kess said, "Sometimes a person may find he's continuing to work for just a few dollars an hour." He gave this example based on 1991 rates: Elizabeth, age 62, has a salary of $72,000. After Federal income taxes of $22,320, Social Security and Medicare taxes of $4,355 and commuting and work-related expenses of $5,040, she nets $40,285.
If she accepts an early-retirement offer, she will receive a bonus of $30,000, or $10,000 for each of the three years prior to age 65, as well as full pension benefits of $21,000, or 30 percent of her average earnings of $70,000 for the last three years. She can also get I.R.A. income of $10,000, Social Security benefits of $9,400 and distributions from her 401(k) plan of $2,000. She will have to pay $14,787 in Federal income tax and $4,800 in medical insurance premiums that her employer now pays. That leaves her with a net of $32,813.
The difference between working and retiring is $7,472, Mr. Kess said, and based on a standard work year of 1,960 hours, in effect, she would be working for $3.82 an hour. Of course, such numbers must worked be out for each person, and often state and local taxes must be considered.
For people nearing retirement or already retired, T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore-based mutual fund manager and investment adviser, is offering an excellent free kit called "Retirees Financial Guide." Like the Retirement Planning kit, which the firm began offering two years ago to help working people plan for retirement, the new kit has worksheets and extensive help in filling them out, as well as information on issues that affect financial security in retirement. It is available by calling, 1-800-541-4041.
Steven E. Norwitz, vice president of the firm, who spent a good part of the last year putting the kit together, said, "The kit is designed to help retirees determine how much they can afford to spend and maintain their purchasing power throughout retirement."
These are among the topics covered:
*Investing a bonus offered as an incentive to retire, as well as other savings.
*Tax and investment implications of leaving money in a pension plan, rolling it over into an I.R.A. or taking it as a lump sum.
*Budgeting for expenses in retirement, making inflation-adjusted projections based on life expectancy.
*Withdrawing money from retirement plans, including I.R.A.'s, and Keogh and 401(k) plans.
*Evaluating health insurance for people below age 65, coverage available for those 65 and over from Medicare, Medigap and long-term care coverage.
*Benefits and filing requirements for Social Security.
Social Security is available at age 62, but monthly payments are reduced, so people who plan to work part time after retirement may want to delay filing for Social Security and get full benefits later. Another factor in making this decision is that up to half the benefits are taxable for people above certain income limits. The kit has examples of how working after retirement can result in reduced benefits, as well as increased taxes on the benefits -- one of the many tax pitfalls retirees face.
Mr. Norwitz said, "The need for financial planning is as great after retirement as it was during the working career." Also, he noted, with the current decline in interest rates, many retirees need to reposition holdings to maintain income.
"As far as their investments are concerned, we find that many retirees tend to be too conservative in their strategy and overlook the impact of inflation on their savings," he added. "People who retire in their early 60's can expect to live another 25 or 30 years. As a result, they should have some growth-oriented investments in their portfolios to preserve their purchasing power. In the kit, we discuss various strategies to cope with inflation."
Of course, there are personal considerations, as well, in deciding whether to take early retirement. Mr. Kess recalled that one client found his office more peaceful than his home, where three generations lived under one roof, "so I told him to continue working." Another person, generously inclined, had soon given away a good portion of her retirement bonus to relatives with sudden needs. "You have to look at the psychological aspects," Mr. Kess said, "not just the numbers."

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush Reneges on Mass Transit

 BODY:
President Bush wants to chop half the Federal aid that New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and more than 60 other large cities hoped to get for operating buses, subways and commuter rail lines next year. Those cities and their environs have roughly half the nation's population and 90 percent of its mass-transit traffic. Is Mr. Bush serious about helping urban America? Apparently not.
Mass transit has been starved by Washington since President Reagan took office. Transit aid, discounted for inflation, is now 50 percent smaller than in 1981. The six-year Federal transportation program enacted last year was supposed to reverse that. It authorized $5.2 billion for the 1992-93 fiscal year, starting Oct. 1 -- nearly 40 percent more than this year. But the President's budget proposes only $3 billion. That's a devastating 20 percent cut from current spending, and less than Mr. Bush himself proposed last March. 
 Mr. Bush conceded in his budget message that Federal clean air standards would put a heavier burden on transit systems. He didn't mention that America's cities and snarled suburbs need relief from traffic jams, nor that the entire nation needs to conserve oil. And he seems to have forgotten that he hailed the transportation bill for providing "jobs, jobs, jobs." His mass-transit cuts would mean 130,000 fewer.
Mr. Bush wants only to help build new systems and modernize old ones, not keep them running. Incredibly, he thinks their survival is not a national concern. His budget shrinks next year's operating subsidies to $1 billion, where the new law authorized an increase to $2 billion.
New Jersey offers a grim example: The current subsidy for N.J. Transit's buses and commuter rail lines would be slashed 90 percent, to $4 million. This could only mean higher fares and reduced service. Nationwide, even new projects and modernization take a hit. The new law authorized $2.8 billion; Mr. Bush would provide only $1.6 billion.
The good news from the White House on this score is the President's endorsement of Congressional proposals to increase the tax deduction for businesses that subsidize employees who commute by mass transit. For the rest of his proposals, it can only be hoped that Congress will abide by last year's promise.

HEADLINE: Create a U.N. Fire Brigade

BYLINE: By Joseph S. Nye Jr.; Joseph S. Nye Jr. is author of "Bound To Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
If a new world order is ultimately to emerge from yesterday's summit meeting of the world's leaders at the U.N., they will have to stretch their imaginations.
The U.S. should go beyond rhetoric to promote a new order because it will remain the world's largest power well into the next century. To achieve this, the U.S. ought to propose the creation of a U.N. rapid-deployment force. 
 The climate seems highly suitable for such a force, given the mood at the summit for an expanded role for U.N. peacekeepers.
We had a chance to help create a new order in the 1920's but refused to join the collective security system of the League of Nations and to cooperate in stabilizing the international economy. This isolationism returned to haunt our country with the rise of Nazism.
By contrast, growing interdependence today justifies our need for a cooperative world. Evidence of this interdependence is overwhelming.
In 1950, trade was 4 percent of our gross national product; today, it is 13 percent. Thirty-three percent of American economic growth since 1986 can be traced to exports. The international monetary flow, which is 25 times as large as the flow of goods, constrains our ability to control capital markets and determine interest rates.
More and more, political issues -- migration, global warming, the drug trade, the spread of AIDS -- cut across national boundaries. No country can manage them alone.
The technology of destruction is spreading. At least 10 poor countries have major weapons-exporting industries, 20 of them can make chemical weapons, 15 can make ballistic missiles and 9 probably have nuclear weapons.
In enforcing collective security against Iraq, the U.S. had to take the lead because it was the only country that could do so. On the other hand, the Bush Administration was wise to urge the European Community and U.N. to take the lead in mediating the conflict in Yugoslavia and to encourage the Organization of American States to deal with the coup in Haiti.
But what about aggression in which the U.S. has no direct interest beyond the abstract principles of collective security: Libya's invasion of Chad, the mercenary invasion of the Maldive Islands, the invasion of Rwanda by Uganda-based exiles?
A rapid-deployment force that could deal with such problems should be made up of 60,000 troops in brigades from 12 countries.
This force, intended to repel aggressors, would be different from United Nations peacekeeping operations that are interposed between sides in civil wars after the fighting stops.
It could be formed around a core of 5,000 soldiers, who would hold regular exercises to develop operational procedures.
Such a small force could not stop civil wars like the one in Yugoslavia or intervene if, say, there was military conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia or major aggression like Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Under these circumstances, an American-led coalition would be necessary. (In the event of a clash between nuclear states such as Russia and Ukraine, a U.N. role would be unlikely because of the Security Council veto.)
But the force would insure that the collective security effort established during the Persian Gulf war would not be squandered by indifference to smaller conflicts.
America does not want to become a world policeman, dragged into every distant dispute. Our involvement in a rapid-deployment force should be limited to logistical support.
Although the two-superpower world order has collapsed, a one-power world is an illusion. The need for new institutions is at hand.

HEADLINE: The Hollowing of New York

BYLINE: By Ronald K. Shelp; Ronald K. Shelp is president of the New York City Partnership, a group of business and civic leaders, and the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 BODY:
New York City is threatened by a corporate exodus as dangerous as that of the early 1970's, when more than 30 major corporations and their thousands of jobs left. While that involved the departure of entire companies, today we face a hollowing of the business base, as companies move thousands of mid-level jobs out of the city while their corporate headquarters remain here.
In the 1980's, many businesses moved data processing and other routine back-office functions out of Manhattan. But recently, many front-office positions in administration, legal affairs, sales and marketing have been transferred. 
 Modern technology permits many jobs to be done as effectively in Kansas, Florida or even Ireland. Other locations are often closer to markets, safer and more affordable for employees, and offer a higher quality entry-level workforce.
Contrast these advantages with New York's rising costs and eroding services, and even executives who would prefer to keep employees here find it increasingly difficult to justify such a decision to their partners and directors.
This hollowing process draws fewer headlines than did the corporate departures of firms such as J. C. Penney, W. R. Grace and American Home Products. But companies as varied as Metropolitan Life Insurance, I. T. T. and Salomon Brothers are relocating thousands of employees elsewhere.
New York City can take immediate steps to change the growing negative perceptions about doing business here.
* Put an end to the cost spiral. Combined city and state taxes are the highest in America. Mayor David Dinkins made a welcome proposal this week for a four-year freeze on property taxes. The city budget should go further and put a four-year freeze on all personal and business taxes, while proceeding with the scheduled elimination of the personal income tax surcharge in 1993.
* Improve management in order to maintain services during restructuring. Cutting services to the bone merely to keep the city out of the hands of the Financial Control Board is not the answer. As revenues decline, the city needs to take the same difficult steps that service companies have taken to transform themselves. The administration's most recent financial plan calls for workforce reductions of at least 20,000 jobs. But more important than the final headcount is persuading municipal unions to make significant concessions in work rules and productivity. This would help halt job cuts, improve services and bring the budget closer to permanent balance.
* Send the right signals. New York City residents and businesses need to know that government leaders have a vision for the future and are taking steps now to fulfill it. The Mayor should quickly name an experienced and distinguished business executive to fill the vacancy created by Sally Hernandez-Pinero's expected departure as Deputy Mayor for Economic Development. The city should institute a few highly visible projects such as cleaning up the roadways between the airports and the central business districts, to demonstrate that it can do things quickly and effectively.
* Speed up privatization. The city's financial plan cites Off-Track Betting and the Parking Violations Bureau as candidates for privatization. The processing and recycling of solid waste should be added to that list immediately. And we should take advantage of new Federal laws encouraging privatization of transportation projects including building, maintaining and operating bridges and roads.
City officials can be justifiably proud of their efforts in recent years to prevent the relocation of a number of major corporations. But we must remember that we cannot afford even partial desertions. Limiting our focus to retaining headquarters in the city could lead to a hollow victory.

HEADLINE: A Victory for the New American Family

BYLINE: By James D. Marks; James D. Marks is a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union.

 BODY:
Six years ago, a New York City couple, one a pediatrician, the other a psychologist, had a child. They had lived together since 1978. Together, they changed their son's diapers, attended P.T.A. meetings, learned the names of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Until the decision on Thursday in Surrogate's Court in Manhattan, though, only one of the adults was recognized as the boy's legal parent. Why? Because both are lesbians.
Before the ruling, New York closed its eyes to the bonds between the boy and his non-biological mother, the pediatrician. If the boy were sick, the pediatrician could not have given permission for treatment, let alone use her insurance to cover medical costs, unless she had the most progressive of employers. If she died, the law would not have recognized the boy as her heir automatically. If she and his legal mother, the psychologist, had separated, he would have had no certainty of economic support or even contact with both parents. 
 With the decision -- in a case in which I represented the couple -- New York joins California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Vermont and the District of Columbia in permitting same-sex second-parent adoption. If both members of a same-sex couple wish to be a child's parents, the legal parent's partner may adopt the child and become its second parent, just as stepparents adopt the children of their spouses.
According to various studies discussed by the court, three million to four million gay and lesbian Americans have had children. Some gays and lesbians have adopted children and others, like the Manhattan couple, have arranged to conceive children biologically.
Despite the numbers, legal acceptance of gay and lesbian parents has been slow in some places.
In fact, Florida and New Hampshire have enacted laws prohibiting lesbians and gays from adopting under any circumstances. The remaining states have not formally addressed the issue.
Some people opposed to such households argue that lesbian or gay parents adversely affect the psychological development of children. But research accepted by the New York court shows no difference between their children and those raised by heterosexuals. The boy, who now has two legal parents, has grown up with plenty of contact with men and women, straight, lesbian and gay, and their children. He is happy, well-adjusted and, incidentally, no more likely to grow up gay than a child of heterosexuals.
Other fears are older and subtler. Roman law termed the male head of household the paterfamilias and gave him complete authority over his children, including the right to sell them or put them to death. Today, in issues related to privacy, like abortion, euthanasia and same-sex parents, some people think of the state as paterfamilias, with rights to manage the bodies of its citizens. Permitting gays and lesbians to raise children challenges that model of state authority: if the family does not need a traditional father, neither does the nation.
The state, like a family, is dysfunctional when it forces nontraditional relationships into the closet. Until a 1967 Supreme Court ruling, some states prohibited marriage, sex or procreation between blacks and whites. Today, a black Supreme Court Justice is married to a white woman. Our nation can learn to open its eyes and accept diversity.
This week's decision is a triumph. It recognizes a functioning family in law as well as in practice. Other states should follow New York and sustain the very real bonds between children and parents who love and care for them.

HEADLINE: New York Piers Make Business Go Elsewhere

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Because of the increase in containerized rail cargo, you report Jan. 13, millions of tons of products arrive in the New York City region annually without ever crossing a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey pier. 
 When I was in the used-clothing-export business a decade ago, the prohibitive economics of using New York piers made it cheaper for exporters to truck thousands of tons of bailed clothing to Philadelphia for loading on ships bound for Asia than to use the local piers.
Three or four days later, I could see the same ships docked at Port Authority piers in Brooklyn from the offices of our warehouse, also in Brooklyn. But despite the proximity, loading fees, fueled by the city's rent and other charges, union work procedures and operational inefficiency, made it cheaper for exporters to ship through Philadelphia.
Apparently, importers now find the same conditions exporters experienced 10 years ago.

. . . And Go to Sleep

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
The tipoff came when the Bush people said the speech would be a "defining moment." That was what they had called the gulf war this time last year -- a "defining moment" -- and now they were recycling it to ballyhoo a speech.
They didn't even have any new phrases, for Pete's sake. How could they possibly have a new idea? Applying "defining moment" to that perennial brain-glazer, the State of the Union speech, should have told us how things stood: to wit, that this outfit is so sure it's home safe for another four years that it doesn't even feel the need for fresh bluster, much less a fresh thought. 
 As if to flaunt his contentment with last year's crowd-grabbers, the President addressed the economic recession with the same chilling words he used after Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait: "This will not stand."
What does this mean? That the recession is going to get Schwarzkopfed unless it comes to its senses and clears out of America pronto? Of course not. It means, "Prosperity is just around the corner."
This seems to be the Republican belief. It rests on faith that low interest rates will work restorative magic in time to assure the usual Republican Presidential victory. While waiting for Mr. Prosperity the masses can presumably be calmed with the action-packed oratory of yesteryear.
"This will not stand."
Republican calmness about the recession owes a lot, too, to the Democratic Party, as it is still called out of ancient custom and utter disregard for fact. Bush and Friends now seem to believe the Democrats as usual will come along quietly and not raise a fuss when the campaign starts.
If the election is the usual Republican cinch, the President can stay relaxed about the recession, as a good hard-money Republican ought to, instead of falling for cockamamie quick-fix schemes now being urged by big-government hotheads.
Hence: "This will not stand." Or, in the less dynamic Hoover idiom, "Prosperity is just around the corner."
What was well defined by Mr. Bush's speech was his contempt for the possibility that the Democrats can threaten his re-election. At present, contempt seems thoroughly justified.
Democratic Presidential campaigns in modern times invariably become catastrophes sooner or later. This year's went catastrophic earlier than sooner. What fun imagining the cackling with which Roger Ailes, the Republican Party's own Doctor Huer, must be rubbing his hands as he watches the Clinton story unfold.
(All right, kiddies: Dr. Huer was the scientific genius with the lightbulb-shaped head without whom Buck Rogers would surely have lost outer space to dark-eyed Killer Kane, who was sort of the Willie Horton of the 25th century.)
It wasn't bad enough that the press's anointed Democratic front-runner had Gennifer Flowers to deal with. Not bad enough that this associated him with the kind of newsmakers who see Elvis and J.F.K.
No, that wasn't bad enough, so on television his wife, Hillary, managed to offend Tammy Wynette, the favorite country singer of many a music-loving American whose vote the Democrats would love to have, including white Southern males. It was almost as though Roger Ailes had already started his devilish work, but it still wasn't bad enough.
So Gennifer Flowers, who had been taping her phone chats with the Governor, produced a tape to outrage Mario Cuomo: a piece of chitchat with Gennifer saying she "wouldn't be surprised if he didn't have some Mafioso connection" and Governor Bill saying, "Well, he acts like one."
"An offense to Italian-Americans and it's an offense to every other ethnic group," said Cuomo. Clinton's phone apology to Cuomo only emphasized how bad things could get when Cuomo said Clinton "should save himself his quarter."
Roger Ailes won't really take advantage of all this when the time comes to carve up the Democrats for Bush, will he? Say you won't, Roger, so we can see how fast the Republicans will hire somebody who will.
Still, it could be even worse. Yes, and what's more it is even worse. The Gennifer-Bill-Tammy-Hillary-Mario farrago has the press so mesmerized (see this column) that it never gets around to mentioning the other Democrats in the running, some of whom even look competent.
No wonder George Bush can't be panicked into giving the recession the Schwarzkopf treatment. Prosperity is just around the corner.

Seize the Hour, Day or Moment

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
AS RICHARD NIXON, IN the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, lifted a glass 20 years ago to toast the beginning of a new relationship between the United States and China, he quoted from a poem by Mao Zedong: "So many deeds cry out to be done/Always urgently./The world rolls on./Time passes./Seize the day. Seize the hour."
When it came to titling his new book, however, about America's challenges in a "one-superpower world," the former President seized neither the day nor the hour. The title: "Seize the Moment." That was no spur-of-the-day decision; Mr. Nixon wanted to instill an even greater sense of urgency, or to express the essence of the idea without slavishly following the cliche. 
 Others are willing to stick with the old form. In the final scene of Steven Spielberg's new movie, "Hook," a sequel to "Peter Pan," the rejuvenated old man named Tootles, after a liberal sprinkling of Tinkerbell's fairy dust, flies out the window and soars over London shouting, "Seize the day!"
Robin Williams, who plays the grown-up Peter, starred in an 1986 film based on a 1956 novella by Saul Bellow. Its title: "Seize the Day."
The historian David McCullough, in his new book, "Brave Companions," makes the same choice as Nixon. He relates an anecdote about the painter John Singer Sargent, who had been hanging around the White House hoping to talk Theodore Roosevelt into posing for a portrait. The two men met unexpectedly as the President was descending the stairs, and the artist asked when would be a convenient time to pose. Said Roosevelt, in his typically decisive way: "Now!" McCullough writes: "So there he is in the painting, standing at the foot of the stairs, his hand on the newel post. . . . Moments come and go, the President was telling the painter. Here is the time, seize it, do your best."
As should be apparent, moment-seizing is in, even more than day-seizing; hour-seizing seems to be missing its time. The phrase's origin, presuming there to be no earlier usage in Chinese literature, is in the Latin carpe diem. The verb carpere means "to pluck, grab, seize," from the Greek karpos, "fruit"; it's what you do to ripe fruit on the vine. There may be a connection between carpere and the verb to carp, of Scandinavian origin, "to pick on, find fault with," as in "those carping liberal Democrats" in Mr. Bush's what-recession rhetoric. The noun diem is "day," as everyone who puts in for per diem knows, though few expense-accounters pronounce it correctly: it's DEE-em, and the whole phrase is KAR-peh DEE-em.
There's a phrase that has changed its meaning radically. When Horace wrote his odes, carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero meant "seize the day, put no trust in tomorrow." Lord Byron, a swinging Romantic poet, wrote in an 1817 letter: "I never anticipate -- carpe diem -- the past at least is one's own, which is one reason for making sure of the present."
That live-for-today meaning was expressed in the 1867 novel "Under Two Flags" by "Ouida," the pseudonym of the English novelist Louise de La Ramee, writing of "the reckless life of Algeria" with its "gay, careless carpe diem camp-philosophy." The Daily News of London grumped in 1901: "The 'Carpe diem' philosophy is not the philosophy of happy people." Its synonymous expression is "Eat, drink and be merry," the advice of the worldly author of Ecclesiastes (8:15), to which the prophet Isaiah added a fatalistic note: "Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we shall die."
The amalgam of hedonism and existential resignation, of the pursuit of pleasure and the anguish of transience -- the only-come-this-way-once ambiance of beer commercials -- is the opposite of the phrase's meaning today. Now we think of riding the tide in the affairs of men, which Shakespeare said could lead on to fortune; to change metaphors, seize the day has come to mean "strike while the iron is hot." No longer is carpe diem the what-the-hell attitude of the dwellers in the present; it has become the battle cry of the gutsy opportunist with an eye on the future.
I had to handle this topic today. You know what attitude drove me to it.
 
 
BANAUSIC AIN'T BANAL
The Supreme Court struck down New York State's "Son of Sam" law, which would have denied profits to perpetrators from writings about their crimes; as a First Amendment freak, I read with fascination the text of Simon & Schuster v. New York State Crime Victims Board.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing the Court's opinion, quoted Henry Hill, a gangster now in the Federal Witness Protection Program and the subject of Nicholas Pileggi's 1985 book, "Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family" (as the Court opinion put it, "hereinafter Wiseguy").
Although Mr. Hill admitted pulling off the largest cash robbery in United States history, the 1978 theft of $5.8 million from Lufthansa Airlines, Justice O'Connor wrote, "Most of Hill's crimes were more banausic."
That word was new to me (and to Robert D. Sack of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, who called the case to my attention). Banausic (pronounced buh-NAW-sik) is defined in Merriam-Webster's Ninth New Collegiate as "concerned with earning a living." It is rooted in the Greek banausos, "artisan," a word that then had a pejorative connotation: working with the hands was considered a grubby thing to do by the types who strolled about in sheets.
On further review, as they say at football games, the adjective banausic now has two senses: one is "banal, spiritless, having no character or zip"; the other is "mechanistic, mired in routine, lacking in creativity." The Oxford English Dictionary's Supplement notes that the word (which comes after banana) is no longer rare, evidence of a pickup in usage, but adds no new definition to its original "merely mechanical."
What did Justice O'Connor mean? I shot her a postcard: "Was your meaning banal or mechanical? Have you used banausic before?"
"I intended it to mean 'mundane,' " she replies. "I have not used the word previously in an opinion, but once in a while it is satisfying to include a word that is not overused."
Mundane has two senses: "prosaic, commonplace, workaday," as the context of Justice O'Connor's opinion suggests, and the less common "materialistic, temporal" as opposed to "spiritual." I would drearily go into the etymology of mundane, but that would be (what's the word that follows banana?) banausic.

Prime-Time Heroes

BYLINE: By Eric V. Copage; Eric V. Copage, an editor of this magazine, is the author of "Kwanzaa: An African-American Celebration of Culture and Cooking."

 BODY:
No one told me that because I am black I couldn't be Superman. No one told me I couldn't be Peter Gunn, the wild, wild James West or John Drake, Secret Agent Man.
These television paladins of yesteryear came up during a recent dinner conversation. A companion told me a black friend of his, roughly my age, had felt hobbled by the lack of African-American heroes and the prevalence of negative stereotypes on television during his childhood. While I knew that television programs could adversely affect self-esteem, I also knew, through my own experience, that it needn't be that way. And as my 4-year-old son and 16-month-old daughter hurtle through the world, I know I must do my best to nurture them the way I was nurtured. 
 When I was growing up, virtually all the main characters on TV were white. But that didn't prevent me from being lost in space with Billy Mumy or diving under the sea with Lloyd Bridges. When "I Spy" premiered in 1965, the precedent of Bill Cosby's starring role was lost on my 10-year-old mind. I watched because Scotty (Cosby) and Kelly (Robert Culp) were so cool that they could wisecrack in the face of death, which was the same reason I admired John Steed and Emma Peel -- "The Avengers" -- played by Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, both of whom, of course, were white.
It's not that I was oblivious to color. I remember feeling an emotional dissonance between ending the pledge of allegiance at school "with liberty and justice for all," and going home to see TV news footage of blacks fire-hosed for demanding to eat and walk where ever they chose. In the integrated and white middle-class neighborhoods of Los Angeles, racial epithets had been hurled at me. Yet the racial violence seemed distant and surrealistic, and I never went home crying as a result of a racist remark.
Rather, the reality of my home was the most powerful one I had. The adults in my life told me I could do anything if I was determined and resourceful. Granted, being middle-class made this easy to accept. But the people who gave me this advice had come from backgrounds that were far from middle-class. My father, for instance, grew up during the Depression in the ghettos of Chicago, yet managed to become a successful real-estate broker and never dwelt on the disadvantages dealt him. My mother, a housewife and sometime actress, grew up poor but didn't seem alienated from society.
And when, as a youngster, I'd tell my father my big plans for the future -- to buy the company that made Colgate toothpaste and change the name to Copage -- he'd just give me a sly smile that seemed to say proudly, "That's my boy," as any middle-class father would. I was expected to be ambitious because there was an intrinsic pleasure in excelling, not because I had to prove anything to whites.
Even the Watts riots of 1965 failed to convince me that to be black was to be helpless and hopeless in America. My father owned a hamburger stand in Watts as an investment, and hired local teen-agers to work at the counter. They didn't dress as I did, and they sure didn't take the music, karate and acrobatics classes children in my neighborhood routinely attended. Yet I believed that if these teen-agers continued to work hard and look for opportunities, they could make better lives for themselves, as my father had for himself.
Over the next two years, however, a sense of otherness took root in me. In my mostly white junior high school, I was asked whether I preferred being called Negro or black. I began hearing chants of "black is beautiful." That being black was to be somehow tragic and full of rage was played out on the TV news, where I saw black Americans talking about revolution and shooting clenched-fist salutes in the air. In the midst of this, I began to doubt myself and the values I had grown up with. I feared I might be an "Oreo."
This conflict was brought into vivid relief for me in 1968. I was 13 when my 6-year-old brother, Marc, was tapped to play the part of Corey Baker in "Julia," the half-hour sitcom that starred Diahann Carroll as a widowed nurse trying to raise her young son (my brother). Julia was middle-class, beautiful and smart, and lived with her son in an integrated apartment building.
Being the first series since "Beulah" in 1950 to star a black woman, "Julia" received a fair amount of publicity, and more than a fair amount of vitriol. Black activists and some white television critics said the series, produced and written by whites, was "unrealistic" because it did not address the black rage blazing across America's inner cities.
But for me, "Julia" was as real as television gets, no more sanitized or hyperbolic than "I Love Lucy" or "The Patty Duke Show." And besides, the show, with its black characters functioning without pathology in a "white" world, was enough like my life to seem grounded in reality. Were the show's critics charging that my family had forsaken our blackness? Yes, I avidly listened to Bach and Beethoven, but to Charlie Parker and Miles Davis as well. True, when my grandmother cooked chitlins, I shut the kitchen door to contain the stench, but did that make me less black?
For years after that I had a knee-jerk response to television's depiction of black people and black family life: Was the "social reality" that was not a part of "Julia" more "black"?
Still, the fact is that no black person ever complained to me about the life depicted on "Julia." On the contrary, in our conversations about the show, blacks of my acquaintance seemed proud. Certainly, I reasoned, seeing Greg Morris as the expert technician on "Mission: Impossible" or Denise Nicholas as a concerned and conscientious school counselor on "Room 222" could inspire a black child to reach beyond his social limitations.
Recognizing the power of television made me restless for further change. Sidekick status was just not good enough. Why didn't James Earl Jones play Chief Ironside and get chauffeured by some trusty white soul? Why couldn't Captain Kirk be black? And speaking of the Enterprise, why hadn't it ever run into black aliens?
As my friend and I walked to his bus stop after that recent dinner party, we talked about how the depiction of blacks has changed over the past 25 years. Today my children routinely see black judges, lawyers, obstetricians and cops on "Sesame Street," "The Cosby Show" and "Mister Rogers's Neighborhood." This is good. And with Cosby, Oprah Winfrey and Quincy Jones, blacks are beginning to control their own images. That is even better.
But a parent's encouragement, regardless of his or her economic or social circumstance, is more powerful than any cathode-ray-tube hero. Besides, throughout America's history, its good will toward blacks has always come sporadically, been slow to gather force and quick to dissipate. Television has been a mirror of that. As my friend boarded the bus and waved goodbye, I thought I'd continue to teach my children what I had been taught: that they needn't see a black become President or win the Indy 500 on television before feeling they can do it in real life.

HEADLINE: POP VIEW;
On Rap, Symbolism And Fear

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Over the last decade rap has become the epicenter of popular music and a significant influence on fashion, visual arts and language. But to much of the American mainstream, rap is an outlaw music that otherwise well-informed people vilify and fear. Rap marks a generation gap. As young people dance to it, some elders pronounce it unlistenable and others are disturbed by its messages. There's a perception gap, too, reinforced by media, both responsible and irresponsible, that reflexively connect rap and violence. The reasons generally have less to do with rap's rhetoric than with larger tensions of race and class.
Trouble at the movie "Juice"? Commentators point not just to its crime-story plot, but to its rap soundtrack. (No riots have been reported, however, at "The Addams Family," which has a theme song by Hammer.) People trampled to death at an ineptly promoted, poorly policed basketball game at City College in New York? Out come the statistics about violence at rap concerts, although the rap celebrities were invited to shoot hoops, not to perform. 
 No one considered it odd when City College revealed it has a standing policy against presenting rap-related events; imagine the reaction if klezmer or country music were prohibited. And when, shortly after the City College deaths, three times as many people gathered without arrests or major incidents for a rap concert at Madison Square Garden, at least one television correspondent played up a minor altercation as if it eclipsed the whole show. Television, tabloids and some newspaper columnists tend to present rap as one indivisible, alien morass: "an increasingly sociopathic form of pop music," quoth one Washington Post contributor.
Rap gets plenty of publicity when it turns most offensive. When Ice Cube spews racist demagoguery on his album "Death Certificate," or when Public Enemy releases a video clip that sets out to honor Martin Luther King Jr. by killing a fictitious senator and governor of Arizona, shows like "Nightline" pay attention.
But too many people leap from a handful of lyrics to blanket denunciations. The bulk of rap lyrics, in fact, completely ignore whites, to concentrate on boasting and, lately, lectures on black self-help. While rap-haters focus on the racism of Ice Cube and the sex-and-guns fantasies of N. W. A., they tend to ignore the many rappers who plead for an end to violence, and who find a wide audience. Chubb Rock, for instance, had a No. 1 single on Billboard's rap chart with "Treat 'Em Right," which urges fellow rappers to bring "decency" back to lyrics and tells would-be gang warriors, "Leave the knife and gun in the store and ignore temptation."
Hip-hop culture, which also includes dancing, fashion and visual arts, has been widely available for at least 13 years -- longer in the right neighborhood. As early as 1974, disk jockeys in the South Bronx were chopping up and recombining music on multiple turntables, and they were soon joined by rhyming rappers. In 1979, the Sugar Hill Gang released "Rapper's Delight," the single that announced the arrival of a new genre. Kurtis Blow took rap further up the pop charts with "The Breaks" in 1980; Blondie's "Rapture," the first white rap hit, followed in 1981.
In pop terms, that ought to be ancient history. By the time rock-and-roll was 13 years old, in the mid-1960's, only the most lunatic of fringes still denounced the entire genre as a threat to public morals and safety. Rap hasn't had it so easy. There are still some people proclaiming that it's not music, and more who are convinced that rap exists only to incite violence, corrupt children and destroy all that is good and decent.
Why hasn't rap's success, with performers ranging from Run-D. M. C. to Hammer to P. M. Dawn, made it just another branch of entertainment, taken for granted? Obviously, rap has become a symbol in a United States obsessed with race.
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, wrote in The New York Times that contemporary political campaigns use crime as "a marker for race." Rap is an even more precise marker: despite the growing number of rappers who are white, female, suburban or all three, rap is still overwhelmingly made by young, black, urban males -- a demographic segment that many Americans consider threatening. Hating rap, a purportedly esthetic judgment, can be a synonym for hating and fearing young black men.
Yet clear-cut racism is only part of the anti-rap sentiment. As a matter of taste, hip-hop does challenge older pop esthetics. Unless a rap song lifts a whole melodic hook from an older song, as Hammer does, it's likely to be atonal or tuneless, building its catchiness on a slogan, a rhythm or a sound effect -- closer to non-Western music than to Tin Pan Alley. In that, however, it is part of a larger trend in popular music; other styles like speed-metal and industrial rock also downplay melody in favor of rhythm, texture and impact. To listeners weaned on the jolting jump-cuts and assertive self-promotion of television and the electronic soundscape of video games, rap sounds familiar. If it annoys parents, all the better.
Rap is also foreground music, abrasive and insistent, perfect for blasting from a club sound system or a portable boom box or a car stereo; people who use Bach or Bon Jovi as congenial background music are irritated by the noise. But opera also shrieks for attention, and it doesn't trigger the kind of self-righteous response that rap does.
Some reactions against rap involve historic friction among races and classes. In "Popular Musics of the Non-Western World" (Oxford University Press, 1988), Peter Manuel writes that new kinds of music usually arise from "an unassimilated, disenfranchised, impoverished, socially marginalized class." Styles as far flung as Greek rebetika, Jamaican reggae, Argentine tango and American jazz have all trickled up from outcast or gangster netherworlds, eventually to be embraced by middle and upper classes (some seeking vicarious thrills), while drawing widespread denunciations on the way up. In that, hip-hop is true to form.
But when suburbia embraced hip-hop during the 1980's, the alarmist reactions only increased. For one thing rap remains defiantly unassimilated, profane and disdainful of middle-class proprieties. In the mainstream American imagination, blacks have historically been considered the Other, the opposite of the mainstream's genteel self-image. That mysterious, imagined Other is considered uncivilized, sex-crazed, irrational, angry.
Hip-hop, many commentators have inveighed, is intended solely to spur violence, race hatred and general lawlessness. Not so coincidentally, that's what those commentators fear from an urban black population whose prospects deteriorated steadily through the 1980's.
It's not hard to detect signs of a guilty conscience projected onto the Other. Rap often sounds like a young black man shouting; what else would he be shouting about, thinks a listener who can't understand all the words, but how angry he is at people like me? And how he's going to hurt us?
Rap is not so single-minded. Hundreds of thousands of words have been rapped on recordings in the last decade, on innumerable subjects: Egyptology, sex, sneakers, gang vendettas, the recession. Chuck D. of Public Enemy has compared rap to a black cable-news network, but rap also has something in common with citizens'-band radio and computer bulletin boards. Rap mixes public messages and private references, distress calls and jokes, information and fiction, retorts and pontifications. Sensationalism and images of violence appear, along with occasional glints of racism.
Rappers, of course, are not philosopher-kings. Like rock musicians, many rappers are immature or stupid or wildly egotistical, and they don't always hang out with the nicest people. Some rappers use criminal records as proof of authenticity, as Leadbelly did in the 1930's. And some, recognizing that outlaw images sell, set out to shock and titillate, claiming the same artistic license as the makers of, say, "A Nightmare on Elm Street." If young black men are to be stereotyped, their raps suggest, then they'll exaggerate the stereotype as far as it will go.
To be "hard" -- to please a hypothetical "street" audience that will only accept the most brutal scenarios -- too many rappers confuse manliness with misogyny and homophobia. Gangster rap, rap's equivalent of action-adventure films, offers frightening messages in abundance, for those who want to find them.
Many political rappers are followers of the Rev. Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, whose message of black self-reliance has been widely criticized for invoking anti-white and anti-Semitic racism. Farrakhan-ite rappers tend to be more circumspect, saying "devils" instead of "white devils" and usually condemning the system rather than the race of the people who run it. Lately, Public Enemy and other rappers have denounced self-destructive elements among blacks -- drug dealers, gangsters, alcoholics -- as much as they've attacked outsiders. But Public Enemy gets far more attention for its blunders, like the video clip for "By the Time I Get to Arizona," which ignores Martin Luther King Jr.'s philosophy and chooses revenge (and machismo) over persuasion.
Even at its rare racist extremes, rap simply picks up demagogic ideas that have long been heard on ghetto streets, allowing them to be monitored -- and answered -- and reminding a wider public that racism can cut two ways. Sensible or virulent, rap also continues to be a voice of the disenfranchised; unlike David Duke, no rapper has yet been a serious contender for public office.
David Samuels, writing in The New Republic (Nov. 11), contended that gangster raps and racist raps (which he conflates with all of rap) foster a "voyeurism and tolerance of racism in which black and white are both complicit," particularly when whites treat gangster raps as a window into ghetto life. But only a naive listener would fail to distinguish between tall tales and reportage.
As a business, hip-hop has problems akin to early jazz and early rock-and-roll: a mixture of honest and fly-by-night entrepreneurs, some of whom exploit both performers and fans. And yes, rap audiences, with some members from poor, crime-wracked communities, can include troublemakers. But the vast majority of concertgoers are happy to see metal detectors and extensive security, and rappers on stage invariably urge audiences to stay peaceful. The sensationalist image of rappers inciting slavering hordes to acts of mayhem has no basis in reality.
Rap's internal troubles reflect the poverty, violence, lack of education, frustration and rage of the ghetto. Yet in the end, rap is not a way of exporting those troubles, but a way of transcending them.
People who can't afford musical instruments or lessons -- and who aren't getting much music education in the wake of school budget cuts -- have made their own music with turntables, changing the passive act of playing records into the active creation of new songs. People who might be proving their toughness in street fights are, instead, proving themselves with elaborate boasts and taunts, trading physical threat for verbal dexterity. Rap has also provided new, legitimate avenues for entrepreneurs and technicians -- it testifies to the spirit of free enterprise.
It's time to recognize what rap is: a huge, varied symbolic realm, too big to be stereotyped. There are smart rappers and idiotic ones, positive forces and nasty ones, rappers who want to teach and rappers who want to pander and rappers who just want to make people laugh. Until rap is treated as something other than a terrifying monolith, people within hip-hop may well be justified in thinking that, to the outside world, they all look alike.

HEADLINE: FILM;
One People in Two Worlds

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN; Samuel G. Freedman is the author of "Small Victories," a finalist for the 1990 National Book Award, and the forthcoming "Upon This Rock," about a black church in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
As Idi Amin expels the entire Asian population from Uganda, early in Mira Nair's new film, "Mississippi Masala," soldiers halt a busload of fleeing Indians. They order one woman outside, at gunpoint, and open her suitcase, searching for currency or jewels. Instead they find a tape recorder and, still suspicious, demand she play the cassette already cued. Out pours a song from an Indian film, its words translated by subtitles into English.
"My shoes are Japanese/ My pants are English/ My red hat is Russian/ But my heart -- it's all Indian. 
 With the odd and abrupt power of popular culture, the song becomes the anthem of a diaspora, the Indian diaspora that animates Ms. Nair's film, which opens Wednesday. She follows the woman's family from Uganda through England to Mississippi, where they manage a roadside motel called the Monte Cristo and shop at the Piggly Wiggly even as they cling for identity to a homeland few of them have ever inhabited.
In evoking their odyssey, with its agonizing compromises between fidelity and assimilation, Ms. Nair has undertaken one of the most gripping subjects for contemporary Indian and Pakistani artists, many of them born or educated abroad. Salman Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses" and the film "My Beautiful Laundrette," written by Hanif Kureishi, followed the migrants to England, while V. S. Naipaul has set books in the expatriate communities of Africa and the Caribbean, and Bharati Mukherjee created in the novel "Jasmine" a Hindu heroine who comes to rest in Iowa.
Like all of them, Ms. Nair knows firsthand the dialectic of diaspora, the constant tension between departing and arriving. "When I left India at 19, I was rooted in a very certain reality," the 35-year-old director said recently. "And since then, life has been very fluid. Back and forth, back and forth. And I realize in hindsight that I use that fluidity as part of my work.
"I used to have a joke when people asked where I live," continued Ms. Nair, who won an Academy Award nomination for best foreign film for "Salaam Bombay!" (1988). "I'd say, 'I live on Air India.' But the other side is that you live between your ears. You carry your home within yourself. That's a nice-sounding cerebral concept, but the truth is that you're torn."
One half of the film's title, "masala," refers to a variety of spices in different shades, and to Ms. Nair symbolizes the polyglot culture of Indians who were colonized in their own nation by the British and then forced by poverty to seek survival elsewhere. Often they served in those adopted countries as the mercantile class, comfortable enough to be resented from below, not comfortable enough to be protected from above.
That is precisely the situation for Jay (Roshan Seth), a lawyer of Indian descent and Ugandan birth, as "Mississippi Masala" opens in 1972. A lifelong black friend named Okelo saves Jay from arrest and possible execution as an outspoken foe of Amin, yet endorses the dictator's decree ousting Asians.
"I was born here!" Jay shouts in exasperation. "I have always been Ugandan first, Indian second. All my life I have devoted to justice -- I have been called a traitor and a bootlicker by my fellow Indians. Uganda is my home."
"Not anymore," Okelo replies softly. "Africa is for Africans. Black Africans."
Eighteen years later, when the film resumes its narrative, Jay is managing a motel in Greenwood, Miss., and petitioning a new regime in Uganda for restoration of his assets and citizenship. His wife, Kinnu (Sharmila Tagore), owns a liquor store in the black section of town. And their only child, a 23-year-old daughter named Mina (Sarita Choudhury), has grown into a self-proclaimed "masala" who wears the traditional smock called a kameez, hangs a John Lennon postcard by her bedside and still remembers a few childhood words of Swahili.
She suffers, in one respect, from inertia, maddening Jay with her refusal to attend college. But in other ways, she stands as the family rebel, shouting in one moment of intergenerational anger, "This is America, Ma!" and proving it by her romance with a black man.
The relationship between Mina and a small-business owner named Demetrius (Denzel Washington), like that between a black architect and his white secretary in Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever," sets off violent tremors in both extended families. And, in Ms. Nair's design, it places the sharpest edge on Indians' ambiguous position in the racial and economic landscape.
Only decades after his forebears were shipped to Uganda by the British for the bitter labor of building a railroad, Jay dresses in a tweed coat with pocket square and owns a hilltop villa surrounded by gardens, literally and figuratively perched above the black masses. Once in Mississippi, his family rapidly surpasses blacks who have lived there for centuries, in terms of both income and white acceptance. And while the Indian diaspora includes a fierce attachment to the foods and songs and gods of the subcontinent, the salves that make exile tolerable, the African diaspora embodied by Demetrius has been systemically stripped of its culture and history.
"There's a tension around the issue of alliances," Ms. Nair put it. "The black folks think, 'All of us people of color must stick together.' And the Indians cash in on that when it suits them. But the white people are glad the middle class isn't black. I once asked an Indian motel owner if he'd experienced racism, and he said, 'No, I'm just a white person who stayed in the sun too long.' "
At one point in the film, facing Jay's opposition to the interracial love affair, Demetrius declares: "I've never left Mississippi, but I do know something about the world. I know that folks can come to this country and be as black as the ace of spades, but soon as they come here they start to act white -- treat us like their doormats."
Such attitudes, Ms. Nair said, underline the hard lessons of Uganda. "It's popular to show Amin as this violent buffoon," she said, "but, in part, he had a very acute political grasp of that time. He knew it would be shrewd to cash in on the nationalism. And it's also true that the Indians were the ones running the country on the visible level -- the merchants, the moneylenders, the businessmen. Even though the British, who had wedged them in, were the experts in divide-and-conquer."
Ms. Nair's familiarity with the daily lives of Indian expatriates comes from more than her own perience at Harvard University, where she studied after leaving the town of Bhubaneswar, some 350 miles south of Calcutta. Rather, it attests to her background as a documentary film maker and to her creative partnership with Sooni Taraporevala, a Harvard classmate who has become Ms. Nair's regular screenwriter. Even the pair's first feature, the highly lauded "Salaam Bombay!," largely eschewed trained actors in its portrait of the city's street children.
Only 15 years old in 1972, Ms. Nair does not remember hearing news of Amin's edict. Rather, she learned of it elliptically through Mr. Naipaul's novel "A Bend in the River," which is set in an unnamed African country, and more directly through an article by Jane Kramer in The New Yorker about an Indian family that had moved from Kampala to London under the dictator's expulsion order. Ms. Nair would later spend several weeks in Uganda, interviewing many of the 500 Indians who had remained in defiance of Amin's order, after nearly 80,000 left.
In the precarious existence of Uganda's Indians Ms. Nair found a parallel to those countrymen increasingly operating motels in the American South. With her documentarian's talent for research, she drove from South Carolina to Mississippi in March 1989. So numerous were Indian-owned motels that one or two billboards for competitors bluntly stated, "100 percent American."
The reasons for the boom became readily clear to Ms. Nair. Sponsored for immigration, trained in the trade and sometimes even lent money by relatives, Indians could buy motels for as little as $100,000. Much like Koreans with greengroceries, the Indians could rely on family members for labor and could conduct business with only a cursory knowledge of English.
More important, Ms. Nair discovered the texture she calls the "inexplicability of life." "The Indians inhabited this no man's land, and yet it was their oasis," she said. "Here they were, face to face with truck drivers or prostitutes or lovers having a tryst, with blacks and whites. And yet here are these Indian hymns and the smell of garlic. One Indian couple I met couldn't afford the insurance on their motel's swimming pool, so they made it into a garden of Indian vegetables."
On a subsequent trip, Ms. Nair brought along Ms. Taraporevala. It was her life, more than the director's, that came to inform the coltish character of Mina. Ms. Taraporevala's father, who ran a money-exchange business in Bombay, allowed her to apply to Harvard only because he was certain that even if she won admission she would never receive the necessary scholarships.
"There's always this tension and pull," she said. "My parents always assumed that I would grow up and earn a living and be independent. But as years go by, you change and have new ideas, and they start to not recognize you anymore. When I would come back from college and do something my father did not like, he would say, 'I should not have sent you to America.' "
On one trip home, Ms. Taraporevala was joined by her college boyfriend, a white Chicagoan. Her parents treated him with courtesy, only expressing their true trepidation after the couple broke up.
"My father's always believed that I think with my heart instead of my head," said Ms. Taraporevala, who puts very similar words in Jay's mouth in the film. "He really thought I had screwed up, that I should get my life together, stop mooning. Then the issue of Indian and American came up. He thought maybe the reason things didn't work out is the cultural gap was too broad to bridge."
The role of Mina went to an unproven actress, but one with a particular affinity for the role. Sarita Choudhury grew up in Jamaica, where her father worked as a government biologist. India was "like a storybook more than a reality," she recalled, kept alive by her father's stories and celebrations of the Hindu festival of Divali. Outside the household, however, Ms. Choudhury became so Jamaican she learned the patois of Kingston's slums. It was her own grace note to have Mina wear a Bob Marley T-shirt in several scenes.
"When I read the script, it took away my paranoia that I couldn't act," said Ms. Choudhury, who is 25, "because I found a story I could identify with, and I instinctively felt I could portray this character. Mina is someone who's mixed and matched until she's mixed up. When you have a mixed heritage, you can't be patriotic to any one place. The strength of that is that you're much more open-minded, but the downfall is that you have no home."

HEADLINE: A DIRECTORY OF CRUISES WORLDWIDE;
New Ships, New Destinations

BYLINE: By TERRY TRUCCO; TERRY TRUCCO frequently writes about travel.

 BODY:
LAST year at this time, cruise line executives were nervous. There was a war in the Persian Gulf, a recession at home and Americans simply weren't taking cruises. "It was as if the phones had been disconnected," said Rod Seeley, president of Cruise Pro, a cruise-only travel agency in Thousand Oaks, Calif. In addition, three enormous ships were about to be launched, adding more than 6,500 berths to the market. The industry's response was a blizzard of discounts, everything from 2-for-1 promotions to deep reductions on last-minute reservations. Apparently, the ship lines got the desired result, for according to the Cruise Lines International Association, a trade organization, cruise ships had an occupancy rate of around 87 percent in 1991, about the same as in 1990, not bad for a year that once looked disastrous.
A year later, there is still a recession, and 18 new ships are set to start cruising, offering more than 12,000 additional berths. Yet throughout the cruise industry, there is a mood of cautious optimism. "We've certainly had a much better start to the year," Mr. Seeley said. "This may not be a banner year for the cruise lines, with all the discounting, but it's going to be a banner year for the consumer." 
 Cruise passengers have rarely had so many choices, from exotic destinations to spectacular accommodations. And the cruise industry has seldom courted passengers as ardently. This is a year for the adventurous, with ships visiting once-forbidden ports, like Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, and sailing to the newly independent Baltic capitals Tallinn in Estonia and Riga in Latvia. And this year people taking cruises can visit a lake in Russia or be among the first non-Russians to sail the river between Moscow and St. Petersburg. Ships are also returning to the Mediterranean, many tying up in Barcelona for the Olympics. Cruises prepaid in dollars are considered a particularly good way of visiting cities in Europe and Asia where the dollar is weak.
The year's new ships range from the enormous (2,354 passengers can be accommodated on Royal Caribbean's Majesty of the Seas) to the almost intimate (the luxurious Royal Viking Queen holds just 212). Among the in- between are the Club Med 2, a 386-passenger sailing ship with computerized sails, and five ships carrying between 1,000 and 1,300 passengers. Celebrity's 1,374-passenger Zenith, a Caribbean vessel, will serve meals devised by a noted London chef, Michel Roux. And Holland America's 1,250-passenger Statendam, set to sail in late December, will have a 17th-century Italian marble fountain in the atrium.
Discounting should continue through 1992, though industry executives expect the discounts to be more predictable and consistent than in 1991. A number of lines, for example, including Princess, Holland America and Royal Caribbean, are offering big incentives for early bookings in an effort to discourage 11th-hour bargain hunters.
If last month is any indication, the cruise industry could be on its way to a buoyant 1992, at least as far as occupancy rates go. (The record was 1989, when occupancies reached 90 percent, according to the cruise lines association.) Several cruise lines reported record bookings, including Royal Caribbean, which set a single-day company high of 11,102 bookings on Jan. 8 and Carnival, which reached an unprecedented 65,000 bookings the week of Jan. 6.
True, January is traditionally a strong month for cruise bookings, and much of the volume resulted from last-minute reservations, discount offers for early bookings and pent-up demand. "Because of the recession, everybody is booking late, even for round the world and Mediterranean cruises," said Stanley Rhodes, an agent with Linden Travel in New York.
Among the discounts still being offered, Norwegian Cruise Line is featuring a 2-for-1 deal on selected three- and four-day Bahamas cruises, through Feb. 24. Holland America is offering substantial reductions, linked with stringent restrictions, for early reservations on selected autumn cruises. And several lines, including Renaissance Cruises and Royal Cruise Line, have introduced reductions on the supplements single occupants pay for use of double cabins on selected sailings. The availability of group discounts is also growing rapidly as well, with cruise lines accepting looser definitions of groups. "A group can be three or four people, not an obvious affinity group," said Stanley Buchin, a cruise management consultant for Arthur D. Little, a management consultant company.
FOR customers in the market for longer trips, cruise lines often have good prices on so-called positioning cruises, including trans-Atlantic trips to move a ship from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean. "Demand for these cruises is lower, and prices can be negotiated more easily." said Steve Wellmeier, marketing director for Travltips, a travel agency in Flushing, Queens.
Yet in spite of discounting and concerns about possible overcapacity, cruising is viewed as one of the few bright spots in the travel industry these days. "The cruise industry grew about 10 percent last year," said Arthur Sbarsky, senior vice president in marketing for Crystal Cruises. "Airplanes, hotels, trains and buses didn't."
Some believe the single all-inclusive cost of a cruise is especially attractive in today's economic climate. "With cruising, once you've paid the initial price, everything is taken care of," said Joyce Landry, a partner in Landry & Cling, cruise specialists in Coral Gables, Fla.
Cruises are becoming particularly popular with families. According to a 1990 survey by the cruise lines association, 28 percent of those who had taken a cruise in the previous two years took their children. "The baby boomers are taking their kids on cruises, and not just to the Caribbean," Mr. Seeley said. A number of cruise lines, including Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line, now offer year-round youth programs. Royal Caribbean will have a specially designed teen disco, called Flashes, on its new Majesty of the Seas, which will set sail on April 26. (A similar disco, with light shows and music, is on its sister ship, Monarch of the Seas.) Cruises linked to land trips are attracting families as well. Premier, for example, offers moderately priced Bahamas cruises that conclude with a visit to Florida's Walt Disney World.
The recession does not seem to have greately dampened the demand for luxury accommodations, either. Cruise lines and travel agents report that the year's hottest sellers are the cheapest cabins -- and the costliest. Some passengers are asking for the cheaper cabins in the hopes of an upgrade. But premium-priced suites are selling, often to cruising's traditional constituents, older affluent passengers.
Many in the industry, in fact, are betting that luxury is the future. One of the year's most talked about new ships is the $125 million Radisson Diamond, a futuristic looking 354-passenger luxury liner with a twin hull. The ship, due to spend much of the year in the Caribbean, will have a five-story atrium, glass-enclosed elevators, saunas, steambaths and a $600 a day price tag without air fare. The company plans to launch a sister ship, the Radisson Ruby, in 1993.
Among cruise companies, the two-tiered approach -- both a luxury and a moderately priced line -- is proving itself. The veterans include Kloster Cruises, with its mass-market Norwegian Cruise Line and sybaritic Royal Viking Line; and Chandris Cruise Companies, which runs the mass-market Fantasy line and more upscale Celebrity line. .
New to the two-tiered market this year are Costa Cruise Line and Dolphin Cruise Line. The 1,300-passenger, $325 million Costa Classica is the first in Costa's Euro-Luxe line, aimed at the high end of the mass market and the low end of the luxury market. The ship, launched last month, has all the trappings of a floating hotel, with marble walls and floors, teak decks and an enormous bronze sculpture by the Italian artist Arnaldo Pomodoro.
The 1,056-passenger, $220 million Royal Majesty, the first of three handsomely appointed ships in Dolphin's new Majesty line, will start running short cruises in September from Miami to Nassau and Royal Isle, the line's private island in the Bahamas. "I think the lines are discovering that once passengers go on a second cruise, they want upgraded vessels," Ms. Landry said.
The North American cruise industry, by far the world's richest market, has grown dramatically in the last two decades, and is expected to continue to grow in the 90's. The Cruise Lines International Association is predicting passenger growth of between 8 and 10 percent in 1992. The current year began with 90,000 berths on 122 ships; an additional 30,000 berths are expected by 1994. Last year four million passengers from the United States and Canada took cruises, a big increase over the industry's 500,000 passengers in 1970. And, despite concerns by some in the industry that too many ships are coming on line, others insist cruising is in its infancy. "An enormous number of Americans have never cruised," Mr. Sbarsky said.
Many attribute the growth of cruising to a change of strategy on the part of the cruise lines. "Until the mid 80's, cruise lines were run by maritime people, and passengers were considered just another cargo to move around," said Mr. Buchin. These days, cruise lines are managed and marketed like resorts or hotels.
The creation of sharply focused lines like Carnival, and television shows like "The Love Boat," attracted new types of passengers, as well. According to the 1990 survey by Cruise Lines International, 41 percent of the adults who had taken a cruise in the previous two years were under 40.
Income levels were also surprisingly varied. In the same survey, 35 percent had incomes under $40,000, while 30 percent exceeded $60,000.
Cruising's broadening audience is reflected in the popularity of short cruises, particularly the affordable three- and four-day cruise, one of the market's fastest growing segments. In 1984 there were three or four ships offering short cruises, according to a spokesman for Carnival. This year there will be 10.
This market could expand dramatically if Cuba is opened to Americans, according to Ron Bitting, owner of Personal Touch Cruise Consultants in Freeport, L.I., and president of the National Association of Cruise Only Agencies. " It would be one of cruising's most exciting events, and it could happen in 1992."
At the same time, demand continues for longer cruises by older passengers. In most cases, older, smaller ships are used for the longer journeys. Fantasy's Britanis, which dates from the 1930's and is one of the oldest cruise ships afloat, makes a 50-day South American cruise each autumn. "It carries 926 passengers, but they take about 500 and use the more comfortable cabins," said Mr. Wellmeier.
Ships in 1992 will sail to nearly every corner of the world, from Antarctica and the Amazon to Africa and the so-called Atlantic Frontier (Boston to Labrador). Alaska has become a cruise classic, though just 16 ships will visit this year, six less than in 1991. (Most cruise lines, concerned that last year's Gulf War would last for months, diverted Mediterranean ships to Alaska and New England.) Eighteen lines will visit the Mediterranean this summer. Cruises are also going to Australia and Indonesia. Because of the civil war in Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik has been dropped by most cruise itineraries, though Ocean Cruise's Ocean Princess, among other ships, still plans to stop there.
The Caribbean remains cruising's major destination, with year-round visitors and 56 percent of the market. A number of the year's new ships are expected to make the familiar stops -- St. Thomas, Grand Cayman, St. Martin, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Barbados. Travel agents agree that these ports are nearly overwhelmed by cruise ships, yet until other Caribbean islands develop the tours and facilities to accommodate daily arrivals of over 1,000 visitors, these will remain the Caribbean's cruise capitals.
And there seems no end in sight to ships destined for the Caribbean. The ship of the future could be the Phoenix World City, an ultramegaship built to hold 5,600 passengers and a crew of 1,800. Currently in the final stages of design, construction on the $1 billion project could start in the United States later this year, according to John Rogers, president of Phoenix World City Corporation.
The supership, brainchild of Knute Utstein Kloster, founder of Kloster Cruises, would have three hotel towers, 13 restaurants, a 20,000-square-foot casino and home base in Port Canaveral, Fla.
From there it could cruise the southern coast of the United States or venture into the Caribbean, where its 400-passenger tenders could deliver passengers to nearly any island.

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
An American Modernist, at Home and Abroad

BYLINE: By John Russell

 BODY:
Some of this critic's most favorite American paintings are included in the centennial exhibition of the work of Stuart Davis (1892-1964), which one can still catch at the Metropolitan Museum for two more weeks. The show is large -- 175 paintings and drawings, some of mural size -- and there are those who think that it could with advantage be smaller.
This regular visitor to the show does not agree. For one thing, a thinned-down and generally approved version of Stuart Davis's career might leave out my favorite paintings altogether. Quite apart from that, what we have in "Stuart Davis: American Painter" is something that goes way beyond Davis himself. 
 The underlying subject of this show is the modernist spirit in America. From the moment in 1913 when Stuart Davis, not yet 21, showed five watercolors at the Armory Show in New York, he was a part of that spirit. He saw everything. He read everything. Modernism was the very air he breathed.
The catalogue of the present show reminds us that in 1920 William Carlos Williams chose a drawing by Davis as the frontispiece for a new book of his poems. Even more telling, perhaps, is the fact that in that same year a drawing by Davis appeared in the Little Review to accompany the first publication in this country of an extract from James Joyce's "Ulysses."
As a history of American modernism, the show is necessarily both elliptic and incomplete. But as a diary of one man's responses to his century, it repays many a visit. Stuart Davis identified strongly with his century, and with the United States as a society that had a virtually unlimited potential that might or might not be realized. Meanwhile, his eyes and ears were finely attuned to the rhythms of American life. (He named his son, Earl, after the great jazz pianist Earl Hines.)
From his first teacher, the painter Robert Henri, he inherited a sharp eye for the down side of society. As to that, he knew what the late Stuart Chase meant when he wrote that improved technology would in the end cause widespread unemployment and the proletarianization of the middle class.
But the paintings by Stuart Davis toward which I move as if magnetized were not inspired by social problems. They are the hedonistic and unpopulated Parisian townscapes that he painted in 1928-29 in the course of his first and only visit to Paris.
The visit was a key episode in his long career. Financed in part by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, and in part by Juliana Force, the first director of the Whitney Museum, he stayed in Paris for 13 months, with intense enjoyment. But he never went back. As he summed it up in 1931, his time in Paris "allowed me to observe the enormous vitality of the American atmosphere, as compared to Europe, and made me regard the necessity of working in New York as a positive advantage."
So what did Stuart Davis do in his Paris pictures? To begin with, he edited out every one of the human figures that would otherwise have crowded the Parisian streets. He went on to change, revise and omit the given scene as he thought best. He used color in a completely arbitrary way. The color was gentle and elegiac, moreover, with none of the Sousa-like bounce that came naturally to him back at home. He played around with scale, too. What was big, in reality, often became small, and what was small -- an old-style soda syphon, for instance -- stood tall in the foreground.
Next, he took the weight and the volume out of the given scene, so that it looked flat, and light, and thin. Change and omission were fundamental to his procedures. Not everyone cares for the paintings that resulted. The critic Brian O'Doherty, who knew Davis well and loved his work, once described them as "confected idealized stage sets for a nostalgic musical of an American artist in Paris."
But they were not sets for someone else's work. They were complete in themselves. Love letters to a certain Paris, they worked as well with august architecture (see "The Place des Vosges" of 1928) as with the anonymous, awkward and cheerless suburban scenes with which he took just as much trouble.
It is relevant to these quietly seductive pictures that Davis painted them at precisely the time when George Gershwin was writing his "American in Paris." Between them, though quite independently, Gershwin and Davis immortalized the moment at the end of the 1920's when Paris was wide open to the intelligent high-stepping American and the dollar went a very long way.
I never hear "An American in Paris" without imagining the kind of lanky, rangy, young American couple who might have danced their way in and out of one of Stuart Davis's Parisian paintings. Nor do I ever look at one of those paintings without hearing the jaunty, irrepressible orchestration with which Gershwin responded to the idea of Paris.
Those were glory days for the young American in Paris. This was the time when Alexander Calder was making fast friends with Joan Miro, when Man Ray and Berenice Abbott between them were photographing everybody worth knowing in Paris, and when Marsden Hartley and Isamu Noguchi were the American artists in town. A young black American, Josephine Baker, was beloved of almost every Parisian. As for Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, they were perpetrating a dream of Paris that still has potency for the young American visitor.
Read with that period in mind, these paintings can give enormous pleasure. They may not be "major Davis," but they are not second-rate Davis, either. Where Paris was concerned, he went, he saw, he enjoyed it, but he wasn't conquered. Back at home, he had a richer set of options.
He moved forward, and he moved sideways, and in his last decade he moved backward to give a final energy and a symphonic completion to ideas that he had initiated long before. (In 1961, three years before he died, he wrote that "completion must be understood as the economical use of past accomplishment, not a redoing of it.")
Of that economical use, and that completion, there is a prime example in "The Paris Bit," which he painted in 1959. Essentially a symphonic enlargement of his "Rue Lipp" of 1928, this has a congested, full-bodied look that is exactly the opposite of the spare, cool distillation of the earlier painting. We can make out the cheap French hotel, the soda syphon, the carafe of water and the words "Belle France" written billboard size on the wall. But the lean, snaking, soft-shoe stance of "An American in Paris" has gone.
Yet, in his very last paintings, France made a final, coded reappearance. In two small paintings, "On Location" (1963) and "Punch Card Flutter" (1963), and in the large last one, "Fin (Last Painting)" (1964), Davis took as his point of departure a photograph (clipped, by the way, from The New York Times) of the walls of Carcassonne with a forked French tree in the foreground.
A quick and secret mover throughout his 50-year career, Davis seems never to have spoken about that photograph. (It turned up when his son Earl was going through his father's papers.) But it was the prime mover, in essence, of all three of the last paintings, even if in one of them the castellations of the city walls take on the jagged outline of a computer punch card.
Even the title of "On Location" gives us a clue to his feelings about the clipping of Carcassonne. "On Location," in movie parlance, means working in a given scene at first hand and away from headquarters. The idea should perhaps not be pressed too far, and in his catalogue essay William C. Agee points out that the forked tree, as a compositional device, was used by Davis already as early as 1919, and again in 1921. The sturdy form of the French tree may be simply another instance of the "economical use of past accomplishment."
But I doubt that the use of that image from The New York Times was accidental. An ancient loyalty to "la Belle France" must surely have played a part in it, just as Davis must have had a reason to write the word "Fin" at the top of his last painting. "Fin" is a word that he must have seen come up on Parisian movie screens when the night's main feature came to an end and it was time to go home. What can it be, in that big painting, if not a coded "Goodbye" to a world, and a century, that he had served so well?

HEADLINE: CLASSICAL MUSIC;
Houston Dares To Be Different

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
The "Parsifal" at the Houston Grand Opera on Thursday evening will begin its second scene with agonizing stealth. A great ring, shining from within, will float into view from above. It will tilt and -- ever, ever so slowly -- descend around an equally glowing crystalline iceberg in the center of the stage. From it Amfortas will extract the Grail.
Where is everybody? The knights and their somber procession? We hear their voices offstage, but people get short shrift in Robert Wilson's long-suffering but finally produced version of Wagner's music drama. The Houston Grand Opera, in another of the calculated risks it has come to be known for, is giving the American premiere of Mr. Wilson's marriage of glacial motion and neutron-bomb stagecraft -- one in which humans often disappear and only constructions are left standing. 
 Will this slow-motion "Parsifal" exasperate Houston's faithful subscribers right out of their seats and into the street? "In some cases, it probably will," said David Gockley earlier this season, "but it won't be a worrisome number." Twenty years at the head of this company have given Mr. Gockley the confidence to face hard facts. He has lifted his troupe from a minor stop-off on the provincial opera circuit to an $18-million-a-year organization with a new theater and 12 productions a season.
In the process, Mr. Gockley has acted as a sort of personal trainer for the tastes and cultural aspirations of Houston audiences. "You stretch them, or you're not an opera company," he said. "This 'Parsifal' is something you put on for your public and in spite of it." Mr. Gockley's strong personality is one of the reasons the Houston Grand Opera can regularly do new operas (Meredith Monk's "Atlas," Michael Tippet's "New Year" and John Adams's "Nixon in China") and get board members to put up the money and audiences to come.
He is a firm presence at every level of the operation, from high-finance board meetings to low-level lighting rehearsals backstage, idealistic enough to have staged Dvorak's sweetly reticent "Rusalka" last fall yet tough enough to cancel "A Little Night Music" because of a projected budget shortfall of $415,000.
If Mr. Gockley's perseverance represents a good percentage of the company's success, most of the rest probably lies with the historical peculiarities of this 150-year-old city. Like Los Angeles and perhaps Dallas, Houston began not as a human reaction to congenial natural surroundings but as a cantankerous act of will. Flat, hellishly humid in summer and 50 miles from the Gulf Coast, Houston was built from sheer stubbornness.
Until the great Spindletop oil find at the turn of the century, it was the economic and cultural inferior of Galveston, a sophisticated port city of merchants and bankers that had long brought in (usually by boat from New Orleans) "Il Trovatore," "La Traviata," "Fra Diavalo" and "The Magic Flute." As early as 1867 these traveling productions began to find their way to Houston. The Metropolitan Opera's touring arm first arrived in 1901 with "Lohengrin" and came again in 1905 to put on -- of all operas -- "Parsifal," one of a series of American performances that defied the Wagner family's interdiction of productions outside Bayreuth.
Touring companies continued to visit during the first half of this century, largely at the instigation of a benefactor-cum-impresario, Edna W. Saunders, who took Houston's taste and musical development into her own hands. The present organization stems from 1955, when a German emigre conductor, Walter Herbert, stirred Houston's moneyed and music-hungry class into backing the city's own opera company. Early seasons, almost all conducted by Herbert, offered three, then four, productions a year.
A topography and climate bordering on the hostile might be expected to repel the advances of culture, but seemingly the opposite has happened. For even though Houston is now a city of striking skylines, endless shopping centers and air-conditioning, there seems to survive in it the sense of a cultural community drawing together for its own self-preservation. Imminent physical threats to survival are long gone, but perhaps something of the early reactions to them has been inherited and sublimated in the hearts of Houstonians.
"New York has its pockets of connoisseurs," said Fredericka Hunter, an art dealer who owns the Texas Gallery. "But there isn't that division of the arts here. The same people go to the music, the exhibitions, the plays. The ones who give money usually give equally to all these things."
Mr. Gockley said, "Houston is not a city of remarkable natural beauty. What makes us different is our arts life." Mr. Gockley's long and evidently happy marriage with such Houstonians allowed him and his board to finance and build a new opera house in the midst of the city's devastating oil recession of the 1980's. Indeed, the spirit of Texas's oil explorers has spilled over into the arts. "They are used to taking a chance," said Ms. Hunter. "They aren't afraid of a dry hole."
Mr. Gockley said: "This is not a town that suffers poor fiscal management. The board tells me to hold on to my audience and keep expenses in line and then lets me run the company. I involve them in policy and major decisions but not the choice of operas."
This "Parsifal," shared with the Hamburg Opera, which gave a not trouble-free version of the production last March, has some natural ties to Houston. Mr. Wilson grew up in Waco and went to school at the University of Texas in Austin. His "Parsifal" was originally intended for Bayreuth, then the Kassel State Opera, but it was canceled with charges that Mr. Wilson had not lived up to agreements.
"Hamburg welcomed our co-sponsorship," said Mr. Gockley. "We sent our technical director over, and he helped them work out some of the production problems. There isn't a lot of built scenery that takes up space and costs a fortune. It's a labor-intensive operation, and it will cost us $1.5 million.
"With Wilson, things must happen with excruciating precison. The expense is in the preparation: the technical rehearsals, the stage movement. In the average show there are three or four follow-spotlights. We use 15 -- for Gurnemanz's head, his hands, the different parts of his body that are moving at a significant moment. Some of the technology was only available in Europe."
Christoph Eschenbach, the music director of the Houston Symphony, will be conducting his first staged Wagner opera, with his own orchestra in the pit. Warren Ellsworth, who trained at the company's Opera Studio, will sing Parsifal. The cast also includes Monte Pederson, Harry Peeters and Vera Baniewicz.
"Wilson reduces images to a level of abstraction not seen before," said Mr. Gockley. Indeed, the image of the knights' round table is reduced to an object, the flying ring. The killing of the swan, usually left offstage, is here represented by a giant two-dimensional wing descending from the flies. Klingsor's tower rises from a lake, hydraulically lifted. The magic garden is portrayed in the abstract as underwater. The ring returns in the last act, now black and tarnished with disuse, referring, too, to Parsifal's black armor.
"The major problem is matching the visual tension with the music," said Mr. Gockley. "But there is a real empathy between Wilson and Eschenbach. They are soul mates."
"Parsifal" required a bigger than usual overall budget for the company this year; Conoco and other companies kicked in extra, and individuals have come up with $600,000 more. Mr. Gockley denied that "A Little Night Music" was a victim of the "Parsifal" production.
He expected little from government agencies and got little. "Grants to us from the state dropped from $150,000 to $18,000 in four years," he said. "We are squeezed three ways: on the Federal level by Jesse Helms's pressure on the National Endowment for the Arts; on the state level by a political climate that spreads arts grants geographically around many smaller communities, and in the city by different cultural and ethnic groups competing for the same money."
Houstonians, on the other hand, are used to taking care of themselves, and for "Parsifal" they have pulled together to do so again. Let's hope they like it.

 CORRECTION:

An article and a picture caption on page 25 of the Arts and Leisure section today about the Houston Grand Opera carry outdated references to the cast for a production of Wagner's "Parsifal." After the section went to press, the company announced that John Keyes would sing Parsifal and Dunja Vejzovic would sing Kundry.

I walked through different parts of Quito, both day and night, and did not feel any danger, except from stray dogs.

HEADLINE: Battle-Scarred Lawmakers Confront Spending

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
STATE residents who saw their taxes rise dramatically last year with the advent of the new tax on wages may soon face a new shock: getting a lot less for their money. When the General Assembly goes back to Hartford this week, lawmakers in both parties say, deep cuts in spending are inevitable, with everything on the chopping block from higher education spending to municipal aid.
Although the income tax is producing about what was expected when it was passed last August, the state's other taxes -- notably sales taxes and the levy on corporate income -- have continued to slide, as the recession has eaten away jobs and profits. And rising state spending on nursing homes and prisons, for instance, are battering the budget from the other side. 
 The expected result is a shortfall of $700 million to $1 billion in the year that begins on July 1, which means a battle over how to resolve that figure without raising taxes again. Politicians across the spectrum -- most of whom are running for re-election in November -- say that any major tax hike is out of the question. What is left, they say, is the equally unpleasant election-year task of slicing up the shrinking pie that remains. "People are totally and completely unprepared for the magnitude of cuts that will be required," said Representative Jonathan Pelto, a Democrat from Storrs and a deputy majority leader in the House of Representatives. "I think it's very likely that this year will be as bad, if not worse, than last session."
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who will propose his budget to the legislature on Wednesday in his State of the State speech, has declined to provide much illumination about his plans, except for these: it will not likely include any new taxes, but it will make everyone howl in pain just the same.
"Nobody's seen the budget, and it's not going to be nice when we do, I know that," said the Speaker of the House, Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat from Newington.
Mr. Balducci said he expected that all of the state's main spending priorities -- municipal aid, education, prisons, and social spending for welfare and Medicaid -- will come under intense scrutiny, and that every area could potentially become a battleground.
There are other complications as well. Lawmakers say that the grim economic news in recent weeks about layoffs at the United Technologies Corporation's Pratt & Whitney plants in the state and the prospect of tens of thousands of more lost jobs in southeastern Connecticut from proposed cuts in submarine construction at the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics have crystallized the need for some state effort to help companies diversify from military work.
The state's largest cities, especially Bridgeport, also continue to suffer from staggering burdens of crime and poverty. Those needs are expected to fuel a drive to try to widen Connecticut's legal gambling system, perhaps including slot machines in Off-Track Betting parlors or elsewhere.
Senator Frank David Barrows, the co-chairman of the Public Safety Committee, which oversees gambling laws, has said he would support such an expansion. Mr. Balducci also said last week that he might support the introduction of slot machines, if the money could be dedicated specifically to distressed municipalities. And many lawmakers say that the scars of 1991 have also yet to heal.
Through the long months of debate on the income tax, both the Democratic majority and the Republican minority repeatedly fractured on what direction the state should take on the pivotal tax question. In December the bitterness reached a high-water mark during an effort to amend the income tax, when a group of moderate Democrats joined with the Republican minority in the House to overturn a procedural ruling by Mr. Balducci from the Speaker's chair, an event that legislative veterans said had not occurred in Connecticut in decades, if ever.
Many Democrats have asked that Deputy Speaker Dean P. Markham of East Hampton, who sided with the Republicans and against the Speaker, be stripped of his job. But Mr. Balducci said last week that a decision on whether the Democrats who rebuked the party's leadership in that vote would be punished might not come until the opening day on Wednesday.
Also uncertain is how vigorously various groups in the General Assembly will fight to repeal or amend the income tax. The special session that ended in December tried on both those counts and failed. The repeal bill, though passed by a bipartisan majority in the House and Senate, was vetoed by Mr. Weicker. The bill to amend the tax never even came up for a vote after it died on the vote against the Speaker.
"There's a lot of stuff that's on the public record in the last 12 months that now comes back to haunt," said Representative Richard Foley Jr., a Republican from Oxford who is also his party's state chairman.
 
Confusion and Anger
 What could temper the hostilities and ultimately force a budget compromise within the three-month regular session is the realization that more chaos at the Capitol will not likely be seen in a kindly light by voters in November, regardless of their feelings on the income tax, state spending or anything else. All 187 Senate and House seats are up for re-election this year.
"Confusion and anger won't do any incumbent any good," said Representative Thomas S. Luby, a Democrat from Meriden. Mr. Luby, who opposed the income tax last year and also helped block the effort to amend the law in December, said that he was now more inclined to support some effort to make the tax law more fair for middle-class taxpayers if the proposal could be tied to further cuts in business taxes.
"The political reality will tend to restrain people from obstructionist or unreasonable behavior," Mr. Luby said. "I'm sure you'll see a calmer, more orderly session."
Mr. Foley, the Republican party chairman, agreed that the session could indeed produce smooth results, at least in theory, because people will feel the need to get back to their districts to start campaigning.
"That's the best scenario," Mr. Foley said. But he added, "This being the State Capitol, it is unlikely that it will happen."

HEADLINE: Talking: Jumbo Loans;
Qualifying Becomes Tougher

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
IN higher-priced regions like the New York metropolitan area, many people who want to buy a home must apply for a jumbo mortgage.
A jumbo loan is one that exceeds $202,300, the current limit imposed by the Federal National Mortgage Association and Home Loan Mortgage Corporation -- known, respectively, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- that regularly buy mortgages from lenders. Such loans must be sold to private pools of investors who set their own rules about what is acceptable. 
 Although in most instances the money will still be forthcoming, it is no longer being offered without extensive documentation on the creditworthiness of the borrower and the value of the property.
In the past, the private secondary market investors were extremely liberal about qualifying criteria -- more liberal, often, than Fannie Mae -- since the properties tended to be in more select neighborhoods and thus wereconsidered good collateral for the loans. In addition, the borrowers were normally more affluent people and were viewed as good credit risks.
This is why, for example, so many of the "no doc" loans so popular in the late 1980's -- loans that did not require independent verification of income or assets -- were jumbos.
No longer. Anthony Harney, a mortgage consultant of Wyckoff, N.J., who acts as an intermediary between jumbo lenders and their secondary market investors, reports that the "white collar" recession, as it is being dubbed, is creating major concerns about even an affluent borrower's ability to make payments as well as the true value of the property. He noted, for example, that in areas like northern New Jersey, higher-priced properties have plunged steeply in value. Many of the people in the jumbo-loan category have also faced the most severe cutbacks in income, whether from lost jobs or failed businesses.
Terms and attitudes vary sharply from lender to lender. "You'll need to do a lot more shopping around," said Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH Associates of Butler, N.J., a nationwide mortgage monitoring service.
In general, however, borrowers can expect lenders willing to make jumbo loans to require a large downpayment to protect their equity. "While they used to write 80 percent jumbos," said Mr. Harney, "the cut-off point at most places is now 75 percent or even lower." The lender may also seek a second appraisal and even interior photos.
Further, a prior banking relationship with the borrower may be a prerequisite. Assets and income will be carefully investigated. And, as in the past, the interest rate is likely to be 1/4 or 1/2 a percentage point higher than for a conforming loan, although the points charge should remain comparable.
Consider, for example, the policies at Republic National Bank of New York. Cliff Broder, senior vice president of domestic private banking, reports that the bank has imposed a 70 percent limit on jumbo loans (75 percent for a newly bought property). This falls to 60 percent for loans over $500,000 -- a sharp contrast to 1986, he noted, when the limit was 80 percent up to $1 million.
Republic now requires two appraisals in many instances. A set of interior photos can also help bolster requests for loans over $500,000, added Mr. Broder. Republic does not require an existing banking relationship but will reduce the points charge if the applicant is willing to use the bank for other personal or business banking needs.
In addition, Republic looks more closely at the jumbo borrower's potential exposure to other temptations that could result in delinquencies. These could include an existing revolving line of credit, high borrowing limits on consumer credit cards and even overdraft privileges. In some cases, he said, borrowers may have to agree to close down some of these lines before a jumbo loan is granted.
NOT all jumbo lenders are as stringent. The CreditFlex program introduced last month by Arbor National Mortgage of Westbury, L.I., for example, takes note of the growing number of responsible borrowers who have been struggling with temporary cash-flow problems that stain an otherwise pristine credit history. CreditFlex gives a loan officer greater discretion in overlooking such blemishes, said Nancy Boles, Arbor's vice president of marketing.
The blemishes may include recently delinquent mortgage or credit card payments, liens and judgments and even a bankruptcy -- provided it was discharged at least three years ago. As the loan-to-value ratio drops -- say, to 60 percent or less -- the lending officer is permitted to take greater risks with blots that might normally disqualify the borrower entirely, said Ms. Boles. But she emphasized that it is not for anyone whose history suggests irresponsibility.
CreditFlex is available to anyone seeking to refinance up to $400,000 ($350,000 for new purchases) and provides an adjustable-rate loan starting at about 8 percent. The points charges depend on the amount of interest the borrower is willing to assume as a trade-off. Arbor, one of a handful of lenders still willing to lend up to 90 percent of value for jumbos under $400,000, has offices in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut and Virginia.
Even so, jumbo borrowers should not overlook the chance to grab a lower-cost conforming loan where feasible, said Mr. Havemann of HSH. This may be easier than expected, he said, now that Fannie Mae has lifted its maximum to $202,300, up $11,000 from $191,250 last year.
As a result, anyone who needed a jumbo loan when originally buying the home may now qualify for a conforming loan, especially if a significant amount of principal has since been paid down. "Or, you could buy down the balance to $202,300 by putting some cash in yourself," suggested Mr. Havemann.
Finally, anyone buying a co-op apartment in an exclusive Fifth Avenue or Park Avenue building that does not allow shares to be pledged as collateral can rest assured that the generally tighter lending climate should not adversely affect them.
These noncollaterized jumbo loans are still being made to high-net-worth people, reports Barbara Fox, president of the Fox Residential Group, Manhattan real estate brokers specializing in more expensive properties. Ms. Fox said that in December she had two buyers who took out such loans with ease. However, as in better times, the borrowers must normally establish a solid banking relationship with the lender before such a loan will be considered.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Orange County Condos;
Sales Without Giveaways

 BODY:
The region's sickly economy has sent many home developers scrambling for buyers, with some resorting to such last-resort sales measures as auctions and deep discounts.
But the builder of a condominium community in Orange County, N.Y., is trying to buck the trend by opening his project with low prices designed to bring in bargin-hunting buyers. The units in the Windsor Crest complex in New Windsor start at $107,900 for a two-bedroom apartment and go up to $139,900 for a three-bedroom residence. With the first, 46-unit phase of development nearly completed, 9 residences have been sold. 
 "We have been selling to first-time buyers and people looking for new homes," said Michael Landau, president of New Hilltop Development Corporation of Fort Lee, N.J., the company building the complex.
The 22-acre community is on Route 32 just south of Union Avenue and four miles south of Newburgh. The first phase includes 16 apartments and 30 multilevel town-house-style units. The apartments range in size from 1,150 to 1,350 square feet and in price from $107,900 to $124,900. The town houses, which have three bedrooms and two and a half baths, range in size from 1,650 to 1,750 square feet, not including the garages and basements, and are priced from $137,900 to $139,900.
The residences were designed by the architectural firm of Denker & Bodnar of Nyack, N.Y.. They are in a traditional pitched-roof style with decorative features like window shutters. The recreational amenities include a clubhouse, a pool and tennis courts. The plan calls for a total of 149 residences.
Occupancy is expected to begin at the end of the month and completion depends on the pace of demand.

HEADLINE: Jumping the Barriers to a Refinancing

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
HARRY LeFEVRE will receive an extra $12,000 this year -- without a raise, overtime or moonlighting. The 41-year-old high school teacher from Amawalk, N.Y., will merely refinance his home.
"We wanted to look at a way to improve our cash flow," said Mr. LeFevre, who is trading his 9.87 percent, 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage for a 4.25 percent, one-year adjustable-rate loan. Closing costs and points, about $10,000, will be rolled into the lifetime cost of the mortgage. 
 "And now, by refinancing, I'm saving $1,025 a month in mortgage payments," he said.
Spurred by the sharp drop in mortgage rates over the last year, Mr. LeFevre and millions of other Americans are rushing to convert their mortgages into shorter or longer terms and usually with lower -- often dramatically lower -- monthly payments.
But a large percentage of homeowners seeking refinacing, as many as half in some parts of the New York region, are discovering that they do not immediately qualify because their income has declined, their indebtedness has risen or the value of their home has fallen.
Even some of these homeowners, however, are paying the extra amounts of cash necessary to lock in low long-term interest rates on the one-family homes, condominiums and co-op apartments that many of them bought in the high-interest 80's.
"In those situations where the appraisal comes in lower than required, the borrower has the option of paying down their mortgage, and I would say in 50 percent of the cases, they are doing that, when they have the money to do it," said Bruce R. Lublin, president of Homerica, a mortgage broker in Harrison, N.Y.
In the past, when homes were generally increasing in value, the old "2-2-2" formula was the prime way to determine whether it made financial sense to refinance. The numbers meant that if borrowers had been in their home at least two years, intended to stay at least two more and refinanced at a rate at least two points lower than their current mortgage rate, then refinancing was practical.
Today, though, those guidelines are more flexible and depend in large part on an individual's circumstances. Homeowners who qualify for refinancing should calculate how much they will pay in closing costs, fees and points -- a point is 1 percent of the amount borrowed. Then they should figure how much their monthly mortgage payments will drop and how long it will take before their monthly savings cover the refinancing costs.
IF, as in Mr. LeFevre's case, the costs are recouped in the first year, then how long he stays in the home is irrelevant. If, however, a homeowner plans to stay in a home no more than five years and expects it to take three years to recoup the refinancing costs, it might not make financial sense.
"We have had people refinance when the rate was less than 2 percent, 1.5 percent or less," Mr. Lublin said. "If we could get them in for a no-point loan and we kept the closing costs to a minimum, then we have seen cases when it made sense for people with only a 1 percent drop."
The lesson in this for homeowners who want to seize the opportunity to cut their borrowing costs is to analyze carefully, get professional advice, be persistent and shop around.
What one lender may not do, another might. The drop in rates may not produce for everyone the dramatic savings achieved by Mr. LeFevre, but a refinancing may be worth pursuing anyway, even if a new loan requires an additional down payment.
Nationally, according to a Mortgage Bankers Association of America survey of 20 large mortgage banking firms, the number of refinancing applications has risen fivefold since a year ago and 12 times since March 1990. About 1.5 million households saved $3 billion in 1991 by refinancing mortgages. About 3 million are expected to refinance this year and save $6 billion.
Thomas M. Holloway, a senior economist with the association, termed the volume of refinancing activity "extraordinary." He noted that more than 70 percent of all loan applications in January nationally are for refinancing rather than for original mortgages, compared to the average a year ago of about 29 percent.
He said that the flood of refinancing started after Dec. 20, when the Federal Reserve Board cut by a full percentage point its discount rate, the rate it charges member banks for loans. He added that the volume has been especially strong in the last three weeks because many borrowers waited until after the holidays to apply. He also said a small "up-tic" in interest rates during the week of Jan. 17 appeared to signal that the decline in interest rates may have bottomed out.
"People are saying that now may be the time to go," Mr. Holloway said.
Interest rates, now at an 18-year low, have been falling steadily, for the most part, since the mid-80's. The national average for a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage has dropped from a high of 12.05 percent in July 1984 to 5.92 percent in January, according to preliminary figures released by HSH Associates in Butler, N.J. The rate on a 30-year, fixed-mortgage has dropped from 14.74 percent in July 1984 to 8.34 percent last month.
HSH Associates, which surveys 2,000 lenders around the country, also found 370 banks and brokers offering 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages at 8 percent or less and 180 offering adjustables at 5 percent or lower.
Besides sparking a boom in refinancings, the lower interest rates nudged up home sales by 0.9 percent in December over the previous month. "Since the drop in interest rates, we have seen more buyers and refinancings, I being one of them," said Carol Rothe, a vice president of the William Higgins real estate agency in Hillsdale, N.J.
HOMERICA, which currently charges 4.25 percent on its one-year adjustable-rate mortgage, has been offering the lowest rates in the nation for the last several weeks. It also charges borrowers 3.25 points for the loan. Mr. Lublin said his office has been getting literally thousands of calls, 90 percent of them inquiries about refinancing. "We are inundated," he said.
Elsewhere, the Dime Savings Bank in Manhattan has been receiving 4,000 to 5,000 calls a week inquiring about refinancing, compared to a weekly average a year ago of about 1,000 calls. Moreover, 83 percent of the residential mortgages it processed in the first half of January were refinancings. A year ago, the figure was about 20 percent.
"We have had significant refinance activity for the last quarter, especially since about early October," said David J. Totaro, a senior vice president and chief marketing officer at the bank.
Mr. LeFevre, who refinanced at Homerica, said his monthly mortgage payments will drop from $1,930 to $905 during the first year of the loan, which can be converted to a fixed-rate mortgage during the third, fourth or fifth year. With a 2 percent cap on the amount the interest rate can increase or decrease, the highest amount he will pay during the second year will be $1,130. Thus in the first two years he stands to save at least $21,000.
Though in some instances, points and closing costs are paid at the time of closing, Mr. LeFevre's 3.25 points, or $5,980, and $4,000 in closing costs are being paid over the life of the 30-year, $184,000 loan, which also has a 6 percent lifetime cap, meaning the most he will ever pay will be 10.25 percent.
"He's making it back in the first year," Mr. Lublin said, referring to the points and closing costs.
Although the super-low, one-year adjustable rates may be the most eye-grabbing, they do not appear to be attracting the most interest from customers.
"The one-year adjustable is popular with first-time buyers, not for refinancing," said Mr. Totaro of the Dime Savings Bank, which is offering a one-year, adjustable-rate mortgage at 5.5 percent with no points and a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage at 8.12 percent with 1.5 points. The bank's 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has an interest rate of 8.625, with 1.25 points.
"People are trying to get into a fixed-rate for the 15-year and the 30-year," he added. "If they can't get into a fixed-rate, they are trying for either a three-year or a five-year adjustable."
Andrew Zartolas Jr., a senior vice president at Westport Bank and Trust in Westport, Conn., said that mortgages called "7-23's" are also popular. These are fixed for the first 7 years and then adjusted for the last 23 years to the 10-year average of Treasury bill rates.
"A lot of people don't anticipate being in their homes for seven years," he said. "And, for them, this is a good opportunity for good savings for seven years. And since T-bill rates aren't that volatile, it's a chance worth taking."
Most borrowers are refinancing to lower their monthly mortgage payments. Some, however, are arranging the new loans to consolidate other debts or incur new ones. For example, Noel Nichols of Norwalk, Conn., switched from a 13.75, fixed-rate, $107,000 mortgage that he took out in 1983 for a 9.12 percent 30-year, fixed-rate with no points at $122,000. His monthly payment, $982, will stay the same, but he borrowed $12,000, the interest on which will be tax-deductible, to buy a car. The refinancing cost him $1,800 for legal and other fees.
"I had been intending to do this, but the uncertainty over my employment situation made it difficult," said Mr. Nichols, who is a financial consultant.
Homeowners are finding that there are many barriers to refinancing. First, there are new qualifying restrictions imposed by the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, which buys loans made by banks and other lenders. Fannie Mae now calculates a borrower's ability to pay at a minimum of 7 percent even if the borrower finds a lender offering a lower adjustable rate mortgage.
Moreover, if a borrower's down payment is less than 25 percent, the ability to pay may be computed at two points higher than the offered rate. Thus, if a borrower found a one-year, adjustable-rate mortgage offered at 6 percent, the approval would be based on his ability to pay 8 percent.
A buyer would not pay at the higher rate but would have to show he could do so if it became necessary. The additional percentage points give Fannie Mae added assurance that the borrower would be able to meet the payments if the interest rate rose. Adjustable loans usually are capped to limit rate increases to two percentage points in a year.
MORE problematic than higher ability-to-pay levels may be drops in appraised property values, higher household debt or lower family income. Mr. Totaro said that 60 percent of those making telephone inquiries to the Dime Savings Bank either didn't qualify or were only shopping for rates. And as many as half of the applicants have a problem with a decline in their property's value.
Suppose, for example, that to buy a $300,000 house, someone put down $60,000 and took out a $240,000 mortgage. If the house declines in value to $240,000, the most the owner would be able to refinance would be $192,000, since most banks will not let a loan exceed 80 percent of a house's appraisal value.
"A lot of customers are coming in here very surprised their homes are no longer worth what they paid for them, and, in some cases, their mortgage value is higher than the value of the home now," Mr. Totaro said. "Primarily condo and co-op owners are having this problem."
R. Frank Gooden, owner of First Merchants, a mortgage lender, in Brooklyn, said that owners of property bought between 1986 and 1990 often run into problems with refinancing, especially if the down payment was less than 25 percent. "It depends on the location," he said. "But in some places the appraised value could have dropped 25 to 30 percent."
"What we tell people in that situation," he added, "is if they expect to be in their homes more than four to five years, given the low interest rate, it does make sense to pay down the mortgage."
TOUGHER credit restrictions can also be troublesome, particularly for homeowners who bought with easy-to-obtain, no-verification loans, which were popular in the mid-1980's. Lenders of those high-interest loans did not check the income or assets of borrowers.
Renuka Chainani, for instance, bought her $136,000 studio apartment in Battery Park City in Lower Manhattan in 1987 with a no-verification, 11.25 percent mortgage from the Dime Savings Bank. When she inquired about refinancing last fall, she was told that because she was late on her student-loan payments to another bank, she would not qualify.
"I could get a mortgage four years ago, but now my credit isn't good enough to refinance," she said.
For those who qualify for refinancing, the surge in applications has increased processing time markedly. Mr. LeFevre, for example, applied in November and is scheduled to close later this month.
"We're on fire -- we're seeing record applications, and 91 percent of them are refinancings," said Alan J. Cicchetti, a senior vice president at the Connecticut National Mortgage Company in Hartford.
According to a Mortgage Bankers of America survey, application processing time has increased by 20 days, to 50 days. It also showed that virtually all of the 20 lenders surveyed have employees working on overtime or have hired temporary staff to handle the overload of applications. About half of them have also added telephone lines, increased office space and hired additional permanent staff.
"We have customers just showing up without calling first because they can't get through," Mr. Lublin said. "It's incredible."

The 40-Year Mortgage
 
Question: I have heard that a bank in California offers 40-year mortgages. Is it possible to get such a home loan in this area? . . . S.G. Belwood, Manhattan
 
Answer: Maybe. Elizabeth Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Service, a mortgage brokerage in Manhattan, knows of no New York or regional lender that currently offers 40-year loans. However, both the Bowery Savings Bank and Great Western Bank offer these loans. Both are lenders based in California with operations in New York City. 
 "Essentially, the 40-year loan is like other loans," said Mrs. Scott, "except that the payments are amortized over a 40-year period instead of the 15, 20 or 30 years of the typical home loan."
Mrs. Scott said that there are advantages and disadvantages in the 40-year mortgage. The main advantage is that the loan carries a lower monthly payment than more conventional mortgages. But the 40-year loan ends up costing significantly more over the long run.
Take for example, a $100,000 mortgage that carries an 8.5 percent interest rate. The monthly payments for this mortgage on a 30-year term would be about $769 while the monthly payments on the same loan with a 40-year term would be about $733. But over the life of the loan, the cost of borrowing the $100,000 for 30 years would be $276,840 and, for 40 years, would be $75,000 more, or $351,840.
Also, Mrs. Scott said, some lenders that offer 40-year mortgages put more stringent prepayment penalties on these loans.
"The 40-year mortgage is almost an all-interest loan in the beginning," said Mrs. Scott, "so the loan is probably most useful for a borrower who could use the advantage of the lower monthly payments but does not expect to own their home for a long time."
 
Assessments in Co-op
 
Question: I am a shareholder in a co-op. Last year, for the first time, the co-op board assessed each apartment owner $50 for the employee Christmas fund. In the past I have contributed to a fund on a voluntary basis.
I can see nothing in the bylaws or proprietary lease that requires shareholders to make these contributions. Is it legal for the money to be raised through an assessment? . . . Samuel Galewitz, Rye, N.Y.
 
Answer: It is, according to Ronald A. Sher, a lawyer who practices in White Plains.
"Presuming that the co-ops bylaws or proprietary lease gives the board the authority to implement assessments," said Mr. Sher, "then a holiday bonus for employees could constitute a legitimate expense for which the board could assess the shareholders."
However, it is more usual, Mr. Sher said, for a holiday bonus to be part of a co-op's regular expense budget and not a special assessment.
 
Rent Increases
 
Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment and I received notices about the Rent Guidelines Board increases. It says that the allowable increase on a two-year lease is 6.5 percent and that it is 4 percent for one-year leases.
It seems to me that I would pay more money -- 13 percent -- if I took a two-year lease than I would if I took two one-year leases even if the next increase for the one-year lease is higher than it is now. Is this true? . . . Ann Thornburgh, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. The 6.5 percent currently allowed for leases signed between Oct. 1, 1991, and Sept. 30, 1992, is for both years, not for each of two years in the lease term.
Joseph D'Agosta, an assistant commissioner at the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which oversees rent-stabilized housing, said the rent increase system is designed so that tenants save money by taking two-year leases rather than consecutive one-year leases.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: City College;
A Case of Terra-Cotta Failure

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
THE 19th-century architect George B. Post had an engineering degree, excellent credentials and a reputation for sober, conservative designs.
So up at City College they are still wondering what happened at the turn of the century when Post used unproved technology for Shepard Hall, City College's main building of 1907 -- which has become the largest example of terra-cotta failure in New York City and perhaps the country. 
 Now architects, engineers and workmen are swarming over the landmark's exterior and the total cost of their repairs will exceed $200 million -- over $600 a square foot.
City College was established in 1847 and soon built a large, neo-Gothic building at the southeast corner of 23d Street and Lexington Avenue. But by the 1890's, the city grew up around the site and enrollment increased and City College -- like New York University and Columbia College -- began to look for a campus farther uptown. The trustees eventually settled on a rocky plateau running from 138th to 140th Streets, from Amsterdam Avenue to St. Nicholas Terrace.
When Post won the design competition he had had 25 years of experience with everything from tenements to mansions and skyscrapers and his firm was considered a leader in the profession.
He designed a group of buildings in the collegiate Gothic style of which the centerpiece was the main building, later named Shepard Hall.
In form, Shepard Hall is like a giant cathedral: a front with two towers faces the campus, behind which the "nave" is terminated by a huge, square, central tower, something like that over the crossing in a Gothic church. Two curving wings of classrooms extend out from the sides.
For the sake of economy, the buildings were faced with Manhattan schist taken from the site and trimmed with bright, white terra cotta. The dark, rough, rocky schist and the bright, smooth, angular terra cotta form a startling combination.
At the time of the City College commission, glazed terra cotta had been only recently introduced and was considered a versatile material -- it looked like stone, but could be mass produced and was light in weight.
Most of the facades at City College were bearing walls, instead of masonry veneers supported on steel framing, and Post used the terra cotta as if it were stone, piling one block on top of another, sometimes with no real backing or other stiffener, especially in the big, square central tower.
But terra cotta is not like stone -- it cracks easily, is not nearly as strong and its hollows easily trap water which can freeze and expand.
The current work is being supervised by the Stein Partnership. An associate, Christopher Tavener, said that patchwork repairs indicate that problems with the terra cotta arose decades ago. In recent years, the main tower walls have shifted dramatically -- and with no steel skeleton, the entire structure depended on their stability.
The Stein Partnership has had to redesign the building from the inside out, install new concrete walls and floors, and remove 12,000 pieces of terra cotta -- so far. These have been replaced with a hollow material called Design-Cast, a cast of cement reinforced with fiberglass carefully supervised for color and glaze. This in turn is bolted onto an internal spiderweb of steel so that one piece may be removed in the future without jeopardizing the ones above. Ultimately, says Mr. Tavener, all 50,000 elements will have to be replaced.
IT'S a 10- or 15-year project, costing at least $210 million, according to Robert McLaughlin, project manager for the owner, the Dormitory Authority of New York State.
Terra-cotta failure is familiar now in projects like the Woolworth Building, where 26,000 units had to be replaced in the 1970's because water penetration rusted internal steel pins and cracked the blocks. In the strictest sense, such a failure is not one of design but of maintenance.
But the case of Shepard Hall shows an experienced architect using a new material in new ways on a large scale and apparently without considering the possibility that the material might not hold up. He left little margin for safety or evidence of awareness that something new was under way.
This upends notions of older times as periods in which builder and architect worked in unison with tried and true techniques to build structures that could last for centuries. In the case of Shepard Hall, Post's terra-cotta experiment will be completely gone by its 100th birthday.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: The Convention High;
For Manhattan's Hotels, No Fear of July Doldrums

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
SIX months from now, New York City, traditionally a Democratic town anyway, will be positively swarming with Democrats. Local Republicans may find that daunting, but Manhattan hotel operators see a lip-smacking prospect.
They are preparing to play host to the 30,000-or-so delegates, reporters and their ancillaries -- and, of course, tourists -- that the Democratic National Convention, which begins on July 13, will bring to town. 
 And, they are sending a strong signal to the Democratic National Convention Committee that they will do whatever it takes -- extend room-service hours, provide extra meeting space, what have you -- to make the visitors feel at home. "The hotels have been incredibly accommodating," said Mario Cooper, the committee's manager.
Indeed, the operators of the 56 hotels that have contracted with the committee to provide 18,000 rooms for five nights -- most at corporate rates or lower -- are spending millions on fancy facelifts. Their fervent wish is that the convention will provide both a momentary adrenalin rush for hotels, which rarely have more than 50 percent occupancy rate in July, and a longer-range public relations shot in the arm for the city at large.
"We're banking that what is good for the city is good for the real estate industry," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York.
Clearly, everyone is hoping for a replay of the happy experiences of 1976. Back then, when New York's economy seemed in even more dire shape than it is now, the confluence of the Democratic National Convention and the Bicentennial celebration was enough to send spirits and bottom lines soaring. Tourists, politicos and reporters poured into town, spending an estimated $20 million and sending out signals to the rest of the world that New York, despite its problems, was an exciting, vibrant place.
The rekindled interest in New York was so strong that tourism, which had been faltering, rose steadily for five years straight, succumbing only to the effects of the soaring dollar and the recession of 1981.
Hotels are hoping that the combination of the Columbus Quincentennial, with its attendant Operation Sail, and the convention will provide an equal infusion of cash and enthusiasm. Throughout the city, they are whipping themselves into physical shape.
The ITT Sheraton Corporation is spending $200 million to revamp the Sheraton New York and Sheraton Manhattan hotels. The U.N. Plaza-Park Hyatt Hotel is spending $30 million to redo one of its two towers, a feat that includes renovating about 200 rooms, the lobby, the health club, even the sprinkler system.
The Ramada Hotel Pennsylvania at Madison Square Garden, which will spend $4 million to $6 million on renovations this year, redid its lobby four months ago, is working on its ballrooms, and is redoing some bathrooms, carpeting and wallpaper.
Loew's has spent $17 million to refurbish the Regency, $26 million to spiff up the Loew's New York, and a total of $10 million to refurbish its two Eighth Avenue hotels, the Ramada and the Howard Johnson Plaza. Loew's insists the fix-up activity has nothing to do with the convention.
Indeed, many of the renovations would have proceeded, convention or no. But many have been crunched to be ready before July. "The convention has sped up what was already on drawing boards," said Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City.
IT has also inspired some construction on its own. ITT Sheraton always planned to renovate the Sheraton New York and Sheraton Manhattan (new names for the Sheraton Centre and City Squire) as soon as it bought out the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, its former partner.
But Robert W. Motley, director of marketing for the two hotels, doubts that the Sheraton New York would have built its Presidential Suite, a 3,600-square-foot duplex carved out of eight rooms, had the hotel not been named, along with the New York Hilton, as convention headquarters.
"I don't think we would have taken eight rooms permanently out of inventory if we didn't expect to hold some highly publicized convention events there," Mr. Motley said.
Indeed, the push for publicity is industry wide. Kenneth I. Walles, general manager of the Ramada Pennsylvania, is talking about a cocktail reception in its Presidential suite just for the media. The New York Hilton is planning "a week full of festivities," said Lola Price, a spokeswoman.
The two Sheraton hotels are adopting a convention theme -- red, white and blue hats for staff, and such -- 60 days before the convention, in hopes of advance publicity.
The U.N. Plaza-Park Hyatt Hotel is pointing out to its convention guests that, if they stay over on a Saturday night, they can get cheaper air fares. The hotel will, in fact, let any delegates extend their stay at the convention rate for as long as they wish. "It's July, our normal occupancy would be 55 percent, so if someone wants to stay here for three weeks, that's great," said Pamela Malkani, director of marketing and sales.
To help spread the welcome mat, the New York 92 Host Committee, a privately financed group that exists expressly to show New York off at its best, is arranging for volunteers to meet delegates at airports and shepherd them through the city. It is preparing welcome kits and is working with the hotels to set up extra information desks.
"If we present New York in its best light, it will have an impact on our hospitality industry for years to come," said Leslie Marcus, the Host Committee's executive director.
Some unpleasantnesses may yet dim that light, though.
Ramada Hotel Pennsylvania, for example, has contracted to rent 1,200 rooms to media people, many of whom will want to come in a few days earlier to do pre-convention stories. Television crews in particular will want to run cables, set up lights, and otherwise prepare meeting spaces for press conferences and interviews.
THE problem is that from July 4 to 11, the hotel is headquarters to Esto 92, an Estonian convention that is expected to bring some 15,000 Estonians to Manhattan. The hotel and the city tried to persuade the Estonians to change their dates, or at least turn back some meeting space earlier, all to no avail.
"Maybe we would have considered changing the dates for decent monetary considerations, but they weren't offered," said Urmas Karner, president of the Esto 92 Committee Inc. The result is that the Convention Committee may have to house early arrivals from the press and electronic media elsewhere, while the hotel must be prepared to "turn on a dime," as Mr. Walles put it, to wire up meeting rooms after the Estonians leave.
The city's nonunion hotels would probably love to have such overbooking problems. The Convention Committee will not use them to house delegations or as a site for special events. ("We are a union party, after all," said Tina Flournoy, the committee's general counsel.) So they are trying to drum up business of their own.
The Marriott Marquis says it has already booked more than 1,200 of its 1,900 rooms for government dignitaries, both domestic and foreign, and foreign media representatives.
The Embassy Suites, which doesn't have Marriott's international cachet, is embarking on a huge direct mail program to foreign reporters. It is taking booths at international hotel shows. And it is quizzing international reporters as to what might entice their colleagues. Among the suggestions being considered: facsimile machines in each room, transportation to Madison Square Garden, mini-business centers in some suites.
"We're still looking for the million-dollar idea that will sell the hotel out," said Kevin J. Breen, director of marketing.
Indirectly, the New York Convention & Visitors Bureau may do that for him. Already, the bureau is devising street fairs, tours and other special events that will tie together the convention, Op Sail and the Columbus Quincentennial celebrations. And, Steven E. Trombetti, vice president of communications, has prepared a video news release on the "democratic process in action" that will make it clear that convention delegates and entourages will not use up even half the city's 67,000 hotel rooms.
"We have to avoid the sold out syndrome that always accompanies world fairs, Olympics and other major events," Mr. Trombetti said. "We must make sure no one thinks there's no room at the inn."

HEADLINE: In the Region: Connecticut and Westchester;
In Fairfield County, the Cachet Persists

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
FAIRFIELD COUNTY'S appeal to home buyers, even during real estate slumps, has been demonstrated clearly in this recession.
While the county's home market has suffered free-falling prices and overloaded inventories, it has been sustained better than most areas by a stream of buyers seeking its cachet and its proximity to New York, particularly now that its properties are attainable at lower cost, many of them through foreclosure. 
 Statistics gathered by The Commercial Record, a Connecticut business journal, show a rise of 8.03 percent in Fairfield County residential sales from October 1990 through October 1991. The only county in Connecticut to experience a gain, it eased the statewide decline in sales to only 2.8 percent.
Fairfield also showed the smallest drop in house prices, from a median of $230,000 to $225,000, or 2.17 percent. Statewide, the median price fell 3.03 percent, from $148,500 to $144,000. Sales in the mid-range of $150,000 to $300,000 exceeded all others in Fairfield in 1990 and 1991. A total of 8,207 residences were sold in the county through October 1991 for a total volume of $2.26 billion, up over the previous year's figures of 7,286 residences for a total of $2.03 billion.
Robert Vossler, president of the Home Buyers Assistance Corporation of Westport, a relocater, said some Fairfield communities did not do so well. "Bridgeport will continue to have difficulties and Danbury and Shelton are slow," he said. "Because of the drop in prices and interest rates people who would normally opt for Shelton can now afford Wilton and Westport."
William Raveis, president of the statewide Raveis Realty, based in the Town of Fairfield, said: "Fairfield County is always an indicator. If historical data hold true, the rest of the state will follow. It's noteworthy that sales are up in spite of the United Parcel Service move to Atlanta, leaving 300 houses."
Stanley Klein, president of Empire Realty in Greenwich, does not share the view of Fairfield as bellwether. "It is less affected by recession than the rest of the state and recovers earlier," he said. "Mortgage rates are not as significant here. People with mortgages at 45 to 50 percent of purchase price are usually overqualifed."
Sales in Greenwich, which his company tracks, were up by 40 percent in 1991 over 1990. "The reason is simple," he said. "Prices are down." The average among 644 sales in 1991 was $780,469, down 3.2 percent from 1990, when 459 homes were sold with an average price of $806,086. "Sales were also down in 1990 from 1989," he added, noting that it was the first time in 40 years that Greenwich had a two-year decline in prices.
Condominium prices in 1990 averaged $303,726, declining 5.8 percent last year to $285,989. "In 1989 there was a 20 percent decline," Mr. Klein said. He expects condominium prices to begin rising in the second quarter, while home prices will continue to slide.
Stamford prices have fallen about 8 percent, says Tom Purcell, director of the Stamford Board of Realtors. "The average home price in 1990 was $340,000," he said. "In 1991 it was $330,000. We are up 8 to 10 percent in sales of houses and condos for 1991, with 995 sales compared to 870 sales in 1990."
Renters are choosing not to buy until they are more secure in their jobs, he said. "The companies that are coming in are smaller," he added, "and they don't offer the relocation perquisites that big corporations used to give."
Pamela Schwanke, manager of the William Pitt Realty office in Stamford, is optimistic about what she called "our best year in recent memory." Dollar volume for 1991 increased 52 percent over 1990, and the number of sales jumped 43 percent, she said.
In 1990, the Pitt organization, which has offices in Fairfield and lower Litchfield Counties, had 50 foreclosure sales for a total of $8 million. In 1991, there were 133 such sales, totaling $25.8 million, and more are expected this year.
"The lowest price was $100,000 for a 3-bedroom house in Norwalk, marketed for six months at $169,000 before foreclosure," said Michael O'Dwyer of Pitt's foreclosure division. At the high end was a six-bedroom Greenwich home listed for two years at $3.2 million and sold in foreclosure for $1.8 million.
Prudential Connecticut Realty, headquartered in West Hartford, sold 87 foreclosed properties statewide in 1991, and currently holds 200 listings. "In 1990 we had none," said Julia Strayer, vice president for marketing. "Our sales are up 42 percent in Fairfield County and down 2 percent in Hartford County for the year."
REALTORS are resorting to extraordinary means to sell corporate- and bank-owned houses more quickly. Many of them subscribe to the services of Home Marketing Associates of Fairfield and Showhomes of Westport. Both firms install temporary tenants and their furniture in vacant homes on the theory that a warm, attractively furnished, lived-in house sells faster and at a better price.
Roger Jewell and nine rooms of his furniture are currently ensconced in a Show homes house in Rowayton. "They match you and your furniture with the style of the house," Mr. Jewell said. He has lived, temporarily, in Westport, New Canaan and Wilton, where he occupied a house listed at more than $1 million, paying $750 in rent to Show homes. He is responsible for moving costs in and out, utilities and maintenance, leaving the owner free of most expenses except property taxes. Owner, tenant and Showhomes share insurance costs.
"We have 70 houses in our Connecticut inventory," said Noreen Dwyer-Kimball, marketer for Showhomes, a nationwide company. "That's up more than 65 percent from last year."
Home Marketing Associates has most of its 48 homes in Fairfield County. "Last year 70 percent of our properties sold in 30 days," said Joanne Paone, a company partner.
Another service aimed at making houses more salable is offered by Homestagers of Westport and Farmington. Interior designers rearrange the owner's possessions and supply written recommendations for repairs and cosmetic improvements for around $175.
When 30-year fixed-rate mortgages edged up a half point to 8 1/2 percent late last month "our brokers' phones did not stop ringing," said Carolyn Weber, vice president of regional development for Century 21. "Customers who had been waiting for lower rates were nudged into action. The scary part is how long can these rates hold?"

HEADLINE: 'Florio II': Remaking an Image

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

 BODY:
AFTER one of the stormiest two-year openings to an administration in memory, Gov. Jim Florio is looking to recapture the public support he lost through enactment of an ambitious tax program in 1990 and to position himself for a possible bid for re-election in 1993.
The Governor said he was taking a page out of his book as a Congressman, when he met with patrons of a diner in Camden to get the public pulse, and would increase his travels around the state during the next two years.
Perhaps never before in the state has a chief executive entered office with a clearer idea of what he wanted to do and then managed to alienate the very people he was trying to help by the manner in which he achieved his goals. 
 After two successive general elections in which Democratic candidates were punished largely because of voter anger over the Governor's programs, Florio-watching has become a principal preoccupation around the state. Political observers and business leaders admit to being fascinated by the prospect of seeing how the Governor deals with a Legislature controlled by Republicans for the first time in decades while he reaches out for public support. A battle over the budget could provide a first test.
Bruce Coe, the president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, is among those who say that Mr. Florio is showing signs of curbing his penchant for "charging off with solutions to problems before people are even aware of them."
Mr. Coe referred to the Governor as "Florio II" in a recent interview and said he believed that the necessity of working with a Republican legislative majority large enough to override the Governor's vetoes would force Mr. Florio to seek public support for his positions. 
"At the beginning of his administration, the Democratic-controlled Legislature was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Governor's office," Mr. Coe said. "We really had only two branches of government, the judiciary and the executive.
"And while the Governor did an excellent job of identifying the issues, the solutions he pushed through, whether good, bad or mixed, got lost in the manner in which they were done."
"How do you pour millions of more dollars into education and get every teacher in the state mad at you?" Mr. Coe added. "Or move to cut property taxes and have social economists express disdain for what you're doing?"
Mr. Florio's inability to sell his program was underscored in the recent legislative elections. The program included increasing income tax rates for the wealthiest wage earners to provide rebates for less affluent property-tax payers, increasing school aid and adding a penny to the sales tax to close a stubborn budget gap largely created by the national recession. Voters who benefited by the tax changes overwhelmingly voted for Republicans who opposed Mr. Florio's program.
Mr. Florio's aggressive hands-on style also generated some grumbling among members of the administration. Mr. Coe said one Cabinet officer complained to him that he could not talk to Mr. Coe or anyone outside the administration "without first clearing it with three honchos from the inner sanctum."
In an interview in his office, Mr. Florio agreed that "for the first year or year and a half, my efforts to change things led to perhaps too much control." But he said this was a reaction to a lack of accountability that he and a committee of business leaders he had appointed found when he took office.
"They were astounded at the lack of controls," Mr. Florio said, citing a proliferation of the number of state cars assigned to public employees as an example.
He also said that in his 26 years in public office he had never seen the level of pessimism that was abroad today. People who hope for a better future are confronted by forces that seem geared to prevent progress, he said, and in that atmosphere, attempts by government at problem solving are often met with suspicion.
Mr. Florio has begun moving around the state, holding town meetings and listening to local concerns. He has also started a program called "Capital for a Day," which will see him set up a mini-seat of government complete with Cabinet officials in various municipalities around the state. The idea is to give residents a look at the workings of their government and to explain to them what he is trying to accomplish.
He said the public outreach was already bearing fruit. "After a recent meeting, a woman came up to me and said, 'Things are not as black or white as I thought; they're much more complicated than I realized,' " Mr. Florio said.
 
Contention Draws Support
 The Governor's contention that New Jersey is in better financial shape than other states in the Northeast, as evidenced by its triple-A bond rating, and doing more than other states in meeting its infrastructure needs was supported by Charles H. Marciante, president of the State A.F.L.-C.I.O.
"If you look around the Northeast and the nation, you'll see we're in better shape than almost any other state," Mr. Marciante said. "The Governor has put together tons of dough for infrastructure improvements that is easing the burden of the recession and is designed to carry us through to 1993."
Mr. Marciante said Mr. Florio "has been an ace," not only because of the construction program but also because he signed a minimum wage bill that will set a $5.05-an-hour minimum wage in New Jersey on April 1, while the Federal minimum wage remains at $4.85.
Mr. Marciante also praised the Governor for "putting the Legislature's feet to the fire" by saying he would not sign an extension of the Uncompensated Care Trust Fund beyond the end of July. The fund pays the cost of hospital care for the indigent by adding a surcharge to bills of paying patients. Mr. Florio's position will force lawmakers to look for some alternate way of paying for care of the indigent.
Two initiatives by Mr. Florio's predecessor, Gov. Thomas H. Kean, including the creation of the Transportation Trust Fund and revision of the Unemployment Compensation Fund, have figured in improvements for the state's hourly workers. The transportation fund has provided some of the money for the construction program, and the state's healthy unemployment fund enabled the state to extend unemployment benefits to idled workers before the Federal Government authorized its extension.
The unemployment fund contains $2.5 billion and generates $250 million in interest annually at a time when other states' funds are being depleted, Mr. Coe said.
 
Cooperation Pledged
 Mr. Florio has pledged his cooperation to the Republican Legislature, as long as it does not entail giving in on a matter of principle. Though Mr. Coe said he believed that he has seen a calmer, more accommodating Mr. Florio in recent public appearances, others have not been so sure.
Stephen A. Salmore, a professor of political science at Rutgers University and a political consultant to the Republican Party, said that Mr. Florio "has a real chance to make some positive changes, but it all depends on whether he chooses confrontation or compromise, and everything in his background says it will be confrontation."
Some means of accommodation between the administration and the Legislature will have to be found, Mr. Salmore said, since the Republican majorities include many people who are new to public office. While the party is certain to redeem its campaign pledge to roll back the penny increase in the sales tax, deep cuts in government spending will have to be made to offset the $590 million the tax change will cost in addition to hundreds of millions more to close an anticipated budget gap caused by the recession and the use of one-time revenue raisers that helped balance the current $14.7 billion state budget.

 
Budget Sent to Legislature
 Last week, Mr. Florio sent his proposed 1992-93 budget to the Legislature, calling for spending $15.7 billion and counting on revenue from the current 7 percent sales tax. The Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, Republican of Scotch Plains, criticized the Governor for not giving credence to Republican promises to roll the tax back to 6 percent. On Tuesday, Mr. Florio told lawmakers he would sign a tax-cut bill if his budget goals could be met.
Mr. DiFrancesco was happier, however, with Mr. Florio's decision to change the way the state's pension system is carried on the books. The move will increase the value of the system to $29 billion from $24 billion and result in a benefit to the State Treasury of more than $1 billion over the current fiscal year and the next.
On Tuesday, state education officials released revised school-aid figures that provide $341 million in additional money, mostly for middle-income districts. The new aid was generated through the proposed reduction in the state's contribution to the pension system.
Republican leaders said the change would make it easier to cut taxes. In addition, the Republican majority is said to be considering making the sales tax cut effective next Jan. 1, in the middle of the fiscal year, instead of on July 1, when the fiscal year begins. This would cut the anticipated revenue loss in half to about $300 million.
 
Effect of Marches on Trenton
 Mr. Salmore said many of the Republicans in the Legislature were "new and they could become very scared, especially when they see the marches on Trenton and the rallies."
The Presidential election this year could also have a profound effect on Mr. Florio's future, Mr. Salmore said. If a Democrat defeats President Bush, a change in the national agenda would follow that could engender Federal funds for so-called compassionate programs that Mr. Florio could champion.
If Mr. Bush wins re-election, the agenda will remain focused on Republican issues like taxes, budgets and the economy, and the Governor's hands will be tied, Mr. Salmore said. "How can you help people if you can't spend money?" he said.
He said one issue that was certain to reappear was educational financing. "The State Supreme Court left the state with an impossible set of alternatives," Mr. Salmore said.
The court has ordered the state to increase state aid to the poorest school districts and to continue increasing it to keep them on a spending level with the wealthiest districts. Mr. Salmore said the middle-class districts, which are losing aid, "are not going to stand by and let all the aid go to urban districts."
Mr. Salmore said what probably had to emerge was a bipartisan political solution to school financing that the court would accept, or a constitutional amendment to redefine the state's responsibility to provide a thorough and efficient education for all students.
 
Florio 'Mellowing' Seen
 Richard W. Roper, the executive director of the Council on New Jersey Affairs at Princeton University, said Mr. Florio "has mellowed a bit and has not panicked" in the face of his party's political reversal.
Mr. Roper said that the Governor "faces a stiff challenge from the Republican legislative leaders as the agenda is being shaped over the next two years, and his best hope is to take the public policy high ground, lay out the broad themes and program direction and then work closely with the Republican leadership in designing the programs."
He said Mr. Florio's aggressive style in pushing his programs during his first year in office "created powerful enemies who fought him the rest of the way." Although the Governor's tax program does not appear in any real danger of a major repeal because of the economy and the need for revenue, some other initiatives "appear to have unraveled," he said.
The state's auto insurance system continues to produce large deficits despite a major realignment, and the state's tough ban on the sale or possession of assault rifles weathered one attempt by the National Rifle Association to weaken it, but the gun lobby is expected to try again in the current session.
In addition, the education revision that produced increased financing for public schools was cut back by Democrats in the Legislature to provide more money for property tax relief in a futile attempt to hold on to control of the Legislature in the November elections.
The Democrats attempted to repeal the Governor's tax program in the lame-duck session after the elections, but the bills failed to clear the Assembly. Mr. Florio never said he would have signed the bills if they had reached his desk, and he said in his interview that he would never sign anything that would threaten the fiscal integrity of the state or undo his property tax relief and school financing programs.
 
'Guilty of Hypocrisy'
 But he clearly enjoyed watching the Republican lawmakers and state business leaders squirm as the Democrats tried to do what the Republicans said should be done during their campaign, roll back the taxes. "They were guilty of blatant hypocrisy in opposing the tax changes and then saying it would be fiscally irresponsible to repeal them," he said.
Mr. Florio said that the state was positioned to make a strong comeback once the economy rebounded from the recession, and that if the state got "a fair shake" on Federal revenue, the comeback would be dramatic.
He said he was looking forward to working with the Legislature over the next two years. "People need hope, but they also need help," he said.
And he appears to enjoy the prospect of watching the new Republican majority wrestle with knotty problems instead of sniping at proposed solutions from the sidelines. "They won't have the luxury of criticizing any longer," he said.
The Governor said he would "work with anybody" to find solutions, but would continue to veto bills he did not agree with and would stand by his position even if he were eventually overriden.
One such fight may come over the expected attempt to weaken gun control. Mr. Florio said he was not afraid to stand before the voters on that issue.
"That's the democratic process," he said. "It's called accountability."

HEADLINE: State Moves Against '900' Number Schemes

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
WHEN Sherry Haggerty of Newton received a notice in the mail telling her that she had been pre-approved for a gold credit card, she was initially somewhat skeptical. The presence of the familiar Visa and Mastercard logos, however, quelled her skepticism. She called the "900" telephone number printed on the notice.
A short time later, she received a catalogue and a gold plastic card. "The gold card was nothing like a Visa or Mastercard," Ms. Haggerty said. In fact, she said, the card was good only for ordering merchandise from the catalogue itself. And even though she ordered nothing, Ms. Haggerty was nevertheless charged for the card. 
 "It ended up being a scam for a gold card," she said. "But what they don't tell you is how you're going to be billed and that it's going to come on your phone bill, and that you're going to drop dead because your phone bill is $80."
Over the last year, the number of complaints filed by victims of illegal 900 schemes shot up from nearly none to more than 300, said state officials, who suspect that many more are unreported. As a result, the State Attorney General's office and the Division of Consumer Affairs have begun an aggressive assault on operators of illegal telephone marketing schemes.
Their efforts were augmented last month with the passage of a law that sets strict guidelines for operators of 900 numbers in New Jersey. The law, which goes into effect on April 1, requires 900 operators to make detailed disclosure of their rates and services in written advertisements and during calls and allows callers a reasonable time to disconnect without incurring charges.
"We are pursuing frauds in this area as vigorously as we possibly can," said the State Attorney General, Robert J. Del Tufo, who is also chairman of the National Association of Attorneys General Telemarketing Task Force.
 
Penalties or Refunds Paid
 Mr. Del Tufo said that in the last year alone the Division of Consumer Affairs had taken action against 11 companies that were operating 900 lines in New Jersey. Each of those companies has stopped advertising in the state, paid a penalty or provided refunds to consumers.
"It became very clear to me that if you wait until the wrong has occurred, you've lost the game," Mr. Del Tufo said. "You may detect one violation, but by the time you detect it, the defrauder has already taken advantage of thousands of consumers."
The 900 business has quickly grown into a billion-dollar industry, Mr. Del Tufo said. Though most operators of such services are reputable, he said, "there are more people getting into it for the wrong reasons."
Helen M. Pohlig, managing director of the National Association for Information Providers, a trade organization based in Washington, said that her organization supported the aggressive enforcement actions Mr. Del Tufo was taking, but that the organization did not believe that the number of unscrupulous operators was increasing.
"I'm not suggesting that there aren't scam operators out there," she said. "But we believe that we have seen a turnaround and that people who are deciding to get into the business now are truly legitimate providers."
Most 900 businesses provide information or services to consumers who call their "pay per call" numbers. The call is carried over long-distance lines provided by companies like A.T.& T. and MCI Communications. The long-distance carrier charges the company for carrying the call, but the company itself sets the price that the consumer will pay for the call.
Through agreements that the long-distance carriers have with local telephone companies, those charges are included on the consumer's monthly telephone bill. But that, Mr. Del Tufo said, can make it easier for a unscrupulous operator.
 
'Amount of Legitimacy'
 "The fact that the charge comes in on a telephone bill gives it a certain amount of legitimacy," he said.
Ms. Haggerty, for example, immediately paid the charges for the gold card that were included on her monthly telephone bill. "I didn't want to not pay the phone bill and then have them give me a bad credit reputation," she said. "I just paid it. I didn't dispute it with the phone company."
Ms. Haggerty eventually received a refund as a result of action taken by officials against the 900 company.
But New Jersey Bell officials said that if a customer refused to pay charges for a 900 number, the company would remove the charge from the bill and refer it to the long-distance carrier for handling. A customer's telephone service is not disconnected for nonpayment of 900 charges only, nor is the customer's credit rating affected.
The long-distance carriers also try to cooperate with consumers on questionable bills. "We have an agreement with New Jersey Bell to handle customer complaints," said Frank J. Walter, communications manager for MCI Communications. "They have the authority and are instructed to make credits where appropriate."
 
Many Customers Just Pay
 But many consumers, like Ms. Haggerty, simply pay the charges without protest. And that, officials say, is what permits unscrupulous operators to proliferate.
"The question is, why is New Jersey such a prime target?" said Emma Byrne, director of the Division of Consumer Affairs.
Many of the schemes now being worked in the state, Ms. Byrne said, are directly tied to the effects of the recession. Some stratagems, like the one used on Ms. Haggerty, involve offering credit cards or low-interest loans to consumers.
Others, she said, involve "job lines" that offer virtually meaningless promises of employment.
"People who are three missed paychecks away from being able to meet their mortgage payment might be willing to pay $5 and $10 a minute to listen to 'new inside information' on job opportunities," Ms. Byrne said. Unfortunately, she said, the information provided is often just a "recitation of the want ads."
 
Not Told About Cost
 Nancy Erickson, a spokeswoman for the Division of Consumer Affairs, said that one company recently investigated by officials had been distributing fliers urging recipients to call a toll-free 800 number for information on job listings. When consumers called the number, Ms. Erickson said, they were then told to call a 900 number but were not told that the call would cost as much as $24.
After being confronted by state officials, Ms. Erickson said, the company agreed to stop doing 900 business in New Jersey.
Ms. Erickson added that at least 10 900 job lines and several other telephone marketing schemes were currently under investigation.
One company now being investigated, she said, has been sending consumers an official-looking postcard that says that it is the consumer's "last chance" to call and claim a package. The package, Ms. Erickson said, contains "a worthless piece of jewelry."
The scheme, she said, has generated more than 66,000 telephone calls. "They have brought in $670,000 in under three months," Ms. Erickson said.
Louis Jonas, section supervisor in charge of investigations for the division, said that companies using 900 numbers could be investigated if officials received as few as four or five complaints that portrayed a common illegal pattern. In addition, he said, the division will conduct an investigation even without specific complaints.
 
'Not Necessary to Have Victim'
 "It's not necessary to have a victim," he said. "We can move on an advertisement if something in the advertisement doesn't smell right or doesn't look right."
Mr. Jonas said most illicit 900 stratagems fell into a few basic categories. "We pretty much know the most popular ones," he said. "High up there on the list would be the 'free gift, you've won something' scam," like the one described by Ms. Erickson.
And even if the gift or prize isn't worthless, Mr. Jonas said, the practice would still violate the state's Consumer Fraud Act, which prohibits deceptive advertising.
"If you tell me it's a gift, it has to be a gift," Mr. Jonas said. "You can't use it to lure me into a $10 call."
Another common technique used to defraud consumers, he said, involves an offer of a free vacation.
Typically, Mr. Jonas said, such a solicitation requires the consumer to call a 900 number. The call, which can cost $5 a minute or more, usually results in a virtually worthless vacation offer.
"You find out that the room is free, but you have to pay outlandish fees for the air fare," he said.
 
150 Suspicious Numbers
 Mr. Jonas said that officials had accumulated a file of about 150 suspicious 900 numbers in the last year and a half, but because of the large number of companies involved it was impossible to investigate all of them."So we try to be selective and target a company that appears to be hurting a large number of New Jersey consumers," he said.
Mr. Jonas said one of the main difficulties officials had in protecting consumers was keeping ahead of defrauders. "No matter what rules and regulations you come up with, the operators will find a way around them," he said.
Daisy Ottman, a spokeswoman for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, agreed. She said the company ran regular compliance checks to insure that 900 providers met the company's guidelines. "As we become more familiar with some of the subterfuges, we've gotten more sophisticated in our own compliance reviews," she said.
She added that A.T.& T. had shut down a number of 900 providers on its own and also worked with law-enforcement agencies investigating possible fraud claims.
"The minute they notify us of a problem, we take it very seriously," Ms. Ottman said. "We make our records available on demand, and we generally escrow the company's funds."
 
Credit Card Ploy
 Mr. Jonas said that despite the active cooperation of long-distance carriers, some of the illegal ploys continued to flourish.
"The one that bothers me the most is when they hit the poorer people," he said. "And that often turns out to be with the credit card scam."
The credit card ploy, Mr. Jonas said, involves offers of credit cards and even loans to people who have not established credit ratings. Just calling for information can cost as much as $50, he said.
"Sometimes they'll be crying as they tell me their story," he said. "Fifty dollars doesn't sound like much, but when you talk to these people, it's a big chunk for them."
"Sometimes they can't even speak English, or they may be new arrivals in this country," he added. "They seem to have a little more faith in American business than may be warranted."
 
<HBWhat Callers Must Be Told
 One of the last bills passed in the final days of the 1991 legislative session provides sweeping regulation of the state's "900" telephone line industry.
The bill, which was signed into law last month and takes effect on April 1, augments similar Federal legislation that was passed in December. The new state law requires 900 operators in New Jersey to follow strict guidelines when advertising and providing their services.
In all written advertisements, providers must describe the service and its cost, tell minors that parental consent is necessary and list the provider's name and address.
In addition, for all 900 number calls costing more than $5, the law requires the operator to provide a verbal description of the service and its cost, a parental consent instruction to minors and a statement advising callers that they can disconnect after the disclosure without incurring a charge.
The law also prohibits the advertising of 900 services through the use of automatic dialing systems, the offering of services that require the dialing of more than one telephone number for a fee and the providing of services that require the consumer to call another "pay per call" number to claim a prize or gift.
At the bill signing, Gov. Jim Florio said, "With this bill, New Jersey's consumers can now reach for the phone knowing that con artists won't be reaching for their wallets."

HEADLINE: ART;
Russian Works Come to the Forefront

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
WHAT started as the Rutgers University Art Gallery has long since metamorphosed into the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum here, at the corner of George and Hamilton Streets. And, having prospered for 25 years, 21 of them under the direction of Dennis Cate, this repository of prints, painting and sculpture is celebrating its anniversary with a bevy of shows.
Chief among these is "New Directions," so called because the recently acquired collections featured require larger premises. To this end, the museum, propelled by an anonymous gift of $1 million, has embarked on a five-year fund-raising campaign. 
 Of the collections, the one bestowed by George Riabov, a Rutgers alumnus, covers Russian art from the 15th century to the present, contains 1,100 pieces and includes a library of 5,000 books and publications. That donated by Norton and Nancy Dodge numbers more than 5,000 works of contemporary Russian art, the kind banned from public display under Communism. Remember Communism?
Formerly director of the American Institute for Polish Culture, in Miami, Mr. Riabov is now a consultant -- on foreign languages for the Museum of Modern Art, on Russian art for Christie's auction house. Mr. Dodge, a professor emritus of economics at St. Mary's College of Maryland, heads the CASE Museum of Contemporary Russian Art in Exile, which opened in Jersey City a decade or more ago.
How the collectors acquired their treasures during the last 40 or so years is a story that has yet to be told publicly. Their ambition, however, is clear: Rutgers is to be a center for the study of Russian art.
The Riabov excerpt opens with icons and other devotional objects dating from the 15th to the 19th century. All reflect Byzantine influence, except for a double-sided medallion from the 18th century, which is three and a half inches in diameter and depicts scenes from the life of the Virgin. Executed in lace, the design would be extraordinary enough, but it is of rosewood carved into strands scarcely thicker than hairs.
After this comes the lineup of painters, beginning with the Ukrainian-born Ilya Repin (1844 to 1930), a master of anecdote in the grand manner and, though he died in exile (in Finland), generally regarded as a major inspiration to the Social Realists. His picture is of a red-nosed soldier seated at a table playing a balalaika. A beautifully painted scene, it should attract many admirers, now that the illustrative past of Western art is back in favor.
A soldier turned painter, Alexei von Jawlensky (1864 to 1941), started out in the St. Petersburg circle around Repin, then "defected" to the more esthetically advanced climate of Munich, where he was involved for a while with Kandinsky. His "Head of Christ" is a lovely late work in which the thick black lines defining the nose and eyebrows suggest a cross.
Mikhail Larionov (1881 to 1964) and his lifelong mistress, Nathalia Gontcharova (1881 to 1962), are here, the first with a sinuous line drawing of the poet Nikolai Gumilev, the second with a costume design for the ballet "Le Coq d'Or," both circa 1914.
Other notables include Leon Bakst, Alexander Benois, Oskar Rabin, Olga Rozanova, Valentin Serov, who is represented by a study of Czar Nicholas II smoking a cigarette in a holder as he writes, and Mikhail Vrubel, a Symbolist with overtones of both Klimt and Redon.
Though this extraordinary flow of art can't be fully appreciated without a chronological chart, it is obvious that the revolutionary artists did not march with their generations. Liubov Popova was 32 when she produced her Cubo-Futurist abstraction of 1921; Kandinsky did his not dissimilar watercolor in 1924, when he was 58; Ilya Chashnik was 21 when, in 1923, he did the Malevich-like red disk hovering in blackness, attended by smaller geometric shapes (he died six years later).
Hung together, these precise, astringent little images augur a utopia that never arrived in Russia (or in Europe), as later developments in the Dodge collection prove.
As if to show what the dissidents were up against, this begins with "The Cosmonaut's Dream," by Sergei Sherstiuk. The subject, drowsing in his space suit, is suspended diagonally over rural landscape against a cloudy blue sky. It was painted in 1986, four years before Gia Edzgveradze's "Derby," a de Kooningesque abstraction with collage that may allude to horses.
Vyacheslav Kalinin pursues a figural Surrealism packed with incident and touched with a whimsy that recalls the English illustrator Arthur Rackham, as well as old covers of Time magazine. In his predominantly blue "Self-Portrait" (1978), the artist is two men, one holding a palette garnished with a glass containing, it seems, liquor; the other turning back to contemplate a view seemingly of Paris. Edging the central image like shingles are small scenes like that of a man drinking from the spout of a teapot.
One recalls a similar dream by this artist in which two lovely ladies in diaphanous drapery lounge on a rooftop, a samovar with a chimney between them and a view of the Kremlin behind.
Komar and Melamid, humorists well known in this country, contribute a Plexiglas case containing a pebble that is actually a Pravda newspaper compressed. More Conceptualist but equally funny is Viktor Pivovarov's "Daily Regime of a Lonely Man." It is the diagram of a clock divided into periods for reflection, meeting and talking with other lonely people, contemplating nature in the evening (through "the window of opportunity"), reading, shopping, cooking, eating and, finally, sleep. Could Steve Martin have known about this when he came up with his "Lonely Guys Club" routine?
On view through Feb. 25, the two collections, along with that of stained-glass windows and the watercolor designs for them, a gift from Gordon Henderson, are a must-see. So much art; so little space.

THE "verdant glades, picturesque meadows and stretches of woodland" known as the Bronx River Parkway Reservation stretch from the Kensico Dam south to the Westchester County border, enveloping the river in its midst. Except for one glaring detour.
There's a missing link where the river leaves the reservation, flowing instead through an industrial area that has grown up along its banks. The 24-acre site has come on the market as three lots, one of them a wooded parcel west of the Bronx River between the parkway and the river, which County Legislator Katherine S. Carsky wants the county to acquire. 
 The eight-acre wooded property, bordering the river in Yonkers and facing Tuckahoe across the water, would be the first undeveloped open space in the southern part of the county to be acquired in a decade.
 
'What an Opportunity'
 Mrs. Carsky recently wrote County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke and asked him to begin the acquisition process. If the move is initiated by the County Executive, the Board will be asked to vote on the proposal.
"What an opportunity this would be," said Mrs. Carsky, who has often criticized the county's open-space policy as favoring northern Westchester. "It is the only place where the river leaves the reservation and it's the only open recreation space in the middle of southern Westchester, an area with the most people per square mile of the whole county."
Mrs. Carsky added that a recent county appraisal indicated that the eight acres could be purchased at a price she called "incredibly possible." She refused to provide any details, saying that to do so would compromise the county's ability to complete a favorable arrangement.
Acquiring the property, Mrs. Carsky added, would also give the county a staging area for Bicycle Sundays, the county-sponsored program that closes the Bronx River Parkway to automobiles each Sunday in May, June and September for 5,000 to 8,000 bicyclists. The site could provide space for parking, picnic tables and a children's play area overlooking the river, Mrs. Carsky said.
 
O'Rourke Notes Budget Restraints
 A spokesman for Mr. O'Rourke said the acquisition is "certainly something the county is considering."
Noting that the County Executive "agrees with Mrs. Carsky that acquiring open space in the southern part of the county is certainly important," Kara Bennorth, the spokeswoman, added that "every acquistion must be very carefully considered because of the county's current economic situation."
This is the second opportunity the county has had to acquire the acreage, which includes a large stone cotton mill completed in 1810, one of the first built in the United States. The original Bronx Parkway Commission, established in 1906, spent $16.5 million to acquire or condemn 1,338 parcels of land to create the reservation protecting the river. But the tract with the cotton mill on the banks of the river facing Tuckahoe was considered too expensive to acquire.
"It isn't often that opportunity knocks twice," Mrs. Carsky said. "I can think of nothing more suitable than this piece of land because it would enable us to complete the Bronx River Reservation, one of our most extraordinary park holdings."
 
The First Median Strip
 Heralded worldwide for its design, the Bronx River Parkway and its reservation began as one the century's earliest pollution-control measures, an effort to halt the degeneration of a once beautiful river into a "noxious, odiferous and unsanitrary condition," as a historian wrote in 1906.
The solution was to create a park and a roadway, planted with 30,000 trees and 140,000 shrubs, some of which were used to separate north and southbound lanes, a concept unusual at that time but one that formed the basis for later highway median strips.
From 1913 to the opening of the parkway in 1925, 454 parcels were condemned, miles of billboards were removed and 370 buildings were moved or torn down. The 20-year joint venture with New York City led to the completion of the Bronx River Parkway and the surrounding reservation in 1925. It was praised then as an unusual example of planning, "balancing the needs and desires of the population with conservation techniques."
 
Yonkers Bans Shopping Center
 The old mill became a rubber factory, and motorists looked forward to trying out the 15 1/2-mile length of parkway, believed to be the first public road in the world built with entrances and exits rather than intersections.
In the 77 years that followed, the mill underwent other transformations, forming the visual centerpiece for the campus headquarters of two corporate owners, the Burroughs-Wellcome Pharmacutical Company and after that the Revlon Health Care Corporation.
In 1987, the 24-acre property and its 21 buildings were sold to a developer, Howard Sturman, but he was unable to attract new tenants and could not persuade Yonkers to allow a shopping center on the 8-acre site bordering the river. Last March, the Boston Safe Deposit Corporation foreclosed.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Bucking the European Bond Trend

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The consensus strategy for bonds this year is to buy European. Stuart C. Hochberger, the global fixed-income portfolio manager at Fiduciary Trust International in New York, agrees. But last week he spotted an opportunity that has temporarily turned his attention back toward the United States.
He is making an aggressive move that depends on good timing over the next four or five months. "I take an active approach to global management," he explained. 
 The opportunity he sees is in reaction to the recent rise in market interest rates in the United States, which began after the Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan, testified to Congress on Jan. 10. Since then, although there has been no increase in official interest rates, the market has pushed rates on 10-year Treasury bonds 55 basis points higher, or just over half a percentage point.
Mr. Hochberger, who has been at Fiduciary for 11 years and manages $1.5 billion, believes that this interest-rate trend will reverse itself, providing the opportunity for capital gains as bond prices rise when market interest rates fall. Rates will come down again, he said, because growth in the United States will continue to be slow and inflation will remain low.
What makes this market-rate run-up in the United States an opportunity worth taking, he said, is that there is little chance of near-term capital gains in Europe. A recent decline in market rates in Europe, where yields on 10-year French bonds fell 17 basis points, appears to be over for the time being.
Through last Wednesday, when Mr. Hochberger started rearranging his portfolio, European bonds, with their higher interest rates, had outperformed American bonds, which had capital losses, by five percentage points since the beginning of the year. In that period, the return in the United States was down about four points compared with a one-point increase in Europe.
Mr. Hochberger is betting that he can realize capital gains in the United States that will outstrip the high yields still being paid on notes and bonds in Europe. At week's end, the rate on a seven-year French note was 8.3 percent, compared with 6.9 percent on a seven-year note in the United States.
To put the strategy in place, Mr. Hochberger last week took profits in a third of his European portfolio and a third of his Japanese bonds and moved the money into intermediate United States notes in the 7-to-10-year range.
He has now realigned his portfolio so that 48 percent is invested in the United States, up from 30 percent at the beginning of the year. Europe has been cut to a 20 percent share, from 30 percent, and Japan to a 17 percent share, from 25 percent.
Neither President Bush's State of the Union address nor the testimony of Mr. Greenspan last week altered strategy, Mr. Hochberger said. Yet, Mr. Greenspan's testimony on Wednesday did help to nudge imtermediate-term interest rates up a bit. Mr. Greenspan indicated again that it did not appear that the Federal Reserve needed to push short-term rates lower.
Mr. Hochberger said it was possible that the Fed would ease interest rates further, but this is not essential to his strategy. The market itself could bring rates down in response to low growth and low inflation.
Mr. Hochberger expects the window of opportunity to close soon, probably by the second half of the year. By then, when he expects to be moving money back to Europe, the fall in interest rates in the United States will be over, he said, making Europe's much-higher yields a better choice again. In addition, if the consensus forecasts are correct, the Germans will begin to cut official interest rates by then, which will increase the prospect of capital gains throughout Europe.
Some investors may avoid Mr. Hochberger's strategy because it is easier and still profitable to stay in Europe, where yields are attractive compared with the United States. And interest rates on the Continent should come down this year, meaning capital gains and the potential for very nice returns over all for the year.
Clearly, there are risks in Mr. Hochberger's strategy. Market rates here could move higher or just not ease. Interest rates in Europe could come down earlier than Mr. Hochberger is figuring, especially if the current round of wage negotiations with German steelworkers results in agreements of 6 percent or less.
Mr. Hochberger, however, argues that an active manager must make such moves and take such risks.
"I think we will work harder," he said, "but also generate a greater total return when it comes to year-end."
 
The January Effect
 Stocks have often soared in January, and most leading foreign markets did just that last month. Leading the pack was Italy, which rose 8.2 percent. In Germany, the market finished 7 percent higher, just off its high for the month.
Britain ended the month at its peak, up 3.4 percent, according to the Financial Times index of world markets. In Canada, the market rose 2.5 percent, and French stocks jumped 6 percent. The exception was Japan, which was down 5.1 percent.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Bush to Public: Forget Saving, Spend Now

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Call it George Bush's war on savings.
Behind the State of the Union rhetoric about getting the economy moving again lurked what seems to be an important part of Mr. Bush's re-election strategy: Get Americans to stop saving for retirement and instead spend the money now. 
 Consider Mr. Bush's plans for Individual Retirement Accounts. He wants to allow first-time home buyers to raid their accounts for up to $10,000 this year, without tax penalties. And he proposes a new kind of "flexible" I.R.A., which holders could tap for any reason after seven years, tax free. That will make investors hesitate to add to regular I.R.A.'s until they see if the proposal will become law.
Then there was Mr. Bush's plan to halt tax-free accumulations of money in most types of annuities, a popular retirement vehicle. As proposed, it would have been effective immediately, drying up annuity sales. But Friday night, after the insurance industry screamed, the Administration backed down and delayed the effective date until Congress acts. Still, Mr. Bush's hope to slow annuity sales seems clear.
There was also confusion over Mr. Bush's capital gains tax proposal. First the Treasury said the cuts, if enacted, would be effective yesterday. Then it published an explanation saying the effective date would be delayed. Then it said it was right the first time. So starting Monday an investor can sell stocks held for at least a year and know that the profits will be taxed at the lower rate if the cut is enacted. For nervous investors with profits, that removes one reason for holding onto stocks.
One effect of the Bush proposal would be to make the next two Decembers more likely to be bad months for the stock market. Consider a stock bought in October 1991. If sold next November, after it has been held for 12 months, the capital gains rate would be 15.4 percent. But the required holding period rises to 24 months in 1993, and a January sale would incur a tax rate of 19.6 percent. "There is a major incentive to sell early rather than late," says Robert Willens of Lehman Brothers. And in 1994, the required holding period would rise to three years.
Politically, of course, what counts is whether, or when, people begin to believe the economy is improving. One possibly false signal of recovery will come this week, when the new employment report comes out. Betting is that it will show a substantial increase in employment, due to a surge in retail jobs.
If that sounds absurd, welcome to the wonderful world of seasonally adjusted numbers. In December, stores employed 487,000 more workers than they had in October, but the Government had expected them to hire even more temporary workers, so it reported a decrease of 108,000. The workers who were not hired in December were not laid off in January, so now the Government will report higher employment, and politicians will hail a sign of economic growth.

HEADLINE: The Gadfly C.E.O.'s Want to Swat

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: NAPA, Calif.

 BODY:
The corporate chief executives who gathered last month for a conference at Northwestern University's business school campus in Evanston, Ill., became nearly apoplectic when Graef S. Crystal made his presentation. And who could blame them? Mr. Crystal had some fairly harsh things to say about the way C.E.O.'s are compensated. He has been delivering his message with evangelistic fervor for several years, though frequently with all the impact of a pesky mosquito.
But suddenly he is being courted by the media and widely listened to by politicians, reformers, the public -- and even C.E.O.'s -- thanks mostly to the furor over President Bush's recent trip to Japan. Seeking trade concessions, Mr. Bush was joined by a gaggle of American corporate chieftains whose average compensation last year, in the midst of a protracted recession, was $3.4 million, six times the average for their Japanese counterparts. . 
 Mr. Crystal has seized this moment in the limelight, and many corporate heads are furious with him.
Ask Mr. Crystal, for instance, what he thinks of the compensation of Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, chairman of H.J. Heinz ($3.6 million in 1990 salary and bonus, plus $71.5 million from stock options granted in prior years), and he wails: "If they gave him one more dime, the 60th floor of the building would collapse."
What about William A. Anders, chairman of General Dynamics (about $9.4 million in 1991)? "The C.E.O. of General Dynamics must be the laziest man it he world," he clucks. "Look at all the incentive plans they have to give him to go to work in the morning."
Well, how about Linda J. Wachner, head of Warnaco ($21.4 million in 1990)? "It'd be churlish to become outraged by Wachner's excess, now that she's the only overpaid woman in America," he said.
The C.E.O.'s do not take Mr. Crystal's remarks lying down, of course. In Evanston, one of them accused Mr. Crystal of slander and later snubbed Mr. Crystal's wife, Sue, when she tried to engage him in small talk. Mr. Crystal became furious in his own right. "From now on," he declared, "no more Mr. Nice Guy."
 
A Course Called Greed
 Nice guy? To the C.E.O.'s who have been dodging Mr. Crystal's blistering barbs, the idea that he could be even more of a gadfly than he already is must have been frightening. "I'm a rebel with a cause," said Mr. Crystal, who teaches an executive compensation course at the University of California in Berkeley known informally as Greed 259A.
"There's no question that he has sensitized C.E.O.'s to an issue," said David R. Meredith, a compensation consultant who was once a competitor of Mr. Crystal's. "It's really brought the spotlight fully front and center on both the levels of pay and how pay is being done."
Mr. Crystal's message is a simple one: C.E.O.'s are paid too much in relationship to their companies' performance, and their pay seldom reflects downturns in corporate fortunes. He has become the point man for a growing movement of shareholders, employees, legislators and others who feel executive pay must be reined in if the country is to regain its economic vigor.
"People are interested in this topic because while the average person is hurting, C.E.O.'s have done very well," said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who held hearings on the topic Friday. "People know there's something wrong."
Just as the threat of corporate raiders kept managements on their toes in the 1980's, so there is the threat of Mr. Crystal in the downtrodden 1990's. Mr. Crystal has particular credibility, even with his critics, because he spent the better part of his career advising companies about how to use many of the razzle-dazzle, pay-boosting techniques he now lambastes. "He knows what he's talking about and companies know that, and that's a scary thing," said Abraham Nad, publisher of Directorship, a newsletter in Westport, Conn., that tracks corporate board issues.
Some companies have begun paying attention. The crusade Mr. Crystal led against the ITT Corporation last year resulted in some concrete changes in the company's incentive plan this year.
"We certainly felt the pressure and have made prudent reforms," said David H. Rhael, ITT's compensation director. The company switched from giving outright grants of stock to 10-year stock options that cannot be exercised early unless the stock price rises at least 40 percent.
Other companies are not waiting for Mr. Crystal to show up at their doors. American Telephone and Telegraph now insists that its stock price hit certain thresholds before exec utives can cash in the bulk of their last option grant. Itel and Becton Dickinson granted options that only pay off if their stocks outperform Treasury bills or the stock market.
But Mr. Crystal's views are far from being endorsed by other compensation experts, who say there are valid explanations for high compensation levels.
"The average worker is being eliminated in many ways by improving efficiency and automation. They are a dime a dozen," said Jude Rich, chairman of Sibson & Company, a consulting firm in Princeton. "What we really need is leadership and the good leaders are really scarce."
And some academics quibble with Mr. Crystal's rigor, particularly his use of a statistical tool known as regression analysis. "His methodology and accusations are leveled at those who are highly paid, but not necessarily those who are overpaid," said Kevin J. Murphy, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
Professor Murphy argues that of the $9.4 million in 1991 pay for Mr. Anders at General Dynamics, $3 million was based on a sharp spike in the company's stock price, which reflected Wall Street's conclusion that Mr. Anders and his team are doing right by shareholders.
 
Activist Shareholders
 Mr. Crystal has made his mark with a personal computer and the public records of 550 corporations. Because he is so quotable, and willing to be quoted, his ideas have found a wide audience, especially with some of the state pension funds which have begun to take an active role in companies whose shares they own.
Some of these investors are now quietly calling on big companies like International Business Machines before their shareholder meetings to urge cuts in pay for their key executives or injections of more risk into the packages so that top management's fortunes rise -- and fall -- in line with those of the shareholders.
Politicians, who see executive pay as a populist issue in an election year, are on the case.
"The issue he's highlighting is one that concerns most Americans," said Representative Martin O. Sabo, Democrat of Minnesota, another proponent of reform.
He and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic Presidential candidate, are looking at ways to use the tax code to curb excessive pay by making it more expensive for the company or for the executives. Of all the proposals being floated, corporations like this idea the least, arguing that it smacks of government interference and ultimately would only harm shareholders by reducing earnings.
"Whatever happened to the spirit of Horatio Alger?" said Ms. Wachner of Warnaco. "Isn't the hope of every red-blooded girl and boy that they can grow up and run something? I grew up and was able to take over the company I worked for 20 years ago. What's wrong with that?"
Senator Levin's three-pronged proposal is considered somewhat more acceptable because it is more mild. It would force companies to improve the quality of information made available in their annual proxy statements and would require companies to do a better job of accounting for stock options than they do now. He also favors giving shareholders the right to cast a vote on executive pay, albeit a nonbinding vote.
There are also some common-sense suggestions being bandied about, aimed at keeping government out of the picture. Aside from replacing stock grants with options, and tying option payouts to a significant rise in the stock price, some suggest that corporate directors hire their own compensation consultants instead of relying on the recommendations of the chief executive's expert.
Even the Bush Administration has gotten in on the act on the grounds that outsized paychecks not only stain America's image but also hurt the country's ability to compete abroad. Though he has yet to propose anything concrete, Vice president Dan Quayle has joined the chorus of critics, an effort, some say, to blunt the criticism of President Bush's trip to Japan with the corporate executives.
The Japanese bristled at the compensation for the American executives. The $3.4 million average is not only six times what similar Japanese executives earn, despite a higher maximum tax in Japan, it is also 188 times what the average American worker makes.
 
When Performance Falls
 The ones that often seems utterly baffled by the fuss are the C.E.O.'s. "It is a fact that musicians and ball players and actors make more money than executives," said Edmund T. Pratt Jr., chairman of Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals company, and a member of the General Motors board. "Whether that's more of a contribution than someone running G.M. is certainly subject to question."
What the executives don't mention, but Mr. Crystal does, is that the pay of an athlete or rock star can plunge almost instantly if his or her performance is found wanting. Not so with corporate executives.
"The easy part of pay for performance is high pay for high performance," said Mr. Crystal. "The hard part is no pay for no performance."
Mr. Crystal has run statistical tests on executive pay searching for evidence that high pay reflects, say, increased shareholder returns. He contends the relationship between pay and performance would not be much different if corporate compensation directors simply used random numbers as their guides in setting pay levels.
How did pay scales get so out of whack?
Mr. Crystal and other critics say that lax accounting rules deserve some blame for promoting the attitude that the granting of stock options is "free" to shareholders because a company's earnings are not reduced.
Board chairmen are also to blame for naming so many other well-paid executives, with a vested interest in high pay scales, to their compensation committees.
Companies may not see it that way, but they aggravate the problem when they deliberately set their pay levels above the "going rate," hoping to keep their top talent from being lured away by the competition.
"It's very big," said Richard Cyert, president emeritus of Carnegie-Mellon and a member of the H.J. Heinz board committee that gave the "big" compensation to Anthony O'Reilly, the Heinz chief. "But there isn't anybody to match Tony. He has some tremendous external opportunities. The arrangement we arrived at was market driven."
The biggest culprit, however, is the widespread reluctance to cut compensation in lean years, which companies circumvent by layering one incentive plan on another, virtually insuring that something will pay off under any scenario.
Mr. Crystal began developing his expertise as a compensation analyst at RCA in 1959. He spent the next 28 years alternating between consulting jobs and jobs in industry. At the pinnacle of his career, he was billing $500 an hour. He was sought out by such corporate bigwigs as Charles L. Brown at A.T.&T., William S. Paley of CBS and Joseph D. Williams of Warner-Lambert.
He had an apartment in Trump Plaza in Manhattan and a house in the San Francisco Bay area, and, at various times, vacation homes in South Hampton, L.I., and Maui, Hawaii. At one point he owned three grand pianos, reflecting his passion for music. Any time he got on a plane, there were two seats waiting, one for him and one for his companion -- a computer, which accumulated its own frequent flyer miles under the name of Ramsey Crystal.
In 1987, at the age of 53, he took early retirement and joined the business school faculty at the University of California in Berkeley. He soon began a newsletter on executive compensation and kept a few of his consulting clients.
He made the biggest splash as a commentator, writing columns for Fortune and Financial World and, last year, "In Search of Excess," a kiss-and-tell book chock full of zingers about some of the most private moments of some well-known business figures.
 
Some Painful Choices
 His notoriety, however, forced him to make some apparently painful choices. Some long-time clients, like Martin S. Davis of Paramount and Mr. Pratt of Pfizer no longer wanted to have anything to do with him. Other clients, like Michael D. Eisner of Disney, he dropped rather than allow people to attack his motives for criticizing some executives but not others.
Many C.E.O.'s clearly hope the compensation issue will go away. But Mr. Crystal believes it will not -- and some executives agree with him.
"Executive pay generally is a minute fraction of total cost," said Michael D. Rose, chairman of Promus Companies, a casino and hotel company, and a board member at three other companies. "But it's symptomatic. At companies where executive pay is out of line, you'll probably find other things where they are not cost conscious. It will be an indication of a not very demanding management and board."
Mr. Crystal and others argue that competitiveness is a state of mind, achieved one step at a time. "I don't mean to say that if we solve this, the Japanese will suddenly fall over dead," he said, "but every little bit helps. This is one area where we have to look in the mirror, and we can't blame them for it."
 
FROM THE FAST LANE, DOWN TO HIS LAST PIANO
 For Graef S. Crystal, whose friends call him Bud, the price of his convictions about executive compensation has been steep. For one thing, his annual income has plunged from $850,000 or so in his consulting days to about $120,000. Had it not been for some unwise investments in tax shelters, real estate, and wives (he calls himself a "serial monogamist" now wedded to his "fourth and final wife," Sue), he might have squirreled away more of the money he made in the good years to live on now.
Moreover, being a gadfly can be expensive. He has five telephone lines into his home, a $12,000-a-year computer data bill and an enormous brokerage bill because he must buy at least one share in every company he tracks just to get the documents he wants for his research. (Dealing with the dividend checks, many for as little as two or three cents, is a problem. Banks just don't want to be bothered. These days the Crystals send the stacks of checks to Mrs. Crystal's father "because he's 81 years old and they won't yell at him for cashing a two-cent check," she said.)
Mr. Crystal's former life style is fading fast. Fortunately, his home in Napa, a $650,000 two-story modern house nestled into a mountaintop near some vineyards, is paid for. Also, there is a red Porsche in the garage, a wine cellar and a luxurious swimming pool that he lovingly calls his "last capitalistic gasp." But other homes -- a Trump Plaza apartment in Manhattan and two vacation houses -- are gone, through sale or divorce settlements, or are on the block. And, he notes, he is "down to my last piano."
"The money's not important to me anymore," said Mr. Crystal, who is 57 years old. "I have to have a concert grand, a high-powered computer and a good wife. Other than that I can live in a small apartment."
What counts, he said, is the freedom to express his views with total candor. And to name names.
 
GOOD GUYS, BAD GUYS
 Part of Graef S. Crystal's success in attracting attention for his ideas is his skillful use of executive compensation war stories.
For example, he is quick to praise Cummins Engine for doing the right thing back in the early 1980's when a complex incentive scheme he had designed unintentionally produced big bonuses where there should have been no bonuses. The executives realized the mistake and did not demand the extra pay.
He also has kudos for one John S. Reed, the C.E.O. of Citicorp. "His base salary is up there at about $1.2 million, a bit higher than my tastes suggest it should be," said Mr. Crystal. "The nice thing about him is, he hasn't taken bonuses for a few years or long-term incentive grants, and yet he's given bonuses and incentive plans to people underneath him."
Even more impressive, he said, is Mr. Reed's recent purchase of $2.5 million worth of Citicorp stock with his own money, an investment that is so far under water it won't do well unless Mr. Reed performs mightily.
But he regrets advising Salomon Brothers in 1987 that it grant its chairman, John H. Gutfreund, a raft of stock options to make up for the lack of a bonus in a year that the company's results were dismal.
And he says he won't forget an incident nearly two decades ago involving Michael D. Dingman, then chairman of Wheelabrator-Frye, who asked Mr. Crystal to explore starting a bonus plan. Mr. Crystal recommended that Mr. Dingman cut his base pay. When Mr. Dingman reminded Mr. Crystal who was paying for his services as a consultant, Mr. Crystal says he told Mr. Dingman that the last time he looked, it was the company's signature on his checks. The two never spoke again.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Dingman said he did not recall the incident.

A Ticklish Quiz for the Japanese

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
When Alice Tepper Marlin, founder of the Council on Economic Priorities, visited Japan six years ago to describe the nonprofit organization's effort to evaluate the social and environmental responsiveness of American businesses, journalist Mitsuko Shimomura was fascinated. As a result, the latest edition of the council's "Shopping for a Better World" guidebook for "socially conscious" consumers has entries for several major Japanese companies for the first time and Japan has its own version of such corporate ratings.
"I immediately wanted to do something like that in Japan," said the 53-year-old Mrs. Shimomura, who was in New York last week to help launch the 1992 guidebook. "The corporation is the center of Japanese society and you have to change corporate culture or nothing will change." 
 She first found herself well situated to do something in May 1990, when she became editor of the Asahi Journal, a weekly magazine published by the powerful Asahi Shimbun group. She quickly linked up with Koji Nato, a professor at Tokyo International University, to distribute a survey to 100 of Japan's largest companies.
The results were published a year ago after generating controversy. Critics charged that questions about matters like safety records, charitable giving and pay gaps between junior employees and top executives were too invasive and un-Japanese.
"We ran into fears that we were out to bash corporations," said Mrs. Shimomura, the only woman editing a major Japanese publication. Those fears have diminished: For the second annual survey, she said, 93 of the top 100 corporations responded to at least some of the questions, up from 70 a year ago.
But "some Japanese still think this is too American," Mrs. Shimomura said. "There's a long way to go."

A Market for Smog

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Regulators, as a rule, do not like to promote deregulation, and James M. Lents, who heads the primary air-quality regulator for southern California, is no exception. But last week Dr. Lents announced that the regulatory agency would take a radically new course in trying to clean up the Los Angeles area's smog problem by freeing most large companies from the tight rules they have operated under in recent years.
In place of the old approach, Dr. Lents and the staff of the South Coast Air Quality Management District proposed a long-studied concept that relies primarily on free-market economic forces to goad polluters into compliance. Companies that are major polluters will simply be told how much they have to reduce their emissions each year, and then be left to make their own decisions on how best to achieve the goal. Those that exceed the required reduction on their own will generate credits that can be sold on the open market; those that cannot meet the requirement or find it uneconomical to do so will have to purchase those credits on something akin to a smog market. 
 Dr. Lents, a 48-year-old physicist who has run the air-quality district since 1986, said that after years of ever-tighter regulation it has gotten much harder for industry to achieve further emissions reduction, and that the new approach would provide greater incentives to many businesses to redouble their smog-cutting efforts. He also acknowledged pressure on the regulators to provide more flexibility to industry at a time when California is being battered by recession and many companies are leaving the state, complaining about the high costs of air-quality regulations.
The plan is the largest of its kind to date, and Dr. Lents said he expects it to be approved next month, at least in general form, by the district's board.
"There is some disagreement about the details of the program," he said. "But there is a broad conceptual agreement about a marketable permits program that goes all the way from the environmental groups to the business groups."

ECONOMY
 
The Bush Economic Plan: Why Save When You Can Spend? 

"I know we're in hard times," President Bush said last week in his State of the Union address, adding, "This will not stand." Trouble is, if Congress approves the measures outlined in the address, those hard times just may drag on -- and on. The plan calls for cutting the military, but there is nothing in it to retrain workers. "It also focuses on finding small nuggets of savings that are squirreled away and spending them," said Charles W. McMillion, head of MBG, an economic consulting firm. Those nuggets are the nation's individual retirement accounts. Mr. Bush proposes removing penalties if people spend that money to purchase a home, pay for school or buy medical care. Since most economists say the United States already saves too little, the President's plan is likely to make matters worse. "People should not spend the money they put away for their retirement on current needs," Mr. McMillion said.
 
Darman, the Stylist
 
"Here at home," wrote budget director Richard G. Darman in a phrase that could be from the novel "Being There," "the euphoria of summer has been replaced by another winter's gloom." That line, along with President Bush's $1.52 trillion budget, was submitted to Congress last week. The budget calls for moderate increases in a number of domestic programs, including $2.7 billion in new unemployment benefits for people who have already exhausted theirs. (President Bush vetoed a bill to extend those benefits last summer, but that was before the New Hampshire Presidential primary campaign.) This budget packs a bigger deficit wallop than ever before -- $399 billion in fiscal 1992 and $352 billion in 1993. But at least one new Federal program will generate some cash. It proposes to charge some Federal prisoners $20,000 to cover their first year of incarceration.
 
Waiting for Recovery
 
If you follow the pronouncements of the nation's top economists, for at least a year and a half now the recovery has been exactly six months away. It still is. According to the Commerce Department, orders for durable goods -- long-lasting, big-ticket items like airplanes, freezers and automobiles -- fell 4.6 percent in December. That was the largest drop since 1982. And if it weren't for the strength of military orders, "durables would be down 9 percent for December," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh. So when will the recovery set in? "It won't be visible until the summer," Mr. Hoffman said. In other words, six months from now.
 
The Adept Fed
 
Last week, when Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, appeared at his Senate confirmation hearings (he's a shoe-in for a second term) he said there was no need for Congress to lower taxes since that would only increase the size of the budget deficit. Besides, he said, the Fed is on top of things and can manipulate monetary policy to promote a recovery -- and without lowering interest rates further. Today's rates are low enough "by any historical standard," Mr. Greenspan said. That last point -- no further interest-rate cuts -- sent conniptions through Wall Street and the bond markets. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 74 points from its high, closing down 47.18 points for the day. As Mr. Greenspan said, the Fed is in control.
 
Shopping Wasteland
 
It's no secret that buyers are staying home. The reason, according to the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, is that they're scared. And when they're scared, they don't spend. The index fell to 50.4 in January from 52.5 in December. It was a buoyant 100 in 1985. What worries people most is jobs.
 
The Expanding Wallet
 
While nervous consumers stay home clutching their security blankets, their wallets are growing fatter. Consumer income increased by a solid 1 percent in December, the Commerce Department said last week. That was the sharpest gain in the last three years. The most important element in the statistic -- wages and salaries -- increased by a strong $18 billion in December after gaining just $2.7 billion the month before.
 
Lateral Movement
 
Lacking a crystal ball, or even Joan Quigley's astrological savvy, the Government peers into the future with the aid of the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators. The index fell 0.3 percent in December. It also slipped in November. "The economy is chopping sideways," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities. "The economic mix is uneven. Some industries will continue to have a rough time, even with growth. They'll feel like we're in recession."
 
Sickly G.D.P.
 
America's gross domestic product -- which measures all goods and services produced within the country -- is also suffering. According to the Commerce Department, G.D.P. grew by an anemic three-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. It grew 1.8 percent in the summer and 1.4 in the spring. "Economic activity was essential flat in the fourth quarter," said J. Antonio Villamil, the department's chief economist.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Macy Takes Its First Step Back
 
Now that R. H. Macy & Company has filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, it will join some of the nation's classiest acts -- six other retailing chains and a quarter of the nation's airlines. Chapter 11 gives battered companies fresh starts. Last week, Macy's wrangled a fresh $600 million line of credit from Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust. But what about its pre-Chapter 11 creditors? The big store owes suppliers $275 million and bond holders about $3.2 billion. Suppliers will get about 60 cents to 75 cents on the dollar, said Ray Jurgela, corporate credit manager for Russ Togs Inc., a clothing maker. Analysts expect bondholders to get even less.
 
The Downsizing of Defense
 
The way the analysts are reading President Bush's new budget, the weapons systems most likely to be deleted from the arsenal are those designed for war with the extinct Soviet Union: The B-2 stealth bomber, built by the Northrop Corporation; the Seawolf submarine, built by General Dynamics Inc.; the Commanche helicopter, built by United Technologies Inc. The budget contains no money to help the companies retool.
 
Thoroughbred for Sale
 
No ocean liner was faster. The S.S. United States, launched in 1952, had engines that put out 240,000 horsepower. Though it was an engineering marvel, the liner "has been laid up since 1969 in Newport News," said Frank O. Braynard, the author of 27 books on liners. "It is now owned by Richard Hadley, a real estate developer from Seattle." Last week, Mr. Hadley said the S.S. United States would be put on the auction block. "It could become a museum or sail the trans-Atlantic route in summer," Mr. Braynard said. But much more likely, Mr. Braynard said, whoever buys the United States will turn it into scrap.
 
Icahn in the Bankruptcy Queue
 
Last week, Trans World Airlines filed for Chapter 11. T.W.A. became the fifth major airline to file for bankruptcy protection in the last two years. T.W.A.'s owner, Carl C. Icahn, said that the filing "will result in a stronger, more competitive airline." Analysts say the odds are against it.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Japan's Change of Heart
 
Japan's Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, must be a very brave man. Not only did he have the courage to sit next to President Bush again last week, but he also had the guts to change his mind in public. When Mr. Bush took a planeload of American auto executives to Tokyo, Mr. Miyazawa promised Japan would import 20,000 American cars by 1995, and increase imports of auto parts. But a week later, he said he had merely set a target. Last week, he changed his mind again and said Japan would indeed make good on its pledge to buy more cars and parts.
 
 
Just 20,000? Japan can afford to buy far more. At least that's what the Big Three and a lot of economists are saying. They may be right. According to the Finance Ministry, Japan's current account, the broadest measure of its trade in goods and services, more than doubled in 1991 to $72.60 billion, up from $35.76 billion in 1990. That's a world record. The rise would have been larger had Japan not transferred $8 billion to the United States to pay for the Persian Gulf war.
 
I.B.M.'s Many Ties
 
It's becoming a complex task at the International Business Machines Corporation just keeping track of all those Big Blue alliances. After joining forces last year with Apple, Intel, Thinking Machines, Motorola, Siemens and N.E.C., I.B.M. said it was taking a $100 million stake in Groupe Bull, France's troubled state-owned computer maker. That makes France's socialist Government and the buttoned-down capitalists from Armonk, N.Y., practically family. The deal gives Groupe Bull the right to use I.B.M.'s powerful RISC chip technology in its computers -- something Bull needs. It also gives I.B.M. something it needs: a ready supply of laptop computers. I.B.M. also gets a stronger foothold in Europe. "I.B.M. is buying market share and a strong distribution system," said Dedene Nelson, an analyst at Dataquest, a research firm. So far none of the alliances have ended in divorce.
 
American-Japanese Cooperation
 
American auto makers and Japanese politicians may be hurling invectives across the Pacific, but some companies find it much more profitable to do a little business. Last week a consortium including the Mitsui Corporation, the giant Japanese trading concern, the Marathon Oil Company, which is owned by the USX Corporation, and McDermott International Inc., which makes oil platforms, won the right from Russia to explore for oil and gas just off the coast of the Sakhalin Islands. The group expects to be pumping crude by 1995.
 
Last week Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand signed a free-trade pact that will cut tariffs between the countries.

HEADLINE: Between Courses at 4 1/2-Hour Dinner, 575 Cigars Smoked With Great Glee

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

 BODY:
They didn't sing "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" on Tuesday night at Windows on the World but they should have. Because it did.
At the restaurant's first Cigar Lovers' Night, no fewer than 575 stogies, none of them Cuban, were handed out to the 84 men who attended. Two of the four women present stuck to cigarettes. 
 Windows gave the $95-a-seat, four-and-a-half-hour party for the members of its private lunch club, who eat and freely light up in the Grill Room, and for the public. In the conviction that what this economy needs is a good $5 cigar, Windows encourages the members to store their assets in a floor-to-ceiling glass humidor next to the elevators.
Karl Schmid, the executive chef, hatched the idea for the smoke-in when he saw an advertisement in Food Arts magazine, a companion publication of The Wine Spectator, that said, "Wanted: Cigar Lovers." At the time, Marvin R. Shanken, the magazines' editor and publisher, was deciding about starting a cigar magazine; the first issue of Cigar Aficionado, a quarterly, is to appear in September. That explains why Gordon Mott, its managing editor, was casing the party.
At the reception, he and others watched Rafael Lopez, a fleet-fingered employee of Koler Cigars in Manhattan, demonstrate how he rolls 500 cigars a day -- fat, thin, long, short -- with leaves from Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.
David Feeney, a lawyer, took one, sent up cumulus clouds and issued a pronouncement: "The fresher the cigar, the better the smoke. Very mild. Very even. No bitterness. This is obviously very young." Thirty seconds' young, to be exact.
As the guests crowded into a party room, 107 floors up, Johannes L. M. Tromp, the director of Windows, realized that he'd forgotten something. He quickly dialed building operations and asked the duty officer to desensitize the smoke alarms. Who wanted the sprinklers to add two fingers of water to the Scotch, bourbon and -- horrors! -- red wine?
 
Clashing Viewpoints
 Health was not on the agenda. Blowing smoke in a hostile society's eye was. A livid Sidney Zion, a writer and former restaurateur, told how far anti-smokers were pushing things. "I am on the beach at Fire Island," he said. "This is last summer. A guy comes up and says, 'Put out that cigar.' I say, 'This is the beach!' He says, 'It bothers my wife.' This is a crazy smoke fascist." (He put the cigar out.)
Shirley Colucci, the manager of a security-guard company, took a more liberal view. As her husband, Michael, tapped an ash, she said, "This is the most delicious room I ever smelled."
Joseph Daley, a lawyer, scanned the defiant counterculture: thick eyeglasses, balding heads, beards and potbellies that brought to mind William Howard Taft. "These are people who live on the razor's edge," he said.
A fragment of conversation, source unknown, floated over his shoulder: "What I'd also like to know from Bill Clinton is where he stands on cigars."
It was a time to try hedonists' souls. Asriel Rackow, a real-estate developer and wine maven, clasped a California chardonnay, a 1990 Chateau St. Jean, in his left hand and a cigar in his right. In an emergency, he was asked, which would he put down first? Long hesitation. Introspection. Pained, he said, "The cigar."
As the guests filed in to eat, Peter Klink, the banquet headwaiter, asked, "Smoking or nonsmoking?" Mr. Schmid's four-course dinner was saturated with alarm-clock flavorings intended to awaken numbed palates.
Richard Gilbert, a real-estate developer, shirt unbuttoned, tie pulled down, said: "This is the first time I can smoke and eat at the same time. My wife doesn't let me. My daughter doesn't let me." Before him was a plate of honey-coriander glazed cote de boeuf with fried sage and celery root. He was asked, "Can you taste your food?" "No," he replied, "but it doesn't matter."
Bill Scheft, a comedian and writer for David Letterman's show, was the dinner speaker. Putting the fumes in perspective, he said, "The air in Los Angeles is so bad that I use my cigar as a filter."
"I can't tell you," he went on, "what a pleasure it is to walk into a restaurant and see the fire marshal bound and gagged."
Between courses, Maryanne Scully, the Grill Room's manager, and an assistant brought around progressively stronger cigars: Macanudo Claybourne Cafe, Partagas No. 1, Macanudos of the 1984 and 1988 vintages and Partagas Special Reserve. Still, there was a longing, often expressed, for the forbidden: cigars from Cuba, perhaps the ultimate smoke.
Smoking styles mirrored the man: John M. Dempsey 3d, a specialist on the New York Stock Exchange floor, angled his cigar upward, as if it were a line on a Dow Jones graph on a good day, and emitted quick, decisive puffs.
One diner ran up to Ms. Scully, waving his menu and crying: "Miss! Miss! I didn't get this cigar!" He pointed to the 1989 Bonny Doon Le Cigare Volant.
"Sir, this is a wine," she replied. "Would you like me to light it for you?"

BYLINE: By John Durniak; John Durniak is a freelance writer, editor and consultant on photography.

 BODY:
Despite a tough economic climate -- or perhaps because of it -- stock photography, the business of selling generic photographs to clients, is doing well these days.
Among the businesses that rely on stock photos are magazine and newspaper advertising, promotional photography, billboards, catalogues and direct mail. 
 A stock photograph is a generic one kept on file, rather than one made specifically for an advertisement or catalogue.
In stock photography, a client buys the right to use the picture. For example, a company that publishes calendars might need shots of outdoor scenes, or an insurance company might want family scenes for its advertisements.
"Over the last two economic slowdowns, 1973-1974 and 1980-1981, stock photography became an alternative to more expensive assignment photography for obtaining images," said Bob Roberts, president of H. Armstrong Roberts, a 70-year-old stock photography agency in Philadelphia. And in New York, there is now "more sales activity than we've had in a long time," he said.
New York is the center of the stock picture market. Every year about $150 million is spent on stock pictures in the United States, Mr. Roberts said, and about half of the sales come from the files of some 26 New York picture agencies. (There are about 80 major agencies in the United States.)
Comstock, the biggest of the nation's top three agencies -- the others are Image Bank and F.P.G. -- is looking to one of its best years so far, said its president, Henry Scanlon. The company, whose offices are near Union Square in Manhattan, is bullish on the worldwide economy.
"Everybody in stock is now looking to the global marketplace," Mr. Scanlon said. "Comstock's European expansion is going extremely well." The company has offices in Berlin and Paris and is about to open one in London."
"We are growing a modest amount in the United States," he added. "Our economy is kicking, but we have more significant growth in Europe."
Those who might envision a stock picture agency as a place full of cardboard-mounted slides, stacks of dusty envelopes and clerks running up and down narrow rows of file cabinets would be surprised by Comstock. It is a carefully planned complex on three floors.
The middle floor holds the picture collection, the heart of the operation. A control center is surrounded by researchers and sales people in offices along the walls. Working hours are from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., so that the company can handle calls from all over the continental United States.
Every Comstock transparency and print carries a bar code that can be scanned to see where it was last used. The agency is constantly researching what styles of pictures are being used in the news media; for example, nostalgic soft-focus photos were in style a while back. Once a trend is spotted, the company updates its own files by assigning its staff photographers to produce images that fit current concepts. There are more than four million images in the company's files and thousands of new ones are added every month, many from photographers who are not on staff.
Some experts in electronic imaging call Comstock's use of computers and scanners the most sophisticated in photography. And the company continues to expand into the use of electronic picture disks, each of which can hold 441 pictures.
Most customers today, however, select pictures from catalogues, or they can ask for specific types of pictures from the files. The customer buys the right to experiment with several pictures in layouts. Once a picture is selected, the client must then negotiate for reproduction rights.
Customers are charged for the way the photograph is used. The cost for printing it in a mass-circulation magazine would be higher than for a newspaper with a small circulation.
Photographers who do not submit their unused pictures to a stock agency may be missing out on royalties, Mr. Scanlon said. Comstock prefers that interested photographers write to Jane Kinne, the Comstock Building, 30 Irving Place, New York, N.Y. 10003.

 BODY:
When the Japanese began their invasions of countries in Southeast Asia 50 years ago, they brought their own money, notes printed in Japan for use in local markets using local denominations. Today, these occupation notes turn up in collections or as souvenirs, and sometimes they are valuable. But most are worth only a few dollars, no matter how good their condition. Still, they make marvelous reminders of World War II and of Japan's dream of empire.
In 1930, Britain and the Netherlands controlled most of Southeast Asia, while the United States controlled the Philippines and France governed Vietnam. Japan wanted a larger part of the region's economy and so began developing what it called the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, a title that may be more euphonious in Japanese than in English. Japan wanted to establish puppet governments to rule each country within an economic system dominated by Japan. While Draconian, that system at first appealed to many nationalists in the various countries, who hated European rule. 
 By the end of 1942, Japan had either conquered or had treaties with every country in Southeast Asia except Australia and New Zealand. And with the Japanese came the occupation notes. The first were printed in Japan and numbered. Later, lithographed series without the serial numbers were made in the occupied countries.
Five countries were involved, and each country's notes can be distinguished by the first of two code letters on each. Malaya was M; Burma was B; the Dutch East Indies was S (for Sumatra); the Philippines was P and the British islands of the Southwest Pacific were O (for Oceania).
The second letter in the code indicated which printing the note came from. For example, PD means the note was for use in the Philippines and was the fourth printing of that style of note.
The Japanese distributed different printings in different areas of a country as a way of keeping track of the comings and goings of the population. The notes, in essence, served somewhat as passports in these countries, where travel was usually restricted. For example, if a note distributed in Manila appeared on the island of Mindanao, the person carrying it was immediately under suspicion.
When the war began going badly for the Japanese, the value of the notes decreased, so larger denominations were printed. In the Philippines inflation increased when the Allies parachuted thousands of dollars' worth of counterfeit Japanese occupation notes to guerrilla armies.
These counterfeit notes are so good that they are indistinguishable from the originals. Such good quality was possible because the United States discovered a quantity of Japanese note-grade paper in a warehouse in this country. Also, an officer serving with Filipino guerrillas provided samples of the inks used and copies of the original printing plates. Both the United States and Australia began printing the notes and, in effect, became branch mints for Tokyo.
As the Allied armies began taking island after island in the Pacific, they captured large quantities of Japanese occupation money and began overprinting the notes with these words: The Co-Prosperity Sphere: What Is It Worth? These propaganda notes were dropped over Japanese-controlled areas to demoralize the Japanese and rally the Filipinos.
Today, these marked notes are rare and more valuable than unmarked ones. Counterfeits of marked notes began appearing almost immediately and were sold as souvenirs to American soldiers. These are easily detected, as they were stamped with a rubber stamp and the phrase appears in quotation marks. The counterfeiter apparently never saw real propaganda notes but read about them in a newspaper. Thinking the quotation marks were part of the real slogan and not just punctuation added by a newspaper editor, he simply copied them onto his rubber stamp.
When the Allies entered Manila they found tons of real uncirculated occupation notes and burned most of them. But caches of notes turned up later in bank vaults and in remote Japanese compounds, and these became the basis of a strong souvenir trade. Today, most of the Japanese occupation notes are worth only a few dollars each. But a few of the rarest series may sell for about $100.

HEADLINE: Builder Incentives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While your article on tax incentives for builders tried to be even-handed in its analysis of the appropriateness of maintaining them for the developers of commercial real estate in New York City, I fear that it left a perception that such incentives are the panacea for the city's much publicized economic malaise. Nothing could be further from the case. 
 Rarely, if ever, does a firm locate in a particular city (or suburb) because of the availability of one more building. Even if space were an overriding selection criteria, availability of office, back-office and other commercial space -- in virtually any quality, size or sublocation -- is not likely to be a constraint for New York given its enormous vacancy and sluggish absorption. The factors cited consistently by business leaders for selecting a location include the following:
* Availability of an appropriate work force.
* Convenience relative to the firm's customers and suppliers of materials and capital.
* Availability of reasonably-priced housing for employees.
* Overall cost of doing business.d
* Quality of life for its employees and especially for its executives.
The relevant marketplace is the supply and demand for attractive environments for firms and organizations, conventioneers and tourists. Buildings such as offices and hotels merely serve demand whose origin is far broader; they do not generate demand ordinarily. Once in an era a truly noteworthy building is constructed, one with some degree of gravitational pull. Such buildings tend not to be the offspring of tax-incentive programs.
The representatives of the real estate industry and builders' associations desire to promote employment via such incentives seems parochial, and embrace the same misguided notions as American car makers and consumer electronics producers in terms of blind faith in production based approaches. While foreign providers were tailoring their offerings to the style, quality levels and price-value relationships sought by American consumers, domestic providers continued generally to produce more of the same old things.
There is a message for the real estate industry in the woes of the Big Three U.S. automakers and the absence of American firms from the VCR business. Producing more of something, no matter how great the projected profitability may be, will not stimulate demand for it. Hence, artificially buoying that profitability will have no impact on demand.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Congress Poised to Act But Maybe Not for Bush

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On one level, it looks very much like business as usual on Capitol Hill. Congress will almost certainly pass an election-year tax cut that it can say helps the middle class. It is almost certain to reject President Bush's call to eliminate 246 Federal programs, slash mass transit and impose some still undefined cuts in Medicare. Nor will it seriously try to enact Mr. Bush's economic proposals by the March 20 deadline he set in his State of the Union Message.
But on another level, Congress seems different this year. Both parties and Mr. Bush have already found the right accounting gimmicks to "pay for" another extension of unemployment benefits, instead of using the issue as a political club the way they did last year. 
 In both houses, the tax-writing committees plan to meet through the regular mid-February recess, working on Mr. Bush's economic package. And with a degree of coordination rarely even attempted, the House Budget and Armed Services Committees are trying to get their major legislation to the floor by mid-March, rather than May, their typical schedule.
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, who joined in the leadership harumphing about Mr. Bush's chutzpah in proclaiming deadlines for Congressional action after taking months to produce his own still-unfinished program, told a conference of House Democrats Friday, "Our first task, which has not been easy in the past, is to be both faster and clearer."
As to faster, there are really three important dates.
One is Mr. Bush's March 20, and all that anyone expects it to produce is a lot of speeches by him and Republican lawmakers about how the Democrats aren't meeting his reasonable expectations of tax legislation. Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 House Republican, was trying out some lines last week, saying that he feared delay because Democrats want to keep the recession going to hurt Mr. Bush. But in fact neither of the key committee chairmen, Dan Rostenkowski of House Ways and Means and Lloyd Bentsen of Senate Finance, goes out of his way to challenge Mr. Bush, despite the urging of other Democrats. More important, each runs a committee that is not particularly inclined to rush serious business like tax legislation.
The real deadline is probably April 10, the Friday before Congress's scheduled Easter break. It will mean fewer Mondays and Fridays off, but it can be met. As long as Congress is working, Republicans' complaints about Mr. Bush's March 20 deadline will carry little weight, but it would be another thing to miss a deadline and then take a vacation.
The other important date is Feb. 18, when New Hampshire holds its primary. It will measure Patrick J. Buchanan's challenge to Mr. Bush, and may end it. Until then, it would be suicidal for the Bush Administration to talk of compromising its tax legislation; until then, the Democrats cannot know whether a Republican refusal to deal is only short-term posturing. So serious law-making, whether it involves a search for common ground or a battle over an emerging Democratic position, may begin Feb. 19. Even an all-out House battle would leave time for compromise in the Senate by spring break.
To a remarkable degree, this year's agenda is dominated by the budget. There are no major competing issues like civil rights or clean air. Of course, the President mentioned several other bills in his speech, devoting a couple of paragraphs to his crime bill and then proclaiming, "Congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still awaiting Congressional action -- bank reform, civil justice reform, tort reform and my national energy strategy."
President Bush did not spend much time on theses proposalsin his speech, but he did not spend much of an effort to get them passed last year, either, and no one expects Congress to follow his lead on any of them.
Congress will probably pass its own, more modest, versions of energy, education and crime bills, and a family leave measure that the President is still committed to vetoing. And if the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade, Congress will probably pass a measure aimed at re-establishing abortion rights, though not with veto-proof strength. The legislators will also try to do something on health care, an issue where both parties seem way ahead of Mr. Bush.
 
Spending the Savings
 Aside from taxes, the $280.9 billion military budget is central. The Administration's proposed cuts left Congress few easy targets. The issue is what to do with the Administration's $7.6 billion in savings, plus however much more Congress can find to cut. Democrats want to spend it on the domestic programs that Mr. Bush wants to freeze; Republicans would rather use it for tax cuts.
Some kind of tax/growth bill is almost certain to pass. A series of Administration proposals designed to help the housing industry are relatively cheap and almost sure to pass. Something will be done to encourage business investment, either thgough a tax credit or Mr. Bush's accelerated depreciation scheme. The existing temporary tax credits for research and development and for low-income housing are likely to be made permanent.
But the real uncertainty is over whether each side can reach its bottom line.
The Democrats want a bill they can say makes the tax code fairer. Mr. Bush and the other Republicans want a capital gains tax cut, which the Democrats usually decry but say they could live with if it was targeted to developing new businesses. Republicans say they cannot abide the tax increases for upper income Americans that the Democrats say are necessary to help the middle class, and so on.
There are strong reasons to believe that Congress will act. One impetus for action is the members' awareness of their reputation for delay and bickering, which was reflected in a poll rating last month that was as bad as any ever recorded. In the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, just 17 percent approved Congress's handling of its job, while 71 percent disapproved.
There are more motives for Congressional action than just the desire to avoid ridicule, or even the desire to serve the national interest. It is an election year for Congress, too. No one exemplified that cold reality last week better than Mr. Rostenkowski. He usually lends an air of statesmanship to his committee's work, but last week he announced its hearings by saying, "I'll be asking our witnesses a simple question -- what the plan will do to help people on the Northwest side of Chicago -- and I'll reject any plan that fails that test."
Mr. Rostenkowski has a primary on the Northwest side of Chicago on March 17.
 
 
 
THE PRESIDENT'S TAX PACKAGE
 Major propsed changes in tax laws, all of which must be approved by Congress, made by President Bush last week.
 * An effective reduction in the maximum tax on capital gains to 15.4 percent from the current 28 percent. Democratic leaders oppose any capital-gains cut not accompanied by higher tax rates on upper-income people. The Internal Revenue Service says 72 percent of capital gains are reported by people with incomes over $100,000.
 * An increase of $500 in the personal exemption for children under 18 years of age.
 * A 10 percent tax credit, up to a maximum of $5,000, for any home bought this year after Jan. 31 by a person who has not owned a home during the last three years. The credit -- subtracted directly from taxes owed -- would be divided evenly between returns filed in 1993 and 1994.
 * Restoration of a tax deduction for interest on student loans.
 * Allowing individuals with incomes up to $60,000 and couples with incomes up to $120,000 to set aside up to $2,500 a year in a new type of Individual Retirement Account. If the account were kept intact for at least seven years, the principal and interest would be tax-free. People would have the rest of this year to transfer old-type IRAs into the new variety -- after paying tax on the old accounts.
 * Encouragement of business investment by having the Government, in effect, pay 15 percent of the cost of equipment bought this year after Jan. 31. This would be done by accelerating first year depreciation.
 * An increase to $60 a month, from the current $21, in the amount of employer-provided mass-transit benefits on which a worker could avoid tax.
 * A new tax break to a person who sells a home at a loss. The portion of loss exceeding 10 percent of adjusted gross income could be deducted.
 * Repeal of the luxury tax on yachts and expensive planes. The 10 percent tax applies to that portion of the cost of a boat above $100,000 and of a plane above $250,000.
 * Allowance for real estate developers to use losses to offset taxes on other income, like wages.
 * Making permanent a 20 percent tax credit for increased business investment in research.
 * Temporarily extending special tax benefits for investors in low-income rental housing, bonds that finance moderate- and low-income homes, and wage subsidies that encourage the hiring of poor young people.
 * Tax credits and deductions for medical insurance.

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Driven to Abstraction;
With These Data, the Enumerator Always Wrings Twice

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Each year for the last 110 of them, the Bureau of the Census has published The Statistical Abstract of the United States, a compendium of statistical detail about the country, from "Abortions" and "Abrasives, stone," to "Zinc, production and value." The 1991 edition, recently published, is the Census Bureau's largest and the first to tabulate the 1990 census results among its 1,490 statistical tables in 1,000 pages. Besides reporting the big numbers, about the 1990 population (248 million) or steelworkers on the job (169,000, down from 399,000 in 1980, but producing the same tonnage), the Census Bureau culled other sources to collect small details about how Americans are living, where they are working and what they are eating (more broccoli).
The states are, of course, compared, though explanations are rare. There is no clue as to why Maryland ranks first in doctors per 100,000 people, with 325, and Idaho last, with 120. Or why Vermont is first and Utah last in percentage of undergraduates in state who are women. Nor why New York was 44th in percentage of women who work -- 53 percent, versus Utah's 61 percent. 
 The abstract also reflects the country's interest in comparing parts of the population against the whole; women and blacks are separated out in nearly 600 tables.
In between, the browser may find that Americans paid veterinarians $26 million for the care of pet birds in 1987, and that spending is up on all sports equipment except, for some reason, water skis.
Taken altogether, the Abstract is a list of answers looking for questions. It is $28 in paperback, and ordering information is available at (301) 763-4100. Among its findings, both meaningful and whimsical:
 
Health
The number of people treated at hospitals for injuries from drinking glasses declined from 121,951 in 1985 to 114,923 in 1988. Injuries from pet supplies also declined slightly. But injuries from jewelry increased, as did those from "Sound recording, reproducing equip." The figures did not say whether those injured were deafened, electrically shocked, or crushed by speakers. The leading causes of injuries are falls, bicycle accidents, knives and scissors and playground equipment.
Not surprisingly, money is often the best medicine. People with incomes under $10,000 a year spent an average of 26 days with an illness or disability, while those with incomes over $35,000 spent less than 10. Poor people suffer disproportionately from high blood pressure; the middle class from back problems.
Cigarette smoking appears to have become a great social divide. In 1970, college graduates were almost as likely to be smokers as high school dropouts were. By 1987, 34 percent of all dropouts still smoked. But only 16 percent of college graduates did.
 
 
Food
There is evidence that Americans are eating a more healthful diet. Or is there? Red meat consumption is down, from 132.4 pounds per person per year in 1970 to 111.3 pounds in 1989. Fish and shellfish consumption, meanwhile, went up from 11.8 pounds to 15.7 pounds. Whole milk dropped from 219 pounds per person to 95.
Yet consumption of fats and oils rose steadily over the same period, from 52.6 pounds a person to 60.7 pounds. The reason? Salad.
Iceberg lettuce consumption rose from 22 to 29 pounds. Onions and carrots showed similar growth. Cauliflower almost tripled. And broccoli, President Bush's taste notwithstanding, was the big winner, going from half a pound per person in 1970 to 4.5 pounds in 1989.
As for balance, there is scant difference between either the races, sexes or regions on the composition of the American diet. Almost everywhere, it averages 16.5 percent protein, 47.2 carbohydrates, and 36 percent fats. Most nutrition experts say a healthy diet should be 12 to 15 percent protein and certainly less than 30 percent fat.
 
 
Education
The distinctions between races and income levels are sharpest in education. Black children enroll in school later and leave earlier, score lower on tests, and are less likely to enter college. Between 1960 and 1989, the total number of college-bound high-school graduates of all races increased dramatically, to 6.8 million whites from 1.2 million, and to 867,000 blacks from 141,000. But the gap between the two had widened: In 1960, 24.3 percent of white high school graduates and 18.7 of blacks enrolled in college; by 1989, 39.1 percent of whites did, but only 31.5 percent of blacks.
The abstract even tracks the use of computers by parents' income. In 1989, 36.7 percent of children from homes earning less than $10,000 used computers in school. At $75,000 a year or more, 51.2 percent did.
Women earned 52 percent of the 993,000 bachelors' degrees granted in 1988, 51.5 percent of the 299,000 masters' degrees, but just 35.2 percent of the nearly 35,000 doctorates. Women took most of the Ph.D.'s in education, foreign languages, health sciences, home economics, letters and psychology. Men took most of them in computer sciences, engineering, physical sciences and, by 6 to 1, philosophy and theology.
 
 
Jobs
Blacks and women bought or started many businesses in the 1980's. The number of black-owned businesses grew from 308,000 in 1982 to 424,000 in 1987. Their total sales receipts rose from $9.7 billion to $19.7 billion.
The number owned by women increased from 2.6 million to 4.1 million, and took in 16 percent of the nation's business receipts.
Most companies owned by women were retail or service businesses -- shops, lodging or health concerns. But the number of trucking and warehousing operations owned by women grew from 16,000 to 27,000. Women also own about 21,000 of the nation's service stations, auto dealerships and repair shops -- about 10 percent of the total.
New Hampshire had the fastest increase in ownership of businesses by women from 1982 to 1987. New Jersey was second, Connecticut was fourth, New York was seventh. Wyoming was last.
Among state and local employees in 1987, 73 percent got free parking, but only two percent received child care.
The abstract says there were 62,000 "authors" in 1983 and 82,000 in 1989. The number of editors and reporters grew from 204,000 to 253,000 over that period, but public relations employment stalled. Actors and directors increased from 60,000 to 96,000, but librarians declined from 193,000 to 188,000.
 
 
Crime
The rule for avoiding crime is, avoid crowds. New York State reported 1,131 violent crimes per 100,000 population in 1989, the nation's highest, followed by Florida and California. North Dakota was safest, with 60 crimes per 100,000. Montana and Vermont were the next safest.
In 1975, there were 449 bomb threats at airports in the United States, and four bombs exploded. In 1989, there were 489 threats, but no explosions.
 
 
Leisure
The stereotypical suburban house with a lawn and a dog is going the way of the big family that filled it. The percentage of home owners who care for a lawn declined from 64 percent in 1985 to 57 percent. Only 38.2 percent of all households had a dog in 1987, versus 42.5 percent in 1983. But cats become more popular, inhabiting 28.4 percent of homes in 1983 and 30.5 percent in 1987.
The most expensive magazine subscriptions in 1989 were for chemistry and physics publications, which averaged $368 per year. The cheapest, at $28.62, were for philosophy magazines.
There were 4,038 first-year rodeo riders in 1980; in 1989, there were only 3,584.
The higher the income, the more likely someone is to own equipment for several sports. Rifles are the lone exception to the trend. While the purchase of shotguns grows steadily with income, rifle-buying tops out in families earning about $50,000, at which point 32 percent own one. Above $50,000, however, only 12.5 percent have bought a rifle.
Attendance at operas has skyrocketed since 1970, going from 4.6 million then to 21.4 million in 1989. But don't be too impressed. In 1987, American symphony orchestras grossed $306 million. And coin-operated video games, which didn't exist in 1970, grossed $1.4 billion.

HEADLINE: MODEST AIMS;
Missing From Politics: The Blueprints for the Future

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In their State of the Union Messages and budget presentations, Presidents used to stress bold ideas -- a Great Society, say, or a Star Wars missile defense system. Their challengers in New Hampshire often were politicians like Nelson A. Rockefeller and Hubert H. Humphrey with long track records and national identities. Giants sat in Congress with names like Taft and Dirksen, Rayburn and Fulbright and Mansfield, men with distinct world views, recognizable faces and respect that transcended party lines.
There were bad times, to be sure. Nuclear war was a constant threat. Recessions came and went. People were segregated by race. Students demonstrated. Cities burned. But by and large Americans were confident things would improve, probably for themselves and certainly for their children. 
 Times have changed.
President Bush's address to the country Tuesday night and the budget he sent Congress the next morning had been ballyhooed by his staff as a defining moment of his Presidency and the keynote of his re-election campaign. He had the opportunity to rally the country the way he did last year for the war in the Persian Gulf; to say that after winning the cold war, the United States was ready to face a new challenge; to say, in essence: "Watch out, Japan. Watch out, Germany. Here we come."
Indeed, he began by saying, "I mean to speak of big things." But after some strong words about nuclear disarmament that would have been unthinkable even a year ago, he reverted to form. He urged Congress to "modify the passive loss rule" and to "fund our H.O.P.E. housing proposal" -- hardly words to stir the people or give them new confidence that better days are ahead.
 
Hardly Breathtaking
 "We must revolutionize America's schools," the President said at one point. "We must do something about crime and drugs," he said at another. But his proposals are hardly breath-taking. His primary idea in education is to help poor people pay private school tuition. He would fight crime by expanding the number of Federal offenses punishable by death, limiting the appeals by inmates on death row and permitting the use in court of illegally obtained evidence if the police acted in good faith.
Among economists and others outside the Government, there is no shortage of sweeping ideas. They deal not so much with the recession, which will almost certainly pass in time, but with the critical long-term problems of overconsumption, meager economic expansion, a lack of investment in essential public and private projects and insufficient money to meet the nation's needs, matters that the President addressed hardly at all.
Mr. Bush, said Stuart M. Butler, director of domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a research institute that espouses conservative economic policies, "just doesn't have confidence that bold ideas can motivate people."
The President's opponents say he has no ideological core, but his three years in office and his speech Tuesday night belie that notion. In fact, he seems to have a bedrock political principle: He believes that the Government should take a hands-off approach to the economy and that people with capital should be free to develop it.
"People will do great things if only you set them free," he declared. And perhaps his most forceful words were about capital gains. His own economists say his proposed lower tax on investment profits would improve the economy by only about a half a percentage point a year, but Mr. Bush set the stakes high. "This time, at this hour," he said, "I cannot take no for an answer."
To people who say his strategy sounds like a way to make the rich richer, Mr. Bush made a joke: "You kind of remind me of the old definition of the Puritan who couldn't sleep at night worrying that somehow someone somewhere was out having a good time."
 
The Hot Issue
 But if Mr. Bush is not thinking daring thoughts, neither are his challengers, in New Hampshire and in Congress.
The main question on the Presidential campaign trail last week was not about solving the country's problems but about how badly Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas had been damaged by tabloid claims of a sexual affair. The two junior Senators who are running, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa, have hardly broken into the public consciousness. The best-known of the Democrats at the outset, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, has been out of public office for a decade and hardly seems a serious contender now. And former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who may be running the best campaign in New Hampshire, looks grim on television and has hardly any organization or recognition outside New England.
In Congress, there are no leaders in large part because there are no followers. There are a dozen different Democratic plans for dealing with the recession and a dozen more for changing the country's health care system. Egos are such that getting one lawmaker to agree to another's idea is often an excruciating process. The only Democratic consensus is on a tax break of $400 or $500 a year for middle-class households, and that is an election-year campaign gimmick and not an economic policy. When anything bold is proposed, some lobbyist or committee chairman can usually squelch it.
Outside the political system, however, some sweeping, creative ideas for solving the country's long-term problems are emerging.
Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker, talks of a "vast national program of public investment" in schools, airports, roads, bridges, technological and scientific research and the like. He would pay for it with deep cuts in the military budget, a gasoline tax increase of 50 cents a gallon, a temporary 5 percent surtax on income to pay off the savings and loan debt and additional taxes on rich people to offset part of their Social Security and Medicare subsidies.
Robert Heilbroner, the liberal economic historian, advocates similar kinds of public investment, but he would overhaul the nation's tax system and impose a national sales tax like those prevalent in Europe. Taxes on income, he wrote in a recent essay in The New York Review of Books, "are considered by most taxpayers to be a kind of plunder on the part of the Government, seizures of money that is rightfully theirs." Taxes on goods and services "appear to have a voluntary character," he wrote, because "one can decide not to buy a particular item because of its tax."
Mr. Butler and his colleagues at the Heritage Foundation favor a $1,000 per person tax cut, and they emphasize private investment. They want to let poor people own their own housing projects and overhaul the entire medical care system. They would also abolish a variety of popular Federal spending programs and reduce Social Security and Medicare payments to all but the poor.
What these innovative plans have in common is that they would require some immediate sacrifice -- a gasoline tax, a national sales tax, elimination of popular spending programs -- to achieve their eventual goals. Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief professional economist, compares it to "an athlete who's out of shape -- the first few months of exercising are going to be painful, but they will pay off in the long run."
But almost all of the politicians eschew any mention of pain. The John F. Kennedy line about asking not what your country can do for you has become passe. One theme of Mr. Bush's State of the Union address was that Americans had sacrificed enough to defeat Communism and could now rest on their laurels.
"It's difficult," Mr. Reischauer said, "for a politician to begin talking about short-term pain when we're in the midst of a recession. It's like saying to the athlete he should begin exercising when he has the flu. We have to get over the flu first and then do the exercise regimen. The problem with our political system is that when times are better, the will and the realization that things must be done evaporate."
The public seems to be ahead of the politicians. Reporters who interviewed ordinary citizens last week after Mr. Bush's speech found the view widespread that the President had been too passive about addressing the nation's problems.
The New York Times/CBS News Poll published last week showed Americans by a large margin willing to pay significantly more in taxes to get a better medical care system. Large majorities also favored increased Federal spending for education and job creation. Only one person in 10 agreed with most Democrats in Congress that a $400 or $500 tax cut would help end the recession, but 6 out of 10 said increased Government spending would do so.
The poll found the public's sense of "how things are going in the United States" more pessimistic than it has ever been since The Times and CBS News began asking the question in 1979. Three out of four respondents said times were worse now than they were five years ago. Perhaps most striking, 48 percent said they thought the future for the next generation of Americans would be worse than life today, compared with only 26 percent who said things would get better.
All this is bad news for President Bush, but it is by no means critical. His approval rating is only 43 percent, the lowest of any sitting President at this stage of his Presidency in 40 years. But Richard M. Nixon's rating in January 1972 was only 49 percent. He went on to win 49 states in November.
But history shows that Presidential elections turn more on the economy than on any other issue, and Mr. Bush's record -- following his stand-pat, hands-off philosophy -- is bleak. In his first three years in office, the economy grew an average of less than 1 percent a year, the worst record of any post-war President. His economists forecast growth this year of 2.2 percent. The last two Presidential election years when the rate was that low were 1960 and 1980. Both times the incumbent party was ousted.

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
A Plan With Something For Everyone To Swallow

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
WHAT if David N. Dinkins proposed a budget and nobody groaned?
That's more or less what happened last week when the Mayor released the latest in a long line of gloomy spending plans for New York City that prompted measured praise from many quarters, instead of the howls of outrage he has heard for so much of his term. 
 The trick was to spread a little bit of pain among practically every constituency in a way that made each feel it got a little something in return. The City Council and business groups exacted the promise of a four-year freeze in property tax rates and more cuts in the work force, while the Mayor's liberal supporters won a pledge to protect vital services for the poor.
City workers would get no raises for two years -- music to the ears of fiscal monitors and bond raters -- but would not be laid off and could end up sharing in the gain if they agreed to improve productivity -- a grace note for the unions. Everyone would get the most politically popular prize of all: more police officers. "I think it reflects a more thoughtful approach to those different groups that are out there making demands," said Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger. "He's telling them what he will do to meet some of their concerns, and what he absolutely will not do."
Not that anybody much liked Mr. Dinkins's $29.4 billion preliminary budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1. It would increase class sizes for early grades, slow down recycling, close a firehouse and cut parks maintenance to help close a projected gap between revenues and expenditures of more than $1.5 billion. It depends on some new taxes on gasoline, cars and the income of commuters that Albany might not approve and other revenues that might not materialize, making deeper cuts a real possibility.
But the Mayor's staff consulted so closely with the City Council in drafting the plan that mayoral aides joked that the Council's chief finance staff aide, Marc V. Shaw, had become deputy in the administration's budget office. Mr. Shaw scoffed at that notion, but he did produce a list of Council fiscal priorities issued last year that closely paralleled the Mayor's new plan.
"We're very pleased to say the least," said the Speaker of the newly expanded Council, Peter F. Vallone, who has jousted with the Mayor on issues large and small for months. "Now we can get to the details."
Since the Council has the sole power to approve the budget, that was good news for the Mayor. But it also raised the question of who had co-opted whom. The Mayor's promise to hold property tax rates constant ties one hand behind his back just as he gears up to run for re-election and wants to keep as much control over shaping the city's spending priorities as possible. He would face all-out war with the Council should he try to renege.
Or, as Mr. Vallone said, "God has an expression: Not in my lifetime."
Of course, the Mayor's political needs also helped drive him to make the freeze in the first place, to appeal to middle-class homeowners who feel alienated from his administration. That is also part of the reason he proposed more savings over the next four years.
But an equally compelling reason was his reluctant acknowledgment that even if the economy booms, the city would still face a shortfall of $1.6 billion between revenues and expenses in 1996 if current spending trends continued unchecked. That marked the ultimate evolution of the thinking of a Mayor who last year mostly urged New Yorkers to hang on until better times.
"New Yorkers aren't expecting good news," Mr. Dinkins said last week. "But they are expecting -- indeed, demanding -- sober and realistic solutions to our problems, and some assurance that their government is looking toward the future, with courage and optimism."
 
Crunching Numbers
 Hard work is still to come. Because of the strict laws that have governed the city since the fiscal crisis of the 70's, Mr. Dinkins's plan is required by law to show how he would keep the budget balanced over the next four years. Because he wants to borrow $700 million through a bond refinancing to help stretch out the pain, state fiscal monitors and Wall Street credit-rating agencies have pressed him harder than usual, and they are reserving judgment on the plan until they crunch its numbers.
The bond raters have pressed the city to save money by cutting its spending for construction projects financed by bonds. But other politicians and some of the Mayor's own top aides worry that canceling plans to build schools, jails and other projects could undo the hard-fought improvements in the city's infrastructure since the last fiscal crisis.
Business groups were wary that the Mayor did not provide more specifics for winning greater efficiencies from the labor force, while the unions were skeptical of his plans for squeezing them harder. "The Mayor is trying to show the Wall Street people and bond raters that he can put together a snazzy financial plan on paper, but what does it mean to us in reality?" asked Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the city's largest union. "We don't know. We need more specifics on gain-sharing."
Still, the Mayor managed to stitch together a plan inspired by disparate sources. After months of repeating the mantra of the moment, "downsizing," and imposing flat percentage cuts across the board in city agencies, he has taken to saying his goal is "rightsizing" government, and proposed the latest round of cuts after piece-by-piece reviews of each department's programs.
As he left City Hall Thursday night after a long day of explaining the plan, First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel smiled ruefully and wondered to a reporter if critics really liked it any better or were just worn out. In a city so demanding, the staying power that question implied would be no small achievement for the Mayor.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
How to Be Europe's Big Power Without Awakening the Old Fears?

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: BERLIN

 BODY:
Germans, it turns out, may be having a harder time than others at figuring out what to make of their recent commandeering of the common European policy toward Yugoslavia. Even the minimal fears that their audaciousness aroused abroad have proven distressing to the Germans, and they are now engaged in a debate over whether they might have been too assertive after all.
The hand-wringing is over the leading role Germany is taking not only in Yugoslavia, but in defending its economic and political interests throughout central Europe and in lobbying for aid for the impoverished republics that were once the Soviet Union. 
 Throughout the cold war, Germans lived with the principle that if they pursued their own interests too single-mindedly, or if their policies strayed from the European consensus, they risked arousing memories of the horrors of the last war.
That principle remains on German minds; there is also concern that the United States, caught in economic recession, may be turning increasingly inward, and that this will not help Europe in the long run. That concern was in the background when Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher helped to galvanize European interest in the conference held in Washington last month on aiding Eastern Europe.
The question of German assertiveness arose most dramatically in December and January, when Germany dragged the rest of the European Community into recognizing the secession of Croatia and Slovenia from Yugoslavia -- a move that officials in Washington, at the United Nations, and in some European capitals had resisted as an obstacle to achieving peace.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's efforts to address the criticism included a news conference last month at which he said Germany was now a nation of 80 million people in the center of Europe and would have to learn to live with such criticism the way it lives with the weather. Such remarks, however, quickly drew sharp domestic attacks. "Leaving Hitler aside," the weekly Stern said in an editorial last week, "you have to reach far back before you find a German government leader who expressed himself so provocatively and insensitively toward the outside world, on which we depend."
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung was more circumspect, warning that continued doubts in the West about German reliability would lead the Germans themselves to doubt their partners. "Paradoxically, what everyone feared and sought to avoid would then become reality," the newspaper wrote.
 
U.S. Encouragement
 American officials, on the other hand, showed themselves more than reluctant to isolate the Germans with excessive criticism. At a meeting attended by prominent members of the opposition Social Democrats, the American Ambassador, Robert M. Kimmitt, declared last week "that we welcome and value this German assertiveness in collective actions designed to achieve common goals and objectives." He urged Bonn to take a more forceful role in areas like Central America and Africa, and he urged the Social Democrats to drop objections to a broader military role in peacekeeping efforts. American officials said the remarks were prompted by concern that a perception in Germany that "it is damned if it does, and damned if it doesn't" could produce unpredictability.
But German officials make it clear that they find the whole discussion uncomfortable. "We're standing in a show window," said Hanns Schumacher, Mr. Genscher's spokesman. He complained that Germany was being judged with the "criteria of the traditional national state," when its situation is quite different.
Officials like Mr. Genscher like to stress that Germany's policy since the days of Konrad Adenauer has been embedded in the actions of supranational organizations like the European Community, NATO and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. This week, for example, the conference's foreign ministers meet in Prague to lay out, at German insistence, a timetable for bringing the old Soviet republics into the 35-nation organization.
Nevertheless, the forces that drive German foreign policy are becoming, as in most countries, increasingly parochial. The fear now haunting Germany is that the former Soviet republics, some having nuclear arms, could be the site of warfare over nationality issues, or of civilian nuclear accidents. Last week, Germany promised the republics a huge amount of aid to improve reactor safety, and Chancellor Kohl reiterated a frequent complaint that it made no sense for the West to provide humanitarian aid while the old Soviet republics discuss new armies in dimensions that could upset Europe's balance of forces.
Germans also fear an even greater migration to Germany than they are already undergoing, and this heightens support for xenophobic rightist parties. While formally maintaining the open-door policy, Bonn has quietly sought a temporary suspension of fresh approvals from an agency that approves migration requests for ethnic Germans in the former Soviet Union.
Domestic considerations work in other ways as well. Approval of friendship treaties with Czechoslovakia and Hungary have been held up for months out of deference to the so-called Sudeten Germans who were driven from Czechoslovakia after World War II and who have not forsaken their claims to property there. Last week, though, the Cabinet decided to sign the treaties within a month, showing that there is some resolve to override parochial interests if they impinge on broader national goals and Germany's reputation abroad.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Diplomacy's New Dance: U.S. and Many Partners

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
In the last two weeks Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has been swept up in a festival of multilateral diplomacy. First he convened 47 nations in Washington to help coordinate aid to the former Soviet Union; then he flew off to Moscow to bring together 36 more countries to promote regional cooperation between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East. Those two conferences alone spawned 10 different follow-up working groups, which will collect data and no doubt plan more meetings.
But this sudden flurry of many-sided meetings raises a fundamental question: Is the United States increasingly sharing responsibilities with a host of other countries because this is a more effective way to solve problems, or because this is a more effective way to dodge problems -- by creating the appearance of working on them without the reality? The answer is: both. 
 The relative decline in American wealth and power in recent years, and the fragmentation of the bipolar world, have increasingly forced Washington to try to conduct diplomacy with other people's money and with a lot of other people's help -- but without forfeiting its leadership role. This approach made its debut with the Persian Gulf war, in which United States, British and French Armies teamed up with Arab, German and Japanese money to defeat Iraq. The approach was also evident last week when President Bush, alongside President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, took part in the first summit meeting held by the United Nations Security Council.
But multilateral diplomacy worked in the war against Iraq because there was one essential ingredient: The United States knew exactly what it wanted and how far it was ready to go, and it demonstrated a willingness from the start to make the biggest sacrifice by sending its own men and women to fight and die. It was such clear American commitment, led by the President, for clear objectives, that gave Washington the moral credibility to make demands on its allies, as well as the right to claim -- unchallenged -- the mantle of leadership. It is precisely such a clarity of purpose or depth of commitment that have been lacking in the Russian aid and Middle East peace efforts.
The Middle East conference in Moscow was conceived by the Bush Administration as a vehicle to promote the separate bilateral negotiations between Israel and its immediate Arab neighbors -- Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians. The idea was that if Israel could get into a dialogue with the wider ring of Arab states, like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, it would feel more accepted and more willing to trade land for peace with its immediate neighbors. The Moscow conference did get Israel's Foreign Minister and the Saudi Foreign Minister to sit across from each other for the first time ever. That breakthrough should not be dismissed; it contains the seeds of all sorts of new relationships.
But these secondary relationships will not sprout until the core issue is addressed -- the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians -- and the Moscow conference only underscored how far the parties are from that. The Palestinians refused to attend because they insisted that their delegation be allowed to include Palestinians from all corners of their community: from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, from East Jerusalem and from the refugee diaspora. This was to underscore their point that they are a diverse nation and that the solution to their problem is some form of national homeland.
 
Having It Both Ways?
 The Israelis, however, insisted that their only responsibility was to speak with Palestinians under their occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and only about autonomy under continued Israeli rule. American officials say they sympathize with the Palestinians' problem: On the one hand the Israelis won't let them be represented by their chosen leaders, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and on the other hand they won't let them be represented by non-P.L.O. Palestinians from a full cross-section of their community. As Palestinian officials pointed out, Israel cannot have it both ways; if so, their negotiators will have no legitimacy. The reason the Israelis want it both ways, Israeli analysts acknowledge, is that they are still ambivalent about what, if anything, they want to offer the Palestinians now that talks with them are finally under way.
Mr. Baker did not want to confront Israel for fear of blowing up the peace process. But unless America serves as clarifier and arbiter, he most likely won't have a peace process on his hands, but rather a peace industrial complex -- a floating crap game of meetings, seminars and negotiations that never quite comes to closure.
The same ambivalence was evident at the Washington conference on Russian aid. At one level, the meeting succeeded. It got a lot of new countries involved in the aid effort and it forced Washington, out of sheer embarrassment, to increase its own contributions -- in order to answer Europeans who said the conference was just a gimmick to let the United States appear to be leading a global aid effort that would not cost Americans a dime. Even then, the American contribution of $645 million was modest, and the Administration still has not even explained where the money will come from. Robert Hormats, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, said the additional pledges at the conference did not add up to a "critical mass of support behind a clear-cut plan of action and bold Western commitment."
"If you think we are dealing with an historic opportunity, then you need a conference that produces historic results," he said. "This didn't."

Minoru Isutani realized part of a dream in 1990 when he bought the Pebble Beach golf resort, one of America's most famous, for a whopping $840 million. Now all he has to do is figure out how to pay for it. Originally the Japanese businessman had planned to sell 760 private memberships for $740,000 each, a feasible price for wealthy Japanese. But with the recession, the potential value of the memberships dwindled to $150,000. That meant that Mr. Isutani would have to sell so many memberships that an untouchable tradition at Pebble Beach -- public access -- would be threatened, and the California Coastal Commission rejected the plan. Mr. Isutani has a $400 million loan payment due later this year. A spokesman said last week that Mr. Isutani has not yet come up with a new plan for financing the purchase. In a recent interview with the San Francisco Examiner, Mr. Isutani admitted that he may have been a bit impulsive. "I bought the property with 50 percent of my business mind," he said, "and 50 percent of my golf mind."

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
New Bridgeport Mayor, Same Old Quagmire

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn.

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT Bridgeport's bankruptcy bid last summer, a young lawyer named Joseph P. Ganim hung around the edge of the furor, telling anyone who would listen that his city should not go down that unknown road.
He also said something that sounded odd to outsiders more familiar with the troubles of Connecticut's largest city than with its hold on the hearts of its long-suffering residents: he wanted to be Mayor. 
 Now Mr. Ganim, 32 years old, is Mayor. And he is ending the bankruptcy case, withdrawing the city's appeal of a Federal judge's decision that Bridgeport does not qualify -- not yet, at least -- for protection in his court.
But Mr. Ganim's election, and his decision to end the bankruptcy action, do not set Bridgeport right. The city, like scores of others in the Northeast and Midwest, has been declining for decades as basic industries moved to cheaper regions and the middle class to the suburbs. The bankruptcy action, filed last June by Mayor Mary Moran, was cast as a challenge to the state and Federal governments: this city has done what it can, and now it needs extraordinary help.
The action sunk Bridgeport's bond ratings, but did wonders for its reputation. Now it was a national symbol of urban distress. But little else has changed.
 
An Uncertain Year
 Mr. Ganim still faces the same $19.5 million budget gap that prompted his predecessor to make Bridgeport the nation's first large city to pursue bankruptcy. With residents already paying the highest property taxes in the state, and getting less than ever from them, he is no more ready to raise taxes than Mrs. Moran was. Just how Bridgeport will get through the year is no clearer now than last June.
One of Mayor Ganim's first efforts was to persuade the Chase Manhattan Corporation, which had just bought two of the city's largest banks, to keep its Connecticut headquarters in Bridgeport (the banking crisis has reduced the number of banks with headquarters here to 3, from 11). Then he played a leading role in efforts to keep the failing University of Bridgeport open through its spring semester.
Now he faces a Feb. 13 deadline for giving the Bridgeport Financial Review Board, the state agency that has overseen the city's finances since 1988, his plan to cover the shortfall in this year's $320 million budget. Half of that sum appears attainable within City Hall, through measures including a plan to recover delinquent property taxes by selling tax liens to a a private collection agency. For the remainder, Mr. Ganim is counting heavily on concessions from the city's unions, whose contracts were a main target of the bankruptcy suit, and whatever aid the state can offer.
Ending the bankruptcy appeal, Mr. Ganim said, has healed the city's relations with the state, which fiercely opposed bankruptcy. "It's easier to help somebody if they're asking for help, instead of telling you you have to help them," he said.
The chairman of the review board, William Cibes, who is also Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s budget director, said at a recent board meeting, "The good faith shown by the Mayor in withdrawing the bankruptcy action has certainly created a climate of greater cooperation with the state."
But the state has not offered any direct grant to help close the budget gap, said one of Mr. Cibes's chief aides, Douglas M. Cutler. "We're basically hampered by the state's own financial problems," Mr. Cutler said.
Instead, the state may take over maintenance of some city roads and bridges, and assume responsibility for the railroad station and possibly the city jail. Those measures, Mr. Cutler said, would remove some costs from the city's budget while insuring that important facilities do not deteriorate because of finances.
The long-term strategy for Bridgeport, everyone agrees, is economic development, to replace the jobs and tax base lost as large factories closed or left.
 
Plans for the Harbor
 "Bridgeport's economic crisis cannot be resolved by the city just cutting its budget," said Paul S. Timpanelli, president of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council. The council wants to attract small manufacturers to the old industrial area that extends north from the harbor. The plan also calls for tourist attractions, but he acknowledges that such development lies years in the future.
The state's long-range efforts are centered in the Greater Bridgeport Regional Economic Development Commission, headed by the state's economic development commissioner, Joseph J. McGee. The commission is trying to identify common development goals for the city and its suburbs and ways to further them.
"We want to get past stigmatizing the city of Bridgeport, because we have a regional economy that crosses town boundaries," Mr. McGee said.
Jacquelyn C. Durrell, the First Selectwoman of neighboring Fairfield, said efforts at regional cooperation had revived since Mr. Ganim's election, and pointed to a regional anti-car theft program as one result.
"As goes Bridgeport, go all of us," she said of the suburbs' developing sense of identification with the city. "Two or three years ago, there were not many people on suburban streets who had lost their jobs."
But Bridgeport's $19.5 million shortfall, and a requirement that it balance its budget, must first be tackled. And Mr. Ganim, like Mrs. Moran before him, wants to avoid both layoffs and higher property taxes.
Those goals are not unreasonable, said Kathleen Burke, executive director of the Management Advisory Committee, a partnership between the city and business council that has helped reorganize and modernize the city's administration in 1988.
In a City Hall where the planning department, in recent years, has gone from 10 employees to 1, there aren't many people left to be laid off, she said. Under the financial review board's supervision, she said, "The budget has been balanced every year until now. But at what cost?"
Cesar A. Batalla, president of the city's Puerto Rican Coalition, is encouraged by the Mayor's success in mending fences in Hartford and finding allies in Washington.
But only the Federal Government, he fears, can turn around Bridgeport. "Washington," he said, "has to say to cities, 'We need you to be what you were before.' "

HEADLINE: BUSH AND YELTSIN DECLARE FORMAL END TO COLD WAR; AGREE TO EXCHANGE VISITS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today proclaimed a new era of "friendship and partnership" as they declared a formal end to seven decades of rivalry, then agreed to exchange visits in Moscow and Washington by year's end.
Meeting in casual winter clothes under snowy skies at the Presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., the two leaders reviewed the prospects for further support for Mr. Yeltsin's program of reforms and for arms control proposals that could reduce the number of nuclear warheads that each nation deploys to as few as 2,500. 
 But they indicated at a news conference after their three-and-a-half-hour meeting that no agreements had been reached on either issue, and that the matters would be taken up this winter. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d will visit Moscow this month to establish the basis for further arms talks, Mr. Bush said.
 
Restatement of Principles
 The centerpiece of the meeting was a declaration signed by the two men that outlined general principles for relations between the United States and Russia. The declaration was largely a restatement of cooperative policies established between Washington and Moscow before the Soviet Union collapsed and Mikhail S. Gorbachev resigned as Soviet President at the end of December. [The text of the declaration and excerpts from the news conference appear on page 8.]
But by endorsing and signing the statement today, Mr. Bush lent prestige to Mr. Yeltsin as the leader of Russia, giving him a boost of the sort Mr. Gorbachev often gained in his trips abroad.
"Russia and the United States do not regard each other as potential adversaries," the declaration says. "From now on, the relationship will be characterized by friendship and partnership founded on mutual trust and respect and a common commitment to democracy and economic freedom."
 
Many Advisers on Both Sides
 The two leaders were accompanied to Camp David by senior aides, including a roster of advisers to Mr. Yeltsin who are largely unknown to most Americans. They included the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev; Marshal Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, who commands the combined military of the Commonwealth of Independent States; Yuli M. Vorontsov, chief Russian delegate to the United Nations; Yevgeny P. Velikhov, deputy chairman of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and Vladimir P. Lukin, the Ambassador-designate to Washington.
With Mr. Bush were Mr. Baker; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser; Robert S. Strauss, the American Ambassador to Russia, and Dennis Ross, the director of the policy planning office at the State Department and Mr. Baker's senior adviser on Russia.
The only new issue of substance to emerge from the session appeared to be an offer by Mr. Bush to set up a joint center in which American scientists would pursue research with some of the 2,000 or more Russian nuclear experts who are being displaced by Mr. Yeltsin's sharp military cutbacks.
Mr. Yeltsin said he enthusiastically supported the proposal, which is aimed at preventing the scientists from selling their services to terrorists or other nations seeking to develop a nuclear arsenal. Russia has already begun offering raises and other benefits to the scientists to keep them from leaving, he said.
At the news conference, the two leaders warmly praised each other's leadership.
The American President said he has "a very warm feeling in my heart about what he has done and is trying to do, and I consider him my friend." In return, he received effusive praise from his guest.
 
'Tremendously Impressed'
 "I consider I would be very lucky in life, both as a political person and just as a man, to have met George Bush," Mr. Yeltsin said. "I'm just tremendously impressed by his wisdom. I think he has incredible qualities not only as a political person but also as a person, as a really great political figure of the United States."
Later, perhaps with a measure of pride, he said: "We call each other on the telephone. We say Boris and say George. And already this says a lot."
Translating affability into substance, the two leaders said the enmity that had separated their countries over most of seven decades was ended.
As Mr. Yeltsin put it: "Today one might say that there has been written and drawn a new line, and crossed out all of the things that have been associated with the cold war.
"From now on we do not consider ourselves to be potential enemies, as it had been previously in our military doctrine. This is the historic value of this meeting. And another very important factor in our relationship, right away today, it's already been pointed out that in the future there'll be full frankness, full openness, full honesty in our relationship."
Mr. Bush said: "Russia and the United States are charting a new relationship, and it's based on trust; it's based on a commitment to economic and political freedom; it's based on a strong hope for true partnership."
Yet for Mr. Bush, the embrace sometimes remained at arm's length, especially when nuclear weapons came up.
Mr. Yeltsin discussed the possibility of cutting strategic and tactical nuclear warheads to 2,500 for each nation. That figure, which Mr. Yelstin proposed earlier this week, is roughly half the number that Mr. Bush suggested retaining in a proposal he made in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.
Mr. Bush said he had agreed only that further cuts in nuclear weapons would be taken up when Mr. Baker goes back to Moscow. "We didn't go into any agreements on categories or numbers, but we decided that we would let the experts talk about this in much more detail," Mr. Bush said. "But we saluted his very broad proposals."
He also refused to say whether the United States had reciprocated Mr. Yeltsin's decision, made public last week, to cease aiming nuclear missiles and bombers at American targets.
"We agreed all these matters will be discussed in Moscow," he said.
Similarly, Mr. Yeltsin said he and Mr. Bush had discussed developing a global space-based defense against nuclear missiles "on a mutual basis," perhaps in conjunction with other nuclear nations. But Mr. Bush said only that they had reached no decision and that their aides would take it up later.
Although President Ronald Reagan began research on a defense against incoming missiles with a pledge to share the technology with the Soviet Union, Mr. Bush has so far ruled out any transfer of missile-defense secrets.
Although he made no specific pledges, Mr. Bush was more positive in his support for Mr. Yeltsin's political and economic reforms, saying he was "totally convinced" of Russia's commitment to democracy and hoped to assist "in any way possible."
 
Money, and More . . .
 Mr. Yeltsin said that his country needed far more than money if it was to make the transition to democracy, and that the cost of failure would be great.
"I didn't come here just to stretch out my hand and ask for help," the Russian President said. "No, we're calling for cooperation, cooperation for the whole world, because if the reform in Russia goes under, that means there will be a cold war. The cold war is going to turn into a hot war. This is, again, going to be an arms race."
Back in Washington after the Camp David meeting, Mr. Yeltsin met for an hour and 10 minutes with Congressional leaders, and the lawmakers said the conversation focused on economic reform and the assistance that Russia and the other former Soviet republics need. Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, the House majority leader, said Mr. Yeltsin "delivered a loud, clear message that if there's going to be help, it needs to come now."
Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, the minority leader, said of Mr. Yeltsin: "He may be the last hope. That's the message he gave us. This may be the last chance."
While he was in Washington, Mr. Yeltsin also presented a medal to Mstislav Rostropovich, the Russian emigre cellist and conductor, who suggested that he would perform more and more in his homeland in the years ahead and live part of the time there.
Mr. Rostropovich left the Soviet Union after being barred from performing, and became conductor of the National Symphony here, vowing not to return while his homeland remained under Communism. He did return when Communism collapsed, and was on a visit to Moscow during the unsuccessful coup against Mr. Gorbachev last summer where he joined Mr. Yeltsin's supporters in defending the Russian Parliament.
Mr. Yeltsin left Washington about 4:40 P.M. to fly to Ottawa for a meeting with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Yeltsin and Mulroney Meet
 OTTAWA, Feb. 1 (Special to The New York Times) -- President Yeltsin made the final stop of his three-day visit to North America in the Canadian capital today for talks with Canada's Prime Minister.
On arrival from Washington, Mr. Yeltsin broke away from Mr. Mulroney and other Canadian officials to talk briefly with spectators who had gathered at the airport to greet him in the sub-zero weather. "We're not here to quarrel, we're here to do business," Mr. Yeltsin said. "We come not as enemies, but as allies."

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Why Mainstream Economists Expect a Recovery This Time

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
To meddle or not to meddle? For President Bush and many in Congress, the question of speeding the economic recovery has become a question of electoral survival. Hardly anyone who serves at the voters' pleasure, it seems, is ready to defend the patient approach. But even as the juggernaut for economic stimulus gathers strength, the economics establishment, led by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is digging in.
Mainstream economists acknowledge that they were far off the mark in predicting a recovery last year. And many say they may be wrong again in 1992. "There's an above-average risk the consensus forecast is too optimistic," said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office. 
 Yet in spite of last week's discouraging news on factory orders and unemployment benefit claims, there are reasons to believe that the economy is poised for a modest recovery. Most forecasters expect December's sharp cuts in interest rates to bear fruit by midyear, yielding a 3 to 4 percent growth rate in the second half of 1992.
And if the economy does fail to show signs of coming alive by spring, they say the loss is likely to be measured in a few months' delay in growth and a few tenths of a percentage point in the unemployment rate.
 
'Tax Cut Could Be Lethal'
 By contrast, they insist that moving too far, too fast could seriously damage the economy. Their worries focus on a budget-busting tax reduction. "A tax cut would be lethal," said Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, "or at least deleterious to long-term economic objectives."
It is no mystery why many Americans are pounding the table for tax relief, or why politicians want to deliver that relief very soon. What most analysts, including Mr. Greenspan, predicted would be a shallow downturn -- a pause after the longest economic expansion in American history -- has metastasized into a nasty recession of exceptional staying power.
Measured by the book, Mr. Reischauer notes, the recession came and went in a mere 11 months, from the summer of 1990 to the spring of 1991, while the unemployment rate peaked at a relatively benign 7 percent. But in this case, he insists, the book is misleading.
In the year preceding the downturn, economic growth averaged but 1 percent. And while the economy has been creeping back since the recession hit bottom last summer, the forward momentum has barely been measurable. "We slithered into this recession," Mr. Reischauer said, "and we've been bouncing around the trough for months."
The persistence of the recession has broadened and deepened its impact. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 15 percent of the labor force was out of work for some portion of 1990 and that 17 percent was in 1991. Meanwhile, the gap between actual output and total productive capacity has ballooned to 4.8 percent -- roughly the average for postwar recessions -- and is still growing.
For the last three years, forecasters have been saying that happy days will be here within six months. What reason is there to believe that they will be right this time around, and what makes Mr. Greenspan so content to tread softly?
The public has every right to be skeptical. Forecasts generated by computer models rely on the highly questionable assumption that the economic world does not change in ways not captured by the underlying equations. And the fact that almost all forecasts agree that a moderate recovery is around the corner should not inspire great confidence. While each computer model sports its own bells and whistles, the key equations of all the models are remarkably similar. These relate consumer spending and business investment to such policy variables as the supply of bank credit and government outlays.
 
Explanations After the Fact
 What forecasters can do, however, is tell more or less plausible stories about the unique factors that led their models astray in 1991 and explain why the models are not likely to fail in 1992. This time, the stories center on the crisis in confidence.
Consumers' willingness to spend and businesses' willingness to invest are linked in part to the confidence people have in the economy. To the degree confidence can be predicted from variables that can be observed and measured -- say, unemployment and mortgage rates -- the computer models can take account of this psychological factor.
But John Taylor, a Stanford University researcher who until recently served on President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged, "We just don't understand confidence problems." Roger Brinner, the chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a forecasting firm in Massachusetts, agrees. "The free fall in confidence exceeds anything that can be explained by economic variables," he wrote in December.
 
The Risk of Bad News
 The promised 1992 recovery could, of course, be bushwacked by unpredictably bad news. But there are common-sense reasons to believe that the stage is better set for growth than it was a year ago. Mr. Reischauer of the Congressional Budget Office notes that by objective measures, credit is easy to obtain. The Federal Reserve has pushed the bellwether Federal funds interest rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- down a full 4 percentage points since the fall of 1990, substantially more than in earlier recessions of comparable severity.
David Wyss, the research director at DRI/McGraw-Hill, notes that the economy's failure to pick up since the Federal Reserve moved to lower rates in December proves little. It takes six to nine months to feel the full effect of a change in monetary policy, he said.
When it does hit, the impact should be felt in two ways. As in previous recoveries, easier money will make it more attractive for businesses to invest and for consumers to buy. But unlike previous recoveries, much of the gains should be come through increased competitiveness in world markets.
 
Some Help for Exports
 Lower interest rates have made it less attractive to hold assets in dollar securities by pushing down the dollar's exchange rate against other leading currencies. That, in turn, is making American exports cheaper for foreigners and imports less competitive in domestic markets.
"Fully half the gain from a reduction in interest rates now comes through the trade balance," said C. Fred Bergsten, the head of the Institute for International Economics.
If all goes according to Hoyle, DRI/ McGraw-Hill expects an upturn in the spring and solid growth in the last half of 1992. The Congressional Budget Office agrees, estimating an overall growth rate of gross domestic product of 1.6 percent in 1992 and 3.6 percent in 1993.
That would certainly be good in comparison with the eight-tenths of 1 percent increase for 1991. But is it good enough? Most recessions have been followed by a burst of very rapid growth that quickly closed the gap between output and productive capacity. Not this time, though: Under the Budget Office scenario for this recession, unemployment would remain above 6 percent until well into 1995.
Why, then, not push a little harder, using fiscal stimulus to speed the recovery? Most economists agree that with enormous excess capacity in industries ranging from construction to retailing, and with labor running scared, there seems little risk of pressure on product prices or wages. "Inflation is not a problem," Mr. Wyss of DRI/McGraw-Hill said flatly.
What is a problem in the minds of economists is the budget deficit. While many would be pleased to see a quick, one-shot surge in Federal aid to local governments or a temporary cut in taxes, they do not believe Washington is capable of taking back in 1993 what it hands out in 1992. Those who speculate in bonds are equally skeptical: long-term interest rates have risen substantially in the wake of talk about tax cuts, apparently reflecting the market's fear that the deficit will rise and more borrowing will be needed to finance Washington.
In the post-Reagan years, says Mr. Aaron of the Brookings Institution, issues of macroeconomic policy have been overshadowed by the imperative for self-discipline in government. "It's political economy," he concluded, "not pure economy."

HEADLINE: U.S. STARTS RETURN OF HAITI REFUGEES AFTER JUSTICES ACT

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Hours after the Supreme Court lifted an injunction that barred the forced return of Haitian exiles, the United States today began sending refugees back to Haiti from the American Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
About 150 Haitians boarded a Coast Guard cutter this afternoon for the trip to Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, said Lieut. Comdr. Gordon Hume, spokesman for the Joint Task Force managing the Haitian exile crisis, in an interview from Guantanamo. 
 Haitians have been crowding into boats to flee a nation in political and economic turmoil since the military coup against the elected Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Sept. 30. At least two-thirds of those who have fled have not been permitted to apply for asylum in the United States because the Bush Administration considers them to be economic migrants, not political refugees.
 
'Ready to Go Back'
 More than 10,000 Haitians are in custody at Guantanamo, and more asylum-seekers are on cutters offshore. The task force spokesman said the first Haitians to return today were exiles who said they were "ready to go back." About 400 had returned voluntarily through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
The repatriations, by means of the 12-to-14-hour boat trip from Cuba to Haiti, come within a week of the Bush Administration's strong condemnation of growing political violence in Haiti and the recall of the United States Ambassador, Alvin P. Adams Jr.
Mr. Adams's recall followed an attack by policemen in civilian clothes on a political meeting on Jan. 25. The meeting had been called by Rene Theodore, who was nominated to be Prime Minister in a compromise that was seen just a few weeks ago as the first step to the restoration of civilian government after difficult negotiations.
A political solution to Haiti's problems no longer seems possible at least in the short term, officials in the Administration and the Organization of American States appear to agree.
In the first comprehensive human rights report since the September coup, Amnesty International said in January that Haitians were living in "a climate of fear and repression."
"Hundreds of people have been extrajudicially executed or detained without warrant and tortured," the report said. "Many others have been brutally beaten in the streets. Freedom of the press has been severely curtailed and property is being destroyed by members of the military or the police forces."
An economic embargo imposed by the United States and other members of the O.A.S. has added to the problems of Haitians, who are the poorest people in the Western Hemisphere. The embargo was intended to cripple or at least inconvenience the military Government in the hope that it would be more amenable to negotiations.
But many Haitians say that the embargo has struck hardest at ordinary citizens, who are without public transportation because of a shortage of fuel and have lost jobs as factories close. Members of Congress have expressed concern that food, medicine and potable water shortages may soon become acute.
Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn and a member of the House subcommittee on international law, immigration and refugees, said in an interview today that he would try to get legislation to the floor of the House in the next two weeks to grant "temporary protected status" to Haitians. That would allow them to remain in the United States or in American custody at Guantanamo until the political crisis in Haiti ends.
Mr. Schumer will also seek to set aside 2,000 slots in refugee quotas for Haitians with genuine fears of persecution, which would allow them to remain in the United States indefinitely.
"People all over the world look up to the Statue of Liberty," he said. "If America is going to start shipping people back, it will be a signal that America has changed. It's no longer the beacon of freedom."
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, said in an interview Friday that the embargo was "punishing those who are the most vulnerable."
"Those who were attempting to block deportations have the best of motivations, but the practical impact would be very dangerous," he said. "Thousands of Haitians were interpreting the court's delaying actions to take to small and dangerous boats."
Repatriation of Haitians from Guantanamo resumed after a month of delays caused by repeated injunctions against the forced return of Haitians picked up at sea.
Concerned that as many as 20,000 more Haitians were preparing to leave their country, the Bush Administration sought an emergency order from the Supreme Court to lift the ban imposed by a Federal District judge in Miami.
Without comment, the Supreme Court voted 6 to 3 late Friday night to lift the stay. Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and the court's newest member, Clarence Thomas, opposed the action.
Earlier in the day it appeared that the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, had ruled in favor of the Administration on the constitutional merits of forced repatriations, overturning a lower-court ruling. But hours later, the Atlanta court rescinded its order, saying that it had been issued prematurely in error.
While the Supreme Court's action a permitted the Government to begin the deportations, it did not decide the repatriation issue on its merits. If that issue is appealed to the Supreme Court, it would not be decided before next year.
At Guantanamo, Lieutenant Commander Hume said the order to begin assisting in the return of Haitians came this afternoon. The last forced repatriation of Haitians took place on Nov. 18 and 19, when 538 asylum-seekers were returned.
More than 15,000 Haitians have been picked up by the United States Coast Guard since Oct. 29, when a trickle of refugees began to turn into significant numbers, as it became apparent that the exiled President was unlikely to return soon. Coast Guard interdictions at sea were at their highest in January, when 6,653 Haitians were rescued.
Many Haitians are believed to have drowned in their attempts to reach Florida in very small and usually unseaworthy boats, the Coast Guard says.
About one-third of the Haitians intercepted at sea have been found by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to have a plausible case for asylum, which entitles them to land in the United States and lodge a formal asylum appeal.
The State Department had announced this week that it would introduce a program in Haiti under which would-be refugees could seek permission to go directly to the United States if they were found to have a credible fear of persecution. Being granted refugee status abroad insures resettlement legally in the United States. Asylum, a different legal category, can be obtained only after an applicant arrives on American soil without legal standing but with fears of persecution.

Old-Time Politician Tells the Truth, Maybe

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORRILTON, Ark.

 BODY:
For years, there was talk that the elections in Conway County were rigged. But there was never any hard evidence.
Then, a few weeks ago, 200 forged paper ballots from a 1968 Democratic primary were discovered in a Piggly Wiggly grocery sack in the attic of a house once owned by a deputy sheriff, who died in 1974. 
 The discovery coincided with the publication of a book, "How I Stole Elections," by Marlin Hawkins, the Conway County sheriff and the tax collector from 1950 to 1978.
Mr. Hawkins, now 78 years old, was also head of the Conway County Democratic Party for 25 years. While he admits in his book that he paid voters' poll taxes (although he does not mention that all the voters were Democrats), took care of traffic tickets for college students and witnessed ballot stuffing by others, he denies tampering with ballots to win elections.
In short, Mr. Hawkins contends that he "stole elections" by providing favors and good services to county residents.
In a recent interview at his home, Mr. Hawkins said his adversaries are linking him to the 1968 ballots to hamper sales of his book, which he published himself and sells from his home here, advertising it with a small sign on the main highway in town.
"I didn't know any more about those ballots than you did," Mr. Hawkins said in the interview. "I don't want anyone accusing me of violating the law. I stole elections by helping my neighbor."
Mr. Hawkins is in poor health after living through a plane crash and two auto accidents, suffering a broken hip in another accident and undergoing heart surgery, but his combative spirit is a strong as ever. And no one disputes the commitment he had to his constituents.
As sheriff and county tax collector Mr. Hawkins donated food and clothes to the poor, drove the sick to the doctor in the middle of the night and found jobs for the unemployed, including his wife, nephew and son, all of whom he put to work at the sheriff's office. Through his contacts with state officials and members of Congress, he made sure that the roads were paved, and he donated 20 acres for a vocational-technical school. He never lost an election.
But during his first two decades in office he was the target of six grand jury investigations and a Congressional committee inquiry into accusations of election tampering, bid rigging and converting county money to personal use. He was indicted only once, for false pretense, in connection with a state highway construction contract, and was acquitted. In 1968, Mr. Hawkins was ordered by the courts to repay $10,000 in unaccounted for bail bonds and fees that he had collected for the county.
He admits in his book that he forged 100 ballots in 1946 for a friend who was running for governor, Bryan Sims, who lost. "I regret it to this day," Mr. Hawkins wrote.
But any ballot tampering in the 1968 election was "finagling" behind his back, Mr. Hawkins said in the interview.
Eight races were on the ballot in the 1968 primary election in Conway County, including one to fill the office of prosecuting attorney for a five-county district. Robert E. Irwin lost that election by 23 votes to a candidate endorsed by Mr. Hawkins, and immediately asked the county election committee for a recount. But the committee members, most of them Mr. Hawkins's friends, rejected the request, saying they had full confidence in the election officials.
"We knew what was happening but we couldn't prove it," said Mr. Irwin, now a 61-year-old lawyer in nearby Russellville. "They'd just make enough extra votes for what they needed to win. You have to understand the climate there in Conway County. There were no elections in which the vote people cast came out that way. Of course Marlin Hawkins was involved. Absolutely. His book is a fairy tale because he never told the truth in politics or otherwise."
Jack Bland, the county clerk who oversaw the 1968 election, said of the ballot discovery, "I'm just dumbfounded about it." Mr. Bland was charged with destroying ballots in a 1975 Conway County special election held to replace a state senator convicted of tax evasion, but the charges were dropped in exchange for Mr. Bland's resignation in 1978.
After the 200 ballots were found in the attic, the Morrilton police began an inquiry, but quickly ended it, saying the six-year statute of limitations on ballot fraud had expired.
"All this does is prove that the allegations had a basis and the corruption was here," said Larry Miller, a Conway County native and reporter for The Petit Jean Country Headlight, the local newspaper. "A group of people here now are saying we're wanting out of this. We're trying to bury our past."
Yet Mr. Hawkins's book and the recovered ballots serve as a reminder of change.
Mr. Hawkins, meanwhile, said the "art of politics" rarely changes. "There will always be finagling of elections," Mr. Hawkins said.
Then he added: "Someone once told me, 'Sheriff, you need voting machines.' I told them, 'Hell, I don't need voting machines. I've got one.' "

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Not a Gorbachev Waltz, But a Yeltsin Quickstep

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The President from Moscow went to Camp David. He talked to President Bush about arms control, economic reform and world peace. He received high-powered members of Congress at his embassy. He roared through town in his Zil limousine surrounded by security agents in fur hats. He pressed the flesh on a Washington street corner.
It was a familiar, almost predictable sequence of events. But this was Boris N. Yeltsin, not Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and if it was East-West summitry, then it was in miniature. 
 Thousands thronged downtown Washington at lunchtime to see Mr. Gorbachev, who made unannounced street-corner stops his political trademark on two visits here. Today, about 20 people huddled on a windy corner near the spot where Mr. Yeltsin's helicopter was to land, most of them caught up by the roadblock with little idea of who was arriving.
And it all took place in about six hours instead of two or three days, a speed more appropriate for two of Mr. Bush's golf rounds than for a Russian leader's visit, as Mr. Yeltsin hurtled today through his hastily arranged and even more hastily executed visit to the capital.
There was a formal paper to sign, the "Camp David Declaration," in which Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Bush promised their nations would stop being "potential adversaries" and become friends. There was a sense that this was a significant moment in the two countries' new relationship.
But there were no long receiving lines and glittery state dinners at the White House. The Marine Corps Band was not there to play "Ruffles and Flourishes." There was no red carpet or color guard. All that will be saved for the "real" Bush-Yeltsin summit meeting, to be held here in the spring.
Today's quick trip seemed intended by both sides to have Mr. Yeltsin touch all of Mr. Gorbachev's bases and let the world know that the new Russian President was taking over all of the former Soviet President's roles, including the up-close-and-personal relationship with Mr. Bush.
"Gorbachev went to Camp David, so Yeltsin's going to Camp David," a White House aide had said on Friday. "Gorbachev met with the Congressional leadership, so Yeltsin's going to do that. We want to make sure that we know he knows we're taking him seriously."
 
He's Come a Long Way

In his autobiography, "Against the Grain," Mr. Yeltsin writes of his childhood in rural Russia: "We lived in near poverty, in a small house, with one cow. We did have a horse, but when it died, we were left without an animal to pull the plow."
In 1935, the cow died too.
Fifty-seven years later, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, Russia's answer to the prairie populist, spent more than three hours with George Herbert Walker Bush at Camp David, the hideaway in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland that is one of the enduring symbols of American Presidential power.
As they drove away in one of Mr. Bush's beloved golf carts, the two Presidents seemed an odd pairing. Mr. Bush, the product of Andover and Yale, drove, with Mr. Yeltsin, with his silver hair and prizefighter looks, sitting beside him and looking just a bit ill at ease in his Camp David-correct turquoise golf shirt and casual tan jacket. Mrs. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin's wife, Naina, followed along in another golf cart, this one driven by a Secret Service agent.
During the meeting, Mr. Bush gave Mr. Yeltsin a pair of hand-tooled cowboy boots from Houston that bore a silver map of Russia and American and Russian flags. The American President also produced a birthday cake with one candle for the Russian President, who turned 61 today.
But Mr. Yeltsin did not seem interested in gifts. "The best present is meeting President George Bush at Camp David," he told reporters as he arrived at the retreat.
 
First Things First

As Mr. Yeltsin returned to Washington from Camp David, he paused between his Zil limousine and the Marine Corps helicopter that had delivered him, with the seal of the American President on its door.
He looked at the car that was to whisk him away to a meeting with lawmakers.
He looked at the small crowd that had gathered nearby chanting, "Boris! Boris! Boris!"
He looked back at the car.
The Congressional leaders were waiting.
In a split second, the instincts of the populist politician took over and Mr. Yeltsin, grinning broadly, walked over to the crowd. "Spasibo," he shouted his thanks as he moved along, shaking hands and submitting to picture taking. "Spasibo. Spasibo."
"The man's got a strong handshake," said an enthused Steven Frost, a firefighter from Redding, Calif., who happened to wander by and described himself as "optimistically skeptical" at all the talk of Russian-American friendship. "He's O.K. We can talk to him."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
After Ordeal, Is Clinton Tempered Now, or Burned?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
After attending the father-daughter party at the Little Rock Y.W.C.A. on Thursday night, Bill and Chelsea Clinton went home to the Arkansas Governor's Mansion and the 11-year-old taught her father a card game called "Spite and Malice."
"It is a game which is quite appropriate for the last few days," Mr. Clinton said dryly. 
 As the campaign's faltering golden boy, Mr. Clinton has been forced to endure shots from Republican and Democratic rivals on the fidelity issue. But for public consumption, Mr. Clinton acts more worried about his weight -- "I'm getting fat as a wood tick" -- than the fate of his campaign, even though, as he says with a grim smile, "the money merchants are still combing the back alleys."
It has been a week since he was strafed by what the aides commissioned to generate sympathy for him call "tabloid terrorism," and he watched his campaign teeter amid charges by Gennifer Flowers in the newspaper Star that he had a 12-year affair with her and helped her get an Arkansas state job, an account he denies.
The candidate, whose pouty expression, sandpapery voice and Elvis imitations have led photographers to dub him "Elvis," appears laid back, as the squadron of strategists around him buttonhole reporters to suggest that he has come through his trial by fire stronger than ever. And Mr. Clinton has begun to suggest that voters will relate to his confession of imperfection.
 
Keeping Worries at Bay
 "Have you heard that song, 'I Ain't Going to Worry No More' by Ray Charles and Ronnie Milsap?" Mr. Clinton asks reporters traveling on his small plane, singing a few bars in a voice hoarse from allergies. "That should be our campaign song. As long as there's moonlight in Virginia, there ain't nothing to worry about."
Mr. Clinton's poll taker, Stan Greenberg, put it differently, but no less hopefully. He said that as long as voters believed the candidate had not lied and that his marriage was "real," that they will not turn on him.
Hillary Clinton, in vivid appearances on television and in the latest campaign commercials, has tried to foster the image of a "genuine" marriage, Mr. Greenberg said.
"I'm not sure people aren't right when they say she is the one who ought to be running," Mr. Clinton said of his wife, in an interview here before the Democratic debate on Friday. "You know, we like each other. You can watch me watch her speak sometimes, and I've got the Nancy Reagan adoring look."
"I think she's one good argument for voting for me," he added.
Mr. Clinton launched into a stream-of-consciousness tribute: "If the choice for us, is my having gotten a divorce a couple years ago and being single and going up to New Hampshire and winnning and being free of this almost unbelievable set of behaviors to which I and my family and our friends have been subjected, but ultimately being nominated and going on to the White House, or just going home to the rest of my life with her and Chelsea, I think now everybody in America ought to be able to see why I would choose to go home.
"I think she's just been extraordinary," he said in a rare reference to the embarrassing situation his wife has faced. "One of the reasons that I guess I'm in elected office and she isn't is, she's always wanted to guard her privacy much more, and I've always kind of hated to have to discuss some of the things that we have discussed in the last few weeks. If I learned anything it's like every other challenge that I've ever seen her face, she was able to rise to it."
He said he and Chelsea watched his wife's appearance on "Prime Time Live" on Thursday night. "Kids today, if they're given the kind of emotional support they need, if they know they're important and they're good and their folks are committed to them, they can deal with reality better sometimes than we think they can," he said.
Mr. Clinton says he believes it will be ineffective for his opponents to try to turn his confession of past troubles in his marriage into a political noose.
"Most people down deep inside always want to do better, and most people down deep inside know that we're all imperfect, that even the very best lives are a daily lifelong struggle for integrity, for continuing to do better," he said, sinking back in the seat of a car taking him from airport to hotel. "Remember that great story about Oliver Wendell Holmes in his 90's, and a law clerk asked him why he was straining his eyes reading an old dog-eared copy of 'Plato's Republic'? And he said, 'I'm doing it to improve my mind.'
"I feel that way about character. It's about the continuing search for belief and conviction and action and the ability not to disappoint yourself as well as others. It's a lifelong process. And I think that people know that different folks have different difficulties to deal with, but they identify with people who seem to be on the journey."
On the road, Mr. Clinton's manner is in stark contrast to that of Gary Hart, after the charges involving Donna Rice charges erupted in his Presidential campaign.
Where Mr. Hart would cringe whenever anyone would try to take his picture with an attractive blonde, Mr. Clinton does not censor his behavior. When a pretty blonde with a black puppy came up to the candidate in Hampton, N.H., the other day, the pack of photographers exploded in a burst of picture-taking fervor.
Mr. Clinton did not rush, and took several minutes to talk to the young woman and cuddle her puppy.
 
The 'Elvis' Look
 When his former classmate at Yale Law School, Douglas Eakley, introduced Mr. Clinton at a fund-raising event in West Orange, N.J., on Wednesday night by saying that they had shared a bachelor pad on the beach in their first year at Yale, the audience giggled and ooohhhed, and Mr. Eakley chastised them, "Can't you get your mind on the issues?"
The candidate was not flustered. He offered his trademark "Elvis" look, featured heavily in his commercials, of biting his lower lip and crinkling his eyes a bit, a look meant to convey an appealing combination of decency and deviltry.
"Elvis," he explained later, "was the major cultural figure of my childhood and my neighbor in Mississippi and later in Memphis. I like the comparisons."
On the plane, when he was not reading articles about his campaign, he tried, as usual, to charm every man and woman in his path, finding just the right compliment or common ground for each.
In the middle of a photo session at a T-shirt factory in Salem, N.N., Mr. Clinton caught the eye of Patrick Bruchet, a photographer for the magazine Paris Match, and took several moments to discuss the theory of French socialism and health plans in the books of Jacques Attali, the former economic adviser to President Francois Mitterrand.
The Clinton campaign has the eerie feeling of a drama being played out in two dimensions: At stops this week in New Hampshire, New Jersey and Arkansas, the professed feeling among aides was that Mr. Clinton has triumphed in the first round against the tabloids.
The Clinton campaign was a din of spin. James Carville, the fast-talking gonzo strategist wearing jeans with holes so large his underwear was leaking out in the back, pinned reporters to their chairs with a wall of words. "In Washington, you get stories that this is a beleaguered campaign. WOW! No! No! No! People in Washington are not people. They're human beings and all, but they're not people. Washington is never right about anything. Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Look at the polls -- have you ever seen a front-runner get out of the race?"
But in Washington, Democratic Party leaders and elected officials were very nervous and fearful that there could be another slipper yet to drop.
Could one more disclosure tilt voters against the candidate? Is there a subterranean Puritanism that public opinion polls are not picking up right now?
Democrats and Republicans are divided about whether Mr. Clinton has been fatally wounded, or whether he has shrewdly inoculated himself.
 
Barbs Grow Sharper
 Mr. Clinton's Democratic opponents, seemingly frantic at not being able to get any traction from his troubles, grew sharper as the week wore on.
On Wednesday night, John Durkin, a former New Hampshire Senator, introduced Senator Tom Harkin at a labor rally in Manchester, saying, "I don't care much about Bill Clinton's infidelity in his domstic life." But Mr. Durkin said he did care about Mr. Clinton's "infidelity" to the environment, working people and the middle class.
Senator Bob Kerrey, who is divorced, raised the subject by complaining that Mr. Clinton had implied that working out a troubled marriage was morally preferable to parting. "I reject the pious notion that one is either perfect or divorced," he told The Boston Globe.
Mr. Clinton said Mr. Kerrey had misunderstood him.
"The only point I tried to make is that having said that it's okay for divorced people to be President, we shouldn't go in the other direction and say if you've ever had troubles in your marriage and you want to run for office, just forget it," he said. "But I was never negative on Bob Kerrey for getting divorced. As a matter of fact, when my mother remarried my stepfather, I was against her doing it. I think sometimes divorce is not only appropriate, it is the only sensible thing to do in life."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin, a Charmer, Ventures Into Capitalist Den

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia challenged and charmed New York's business leaders on Friday night with such a forceful sales pitch for his country that some said later they were more likely to consider ventures in Russia than before.
Guests at a dinner for Mr. Yeltsin at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the Russian leader scribbled notes furiously throughout the meal, and was disarmingly frank about his own ignorance of the fine points of capitalism. 
 He exhorted the business leaders to act, noting that the vast Russian federation had mineral wealth and saying that it was willing to mortgage its gold, diamonds and gas deposits as backing for investment. "What's holding you back?" he demanded at one point.
Herbert M. Allison Jr., executive vice president and chief financial officer of Merrill Lynch & Company, said: "All he could have hoped to accomplish was to open people's minds to the possibility of participating productively and profitably in Russia's transformation. I think he did. I was quite impressed."
People present also noted, however, that Mr. Yeltsin had to win the backing of the governments of major industrial nations and of world financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund to induce investors to take risks in an economically devastated nation, one without a convertible currency.
The Russian's meeting with New York business leaders was his second since being elected President.
The dinner, sponsored by Gerald E. Corrigan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, brought Mr. Yeltsin together with about 50 prominent people now or recently in government, finance and business -- among them Cyrus R. Vance, a former Secretary of State; David Rockefeller, former chairman of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, and Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of the Archer-Daniels-Midland Company.
Some of the Americans spoke of an unexpected rapport with Mr. Yeltsin.
And they noted that the Russian leader was startled when Mr. Corrigan told the guests that yesterdaywas Mr. Yeltsin's birthday. He hugged Mr. Corrigan and said that even his closest advisers had not remembered.
Mr. Yeltsin put aside his prepared text and challenged his listeners to help him rebuild. "I promised you when I saw you last year that I would destroy Communism, and I was as good as my word," one participant quoted him as saying. Then he challenged them, asking why they had not given him advice on creating a strong central bank or help in establishing a joint Russian-American bank.
He pointed out that foreigners can now own property in Russia and that there are no barriers to full foreign-owned companies. "I hate saying this," he told the business leaders, but noted that Russia can provide them with cheap labor, as wages are extremely low.
Still, some present remained skeptical. "It always helps to be a strong and dynamic personality," said Walter V. Shipley, president of the Chemical Banking Corporation, "but I also doubt if any bankers walked out last night saying, 'Gee, let's go lend money.' "
He said bankers' experiences with loans to developing countries had made them wary of the kinds of financing that Mr. Yeltsin is seeking. "Pure infrastructure development-style finance will need more government-to-government aid or finance than traditionally," he said.

HEADLINE: Bias Law Casts Pall Over New Orleans Mardi Gras

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Every year for more than a century, the grand finale of Mardi Gras has come when Rex, the King of Carnival, and Comus, masked chieftain of the city's oldest carnival club, rendezvous for a midnight toast to usher in Ash Wednesday. But not this year. Citing a new city ordinance that bans discrimination in Mardi Gras groups, Comus and his followers have announced they will be staying home.
In a city whose identity is so tightly intertwined with the rambunctious 12-day festival that precedes Lent each year, that decision by the very same organization that invented the modern-day Carnival has been greeted with dismay. But the withdrawal of Comus and Momus, another old-line carnival club, or krewe, has also ignited a rancorous debate that focuses not only on the future of Mardi Gras, but also on what kind of city New Orleans is and aspires to be.
 
Some Hesitate to Parade
 Having just been through the most divisive governor's race in Louisiana history, New Orleans does not relish yet another confrontation with its racial problems. But the brief sense of community that resulted from blacks and whites working together to defeat David Duke has now given way to expressions of bitterness, signs of what The New Orleans Times-Picayune described in a recent editorial as "a new racial anger" brought on by the ordinance. 
 "This has been a disaster for race relations in this city," said Peggy Wilson, a white City Council member who voted for the ordinance but now says she will introduce measures to repeal it and forbid the city from considering any future legislation to tamper with Mardi Gras, which this year concludes on March 3. "You've opened a Pandora's box and let all the little goblins fly around."
Members of some krewes say the racial climate in the city is so tense that they have reservations about parading this year. Pointing to a recent slashing of canvases at an exhibition of Mardi Gras paintings, they said they feared they might be attacked. Those fears started, they said, when they heard some things said at the televised City Council meeting at which the ordinance was enacted.
"The blacks stood up and said, 'This city is ours,' " Ms. Wilson recalled. "There were raised fists and very angry comments, and that has led some people to say: 'Oh my God, there's a lot of hatred out there. We better not ride.' "
 
Quick and Heated Reaction
 Passed on Dec. 19 after a heated public hearing, the law prohibits any club, marching society or parade organization sponsoring public Mardi Gras activities from excluding anyone from membership because of "race, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, age, physical condition or disability." The measure, which will be carried out in the next two years, was approved unanimously by the seven-member council.
Almost immediately, though, leaders of 65 carnival krewes and clubs issued a statement calling the ordinance a "tragic mistake" that would kill Mardi Gras by forcing krewes to cancel their parades or move them to neighboring St. Bernard or Jefferson parishes. The festival is mostly paid for by the krewes from levies on their members.
The identity of leaders of Comus, Momus and other exclusive clubs is a closely guarded secret, but group members said they regarded the legislation as an infringement on their freedom to choose their friends.
Dorothy Mae Taylor, president of the City Council who sponsored the ordinance, declined to be interviewed about the reaction her measure has provoked. Replying through her press secretary, she said that "continued debate on the issue does not serve well the intended nature of the ordinance nor the citizens of this city," whose population is 60 percent black.
But other black leaders continued to hail the measure as an important step forward in the democratization of Mardi Gras. For too long, they say, Mardi Gras has been segregated, with Momus, Comus and other elite krewes allowed to benefit from police, fire and sanitation services during the parades despite the krewes' exclusionary policies.
"I'm against discrimination in any form," said Roy E. Glapion Jr., head of Zulu, the most important black krewe, complaining that for many years his group, founded in 1916, received no encouragement from the city. "I have no problem with individuals wanting privacy. I watched the Super Bowl together with my friends, but we didn't use taxpayer dollars to do so."
Some members of the traditional krewes say, however, that the contribution they make to the economic well-being of the city, through tourism and other activities, more than balances their restrictive membership policies. A study conducted by the University of New Orleans estimates that Mardi Gras generates as much as $500 million a year. Krewe members say the new law is now jeopardizing that revenue.
That is not an argument that finds favor among those, black or white, who do not belong to the elite krewes.
 
Benefits Called Incidental
 "They do it because they enjoy it, not to make money for the city of New Orleans," Jimmie Thorns Jr., a real estate broker who is chairman of the Black Economic Development Council, said of the prominent white men who belong to the old-line krewes. "I think they would do it even if nobody came."
The current mood contrasts with the sense of accomplishment both races felt after November's election for governor. The resounding defeat of David Duke "was a total pull-together deal," said George Denegre, a prominent lawyer and former King of Carnival. "For them to come out with something like this right before carnival, when nobody has time to do anything about it, is terribly divisive."
Although the debate over the ordinance has been framed primarily in terms of race, there are also undercurrents of class, sex and religion. As bastions of the New Orleans establishment, with links to elite year-round organizations like the Boston Club and Louisiana Club, krewes like Comus and Momus have excluded not only blacks but also women, Jews, Italians and working-class whites from their ranks.
"This is not about racial discrimination," Darrell Walker, an automobile mechanic, said of the dispute. "I'm white and they would never let me in either, not that I would want to join. It's all a family thing. You get to be a member because your granddaddy was a member."
Faced with that pattern, excluded groups have flocked to their own krewes: women to Iris and Venus, blacks to Zulu and Nomtoc, Italians to Virgilians and homosexuals to Petronius. Not all of them are necessarily eager to open their ranks to comply with the new law.
"We're an all-woman krewe, and we want to stay that way," said Joy Oswald, captain, or head, of Iris, the oldest of the city's female parading groups. "This should just have been left alone."
At Zulu, whose 375 members include more than 25 whites, racial integration is not an issue. "We were integrated even when integration was illegal," Mr. Glapion said. But Zulu has been less enthusiastic about allowing women to join, and some members of the Autocrat Club and the Original Illinois Club, two other old-line black organizations, say privately that they oppose the ordinance because they will have to open their doors to women.
"We have discriminated against women," Mr. Glapion admitted. "But if the ordinance says we have to admit them, so be it."
But Mr. Glapion's willingness to tamper with Mardi Gras tradition appears to be a minority opinion, even among blacks. According to a poll commissioned earlier this month by a New Orleans television station, WWL-TV, if this ordinance had to be voted on, it would fail, with blacks 55 percent to 45 percent against it, and whites 80 percent to 20 percent in favor of its defeat. The telephone survey of 650 people was conducted in mid-January and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
"Mardi Gras has been elevated to the status of a religion," said Silas Lee, a poll taker and professor of sociology at Xavier University who conducted the survey, when asked to explain black opposition to the measure. "They don't want people to touch it, even though they recognize that part of the tradition is not fair. What they are saying is that they would violate the civil rights laws to uphold the Mardi Gras tradition."

HEADLINE: New Chairman Installed to 'Invigorate' G.O.P.

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Richard N. Bond, a political consultant with close ties to President Bush, was installed today as chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Mr. Bond succeeds Clayton K. Yeutter, who was named Friday night to a newly created White House post, with Cabinet rank, to oversee economic and domestic policy. The move was part of a reorganization of the White House staff geared to the President's re-election campaign. 
 The election-year moves reflect Mr. Bush's desire for a more dynamic party spokesman, a party official said. This official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said Friday that Mr. Bond was a "flame thrower" who was sorely needed to "invigorate" the Republican apparatus and to counteract the Democratic national chairman, Ronald H. Brown.
 
An Admirer of Lee Atwater
 Last year Mr. Yeutter (pronounced YITE-er), a 61-year-old former Secretary of Agriculture, replaced Lee Atwater, who died of a brain tumor. Mr. Atwater was known for his slashing, no-holds-barred style of campaigning. Mr. Bond worked with Mr. Atwater and has expressed admiration for his style.
The new national chairman told members of the Republican National Committee today that the Democrats had "pontificated, pussyfooted, stalled and delayed" on the President's anticrime proposals and other domestic measures, and he said he would hold Congress to the President's March 20 deadline for action on his plan to revive the economy, The Associated Press reported.
Mr. Yeutter's appointment as the President's chief domestic policy adviser reflects the growing authority of Samuel K. Skinner, the new White House chief of staff, who seeks to make the White House more responsive to the political needs of Mr. Bush's re-election campaign.
The appointment of Mr. Yeutter is widely considered the most important action yet taken by Mr. Skinner to consolidate his control of the White House. Mr. Skinner, a former Secretary of Transportation, succeeded John H. Sununu in December as chief of staff.
Mr. Yeutter's appointment is widely viewed as an effort by Mr. Skinner to diminish the authority of Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, with whom Mr. Skinner has been at odds. Mr. Skinner favors a more political approach to economic issues, while Mr. Darman favors a slower and more moderate response.
The move also diminishes the operational role of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who also is chairman of the Economic Policy Council, which is to be abolished in the reorganization.
The reorganization also eliminates the Domestic Policy Council, which was headed by Attorney General William P. Barr. And it is expected to further diminish the authority of Roger Porter, the White House domestic policy adviser, who is believed to to be seeking another job.
 
Aide to Moderate Republicans
 Mr. Bond, 41, a native New Yorker with a bachelor of arts degree from Fordham University, began his political career working for moderate Republicans, including Representative Bill Green of Manhattan and former Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr. of Maryland.
Mr. Bond served as deputy campaign manager of Mr. Bush's Presidential campaign in 1988. Previously, he was deputy chief of staff to Mr. Bush when he was Vice President, and was deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Mr. Bond had initially expected to get the Republican national chairman's job after Mr. Atwater's death last year, but his appointment was blocked by Mr. Sununu.
Mr. Bond then joined Frank. J. Donatelli, a former White House political director under President Ronald Reagan, to create a lobbying concern, Bond Donatelli Inc., which represents the American Petroleum Institute and the Grumman Corporation, among other clients.

HEADLINE: Many State Lotteries Feel the Pinch of Recession, and Perhaps Monotony

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

 BODY:
Lottery revenue in many states is sagging or stagnant under the pressure of the recession, driving the states to mount new and more exotic games as well as more aggressive advertising campaigns to bolster ticket sales.
Thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have lotteries, and in the fiscal year that ended in July 1991, 11 lottery agencies posted declines in revenue from the previous year, according to figures compiled by the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. In seven other states, revenue was essentially flat. 
 Bill Bergman, executive director of the association, said preliminary figures for 21 states for the first six months of the current fiscal year showed the slide or stagnation continuing in nine states, while revenue was up only slightly in the rest, with the notable exception of Kentucky.
Particularly hard hit are the big states. Russell Gladieux, deputy director of the New York State Lottery, which sold $2.1 billion worth of tickets in the 1991 fiscal year, up 3.7 percent from 1990, said New York was likely to experience its first annual revenue decline in the lottery's 24 years.
 
Advertising Cut Back
 "We didn't change other things about the games, so the cause appears to be the recession," Mr. Gladieux said. "And another part of our problem is the state's tight fiscal situation, and so our advertising budget took a real hit and was cut by 25 to 30 percent."
In California, which has had a lottery for only six years, revenue declined 14 percent in 1991. Joanne McNabb, a spokeswoman for the California Lottery, said a lack of advertising money was hampering plans for introducing several new games and bigger prizes.
"Certainly, we think the recession is having an impact," Ms. McNabb said. "We are now at a crucial point and are practically relaunching and revamping out lottery games. And because of the recession we don't have the resources we would like to have."
A proportion of lottery revenue ranging from 35 to 55 percent goes into the general fund in some states, while in others lottery money is earmarked to aid education, the elderly, environmental programs or local governments. Thus, a decline in lottery revenue could affect the quality of programs in those areas, depending on what a state did to make up for the loss of lottery money.
Mr. Bergman said that the plight of New York and California stood out among those states that have been hurt. Those two states, along with Florida, which is also experiencing sagging sales, have the largest lotteries. When big-state lotteries are down or flat, Mr. Bergman said, "it drags our national totals down disproportionately."
 
Over All, a Slight Rise
 What the national figures mask is that several states, including Kentucky, Oregon, Kansas and South Dakota, saw significant increases in lottery revenue last year, and that lottery proceeds nationwide are still growing, though at a slower rate than in the past.
Nationwide, lottery revenue in the last fiscal year was up 2.7 percent, Mr. Bergman said, or $20.6 billion as against $20 billion the previous year. But the growth from 1989 to 1990 was 7 percent, and in the late 70's and early 80's, when one or two states began a lottery each year, the growth rate was in double digits.
"We aren't losing our player base," Mr. Bergman said. "But because of the recession, the $10-a-week player is now a $5-a-week player."
Because people are watching their spending, Terry LeFleur, a writer for Gaming and Wagering Business Magazine, projected lottery growth in the current fiscal year at 1 to 2 percent. At the same time, the number of lotteries is growing. Louisiana started a lottery last September, and Texas is scheduled to start its lottery this year. In the first week of its new weekly game, Louisiana sold $1.5 million in tickets.
"There are some bright spots," Ms. LeFleur said. "The public is fickle, and they get bored with old games. And where there are new games, you can have big revenue increases."
One of the best examples of that phenomenon is Kentucky. Officials initially projected that the lottery would contribute about $60 million to the state's general fund this year, but they have revised that to $90 million. Greg Donaldson, a spokesman for the Kentucky lottery, attributed the success to the introduction of new games, an increase in prize money and aggressive marketing and advertising.
Kentucky officials are projecting lottery revenue of more than $300 million this year, up from $211 million. Per capita lottery spending was $95 in December, as against $57 last June.
Most other states have been less fortunate. In Iowa, revenue fell $11 million last year, to $158 million, said Nicky Schissel, deputy director of the state lottery. Ms. Schissel attributed the decline to the recession, anxiety over the Persian Gulf war and the advent of legalized riverboat gambling.
"We compete with them for the same discretionary dollar," she said about the gambling on the Mississippi River. "So it is hard to tell what part of the decrease is recession and what part is competition."
In Missouri, Pam Koupal, acting lottery director, said lottery revenue declined 3 percent last year after growth of 10 percent and 30 percent in the two previous years. She attributed the drop in sales to layoffs at large defense contractors in the St. Louis area. .
The two states with the largest drops last year were Idaho and Arizona, with 22 percent and 20 percent, respectively. Industry experts attributed Idaho's decline to the "second-year slump" that occurs in nearly all new lotteries when the novelty has worn off.
 
Too Few Chances?
 Geoffrey E. Gonsher, the assistant lottery director in Arizona, said that a survey in November showed that his state's decline was due to players' cutting back because of the recession, because the mix of games was no longer exciting and because they felt there were too few chances to win.
Lottery officials in Oregon saw ticket sales drop in rural areas hard hit by the recession in the timber industry. But Steve Caputo, deputy director of the state lottery, said sales remained steady in urban areas last year and have increased in the current year with the addition of a new game.
"This industry is driven more by new products or games than it is by the recession," Mr. Caputo said.
Mr. Gladieux, of the New York State Lottery, said his state had kept its lottery revenue growing through recessions in the 70's and early 80's simply by adding new and more exotic games.
 
'Mature' Lotteries Affected
 In California, Ms. McNabb seconded his view. "That is partly why lotteries looked recession-proof," she said. "New games could always offset the effects of a recession. But now the mature state lotteries without the booming, major new products are most affected by the recession."
Mr. Bergman said most lotteries were well beyond the precarious phase in which they would be endangered by economic downturns. At the most, he said, some lotteries that depend on legislatures to approve their budgets will find their advertising budgets cut. Lawmakers in financially strapped states see such budget cuts as both innocuous and good politics, he said, because they consider it unseemly to be promoting gambling when unemployment is high.
But beyond such cutbacks, few lotteries face serious attempts to force them to reduce prizes and increase the percentage of their revenue that go into state coffers, Mr. Bergman said.
And sometimes, even amid a recession-driven decline in revenue, a lottery will perform better than other revenue producers in the state. That was the case in Florida, where lottery revenue was down 5 percent, to $2.15 billion, last year from $2.28 billion the previous year.
"In an ordinary year we might have lost support for the lottery from the Legislature," said Ed George, director of communications for the Florida lottery. "But we are a state that depends largely on the sales tax and tourism. The gate at Disney World is down and sales taxes are off $1 billion from what they were last year. So we aren't even a major story, being off a little $100 million."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
Quayle's New Hampshire Theme: A Vote for Bush Is a Message to Congress

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 1

 BODY:
For those who might equate a vote for George Bush with an endorsement of his tenure, Vice President Dan Quayle would like to offer an alternative.
Campaigning today in New Hampshire, Mr. Quayle exhorted New Hampshire Republicans to consider a vote for the President as a way "to send a message" to Congress. 
 "We ought to talk about sending a message to the Democratic Congress," he said today. "And the best way to send a message to the Democrats is to vote for the President."
Conveying a message -- rather than choosing a candidate -- has become the theme of the Republican primary here on Feb. 18. While Mr. Quayle is asking voters to send a message to Congress by voting for the President, Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist, asks them to vote for him to send a message to the President.
 
Test of Ingenuity
 This indirection illustrates the difficulty of running as a member of the party in power during hard times. To express compassion for the pain caused by the recession, while at the same time avoiding the blame has proved a test of Republican ingenuity.
Stopping at a shopping mall, a church and a high school, Mr. Quayle sought to convince voters that the tax changes proposed by the President this week would provide quick economic relief.
The President's plan, he said, "is the only plan that's going to put this economy back on track." But he warned that Congress was "going to want to spend more and they're going to want to raise taxes."
"But the President isn't going to let the Democratic Congress get away with it again," he said.
In half a dozen appearances today, Mr. Quayle mentioned Mr. Buchanan only in passing, and only when pressed. "I know full well that Pat Buchanan knows that he's not going to be the nominee of the Republicans," he said in response to a question.
Asked why the President would not debate Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Quayle said, "Republicans debate Democrats, not each other." When reporters noted that the Democratic candidates frequently debate one another, and had done so the night before, he said, "They look real good out there, don't they?"
The Vice President drew good crowds at most of his stops, but they were not uniformly enthusiastic. In front of the town hall in Amherst, he was greeted by protesters calling for the Vice President to be an independently elected official.
The closest Mr. Quayle came to rubbing shoulders with average citizens was at a stop at the 101 Plaza Shopping Center in Bedford. Accompanied by Gov. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts and the former White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, Mr. Quayle darted into a Dunkin' Donuts and ordered a chocolate frozen yogurt.
This attempt to pump cash into the New Hampshire economy failed when the store's owner, Carl Andrade, refused to accept payment for the yogurt. Asked by the Vice President how his business was doing, Mr. Andrade suggested that it would do better without Mr. Quayle and his Secret Service agents blocking the donut counter.

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Budget Plan: A Tougher City to Live In

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
The spending plan Mayor David N. Dinkins has proposed for next year and the three years after that would create a city where classrooms are more crowded, parks are dirtier, street and sewer repairs take longer and social workers have more work and less time to spend on each case.
The preliminary budget would produce a city where it would take longer to get a building permit, where the jobs of school guidance counselors would remain unfilled, where a caller seeking help in getting child-support payments would be greeted by an automated telephone system instead of a social worker. 
 "It's going to be a city that is more uncomfortable for everyone," said Penelope Pi-Sunyer of the City Project, a coalition of social-service groups that monitors the budget. And, she said, "It hurts low-income people, inevitably, more than it hurts upper-income people."
 
Thick Tome of Numbers
 Like all budgets, the Mayor's spending plan, which includes a $29.4 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, is a thick tome of numbers and graphs. It contains numbing lists of agencies and programs and corresponding lists of dollars and cents in amounts difficult to visualize.
But taken together, the lists paint a portrait of the Mayor's vision for the city, a vision that in Mr. Dinkins's case is clouded by a faltering economy and shriveling tax revenues.
Facing a $1.5 billion gap projected for next year and larger shortfalls after that, and legally required to produce a balanced budget, the Mayor has cut many costs and increased some revenues. The cost reductions would translate into reduced services in departments like social services, education, sanitation, parks and environmental protection. The revenue increases would translate into higher fees at landfills and more expensive parking summonses, for example, and proposals for new taxes on automobiles, gasoline and suburban commuters.
 
Few Areas Protected
 Only a handful of areas have been protected. The Mayor's plan would mean more police officers on the streets, and no more property taxes in the next four years. It would leave libraries and hospitals untouched. And it would mean reducing the number of city workers through attrition, not through layoffs.
Some workers providing city services under the Mayor's spending plan would not be city workers at all, but employees of nonprofit groups with employees not represented by unions. Such workers would manage homeless shelters, several foster-care programs and more than 40 percent of the low income partment houses now owned by the city. Private contractors would also perform such different tasks as inspecting boilers and providing security at welfare offices.
The Mayor's spending plan is subject to the approval of the City Council, which traditionally has protected middle-income priorities like lowering property taxes and improving schools. The City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, has welcomed the Mayor's plan as a good place to start negotiations, praising the decisions like those to hold the line on property taxes and protect libraries. But heavy cuts to the schools may face tough opposition because Mr. Vallone and other senior Council members have made schools their priority next year.
Here are some of the agencies and what the Mayor's plan would do:
 
Board of Education

The school system would take a $100 million cut next year on top of the nearly $430 million in cuts it has taken over the last two years.
To reduce the number of teachers, elementary school classes would be increased in size to 29 from 25 students. About 20 percent of the jobs for guidance councelors and assistant principals would be cut as well.
In the high schools, class size would be increased to 36 from 30, on the assumption that many students will drop out. The idea is to overbook the classes much like airlines overbook flights to insure that fewer classes are attended only by a handful of students. That would save about $15.3 million in teachers' salaries the next fiscal year.
 
Parks and Recreation
 The parks, already cut by 35 percent this year, would be trimmed by an additional $2 million. The jobs of about 135 maintenance workers will be eliminated, meaning most parks will be cleaned 8 times a month instead of 10, as they are now. The plan also calls for cutting back on the number of people who run recreation programs by a third, a total of eight people, and that means that at least two recreation centers, yet to be determined, would be closed.
 
Social Services
 To save $5.7 million, the Mayor proposed slashing about 690 support-staff jobs from secretaries to analysts in several programs including the Child Welfare Agency and the Medical Assistance Program, which helps people get Medicaid.
To save an additional $200,000, the agency would contract with private groups to handle operations including family-preservation programs, homeless family shelters, counseling for adults and even investigators who track down absent parents.
Caseloads for welfare workers would rise by 7 percent, despite the addition of nearly 400 social workers next year. The caseloads of people who attempt to protect children from abuse in their own homes would double.
 
Sanitation
 The largest part of the agency's reduction in the garbage collection comes in delaying the citywide recycling program for two years. The progam was supposed to be in every city neighborhood in 1993. The delay means about 950 workers will not be hired, for a savings of $31 million. But it also means fewer people will put their newspapers out on the curb to be recycled.
The Mayor has also reduced 87 support staff positions like secretaries, office assistants and analysts, which could slow the agency's response to problems.
 
Environmental Protection
 Cuts totaling about $650,000 would trim 90 maintenance jobs at sewage treatment plants raising concerns among environmentalists about leaks and odor problems, as well as 40 sewer-repair jobs of four jobs of specialists who investigate sewer back-ups.
 
Transportation
 Mr. Dinkins plans to cut in half the number of workers who spot and fix potholes and clear snow from the streets, saving about $384,000. He also aims to severely curtail the city's street sign making shop, cutting 20 positions and saving about $1.9 million.

Little Big Woman

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
It was by way of being a national in-joke when George Bush began his State of the Union address by saying that he'd tried to persuade Barbara to deliver it. It has long been tacitly understood that Barbara Bush is both more likable and more liberal than her husband.
Funny thing. That's how Marilyn Quayle is perceived, too -- not as more likable and more liberal than Dan, but as somehow a superior product, smarter and infinitely more sure of her syntax. And the word on Hillary Clinton, who assumed her husband's surname to advance his political career (and who, perhaps for the same reason, assumed his accent as well) is that she's more intelligent and thoughtful than Bill, tougher and more ambitious. 
 In other words, behind every so-so candidate is a smart woman who makes him look good because he was savvy enough to marry her. The little (big) women.
I suppose you could argue that these two human beings make up a cohesive whole, a power couple, a synthesis of front man and trusted adviser that works for both of them. I suppose you could, but I won't. I always get slightly suspicious about why trusted adviser is always female, and front man -- the one who gets elected, paid, interviewed about something other than his hair and his children, and goes down in history -- is always a man. If this unpaid trusted adviser thing were such a terrific job, wouldn't more men want it?
The fact is that there's still a tacit agreement in American society, despite decades of change, that wives support. Like a French word that always takes "la," self-sacrifice remains a feminine noun. It's a deal that works beautifully for men, which is why you hear so much about how natural it is, even that it was God's idea, that there is a theological basis for women's inevitable compromises. The deal means that it is harder for a woman to run for office: to be the front person, to upstage her husband. The deal means that the world looks with suspicion upon those women who do.
Mrs. Quayle and Mrs. Clinton are instructive. With each couple, we voters get the man. And we also, if rumor has it right, get the less able of the pair. Even if you are going to argue that this arrangement benefits both husband and wife, you surely cannot argue that it benefits all of us.
Last year we said the manning of American government was inadequate to represent the interests of women. This year, we have to admit the problem is bigger than that. There is an enormous power vacuum in this country, a black hole of leadership.
Once he waxed cute about his wife, the President went on to deliver a speech that made clear what we suspected: that he is clueless, big time. No vision, no heart, no substantive economic program. Just a big nah-nah-nah-nah-nah to Congress, along with his perennial favorite, the capital-gains tax. Get real, sir. Most Americans think of capital gains as all the perks you people get in Washington.
This would have been great news for the Democrats if they had a candidate. Their best hope spent the week on the State of his own Union, revealing, above all, the paucity of excitement in the Democratic field. Here's an easy guide: When they start talking about drafting Lloyd Bentsen, they're in trouble.
So we have an incumbent without a clue lined up against a party without a front-runner, and in the midst of all this, it's worth noting that we consistently lose half of our best leadership prospects by virtue of their sex. We no longer have the luxury of doing that. There are many reasons why the deal should be modified. This is one of them: We need the leaders.
If we really believe, as I've heard over and over during the last week, that there's not a male politician in America who hasn't slept around, I've got a solution for the future. Look for a woman.
If we really believe, as I've heard over and over during the last three years, that our political leaders don't have a clue about real life, look for a woman. I've rarely met a woman who didn't know more about the supermarket, the bus stop and the prevailing winds than her male counterparts. Not to mention about child care, human rights, abortion, the minimum wage and sexual harassment.
If it's so widely understood that the wives are superior to the candidates, shouldn't that tell us something about where to find the candidates to come?

Women Are The Big Ticket in Skating

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
SOME people are not convinced that figure skating, with its ballet music and its style points, is even a sport. I say, let Rickey Henderson try to steal second base while staying in sync with Erik Satie or Tchaikovsky, and see what kind of marks he gets.
Whatever figure skating is, CBS is going to show 44 hours of it from Albertville, all of them in American prime time. 
 Without figure skating, the Winter Games would feel like just another afternoon of "Wide World of Sports" -- people you never heard of performing sports you notice once every four years.
Figure skating is the reigning monarch of the Winter Olympics. And it is the only sport in the world in which the women are vastly more popular than the men.
Some of us feel that women's tennis has been just as compelling as men's tennis in the past generation, what with Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert, but the touts outside the stadiums and the television officials remind us that men's tennis is the hot ticket.
In figure skating, it is just the opposite, going back to Sonja Henie and Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill. At the recent nationals in Orlando, Fla., the men's finals were held at 3 P.M. on a Saturday and the women's finals were held at 9 P.M. Showtime. And for good reason.
"We think of our audience as being women, 35 to 65 -- my grandmother from Des Moines," said Rob Dustin, the CBS feature producer for figure skating at the Winter Games.
"In 1988, the ratings for the Battle of the Carmens and the Battle of the Brians were close to Super Bowl ratings," Dustin added, referring to the different interpretations of Carmen performed by Katarina Witt and Debi Thomas in Calgary in 1988, and the rivalry between Brian Boitano of the United States and Brian Orser of Canada.
Figure skating was the absolute best thing I covered in the last Winter Games in Calgary. I had never been around it before, and I found it to have some of the best of the bullfights, a Wimbledon final, and the ballet.
From the sensational press section, just above the ice, where the skaters entered, you could see the looks on their faces, who was ready, who was tense. It was one of the rare times a sportswriter has a better vantage point than the television audience.
You could actually see the serenity of Witt, the favorite from East Germany, the energy of Elizabeth Manley, the surprise from Canada, and the intelligence and ambiguity of Debi Thomas, the American.
When Thomas hit the ice wrong in the early seconds and plodded away to a bronze medal, none of us knew that this complex pre-med student had just secretly married her college boy friend. She was in love; you could see something was distracting her.
It is this up-close and personal drama that makes figure skating so popular with live audiences on several competing tours. Some of this demand traces to the creative and attractive Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, the absolute stars of the 1984 Games, but the answer is bigger than any one draw.
"Many of the sports don't lend themselves to being there, unless you're at the finish line," said Dr. Franklin Nelson, the president of the U.S. Figure Skating Association.
"I love the other sports. I went to see Eddie the Eagle. I love hockey," said Dr. Nelson, a former Olympic figure skater. "But the way this builds, it isn't over in a few seconds. It is elegant. It is appealing because of the art of doing difficult things and making them look easy."
It is easy to ridicule figure skating with its routines set to music, its often gaudy costumes, the prejudging by officials, the bizarre names of the figures, but the performers are also athletes, attempting feats as difficult as the long jump or the dunk.
Fleming has often praised the men for showing ways to mix muscle with grace, and the current trend for women seems to favor the jumping ability of Midori Ito of Japan over the smoothness of Kristi Yamaguchi of the United States.
That tension between power and style will be worth watching, particularly because fortunes are at stake.
"Under normal circumstances, for an American girl to win the gold medal is worth $10 million over the next five-six years, although obviously, the recession changes that," said Michael Rosenberg the business agent for the tough little American buzzbomb, Tonya Harding.
"Any of the skaters can blow it with one opened-up jump, one fall," Rosenberg said. "One little split second on the ice and anybody's life changes."
That drama will be played, with music and color, in 44 hours over the next two weeks. If there were any more figure skating, CBS would show it, too.

HEADLINE: One Thing We Don't Need Is Tax Reduction

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There should be no tax reduction now. This is why: 
 * Tax revenue is a scarce commodity and should be put to its most urgent uses. At a time of gaping deficits and cutbacks of essential programs, middle-income tax relief is not at the top of the list, especially if extended above $75,000. Middle incomes have suffered from severe stagnation, but more basic measures for employment security, health care and productivity growth are needed.
* Nor is tax reduction required to stimulate the economy. Further fiscal stimulus may be needed because monetary policy is not all-powerful, but it may be given more effectively by moving up neglected infrastructure investment, targeted at areas most severely hit by the recession.
* The excessive shift in fiscal responsibility from Federal to state and local government during the 1980's has come home to roost. The recession has brought state and local finances to the brink and threatens the most essential services. Aid to state and local government, aimed at those most in need, is called for and has a higher priority than tax reduction.
* A Federal investment tax credit, targeted at productivity-raising investment and limited in time should be considered and paid for from a 36 percent income-tax bracket on higher incomes. Beyond this, proliferation of questionable tax incentives would undercut the benefits of the 1986 tax reform and should be avoided.
* The peace dividend, if and when it occurs, should be used for catching up on infrastructure investment, targeted and effort-tested assistance to state and local governments, and deficit reduction. It should not be squandered ahead of time by tax reduction.
* The public should know that we are not overtaxed. Comparison with most other industrialized countries shows they have a ratio of tax revenue to gross national product substantially higher than that of the United States, and these are countries with comparable or higher rates of growth.

Reverse the Burden

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Recession Puts a Harsh Spotlight on Hefty Pay of Top Executives" (front page, Jan. 20), illuminating as far as it goes, fails to make the point that tax inequity between the upper 1 percent and the rest of Americans has a direct and crucial bearing on our record budget deficits of the 1980's and 90's. 
 For instance, largely from data of the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, from the United States Government budget for fiscal year 1992 and the House Ways and Means Committee, in 1992 the richest 1 percent of the population will make $678 billion before taxes. That is more than the total income of the bottom 40 percent of all families. The $2.4 trillion of income concentrated in the top one-fifth of our population is greater than the income of the remaining four-fifths.
As a result of the 1978 and 1981 tax cuts, the after-tax income of the richest 1 percent jumped by 136 percent since 1977.
At the same time, for middle- and lower-income families in the bottom three-fifths of the income scale, after-tax incomes actually declined since 1977. The after-tax incomes in the fourth 20 percent grew by only 1 percent over 15 years.
The tax inequity between the upper 1 percent and the rest has undergone an unprecedented increase.
The most effective way to address the deficit is to reverse the tax burden: every 1 percent tax on the incomes of the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans will add more than $17 billion to Government revenues. In contrast, every 1 percent of income taken from the poorest fifth adds only $1.7 billion to tax revenues.
Ethical issues arising from executive compensation aside, in view of our tax structure, the consequences directly and grievously affect our budget deficit.

HEADLINE: ALBERTVILLE '92;
United They Stand After Union Fell

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
When the mostly Russian hockey team quicksteps onto the ice for the first time at the 1992 Winter Olympics, keen spectators are likely to blink, in confusion or nostalgia.
The arrogant red of the Soviet uniforms, worn by the swift, deft and powerful teams that dominated international ice hockey for decades, will remain. But the letters C.C.C.P., Cyrillic for U.S.S.R., will be gone from the jerseys, just as the Soviet Union has disappeared, replaced by a jumble of independent countries. 
 This Olympic squad, like others on the way from Moscow to Albertville, France, has undergone many annoyances and privations because of political changes in recent months. For the Winter Games, the former Soviet Union is being called the E.U.N., or Equipe Unifie, by the French, and it will be made up of athletes from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. But the team's jerseys will have no letters indicating Equipe Unifie, or United Team, or referring at all to the Commonwealth of Independent States, to which the five countries belong.
 
No Propaganda
 Which of the 11 former Soviet republics that make up the Commonwealth of Independent States will take part in the Summer Games at Barcelona, Spain, is still being worked out.
"There is no such thing as propaganda now," said Oleg Sukhoruchenko, a 26-year-old Ukrainian who is pilot of the team's two-man and four-man bobsleds.
In a recent interview here, Sukhoruchenko and his teammates laughed derisively as they recalled the old days, when Olympic athletes came under intense pressure from the Soviet Union's State Committee on Sports. The officials would make speeches about the need to win more medals than the Americans to prove the superiority of the political system here.
Some athletes believed the system was setting a quota for gold medals, as if they were farmers getting quotas for milk. Whatever the motivation, in the 1988 Winter Games at Calgary, Alberta, the Soviets won 11 gold medals, while the United States won 2.
The members of the bobsled team were interviewed just after being told that only nine of them would be going to Albertville.
"If you take a realistic view, gold is not likely," Sukhoruchenko said about his bobsledding team. "That may be for Germany or Switzerland. But it is realistic to think we will win a medal."
The United States might win a medal, he said. He and his teammates were impressed and bothered by an American innovation: a computerized, visual training video of the Olympic bobsled run at La Plagne, near Albertville, by which the Americans can simulate the run's twists and speed. "We have no means for such a device," one sledder said.
Other problems related to the collapse of the union were noted. In the past, Soviet bobsledding was dominated by Latvians, who made up more than half of the team that competed at Calgary. Now the Latvians have their own team, but the Russians and Ukrainians of the United Team had to practice in Latvia, where the best runs are.
 
Separate, but Friendlier
 "They gave us inconvenient practice times, too late or too early, or the run was not properly iced," Sukhoruchenko said.
Another sledder said that relations between the Latvian sledders and the Russian and Ukrainian sledders have improved now that they are separate. "When we were mixed together, sometimes there were problems," he said.
They have tested the run in France.
"It's a new one," said Vladimir Kozlov, a 33-year-old who won a gold medal in the Soviet Union's two-man sled in 1988. "So experience doesn't matter. But it is a run that will allow no mistakes."
The sledders said they had just been given small commemorative badges with the Olympic circles on a red, hammer-and-sickle Soviet flag, "the last such in history." Some said they would keep the badges; others said they would trade them. They agreed that they wanted to paint on the nose of their sleds a black two-headed eagle, symbol of pre-revolution Russia.
The sledders' situation reflects that of the rest of the approximately 146 athletes -- more than half of them Russians -- who will be representing the United Team next month, said Vladimir I. Koval, vice president and treasurer of the National Olympic Committee, which is overseeing the team. "Of course politics has some effect," he said.
The United Team athletes will wear bluish warm-up uniforms, with one of the flags of the five countries permitted on a shirtsleeve. But when a member of the team wins a medal, only the Olympic flag will be flown and the Olympic anthem played.
The team's logo, for commercial purposes, is a kind of nose-down red boomerang with a white star in its leading edge, with the five Olympic circles underneath.
The United Team's hockey team is considered a contender for the gold medal, which was won in 1988 by the Soviet Union. "They think they can win the gold," Koval said. "Everyone knows if you win the gold, the road to the N.H.L. is open to you."
For one member of this hockey team, the way is already open. Aleksei Kovalev, an 18-year-old star of Moscow Dynamo who was drafted last year by the Rangers, is expected to play at the Albertville Games.
How is the United Team's effort in France being paid for?
When the State Committee on Sports was abolished last fall, Koval said, so was a supply of millions of rubles. Koval declined to say how much money had been raised by the participating states, but he said that an unusual amount of money came from the public, through sports lotteries, and from local sports associations. "People love our sportsmen very much," he said, "so they give."
 
Something to Wear, and to Eat
 Foreign sponsors, including Adidas, have also helped, he said. The athletes will wear Adidas apparel with the company logo visible, and will promote the products after the Olympics. Other foreign sponsors include the Japanese publication Baseball Magazine, Koval said.
The economic confusion here, including the recent increases in food prices, has made it difficult for the athletes to get the kind of food they need, such as good meat, fresh vegetables and caviar.
Caviar?
"Some athletes must have caviar," Koval said. "Especially those who do not want to eat much. It is a good source of protein. But red caviar costs 1,000 rubles a kilo and black caviar costs 3,000," about one month's pay for an average worker. "The athletes who need it will find a way to bring it with them. But it is safe to say that our athletes will not be eating caviar by the spoonsful."
"They never did," said an aide.

HEADLINE: BUSH AND YELTSIN DECLARE FORMAL END TO COLD WAR; AGREE TO EXCHANGE VISITS;
U.S. Looking for New Course As Superpower Conflict Ends

SERIES: After the Cold War/First of six articles.

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Like many Americans of his generation, 42-year-old John Driscoll holds many memories of the cold war, particularly the fear that came with the air raid drills at school, when he and the other students crawled under their desks, practicing for the day the Soviet hydrogen bombs fell.
"It seems surreal now," he recalled recently, a short time after the Soviet Union formally announced its demise. "Every summer, when I heard heat lightning over the city and the sky would light up, I was convinced it was all over. My whole childhood was built on the notion that the Soviets were the real threat." 
 Today, Mr. Driscoll is a teacher of economics and government at a high school just outside Washington. Working with Junior Achievement, he is helping to coordinate food shipments to Moscow, the capital of the empire that terrified him as a child. And on a recent visit to Moscow, he said, he found that "these folks have absolutely no confidence in themselves."
Across the country, planners, academics, Government officials and many ordinary Americans are reassessing their view not just of the former Soviet Union but of America as well -- trying to understand how the political and military rivalry with the Soviets altered Americans' lives over the last 45 years, what false assumptions it engendered and how the United States should change now that the cold war is over.
"We're confused," said Robert Jay Lifton, a psychiatrist who is director of the Center on Violence and Human Survival at John Jay College of the City University of New York. "People no longer know how to view the world or how to understand our own national problems, which have to some degree been subsumed by the cold war."
The rivalry between Moscow and Washington so dominated the world's diplomacy, commerce and even its culture that it is no wonder Americans are finding it difficult to adapt.
The two nations that emerged with the strongest militaries when World War II ended spent the next 45 years waging multi-layered competitions, first in Europe, then Asia, Africa and Latin America.
With constant coaching from their Government, most Americans came to believe that the Soviet goal was to impose its system on the entire world, as it had on Eastern Europe between 1945 and 1948. So the United States embraced "containment" -- halting the spread of Communist ideology and its presumed influence on American society.
America threatened war to break a Soviet blockade of West Berlin in 1948-49 and airlifted tons of food to the stranded enclave. It also spent billions of dollars to resurrect the economies of Western Europe and fought the Korean War from 1950 to 1953.
The first Soviet nuclear test was in 1949, and the Soviet Union grew toward nuclear parity with the United States until each nation had the power to destroy the other in an instant. The knowledge that each side had weapons so fearsome that they could never be rationally fired left the constant hope that no matter how bitter it grew, the war would always remain "cold."
But even as they tried to settle their scores by proxy wars and diplomatic confrontations, the two sides continued to flirt with mutually assured destruction. The severest test of nerve, and perhaps America's greatest single cold-war victory, came in 1962 when President Kennedy forced Khrushchev to withdraw Soviet missiles from Cuba.
America's single greatest defeat of the period was surely the Vietnam War, with the devastating social and political turmoil that came with its loss.
In the service of containment, the United States ringed the Soviet empire with military bases and built anti-Soviet alliances wherever possible the world over. This competition cost the United States several trillion dollars -- no one has a real account -- and more than 100,000 lives. And the domestic ramifications permeate American society to this day.
The drive to ferret out Communist influence at home made perceived "loyalty" a major preoccupation of governments, police agencies, school boards and even social organizations.
The fears of subversion and betrayal were fed by several sensational trials, like those of Alger Hiss for perjury and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage. And they fed demogagic attacks on thousands of citizens by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and his imitators.
The fears abated little until the mid-1980's. And by then America was fully and perhaps irreversibly engaged around the world.
When the cold war ended, the United States had 375 foreign military installations staffed by more than 500,000 servicemen and women worldwide. Its diplomatic engagement was just as extensive; through the 1980's America backed its bid for world influence with more than $16 billion in foreign aid each year. And American businesses were selling their products and services worldwide.
But now that the great conflict has at last run its course, Americans are facing not just the giddy spectacle of a grand, global political victory. Behind it lies a quandary of historic dimensions, as disorienting as any this nation has ever faced.
Over the next several days The New York Times will examine how the cold war's end has affected major American institutions and what sorts of changes may lie ahead. Politicians, intelligence officials, foreign policy experts, military analysts along with military-industry scientists and engineers all say they realize that the major force that has directed them these last four decades no longer exists. But few of them have clear ideas of what their new missions should be.
 
Images
Popular Culture Widely Influenced
 For most Americans it will be difficult to forget the cold war's pervasive influence on American entertainment and culture. Cold war themes were the subject of uncounted novels, pop songs, art work and more. Many of the most indelible images came from films.
Among them was the scene from "Dr. Strangelove," the 1963 black comedy, showing Slim Pickens waving his cowboy hat, shouting "Yahoo, Yahoo!" as he rode the hydrogen bomb down toward its target, a missile field in Russia.
Cold war images permeated films until the very end. In "Rocky IV," released in 1985, Sylvester Stallone battled a superhuman-seeming, steroid-grown Soviet boxer who warned him darkly, "I will break you." Moments later he fell bleeding to the floor, another stunned victim of underestimated American might.
But already, film images are changing, too, demonstrating that America is not entrapped by cold war stereotypes, no matter how memorable.
In "Star Trek VI," playing in theaters now, the Klingon empire is in collapse, and its chancellor, not coincidentally named Gorkan, wants to make peace, meaning "an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility that the Klingon empire can no longer afford," as the character Spock observes.
Nicholas Meyer, the film's director, said Leonard Nimoy, who plays Spock, proposed the film in 1990, just as the Berlin wall was falling, saying: "The Klingons have always been our stand-in for the Russians. What about a Berlin wall coming down in space?"
But in the Star Trek film, as in American political life, the prospect of losing an enemy leaves the leaders fearful and uncertain.
"I was used to hating Klingons," William Shatner, as Captain Kirk, mutters wistfully.
 
Legacy
Giving Up Secrecy Is Hard to Do
 When Steven Garfinkel delivers a lecture to Federal security professionals, he begins by showing them a slide that invariably leaves them perplexed.
Mr. Garfinkel is director of the Information Security Oversight Office, the Federal agency that coordinates Government policy on classified documents. Late last year, he turned to his slide as he spoke to a gathering of Defense Department security specialists at a training seminar in Richmond, Va.
It listed the names of 12 Government agencies involved in intelligence or security policy, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and Mr. Garfinkel's own office.
"What do all these agencies have in common?" he asked.
"They're all defense- or security-related," one man shouted. "All of them were formed after World War II," offered another. But these were not the answers Mr. Garfinkel was after.
With some coaxing, he finally led his audience to the response he wanted: All of the agencies were products of the cold war. Across the room members of the audience nodded.
Then came Mr. Garfinkel's next question: "With the cold war over, which ones can we get rid of?"
"They didn't have any suggestions for deleting any of them," Mr. Garfinkel recalled.
As Mr. Garfinkel and others attest, the cold war gave birth to a Government culture of secrecy and clandestine activity that had never existed before to any great degree, except in wartime.
Before the cold war, the nation did not even have a formal system for classifying documents, though some agencies did keep secrets. Today, however, Government officials classify almost seven million documents a year -- so many that Washington has an agency to coordinate policy for keeping secrets.
But with the cold war's end, some people are asking whether all this secrecy is still needed. In July, the Federation of American Scientists began publishing the Secrecy and Government Bulletin, declaring in its first edition that "in the cold war era, secrecy driven by fear and the politics of superpower rivalry became deeply imbedded in national affairs and led to serious political, moral, financial and environmental abuses.
"The end of the cold war provides an unsurpassed opportunity to rectify this problem," it added.
The bulletin's editor, Steven Aftergood, said that government secrecy had often prevented Congress and the public from "paying attention to abuses, wasted money, failed programs" and that "a whole realm of government is beyond any pretense of democratic decision-making."
But even with the cold war over, Mr. Aftergood, Mr. Garfinkel and others say the Goverment has offered no plans to reduce the number of materials stamped secret each year.
"I think it's fair to say that no one's talking yet about changing anything," Mr. Garfinkel said. "It looks like this cold war institution is going to be institutionalized beyond the cold war."
 
Education
Need for Change Is Long Overdue
 When Allen Barrow was teaching high school seniors in suburban Washington in the 1950's and '60s, "everybody expected Soviet missiles," he said, adding, "At times there was a lot of fear."
The school system helped feed that fear. Like thousands of other teachers across the country, Mr. Barrow showed his students films about the enemy. He particularly remembers one "called 'Against the Wall,' I think, in black and white, about the purges of Stalin, the millions of people executed."
Mr. Driscoll, one of his former students, had no trouble recalling that film.
"They lined up people in front of ditches and shot them," he said. "It was real newsreel film. I remember the hats flying. And I thought, 'This is the way the Russians act!' "
Mr. Barrow believes the cold war was a boon to education, in some ways, because it made his students "more aware that things that go on way over there are going to affect us here." He and others also noted that it gave an unquestioned boost to certain subject areas, such as science and engineering, particularly after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, the first man-made earth satellite.
But other educators point to darker effects as well.
As the "rhetoric of the cold war -- good guys and bad guys," filtered into the class room, said Theodore Sizer, a professor of education at Brown University, "study of Japan or Asia was limited," while academic attention was lavished on the Soviet Union. For that, he said, America is now paying a price.
Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, has been studying not just America's schools but those of countries whose students usually score much better by generally accepted international standards of measurement. Among them are schools in Germany and Japan. The difference, he says, goes back to America's view of itself in the cold war's first decade.
The United States ended World War II the globe's unquestioned leader, the only nation to enter the postwar era at full industrial capacity and in possession of nuclear weapons. As a result, from 1945 into the late 1950's, "we were enormously confident in our economic institutions, and in our social structure, including the schools," Mr. Tucker observed, while the Germans and the Japanese, and to some extent other Europeans, had to rebuild.
"But what is only now becoming apparent is that World War II led to a fundamental restructuring of the world economy," he added, alluding to the growing global trade of increasingly high-technology products. The Germans, Japanese and others restructured their societies, including their school systems, to suit. But American education stuck to a pattern that was largely set early in this century.
"We drifted," Mr. Sizer said. "We were so damned focused on Russia that we never faced up to the changing economic reality."
"There were important exceptions," he said, "but in general American education underwent a mindless continuation of the existing system."
 
Direction
Fear Giving Way To New Concerns
 Dr. Lifton and his staff at the Center on Violence and Human Survival have been monitoring the views of selected clusters of people on broad national issues for many years. But his current study, begun before the cold war ended, came up with a result that surprised him.
About 80 people from different social backgrounds in the New York area were interviewed in depth starting in 1987, and at the beginning "the fear of nuclear war we encountered was fairly widespread," he said, adding, "They spoke of a holocaust, the end of the world."
But Charles B. Strozier, co-director of Dr. Lifton's center, said that by 1990 "we began to note how that imagery was changing: Rather than fear of nuclear war, people began offering environmental images, fear of the greenhouse effect, the ozone layer and Chernobyl as dangers to the future."
Out of that, Dr. Lifton said, Americans appear to be turning their concern away from mortal enemies toward dangerous social problems instead.
But in the view of John Mack, a psychologist, it may not be so easy for the nation's leaders to follow.
Dr. Mack is founding director of the Center of Psychological Studies in the Nuclear Age at Harvard University. His studies convince him that in America, the cold war greatly exaggerated the human tendency "to judge ourselves by who we are and who we are not -- male or female, good guy or bad guy, American or Russian."
That need, Dr. Mack says, is a central feature of the human psyche, and it grew far stronger because the other side was poised to strike with nuclear arms.
For the last 40 years, America's leaders have played on that, he said. But now, with the new era, how will the nation's leaders cope when "they can't find a reliable enemy to mobilize the nation any longer?" he asks.
With the enemy at last removed, Dr. Sizer wonders whether America can "be driven by a sense of our own ideals" without the additional impetus of fear of annihilation.
Or, as Dr. Mack asks, will the nation's leaders create new enemies instead? "Will we fall back," he wonders, "to the old easy way of divide and blame, mobilize the people out of fear?"
That is the looming question of America's new age.

HOW WAR BECAME 'COLD'
 Athough Walter Lippmann and Bernard Baruch have been given credit for inventing the term "cold war," it was coined by the publicist and speechwriter Herbert Bayard Swope. By his own account, given in "William Safire's Political Dictionary," Mr. Swope first began using the phrase in personal letters just before World War II, when Americans were talking about possibly entering "a shooting war" with the Germans. Mr. Swope considered that phrase "rather tautologous and redundant," he said in a letter to Mr. Lippmann, so he came up with the phrase cold war -- "the proper opposite of the so-called 'hot war.' "
Mr. Swope said he first used the phrase referring to the American-Soviet conflict in a speech he wrote for Mr. Baruch in 1946. But Mr. Baruch said he and his advisers decided that the phrase "was too severe," and so he did not use it until 1947. By that time, apparently, he had decided that the severity was warranted. In a speech in Columbia, S.C., he said: "Let us not be deceived. Today we are in the midst of a cold war."
The phrase caught on quickly after that, in part because Mr. Lippmann began to use it, too.

'A Moral Component'

BYLINE: By Felicity Barringer

 BODY:
"If we're going to be a world leader, we need to be able to say we have some values and we want to take some leadership in an area like children's needs. But we're 56th among all nations in immunizations, and our infant mortality rate is higher than Cuba's. We need to see our role as a world leader having a moral component as well as a military component.
"We have an enormous opportunity to provide leadership in the area of limiting nuclear proliferation and promoting and encouraging and nurturing geniune democracies in many parts of the world. This is where collaboration with other wealthier nations becomes critical. The old 'we-have-the-answers' style is not one that will serve us well in the future. There is a lot of successful community development work going on in other countries. 
"The leadership of the United States depends in many ways on our making a commitment to solving issues of housing, health and the quality of life. That's what people have admired about this nation for decades, and now it is crumbling. I don't think it's possible for us to remain a world leader long into the future if we don't get our domestic house in order. There is also the question of economic productivity. As a number of American corporations have found, it's possible to be productive, efficient and committed to quality, like Japanese businesses."

HEADLINE: Travel Is Flat This Winter, Agents Say

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
ON the outside, it looks like a glamorous business, but people on the inside know better. With few exceptions, travel agents in Westchester say that although they are working harder than ever, business this winter has been flat, for the second year in a row.
"Customers are cautious," said Jeffrey Dash, owner of Dash Travel in White Plains. "They are booking shorter trips later, and they're spending less."
Mr. Dash added: "Air fares are still a mess. In Westchester, we have a lot of people who commute to Florida, and those who can't take advantage of the few promotional Florida fares this year find themselves paying 40 to 50 percent more on Florida routes than they did last year." 
 The Florida round-trip fare in January was a minimum of $400, he said, and that "makes it very difficult for Florida hotels to keep up their occupancy rates."
Even some of the lowest promotional air fares ever to Europe haven't helped stimulate county residents to travel there or to the Winter Olympics, said Jack Lepetich, president of Oliver's Travel, another White Plains agency.
"What a disappointment!" Mr. Lepetich said. "Especially when everyone in the industry was convinced that in 1992, with the Persian Gulf war behind us, travel to Europe would be strong." He said that even Icelandair's $298 round-trip fare to Luxembourg had few takers.
"What happened was, the Winter Olympics died," Mr. Dash said. "The event wasn't promoted right, and, frankly, ground transportation arrangements were very difficult to make."
Cruises, Mr. Lepetich said, were a bright spot and were selling well this season.
"Cruises are hot," he said. "The buys are unbelievable, with all the major cruise lines offering deep discounts. Just comparing cruise prices today with the prices in the 80's, which rose steadily -- on the average of 10 percent a year -- is enough to convince anyone to go on a cruise."
 
10 New Ships Built Since 1990
 A glut of megaships is what has caused the drop in prices, he said, with 10 new cruise ships built in 1990 and 1991.
"The Caribbean is flooded with new luxury cruise ships, and each of them has about 2,000 cabins to fill," Mr. Lepetich said. "And rather than send them out half empty, cruise lines are offering such things as 2 for 1 deals or 50 percent off for the second passenger."
Allen N. Rich, director of Rich Worldwide Travel in Scarsdale, said that when it comes to pricing, cruise lines now resemble airlines.
"Every morning our fax machine brings not only the new overnight airline fares but the latest cruise line discounts," Mr. Rich said. "From a travel agent's point of view, it's a nightmare. If you booked a client in advance on a luxury cruise ship, that client naturally expects to be rebooked at the lower price.
"The same holds true for the airlines," he added. "When one weak airline offers a kamikazi fare, the others flying the same route are forced to follow suit. The time and energy travel agents now spend spinning their wheels -- that is, rebooking -- I believe has contributed to the demise of many of them."
Mr. Rich and his wife, Ina, who is president of the company, also have agencies in Somers, in Rockland County and in Manhattan. The company, Mr. Rich said, does a volume of $32 million a year.
"We have 48 people in our Scarsdale office alone," Mr. Rich said. "In Westchester, we are the largest independent travel agency, and we have been ranked as the 11th largest privately held company in the county." But nevertheless, he said, this is so far not one of the agency's better years.
"But judging from the number of inquiries we've been getting lately, we are hoping that we will get a good number of late bookings this year," Mrs. Rich said. "Deluxe travel has definitely been cut back this season. On all levels, there seems to be a reluctance to splurge."
 
Uneasiness About the Economy
 People are taking shorter vacations and looking very carefully for the best deals, she said, and added: "Travelers are wary of Europe because the dollar is so bad. The Summer Olympics are not selling as they should be."
Ski resorts in the West, however, are popular. "In the off times, especially during the lulls, there are good buys and a lot of space, and customers are responding," Mrs. Rich said.
Across the board, in every price range, customers are balking at putting down deposits for accommodations six months ahead of time, Mrs. Rich said.
"It's a reflection, I believe, of most people's uneasiness about the economy," she said. "People are worried about their jobs and their businesses. I know in our own industry there are many agencies up for sale; others have gone out of business."
According to Travel Agent, an industry magazine, 2,300 agencies nationwide closed or went bankrupt during the first nine months of 1991.
Yet there are always the exceptions. Three and a half years ago, when Judith Schumacher opened her agency, the Travel Loft, in Rye, she said: "People thought I was mad. It was a low point; travel was not great."
Yet Ms. Schumacher, who started in business with four salespeople and now has nine, said she has been able to increase the agency's volume at a rate of about 10 percent a year.
 
'You Can Make Money'
 "Yes, the paperwork involved is horrendous," she said, "and there is a lot of wasted effort. But you can make money in this business. Our agents, who are all travelers themselves, spend a lot of time with clients and are able to give them firsthand information. They have the right attitude. They're enthusiastic, and customers respond by giving us repeat business and sending us their children when they want to travel."
This winter, she said, people are taking fewer and shorter vacations. "The lower-priced Caribbean islands are popular, and ski trips are selling, especially since the snow out West is the best it has been in seven years."
As for the big spenders, there are fewer of them around.
"But there are still people with plenty of money," Ms. Schumacher said. "They may be fewer in number, but the young two-salaried yuppie couple who can afford to pay $700 a day at a top resort are still traveling. They may not stay as long as they did during the 80's, but the luxury level of their trips hasn't dropped."
 
An Increase in Calls
 At Singleworld Cruises and Tours in Rye, which caters to singles only, from ages 20 to 80, the director, Randall L. Russell, said: "Our business is O.K., not great. But recently we've had an increase in the volume of phone calls. At this point we still don't know how many of those inquiries will turn into bookings."
And beginning around the first of the year, Patrick Grimes, president of Grimes Travel in White Plains, said, he was surprised, if not astonished, to see a jump in inquiries and bookings.
"Frankly," Mr. Grimes said, "I wasn't expecting it. All you hear is that fewer people are traveling. But in January, we were well ahead of last year -- a surprising increase. What's more, another encouraging sign is that a number of our clients are booking trips for next summer. We've received a number of deposits for cruises to Alaska in August."

HEADLINE: The Case of the Impotent Millionaire

BYLINE: By Walter Mosley; Walter Mosley is the author of the forthcoming mystery novel "White Butterfly."

 BODY:

FUGITIVE NIGHTS
By Joseph Wambaugh.
336 pp. New York:
Perigord Press/
William Morrow & Company. $22. 
 MANY books are rolled into one in "Fugitive Nights." It is a hard-boiled police novel that moves at a fast clip through the California desert. It is hilarious and chilling, told to us by Joseph Wambaugh at his most cynical (cynicism is, at least in this case, the flip side of romance).
It is also a mystery (actually two mysteries) with a murder thrown in. Not your usual kind of mystery. The culprit is known to you almost from the moment he is introduced. You know, or think you know, the crimes that have been committed from the beginning, and soon you have a good idea of a crime that is intended. What you do not know is why.
You do not know why the impotent and shy millionaire is going to a sperm bank, or why his wife, who rarely even sees her husband, cares. What does this domestic case, taken on by a former police officer named Breda Burrows, have to do with a burly, dark-skinned man who has accosted a policeman at a small border airport? How does it concern a diminutive and immature desert cop whose heroes are Oliver North and G. Gordon Liddy? And why would the alcoholic, overweight and misanthropic retired police detective Lynn Cutter get involved when it will jeopardize his pension?
The answers come at you from oblique angles. They lie in the characters that Mr. Wambaugh reveals with humor and care. Almost everyone in this book is either a cop or has been a cop. They are a lovable crew of misfits who try, hopelessly, to align themselves in American society. Nelson Hareem, the young desert policeman, just wants a beat where he can have a little shade. Breda wants to stay a size six and meet a man who is mature. Everyone is worried about AIDS; maybe from last night's encounter, or lurking in that swig of Scotch.
"Fugitive Nights" is a psychological novel that is topical in its approach. Jesse Jackson, Iraq, Sinead O'Connor, the recession and George Bush are to be found in its pages. Lynn Cutter gives a running, cynical account of what's wrong with the world. He lashes out at politics, poetry and the institution of marriage with a lewd wit. I found myself laughing out loud every few pages.
It is also a book about the desert. Mr. Wambaugh has certainly captured the beauty of the barren Southwest. Anyone who has been there will recognize the subtle and magnificent landscape.
"Fugitive Nights" has its ugly side, too. The forensic particulars turned my stomach. Breda Burrows gives more than enough detail when she remembers being a female police officer trying to make it in a man's world. The lives of cops, and ex-cops, are shown in a harsh light. They are idealists with guns, children with blood on their hands.
Mr. Wambaugh, who delights in his varied characters, gives us a fine supporting cast. It includes a nervous police captain, who spends every extra moment helping his wife run Tupperware parties, and Jack Graves, a modern-day Bartleby the Scrivener. Jack was my favorite character in this novel. He is a policeman who once mistakenly shot and killed an innocent Chicano youth. First he was hounded by the law and later by his own conscience. Jack is the best detective in the book because he has looked deep into his own life and has developed an abiding concern for others. But his concern extends to the perpetrators. He would really rather not turn anybody in.
There are problems with the novel. Mr. Wambaugh has been a little too ambitious. He has so many interesting characters that he has had to take some short cuts to flesh out their personalities. Jack Graves, for all the beauty of his character, is too predictably trapped in the story. I could not help feeling that there was a side of Lynn Cutter that was left unrevealed.
What I liked most about this book was that it was filled with little surprises. Characters are not what you expect them to be. They have qualities that come out only after you have listened to them for a while -- just like real people.
I cannot end without saying that "Fugitive Nights" is also a political, moral novel. There is continuous and powerful criticism of the United States, a land in which child murderers are paroled, a land filled with alcoholism, racism, chauvinism and rage.
"Fugitive Nights" had me wide-eyed and alert until the very end. And even then I was wondering: is there more?

HEADLINE: All About/Retailers;
Down the Scale With the Major Store Chains

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH; Isadore Barmash, formerly a reporter for The New York Times, writes on the retailing industry.

 BODY:
Last week, when R. H. Macy & Company filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy action, it was just the latest in the series of calamities to hit the nation's retailing industry. Two years of dismal sales and huge accumulations of debt, largely from the leveraged buyouts of the 1980's, have pushed some of the country's largest retailers to the brink. Since the beginning of 1990, Federated Department Stores, Allied Stores, Carter Hawley Hale, Ames and Hills have all filed for Chapter 11. More than 1,000 department-store outlets have been affected -- some closed, others with their staffs and inventories cut and all with the need to scramble.
Fortunately, the problems of the bankrupt chains are not those of the entire industry. Few retailers are as deeply in debt as Macy's and some of the largest chains have had strong sales even in the recession. Though final figures are not yet in -- retailing's fiscal year ends in March -- analysts expect 1991 to be a strong year for Wal-Mart, K-mart, the Gap, the Limited and Dillards.
 
Emphasis on Upsizing
One-Stop Concept Gets a New Spin
 The list of who is doing well illustrates one of the most important lessons for retailers in the 1990's: Low-priced apparel is the seller. As a result, according to Kurt Bernard, president of Bernard's Retail Marketing Report, many department stores will be allocating more space for low-priced and what the industry calls "bridge" lines, secondary designer lines that sell for about 40 percent less than the primary apparel lines. The popularity of these lower-priced fashions is shown by the reported $150 million a year in sales of Donna Karan's D.K.N.Y. Bridge Line, Mr. Bernard said. 
 Even with the bankruptcies -- and America's increasingly downscale tastes -- retailers plan to open about the same number of stores in fiscal 1992 as they did in 1991. But there will be a difference. "One of the biggest changes in 1992 will be the larger size of stores from Wal-Mart to the Gap," said Robert F. Buchanan, an analyst at Alex Brown & Sons, an investment firm in Baltimore.
The aim of the large-store strategy is to maximize sales, raise market share and capitalize on the concept of one-stop shopping. Some of the new properties combine discount, department and grocery stores all in one super site. Others are designed as no-frills warehouses. "More super stores and warehouse type stores are opening both in malls and at off-mall locations." said Walter F. Loeb, president of Loeb Associates, a New York retail consultant.
This year, Wal-Mart will opt for 110,000-square-foot stores instead of its standard 76,000-square-foot models. K-mart is designing 100,000-square-foot and larger stores, up from its standard 81,000-square-foot designs.
"Our big store growth was in the 1980's," said Joseph Antonini, K-mart's chairman and chief executive officer. "We slowed it in the early 1990's to catch up but now we are revving it up again with the large super K-mart combination stores and specialty stores." A 148,000-square-foot Super K-mart store, selling food as well as apparel, has been successfully tested in Medina, Ohio, he said, and the company plans to open more of these units.
Retailers see these superstores and warehouses as growth vehicles, Mr. Loeb said. The stores are intended to become shopping destinations, and, he said, "scream out 'Look I'm big, I'm important.' " They will try to carry everything for everyone.
But bigger stores could spell trouble for the malls, said Cathleen W. Mackey, a retail analyst at Dillon Read & Company, in New York. As individual stores expand in size, she said, they siphon off business from nearby malls, especially their anchor department and specialty stores. "I can buy practically all my needs except fashion at Wal-Mart," Ms. Mackey said. "All the basics of life are there. This is is leading to new and different configurations in retailing."
The trend to big is sweeping beyond just department, discount and specialty stores too. Last year, Radio Shack, the electronic subsidiary of the Tandy Corporation, opened eight Computer City superstores on the West Coast, in the Midwest and in the East. Fifty Computer City stores are planned by 1994.
 
Is Bigger Better?
Efficiency Looks Like the Key
 Will the large-store strategy work? A number of analysts have their doubts. A recent study by Smith Barney Harris Upham, the New York investment firm, indicates that larger stores may not prove to be the panacea some retailers hope for. The problem, according to the report, is that the rate at which sales per store have been increasing has slowed remarkably in the last decade. And size doesn't matter.
According to the report, sales per store in 1987 dollars grew at a rate of 3 percent a year between 1948 and 1977. But since 1977 -- for all stores -- the annual rate of sales growth slowed to just sixth-tenths of 1 percent.
So far nothing -- not even size -- has "offset the slower growth in sales volume per store during the 1980's," said Gregory Gieber, the Smith Barney analyst who authored the study.
Since sales per store have been slowing, the retailers that fare best, in Mr. Gieber's opinion, are the ones that are the most efficient. Making stores more efficient, analysts say, means using technology more effectively to automate back-room operations and to make it easier for customers to help themselves.
But increased productivity can also result from simple changes like extending the hours the store are open -- especially during the Christmas season -- to better accomodate today's busy shoppers.
 
New Wrinkles
A Scattering Of Fresh Ideas
 Aside from the big-store strategy, analysts are not expecting many new retailing concepts to emerge during the 1990's. Slack investment by venture capital firms and sluggish sales are the reason.
"The 1990's will be a period of consolidation." Mr. Loeb said. "Sponsorship of new retailing ideas has fallen to a trickle with about $2 billion of venture capital languishing in uncommitted capital, begging to be put into new ventures. Little if any of these monies will go into retailing," he said.
Even so, a few new ideas are being tested.
Home Limited Inc., located in the Garden Gate Shopping Center in Lombard, Ill., has staked out the Midwest for warehouse home furnishings stores. Its first store, which occupies 120,000 square feet, sells ready-to-assemble home furnishings and accessories at 10 percent to 40 percent below regular prices. The role model for the store is the IKEA chain in New Jersey, Long Island and California.
Books & Company Inc., a 10-year-old book retailer in Dayton, Ohio, recently opened separate stores for children's books and for business publications. The owners, Annye Camara and her husband, Joseph Neri, are excited by the potential of new niche segments among book customers. If the concept succeeds, Books & Company is expected to open more stores.
Rooms to Go Inc., a 14-store chain in Tampa, Fla., is the brainchild of Morton Seaman and his son Jeffrey. The older Mr. Seaman, who built up Seaman's Furniture into a major New York chain before it recently fell into bankruptcy, is acting as an adviser to his son. The Rooms to Go strategy is to sell a room- or apartment-full of furniture with related accessories. Items are individually priced but cost customers less, the more they buy. At this chain, an entire apartment can be furnished for $1,800.
One of the more unusual retailing combinations is the store-within-a-store. Nicole Miller, a fashion boutique, will be placed within a dozen upscale Sharper Image Stores later this year.
 
CUTTING OUT THE MIDDLEMEN

Aside from the bankruptcy of R. H. Macy & Company, the hottest issue discussed among retailers is the plan by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to cut out middlemen.
"They just want to deal directly with Mr. Corning or Mr. G.E.," said a wholesaler last week, referring to Corning Glass Works and the General Electric Company. The reason? Cutting out brokers or merchandise representatives will save the nation's largest retailer the 2 to 3 percent commissions the wholesalers usually add to the price of goods.
The move to eliminate the middle step in the distribution ladder began at least a decade ago when the Army and Air Force exchange service threatened to circumvent the rep. Opposition to the military's plan grew so heavy that the idea was shelved.
Now, it is Wal-Mart, eager to maintain its competitive edge, particularly its "everyday low pricing policy," that is pushing the idea. Aided by a retailer-to-vendor computer system that makes much reordering automatic, it hopes to cut out the extra cost increment. And Wal-Mart's major competitors, such as Sears Roebbuck & Company and K-mart Inc., are said to feel the same.
But brokers and reps don't like the move at all. Nor do all producers. Many of the smaller producers prefer to use reps, who may handle various lines of goods, rather than set up their own sales force.
With some rep groups threatening to sue Wal-Mart for discriminating against them, the issue may soon proceed to the courts. So far there has been no action, but
for producers, brokers and reps who depend greatly on supplying a massive trade client like Wal-Mart, the matter can be vital, even one of survival.

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Following in the footsteps of American general-interest magazines, publishers of American trade and specialty journals are scrambling to expand abroad. Driven by the recession at home and the perception of greater opportunities overseas, they are pursuing different strategies.
The Cahners Publishing Company, the industry leader in the United States and a unit of Reed International P.L.C. of Britain, hopes to make global publications out of about 20 of its American journals. Terrence M. McDermott, president of Cahners, expects their circulation in Europe and Asia to exceed 550,000 within five years, up from about 200,000 now. By comparison, the Cahners trade journals now have an American circulation of about four million. 
 The journals are aimed at managers and professionals in industries that are becoming global in ownership or in the technology they use or sell, said Martin Fleming, a Cahners vice president. They include such journals as Variety, Control Engineering, Pollution Engineering, Datamation, EDN, Electronic Business and Design News.
In a telephone interview from Cahners headquarters in Newton, Mass, Mr. Fleming said the company expects to spend "tens of millions of dollars over the next five years" on this international expansion.
Mr. McDermott said the journals generally covered areas in which the United States was the leader and in which there were no similar journals from foreign publishers. Cahners plans to use its relationships with large American companies with interests in Asia and Europe to gain a foothold in these markets. Some journals are being offered in different languages. But with the exception of inserts for individual markets, all will have the same editorial content.
Another publisher, the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, is creating indigenous magazines in large foreign markets for users and buyers of personal computers. These magazines are modeled after some of its seven successful American magazines.
For example, PC Professionell, which Ziff-Davis began publishing in Germany in April, is modeled after PC Magazine in the United States. Because the computer products available vary from market to market, each magazine has its own laboratory to conduct its own product-performance comparisons.
 
Circulation Projections
 "Foreign competitors do not compare products as exhaustively and as profoundly as Ziff-Davis does," said Frank Kelcz, the company's vice president for Europe, in a telephone interview from Paris.
He predicted that the circulation of the Ziff-Davis magazines in Europe would total 580,000 by the end of this year. The company's journals have a circulation of about three million in the United States.
Mr. Kelcz said the company's 1991-92 budget was about $60 million for creating these and other magazines in Germany, France and Britain. "But don't expect us to come out with an Albanian magazine," he said.
On the other hand, International Data Group Inc., a pioneer in foreign markets, just might.
Of International Data's 170 information-technology journals, 145 are in 55 countries outside the United States, including Bulgaria, the former Soviet Union, Romania and China. "We probably started 25 publications overseas in the last 18 months and only a couple in the U.S.," said Kelly P. Conlin, president of the company's marketing services division, in a telephone interview from Boston. The company's journals have a circulation of 2.56 million in the United States and three million abroad.
About 40 percent of International Data's $620 million in revenues last year came from abroad. With markets like Eastern Europe and Latin America relatively undeveloped, Mr. Conlin expects the international portion of revenues to rise to 60 percent within five years. The company first went abroad in the early 1970's.
Mr. Conlin described four of International Data's journals -- Network World, PC World, Macworld and Computer World -- as "global product lines." Versions of them account for about 90 of the 145 foreign journals. But all 90 are very separate publications. While all of International Data's foreign journals have access to each other's information, local editors at each magazine decide which articles best suit its market.
Many American trade publishers think it will be some time before the community, with its different languages and product tastes, will be ready for a pan-European trade magazine.
Mr. McDermott of Cahners contends that another American publisher -- CMP Publications Inc. of Manhasset, L.I. -- is discovering this with Electronic World News, an English-language magazine aimed at managers and engineers in the electronics industry. Introduced in 1989, it has separate editions in Europe and Asia that share some articles. Mr. McDermott believes it is struggling to attract advertising.
But CMP's president, Michael Leeds, insisted that the journal was "doing very well" and was having no more difficulty than a new journal in a competitive American market. He declined to say if it was profitable.

Libel Threat Is Increasing Even for Small Publications

BYLINE: By Alex S. Jones

 BODY:
ABOUT three times each semester, student editors at The Daily Pennsylvanian, the 14,000-circulation newspaper of the University of Pennsylvania, call their libel lawyer about how to get something prickly into print without risking economic ruin in a libel suit.
For Lee Levine, the lawyer they call at Ross, Dixon & Masback in Washington, the most galling aspect of counseling such clients is their tendency to view him with suspicion if not hostility. 
 "The hardest job I've got is to convince them that I'm on their side," said Mr. Levine, who worked at The Daily Pennsylvanian as an undergraduate. His firm also offers regular pre-publication advice to Jack Anderson, the columnist, and The Diamondback, the student newspaper at the University of Maryland. And the firm is on call for consultation by any of the 2,200 publications in the Newsletter Publishers Association.
Indeed, small news organizations of all types are under increasing pressure from worried owners and anxious libel insurers to consult more frequently with lawyers like Mr. Levine to blunt -- if not avoid -- the very real threat to their existence posed by libel suits.
Bruce Sanford, a First Amendment lawyer at Baker & Hostetler in Washington, estimated that the simplest libel action could cost about $20,000 to defend before the case ever came to trial. He said a tenacious plaintiff or an unsympathetic judge could easily increase pre-trial costs to $500,000.
James T. Borelli, legal counsel for Media/Professional Insurance Inc., which claims to be the largest provider of libel insurance to the news media, said the greatest concern was not litigation costs but the risk of a huge financial judgment by a jury. Last year, a record of $58 million was set in a Texas case.
Mr. Borelli said insurers, who have great say in whether libel suits are settled or fought, were increasingly settling, though he offered no specifics and noted that "the vast majority" of cases were not settled.
"It's not like opening a checkbook for libel plaintiffs," Mr. Borelli said.
Large news organizations and book publishers have long been in the habit of consulting lawyers about potential libel problems.
For instance, C. Thomas Dienes, a law professor at the National Law Center at George Washington University, spends several hours each week reading U.S. News & World Report before it is published. When he spots problems, Mr. Dienes said, "You still try to keep the punch in it, but cut down a little bit on the risk," by, for instance, not identifying a person whose reputation could be damaged in an article.
But libel plaintiffs seem increasingly to be aiming their litigation at smaller publications.
John J. Walsh, who has built a successful law practice at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in New York representing libel plaintiffs, said newsletters and trade publications often became the target of libel suits not because they were more economically vulnerable, but because they were perceived as tip sheets for large media organizations.
"These smaller publications are the feeders," said Mr. Walsh, who added that stopping the publication of damaging information at newsletters often means "it is not going to be picked up by a larger publication."
The trend of bringing libel suits against newsletters and other small publications has seemed to parallel the growth of so-called Slapp suits, an acronym that stands for Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. Mark Goldowitz, director of the California Anti-Slapp Project, said a Slapp suit could include a libel suit filed against an environmental group by a municipality.
"It is an effort by a plaintiff to change a policy or political issue into a litigation or judicial issue," Mr. Goldowitz said.
Slapp suits are most often filed against political groups rather than news organizations, but the intention is similar to libel suits against newsletters and other publications when the intent is to nip damaging information in the bud. In such situations, pre-publication review by a lawyer would rarely avoid a suit.
Mr. Sanford said one such suit was filed by the National Life Insurance Company against his client, Phillips Publishing Inc., the publisher of the newsletter Profitable Investing.
In 1989, Profitable Investing evaluated the nation's insurance companies in an article entitled "How Safe Is Your Insurance?" The article was among the first to note that one method for evaluating an insurer's strength was its rating by Standard & Poor's. On this basis, National Life was listed among the companies the newsletter characterized as "shaky" and recommended that it be avoided.
National Life filed suit for defamation. Theodore Sherbow, the company's lawyer from Weinberg & Green in Baltimore, said the article unfairly impaired National Life's reputation, integrity and financial strength.
Phillips Publishing has lost several court motions, including one seeking dismissal on the ground that the newsletter was exercising its right to fair comment. Another motion to dismiss is before the Federal District Court in Maryland.
Mr. Sanford said that had he reviewed the newsletter before publication, he would not have changed it. "We've said this is simple," he said.
Mr. Sherbow also views the situation as obvious, but to his mind, the newsletter's guilt is what is apparent.

HEADLINE: Why Economy Isn't Like a Warm Current

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William Safire grasps the essential science in "The Current Event" (column, Jan. 16), on El Nino, the warm Pacific Ocean current, which is being blamed for floods in Texas. El Nino is a natural rhythm of the climate system, and it is not a calamity for everyone. In Florida and Georgia, for example, it reduces the likelihood of forest fires. 
 Mr. Safire's other inferences are specious. Like other natural and necessary cyclic phenomena -- earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, floods -- El Nino is a disaster for those unlucky enough to be in the wrong place. Perhaps economic cycles are also inevitable, but those who lose their livelihoods or homes cannot share Mr. Safire's benign view of the consequences.
He implies that acknowledging the rhythms of nature -- or the economy -- dictates passive acceptance. Shouldn't a humane society act on its knowledge to ameliorate negative effects? Contrary to Mr. Safire, we have come to understand the huge forces that determine which way the wind blows well enough to predict El Nino and many of its consequences.
The latest return of the warm current was predicted a year ago. El Nino can't be stopped, but such tropical countries as India and Peru have learned to reduce the harm it causes by acting on our expanding knowledge. Surely, our advanced society can do better than Mr. Safire's mystical fatalism. This is El Nino's most powerful lesson.

HEADLINE: We Need to Increase, Not Decrease, Savings

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Open Up the I.R.A.'s" by John D. Sicher (Op-Ed, Jan. 17), arguing that Americans should be allowed to tap into their individual retirement accounts, shows the same glaring myopia demonstrated by the debt architects of the 1980's. The way out of this recession is not to consume money saved for retirement in the future; it is to invest in and build that future. 
 Mr. Sicher would have you believe that I.R.A. funds are invested in mattresses. Instead they are invested in stocks, mutual funds, certificates of deposit and many other productive investments. This pool of money finances the growth and development of America's economy. The United States savings rate is already too low, thus granting a competitive advantage to the Japanese, who have always had a very high savings rate.
The large supply of savings contributes to the low cost of capital for Japanese companies, enabling them to invest in more modern and efficient equipment. Some may remember that the I.R.A. deduction was expanded under President Carter to increase savings and decrease interest rates. In the Reagan era of spend now, pay later, the incentives were removed for most Americans.
If we are to have long-term economic recovery and a future as the leading economic power, it will be through intelligent investment in the future.

HEADLINE: Delays Paralyze Newark's Efforts to House Poor

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 1

 BODY:
In a ramshackle area of wood-frame houses in the Central Ward here, officials held a ground breaking last April that they hailed as the start of a new era for Newark's poorest residents.
But there was more to it: The 100 town houses were to be a new start for the Newark Housing Authority, which had become notorious for failing to build or maintain housing even when it had money to do both. The ceremony would begin a $110 million construction program -- as ambitious as any in public housing -- that would replace 11 deteriorated high-rise buildings with scattered two- and three-story houses. 
 Today the lot where officials gathered with shovels and promises remains empty. The developer chosen for the project never secured financing, and construction schedules are still changing. Instead of a new beginning, the groundbreaking has become a vivid reminder -- along with two town houses under construction that blew down in a windstorm -- that the authority is unable to shelter the poor. Indeed, since the authority demolished four 13-story buildings in 1987, vowing to start construction of new town houses within 90 days, it has built one house.
 
A Last Resort Deteriorates
 To some degree, the failure of Newark's public housing is the story of the failure of public housing all over the country. Where projects became the housing of last resort, buildings were allowed to deteriorate. Peter Marcuse, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University who is writing a book on public housing, calls the pattern "a clear recipe for disaster."
"Wherever public housing has become the housing for the poorest," he said, "buildings have been similarly abandoned, torched."
But while replacing the failures of the past with better, more humane housing has not been an easy task anywhere, it has been especially tortuous in Newark. The Housing Authority's management has been hapless -- inept and riddled with unbridled patronage, some argue -- and its housing is far more unwieldy than most.
To many here, the situation is the shame of Newark. New market-rate housing and $6 billion worth of construction seem to have begun a revival in Newark's downtown, a state arts center is planned and there is even talk of building a convention center. But decent low-income housing is a crucial need in this city where the median income is $12,000, unemployment exceeds 12 percent and one-third of its 275,000 residents receive welfare.
In the Central Ward, filled with rundown houses, boarded-up buildings and homeless men warming themselves around trash-can fires, the need is obvious. The 10 buildings of the Hayes Homes, a Housing Authority complex, loom above bald dirt, shriveled trees and broken playground equipment. Shards of glass litter the central courtyard. Five of the buildings are vacant except for drug-addicted squatters.
 
'Reservations For the Poor'
 There is a consensus that both Newark's public housing and the authority are in desperate condition. Mayor Sharpe James, the city's most indefatigable booster, calls the public housing high-rises "shameful reservations for the poor."
No one disputes him, though many argue that even wretched public housing is better than nothing, especially when there are an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 homeless people, not including those who live doubled up or in substandard conditions. Hundreds of families stay in expensive welfare hotels, and community leaders say their numbers are growing.
Meanwhile, 22 housing authority high-rises stand empty and several others are only half full. Walls in empty apartments have been punched so full of holes that it is often hard to tell where the doorway was. Pipes have been pulled out, light fixtures and wiring removed and floor tiles ripped up, and the staircases are full of garbage and reek of urine. Dried blood is a common sight.
Residents keep their occupied apartments as tidy as anyone's. But 11 vacated buildings, including all 8 of those in Columbus Homes, have been declared too ravaged to fix and are destined for the wrecking ball. But that could be years away. As part of a 1989 settlement with a coalition of tenant and community groups that blocked plans to level 39 of the authority's 46 high-rises, the authority must begin to build replacements before it tears down any more units.
The alliance of community groups, the Newark Coalition for Low-Income Housing, charges that mismanagement and incompetence are behind the construction delays. Last month, the coalition asked the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees public housing, to appoint a receiver to take over the construction program.
"It's the same story over and over," said J. Harris David, a lawyer for the coalition. Small projects have taken an average of 10 years to complete, Mr. David said, adding: "H.U.D. bears a special responsibility here. There is more than $110 million and 1,777 units of housing at stake."
Victor DeLuca, the coalition's chairman, says the demolition plan proves that the housing authority, with H.U.D.'s acquiescence, has abandoned its mission. "No one wants to build housing for the poor," he said. "Some of the land is becoming too valuable for poor people."
 
Red Tape And Recession
 Authority officials call such charges ridiculous and counter that construction has stalled because of the recession, which has made banks uneasy about backing projects that cost, on average, more than $10 million. And they cite bureaucracy that has hindered obtaining titles to land or site approvals.
"Each step along the way, not only do we get some problem, perhaps," said Robert Graham, the authority's interim assistant director, "we also get the entity using all the available time to give us their approval. And oftentimes it's not done concurrently, but consecutively." Burton Bloomberg, acting manager of the H.U.D. office in Newark, said, "It's a complex situation with a lot involved."
But stalled construction is not the authority's only problem. Its leadership is in disarray. In August, its board dismissed its executive director, Dr. Daniel W. Blue Jr., who has since joined the Chicago Housing Authority. In December, four top officials resigned. Mayor James, who opposes a Federal receiver for the authority, contends that new management is needed.
"For too long, the Newark Housing Authority has been a political pork barrel for patronage-giving contracts," he said in an interview at City Hall recently. "I'm looking forward to an independent board with a new N.H.A. director who puts shovels in the ground and builds housing." The Mayor won a court fight in 1990 for the right to appoint six of seven commissioners, five without City Council approval, where the Council previously appointed five and the Mayor one. The Governor appoints the seventh.
Most of the top administrative jobs at the authority, which has 1,000 employees, have changed hands at least once since 1988, said Frank Armour, an authority lawyer. And there was excitement in 1989 at the appointment of Dr. Blue, who had been Mayor Kenneth Gibson's chief of staff, and fanfare over a new board back in 1987. Both appointments were hailed as the beginning of a turnaround.
The Newark authority currently houses about 7,900 households. It has 10,700 units, not including those scheduled for demolition, a waiting list that hovers around 6,500 families, and one of the highest vacancy rates in the country for a public housing authority. In several projects, money is desperately needed for basic maintenance, though the authority receives subsidies for vacant apartments and though its operating reserves, the money used to spend on repairs as needed, are at 90 percent.
Michael B. Janis, deputy assistant secretary at H.U.D.'s Bureau of Public and Indian Housing, said the "very, very high" operating reserve was one reason the authority, the nation's eighth largest, was considered among the nation's most troubled. "If there are units in the housing agency that need some maintenance," he asked, "why isn't that money being utilized to improve the housing?"
But Ben Quattlebaum, the authority's former chief of staff and one of the four officials who recently resigned, said more than 1,600 apartments had been renovated over the last two years to comply with the settlement agreement. He added that the agency had increased its spending on maintenance and modernization and earmarked some reserves for capital improvement.
Some critics trace the authority's problems back to a source of many of the city's other enduring woes, the 1967 riots, which left 26 people dead and leveled entire neighborhoods, destroying more than 1,000 businesses. Residents who could afford to flee did so. Between 1970 and 1990, according to Census Bureau statistics, Newark lost 27 percent of its population. What remained were the projects.
Housing Authority officials say a plan embraced in the 1980's by public housing authorities all over the country sheds some light on their vacancies and maintenance problems. Authorities came to see demolition as the only way to put ravaged, crime-ridden high-rises out of their misery, a concept the N.H.A. wholeheartedly endorsed. It devised a plan that would have seen the most sweeping removal of public housing by any city in the country. More than 5,000 of its 13,133 units would have been eliminated, and thousands were warehoused in preparation for the demolition. No money was spent to either repair or maintain them.
But the authority's plans came to a halt in 1987, when Congress outlawed the demolition of public housing without a one-for-one replacement of the units destroyed. The Newark Coalition sued, and the authority was forced to reverse its course.
Now, said Mr. Graham, the authority is in a Catch-22. "We can't demolish the buildings and they were not maintained, so the cost of trying to fix them is too high," he said. 
 
Tenants Clean Up: 'This Is Our Home'
 But Pearl Cole, who has lived in Building No. 1 at Hayes Homes since it opened 37 years ago, cannot believe that it would cost $100 million to restore the project's former pride. Ms. Cole, co-chairwoman of the Hayes Homes Tenants Committee, said the tenants started a clean-up campaign in December that had made a world of difference. "We wanted to look good for Christmas," she said. "We bought some cleaner to get rid of the smell and the housing authority gave us the paint to do the walls."
Building No. 1 is now a clean, well-lighted place. The front door has no lock and the linoleum is worn, but there are no graffiti on the walls and no trash in the stairwells. Residents have been moved down to the lower 6 of its 12 floors, but there are no squatters in vacant apartments. "We chased them out," she said. "This is our home."
The tenants at Hayes Homes want the housing authority to unbolt sealed floors and buildings and make the project livable. That is unlikely. The housing authority plans to close two buildings and consolidate the tenants in the remaining three.
Stephen Finn, the director of the Newark Coalition's home project, which monitors the 1989 settlement, said that efforts to consolidate Hayes Homes tenants would be challenged in court. "We would hope the Mayor would become more involved," he said. "Instead of going around like Gorbachev trying to sell everybody on how great Newark is, he could be helping the residents of the city."
The Mayor bristles at the criticism. "My commissioners fired the executive director," he said, adding that "the James era" will start with the new executive director. Mr. James also added that his administration was the first of any city to build its own low-income housing, Victory Gardens. But others point out that Victory Gardens does not serve the most needy since its 100 units are for sale, not rent.

HEADLINE: Officers Go on Trial Today In Beating of Black Driver

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Nearly a year after they were caught on videotape clubbing and kicking a black motorist, four white police officers go on trial this week in a case that renews the painful question whether beatings and racial prejudice are common behavior within the Los Angeles Police Department.
The videotape shocked national television audiences, raised a political storm here and led to demands for reforms in the Los Angeles Police Department and to an examination of police misconduct in other cities around the country. 
 Eleven months after the March 3 beating, Los Angeles continues to wrestle with the difficulties of adapting its aggressive Police Department to the complicated needs of its ethnically diverse community.
Critics say brutality is common within the department, and the four officers will, in effect, be taking up the critics' banner by arguing that they were acting in accord with departmental procedures.
One year later, even the commander in charge of instituting reforms in the department concedes that while many changes have been made, officers on the beat are conducting themselves much as they always have.
 
Seeking to Control Chief
 An independent commission investigating the department reported last week that some progress had been made in instituting the changes it proposed in July. But its chairman, Warren Christopher, said lasting improvements would depend on passage in June of a ballot measure that would limit the city's police chief to two five-year terms and and bring him under closer political control by removing him from civil-service protection.
The current Chief, Daryl F. Gates, has resisted pressure to resign and continues to oppose changes, reacting to public criticisms of his department as personal challenges.
Chief Gates, 65 years old, had told the City Council last summer that he would retire in April but now says that he will stay on the job at least until after the vote on the measure, which he plans to campaign against.
But taking him at his earlier word, the city is searching for his successor and plans to announce its choice in April.
On the national level, John R. Dunne, Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, said the Justice Department had completed a much publicized review of 15,000 complaints of police misconduct nationwide filed over the past six years, but that he did not know when its results might be made public.
Although several national organizations monitor police practices, none keep complete statistics on complaints about the police in each city, so it is difficult to compare Los Angeles officers to their counterparts elsewhere. On average, about 600 complaints a year are filed against Los Angeles police officers, and the city in 1990 paid $8 million in jury awards and settlements for brutality complaints.
Now, as the trial officially opens Monday in the Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley, public attention will again be drawn to the videotape that shows four officers swinging their nightsticks and kicking a prostrate Rodney G. King as nearly a score of their colleagues look on.
After analyzing the tape, prosecutors brought charges of assault last March against Sgt. Stacey C. Koon, now 41, and Officers Laurence M. Powell, 29, Theodore J. Briseno, 39, and Timothy E. Wind, 31.
Officer Wind, a rookie, was dropped from the force because he was still on probation. The three others were suspended without pay and face departmental administrative hearings. If convicted, the defendants could face prison sentences.
Once jury selection is completed and testimony gets under way, probably in early March, Mr. King, 27, an unemployed construction worker who has been convicted of robbery and at the time of the beating had recently been released from prison, is expected to testify after a nearly yearlong public silence about his beating.
His lawyer, Steven A. Lerman, said Mr. King continues to receive therapy for ailments that include memory losses, frequent nightmares, slurred speech, blurred vision, facial nerve damage that limits his feeling and taste, and a limp.
Mr. Lerman said Mr. King, who has filed a multimillion-dollar suit against the city, had suffered a broken leg, smashed teeth and almost a dozen fractures in his head. He underwent surgery to remove gravel that was embedded in his face when officers dragged him, hogtied, to the side of the road after the beating. Although the officers said he was speeding, Mr. King was not charged with anything in the incident.
In the trial, the prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Terry White, is expected to show the tape repeatedly, as apparently unambiguous evidence to support his charges of assault.
But lawyers for the defendants say that what they call an "optical illusion" is involved because the videotape does not show the circumstances that surrounded the beating. They will admit that the officers struck Mr. King but will contend that their clients were pursuing the only prudent course.
They say they will focus on the minute or two after Mr. King was stopped at the end of a 15-minute chase and before an amateur cameraman named George Holliday began taping the incident from the window of his apartment.
"It is undoubtedly the case that the incident on the video is a reaction to what was going on before and at the very beginning of the video," said Paul R. DePasquale, who represents Mr. Wind.
Some officers who witnessed the incident told a grand jury that Mr. King behaved strangely when he was ordered from his car, joking and gesturing and resisting commands.
In sharp conflict with Chief Gates's contention that the beating was "an aberration," Mr. DePasquale said the defense would assert that the officers were acting in accordance with normal procedures during the beating.
"What happened out there was what these guys were taught, trained and expected to do by the L.A.P.D.," he said. "And the contention that the incident is somehow anomalous or an example of rogue behavior is hypocrisy. It's dishonest."
 
'Racist, Brutal Police'
 That argument echoes the views of a number of public figures in Los Angeles, like John Mack, the president of the Los Angeles Urban League, who said, "African-Americans are sometimes not sure who they are more afraid of, racist, brutal police on one side or gang bangers on the other."
In its initial report last July, the Christopher Commission found problems in several areas including training, the handling of citizen complaints, the use of excessive force and relations with the community.
In this week's diplomatically worded six-month update, it described a mixed picture of "important initial steps" by the department, along with resistance to structural changes.
Police Comdr. Rick Dinse, who is supervising reforms out of Chief Gates' office, said the department was taking to heart the commission's recommendations.
"Out of 163 individual recommendations, we either have in place or are in the process of putting in place 105 of them, and there are some that we are still opposed to," he said. But on the street, he conceded, "I don't think there is anything you can physically look at or that you can go out and say that is different."
Both the American Civil Liberties Union and lawyers specializing in police brutality cases said they continue to receive as many complaints about abuses as before.
"I think the response of the department has been deliberate, that it has been careful and orchestrated to create the appearance that they were doing all these reforms anyway," said Dan Garcia, the former chairman of the Police Commission, which oversees the 8,300-member department.

HEADLINE: New York's Haitians Share the Fear

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
In a smoky cafe in Brooklyn yesterday, Edner Desrosiers glanced over his shoulder, toward the Statue of Liberty which was visible four miles to the west in New York Harbor, and wondered what the grand symbol of freedom has come to mean.
A day after the United States Government resumed the forced return of Haitian exiles to their troubled country, Mr. Desrosiers trembled with anger and despair for the people of Haiti. 
 "I ask myself, the U.S. Constitution cannot allow Bush to do something like this," said Mr. Desrosiers, a 40-year-old math and French teacher who left Haiti 13 years ago during the brutal dictatorship of President Jean-Claude Duvalier.
"That's why the Statue of Liberty is there, right there in the Hudson River," he continued. "That's a symbol for any nation that seeks asylum."
 
Resentment, Loud or Quiet
 From cafes, street corners and offices of New York City, Haitians both angrily and quietly expressed resentment at the American policy. Many asked how the United States could recall its ambassador, citing growing political violence, and yet send hundreds of Haitian exiles back to a land with such a climate of fear.
The Haitians expressed resentment at what seemed to them a double standard in American policy. But they also spoke of dread, about a nation stoked with political and economic turmoil since the military coup that overthrew the elected civilian Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September.
 
A Step Ahead of Secret Police
 At a tiny restaurant in Prospect Heights, Chez l'Ami Tiotio, Mr. Desrosiers explained that he had beat a hasty path out of Haiti, a step ahead of the Tontons Macoute, the Caribbean country's secret police. If he were to return, he said, brandishing an imaginary weapon, he would be dead.
"If you go there, they're going to kill you," he said. "The Haitian people who are in America now, we know what freedom means. We know what democracy means."
Aluption Cadet, who came to New York from Haiti in 1969, saw a grim future.
"It's a disaster to send them back," Mr. Cadet, a porter, said. "It's a shame. We don't do anything to nobody. We like everybody. Why someone hurt us?"
 
'The Dream is Gone'
 Raymond Guillaume, an accountant for Citibank, felt a similar sadness. "The whole dream of America is gone," Mr. Guillaume said wearily. He spent yesterday preparing income tax returns for Haitian immigrants, a second job at his brother-in-law's office in Brooklyn. Photographs of Father Aristide, the ousted President, lined the walls.
Mr. Guillaume said he learned of the forced repatriation on the Saturday evening news. As he watched, he said he grew angry at the excuses put forth by the Bush Administration.
"When the army people are harassing you and trying to kill you, it's really hard," said the accountant, a soft-spoken man who left Haiti 25 years ago. "The poor people are dying by mass. They are the ones who are fleeing the country. It's not economics. It is political. There is a part of racism to this."
Many Haitians interviewed yesterday said they did not know how to come to the aid of the exiles. Then they found a voice.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, at a news conference yesterday in Washington, called the forced repatriation "an immoral act of genocide" and urged houses of worship to ring their bells in protest. He said he was also getting in touch with all the presidential candidates to ask them to speak out.
"It's clearly a double standard fueled by race," Mr. Jackson said in an interview. "The extreme right wing, the David Dukes, the Pat Buchanans, have drawn the line of locking the Haitians out."
He added that Eastern Europeans and other immigrants had not been returned. Haitians too, he said, deserve a chance in the new world order.
For Alan Cave, the repercussions of returning to Haiti seemed too grim to ponder yesterday. Mr. Cave, a 25-year-old musician who plays at a night club in Brooklyn, said he calls his family in Haiti every weekend. "You don't know what could happen," he said. "There is always worry."
For the first time in a long time, Mr. Cave said, he could feel no hope. "We are desperate in a sense," he said. "We hardly know what to do."

HEADLINE: HAITI GETS DELAY IN EXILES' RETURN

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Plans to begin sending thousands of Haitian boat people home from the crowded refugee camps at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were delayed for 24 hours today, in what diplomats and relief experts said was an effort to give the Haitian authorities more time to prepare for the refugees' return.
The delay meant that two boats carrying the first 400 returnees would not be able to dock until Monday. The process began after unusual judicial and diplomatic maneuvers succeeded in ifting an injunction barring the repatriations. 
 Since the military coup on Sept. 30 that toppled Haiti's first democratically elected government, about 15,000 fleeing Haitians have been picked up at sea. Last week, the Administration increased pressure to expedite the case, arguing that a renewed surge of boat people was rapidly outstripping the country's capacity to handle them. Washington said that about 20,000 more Haitians were massing on their country's shores preparing to flee.
On Friday, a Federal appeals court in Atlanta said it had overruled a district court in Miami that was blocking repatriation. In an unusual move, the Atlanta court quickly rescinded its announcement, citing a "clerical error."
Later Friday, the Supreme Court voted 6-3 to lift the injunction. The court gave no reason for its decision, although it apparently agreed that the Administration was facing a refugee emergency. The action still allows the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to deliberate the merits of the case.
 
Embargo Constricts Island
 Lawyers for the refugees say the Haitians should not be forced to return while violence persists. The Government says most of the refugees have no right to asylum because they are fleeing for economic reasons.
In addition to the violence, an embargo has devastated the economy and malnutrition and disease are multiplying in rural areas, relief experts say.
"We are still alive, but we have been badly wounded," said Cheryl Little, the supervising attorney for the Haitian refugee center in Miami which sought court action to slow repatriation. "By the time a decision comes down on the merits, how many Haitians will have already been returned?"
Ms. Little called Government reports of 20,000 new refugees "unfounded," and said the Supreme Court had let itself be influenced by "politics, scare tactics and disinformation."
She said the court left her less than half a day on Friday to present arguments against lifting the injunction.
A Justice Department official said that each side had repeatedly been caught with little time to prepare arguments. The official denied that the issue had become politicized.
Ms. Little's complaints were echoed by human rights and church leaders in Haiti, however, who warned that the violence is far from subsiding.
"This is a slap in the face of the Haitian people who are being denied due process," said the Rev. Hugo Triest, a Roman Catholic priest involved in human rights monitoring here. "No one believes this story about 20,000 people, and if it is even partly true, it is because of the extreme repression that is going on here against anyone who wants change."
Offering evidence of the climate of fear, Father Triest said that earlier today he had seen the police round up people in the capital for supposedly supporting the deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, issued a statement tonight saying she "regrets" the American decision, given the violence in Haiti.
Officials here and in Washington could not say where the figure of 20,000 people originated. One, who defended the estimate as "maybe even a little conservative," however, alluded to satellite data, which he said showed that enough small boats were available to carry 150,000 Haitians.
Diplomats and relief officials said that the repatriation would begin Monday with the boatload of 150 refugees who left Guantanamo late Saturday and have been cruising between Cuba and Haiti while Haitian authorities prepared to receive them. A second boatload of 250 left today.

The Economy
President Bush plans to finance his health insurance proposal, aimed at helping 90 million Americans buy coverage with new tax credits and tax deductions, mainly by slowing the growth of health programs like Medicare and Medicaid, Administration officials and members of Congress said. The plan is to be introduced in a speech in Cleveland on Thursday. [Page A1.]
Economists say that if the $50 billion in military spending cuts Bush proposed is used to increase growth, the short-term pain would be outweighed by long-term gain. [D3.] 
 It may be premature to write the obituary of the department store. Those eager to relegate the stores to a retailing museum can cite a long list of failed emporiums, yet the traditional department store's share of the general merchandise market has declined less than bankruptcies would seem to indicate. [A1.]
After years of talk, New York City is expected to announce a program today to sell tax-exempt bonds to small investors at prices as low as $1,200 for a $5,000 bond due in 20 years. [B1.]
Dozens of corporate giants collected money to promote brand-name products under an Agriculture Department program. [D7.]
 
Companies
New York legislators are expected to approve changes in credit card laws that would encourage banks to keep more jobs in the state but would raise the cost of credit cards to consumers. [D1.]
Drug marketers have found a new promise of comfort for Americans with drippy noses and aching bodies, but the active ingredients in many new flu medicines are the same as those in regular cold medicines. [D3.]
 
International
Unless American auto parts suppliers swiftly adjust to the vastly different priorities set by Japanese car companies, President Bush has shaken hands on an agreement that may hasten the decline of the American industry, experts say. [D1.]
Representatives of about 160 governments are trying to agree on how to make room for new radio technologies. [D1.]
Germany and the U.S. called for drastic steps to insure liberalization of world trade as the best means to guarantee growth and encourage market economies in the former Soviet Union. [D2.]
German steelworkers voted to strike, and union officials said work stoppages could begin this week. [D2.]
 
The Media Business
CBS desperately needs its Winter Olympics coverage to be an unquestioned success in the ratings. [D1.]
Is ambush marketing about to become an Olympic event? The spoilsport strategy, in which an advertiser tries to disrupt a competitor's plan, seems to be growing, with companies seeking to become associated with events like the Olympics for which a rival has paid for an official affiliation.

HEADLINE: Hoping Freedom Will Ring, U.S. Relaxes Cuba Embargo

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Making a rare exception to its economic blockade of the Communist Government of President Fidel Castro, the Bush Administration has granted permission to A.T.&T. to expand telephone service between Cuba and the United States.
But Administration officials say that far from recasting their policy of isolating the Communist Government, they instead intend the move to help stir popular unrest by increasing exposure between Cubans and their more affluent relatives in the United States. 
 Despite Washington's motivation, Havana would apparently like to believe that telephone diplomacy, like the Ping-Pong diplomacy that improved American relations with China, could loosen the embargo.
"It could be a good sign," said Ariel Ricardo, spokesman of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, "but you always have doubts about what is the intention."
The Administration's decision in late December to allow the company to pay Havana $620,000 in fees for operation of a cable line to Cuba reflects a new, more flexible approach to the island nation at a time when the Castro Government faces a serious threat from the collapse of Soviet Communism and the loss of Moscow's crucial aid.
Even as it has tightened regulations on Cubans who wish to immigrate, the Administration initiated new immigration negotiations with Havana in December. And in a move that would have been unthinkable a few years ago, the Administration shared intelligence information with Havana to thwart a reported terrorist plot to plant a bomb at the recent Pan American Games.
The Administration's willingness to promote A.T.&T.'s business in Cuba comes at a time when there has been a shift in the thinking of some Cuban-Americans who are influential in the Republican Party. Once opposed to any accommodations with Havana, they and the Administration have come to believe that increased communications can spur popular opposition to the Castro Government.
"We believe the more information that flows into Cuba the better," said a senior State Department official.
A break with past practice was signified by the Treasury Department's long-delayed approval of A.T.&.T.'s three-year-old request for permission to pay the Castro Government annual maintenance and capital improvement fees for a telephone cable. While a handful of American companies have received licenses to deal with the Cuban Government in the last several years, all were involved in educational, artistic or charitable endeavors, not commercial transactions.
About 60 million attempts to place telephone calls are made annually between the countries, but only about 500,000 get through the antiquated short-wave radio system. Many people spend hours dialing in vain. With the copper underwater cable connecting West Palm Beach, Fla., and Cojimar, Cuba, an estimated 250,000 more calls should be completed annually.
Officials predict the cable could be operational by the spring. Treasury Department approval is required for the deal on the payment of tolls, by which Cuba would eventually earn between $1 million and $2 million a year.
The Cuban Government is not expected to net money from the transaction, and may even lose some currency, because it receives what callers consider exorbitant fees for some calls between the United States that are now patched through from Canada.

HEADLINE: Credit Card Legislation Up for Vote

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
New York legislators are expected today to approve changes in the state's credit card laws that would encourage New York banks to keep more jobs in the state but would raise the cost of credit cards to consumers who pay their bills late.
The legislation would eliminate the 10-day delay period before banks can charge a penalty fee on past-due card payments and would make it easier for New York banks to offer cards with a variable interest rate. 
 Opposed by the state Consumer Protection Board, the bill is an example of how lawmakers sometimes balance competing interests to keep jobs from moving to other states.
"We want to create a climate that tells banks they can do business in New York, and at the same time protect the consumer," said Herman D. Farrell Jr., a Democratic Assemblyman representing parts of Harlem and Washington Heights. Mr. Farrell is chairman of the Assembly banking committee and sponsor of the Assembly version of the bill.
 
Same Powers as in Delaware
 The bill would give New York banks the same powers as banks that operate their credit card businesses in Delaware, South Dakota or other states where banks are given greater leeway in running their credit card operations.
Chase Manhattan and the Bank of New York have large credit card businesses in Delaware. Citicorp, which has more than 30 million credit card accounts and is by far the largest in the field, runs its card business through banks it owns in South Dakota, Nevada and Maryland.
The proposed changes are closely related to the Dec. 31 merger of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Bank, which is expected to result in the loss of 6,200 jobs, most of them in the metropolitan New York City region. The Chemical Banking Corporation moved its credit card business to Delaware from New York in the early 1980's. Manufacturers Hanover currently employs about 1,400 people in a computer center in Hicksville, L.I., that handles credit cards and other consumer transactions.
As those two companies merge their operations under the Chemical name, they have wanted to combine the card operations in New York -- but they have also sought to make the state's laws as favorable as those in Delaware.
Officials from Chemical visited Albany in September to meet with legislators. "We certainly expressed our opinion that the existing laws were unworkable," said Judy Walsh, a Chemical spokeswoman.
In November, bank officials were optimistic enough that they would get their way that they announced plans to combine the Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover credit card businesses in Hicksville.
Manufacturers Hanover is the largest New York bank to have kept its card business in the state, and it has not been shy in the past about asking the state for help. In 1989 it sought and obtained laws that allow New York banks to charge fees to consumers who pay late or exceed their pre-approved credit lines.
 
Responding to Competition
 The chairman of the Senate banking committee, Hugh T. Farley, Republican of Schenectady, said the importance of preserving the 1,400 jobs in Hicksville and attracting new jobs from the credit card business of Chemical's subsidiary bank in Texas, was more important than the extra costs to consumers. Chemical employs 150 people in Delaware and several dozen in Texas.
"It's very competitive business," he said, referring to credit cards. He noted that New Yorkers who used cards issued by banks from outside the state were already accepting terms similar to those in the proposed bill.
While many banks still charge interest rates of 18 to 19.8 percent on credit card balances, many other banks have been cutting rates in recent months.
People's Bank in Bridgeport, Conn., for example, cut its rate to 11.5 percent from 13.9 percent late last month. And Chemical has said it plans to cut rates to 17.8 percent from 19.8 percent on its ordinary fixed-rate cards in March and to 16.8 from 17.8 percent on its gold cards. Chemical's floating-rate cards, offered through its Delaware bank, charge 15.5 percent.
Mr. Farrell and Mr. Farley expect the bills to pass today's vote, despite the opposition of the Consumer Protection Board. Senator Franz S. Leichter, Democrat of Manhattan, said he planned to offer an amendment that would forbid any bank, whether based in New York or elsewhere, from charging late-payment fees to New York consumers. A similar law in Massachusetts is now being challenged in court by the Greenwood Trust Company, a Delaware bank that handles Sears, Roebuck & Company's Discover card.
 
Consumer Board's Criticism
 In a memorandum sent to legislators on Jan. 24, the New York State Consumer Protection Board called the late-payment charges, about $10 at most banks, a "nuisance fee" that consumers did not notice when doing comparison shopping for credit cards.
The board also objected to provisions of the bill intended to help New York banks offer credit cards with variable interest rates. For variable-rate cards, the bill would eliminate the requirement of 30 days' notice for interest rate changes and would rescind consumers' rights to cancel their credit card and pay off their debt at the old interest rate.
The consumer board said that offering customers a chance to cancel their card at the old interest rate would not prohibit banks from charging higher rates to other customers.
 
Removing Rate Caps
 The bill would also eliminate an existing requirement for New York banks that the maximum and minimum interest rate on cards be equidistant from the initial interest rate charged the consumer.
The consumer board said this requirement should be continued because it discouraged lenders from setting very high maximum interest rates. To get a high maximum rate, the lender must also allow for the possibility of a low minimum rate.
Ms. Walsh of Chemical Bank said it would be cumbersome to keep track of all the maximum and minimum rates for consumers because the initial rates would vary, depending on when their accounts were opened.

HEADLINE: While Fear of Big War Fades, Military Plans for Little Ones

SERIES: After the Cold War -- Second of six articles.

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT KNOX, Ky.

 BODY:
On a bleak, cold hillside one January afternoon, a class of future Army tank commanders huddled on a set of bleachers as Col. John Sylvester, one of the heroes of the Persian Gulf war, explained why the breakup of the Soviet Union would have no effect on their careers.
A towering Daniel Boone figure with muddy boots and a booming voice, Colonel Sylvester led the Tiger Brigade of the Second Armored Division of M1-A1 tanks against Kuwait International Airport a year ago. Now, as warrior-teacher, he was telling these young captains and lieutenants that even with the cold war's end they might still find themselves in a war someday. 
 And in war, Colonel Sylvester told them, the enemy will always try to put obstacles on the battlefield "to make you vulnerable so he can kill you." Simple as that.
But what the Colonel didn't say was who that enemy might be. The fact was, he didn't know.
With the cold war ended, the future is sweeping over the United States military. Nowhere is frustration as intense as here at the Army's tank school, where virtually every tank driver since World War II has trained with a Soviet enemy in mind.
 
An Old Fear, Now Gone
 That vision of an enemy that could point 90 or more divisions at Western Europe and still wage global war with the United States was implanted in multiple generations of Americans in uniform. But now it has evaporated, leaving the United States military without the old certainties about its role in the world, its deployment overseas, its need for futuristic weapons and battlefield scenarios.
At no time since the end of World War II has America's two-million-member military establishment faced as much fundamental change and uncertainty as in 1992, the first full year that will unfold without a unified Soviet military and the industrial complex that supported it.
Significant military threats to American security are greatly diminished, but they have not disappeared altogether: Saddam Hussein reminded the world that sizable military challenges might arise in the undefinable era ahead, but these potential adversaries are vaporous shapes.
"This transition period is potentially dangerous," argued Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Foley, who commands the armor school at Fort Knox. "I don't want to say there is a bogey man behind every tree, but you have to admit when the American people say, 'Our interests are being threatened, let's do something about it,' we have got to be ready to go, on a much reduced scale maybe, but ready to go."
 
A Game With Only One Team
 For other officers, the loss of certainty is more distressing.
Col. Dennis H. Long is the director of "total armor force readiness" at Fort Knox. His job is to look 15 to 20 years into the future and recommend to the Army what kind of tanks and other armored vehicles the service should design.
"For 50 years, we equipped our football team, practiced five days a week and never played a game," he said. "We had a clear enemy with demonstrable qualities, and we had scouted them out."
Now, he continued, "We will have to practice day in and day out without knowing anything about the other team. We won't have his playbook, we won't know where the stadium is, or how many guys he will have on the field. That is very distressing to the military establishment, especially when you are trying to justify the existence of your organization and your systems."
 
The Questions
How to Learn From Small Wars
 The final collapse of the Soviet empire has caused millions of Americans and many of their representatives in Congress to call for dramatic reductions in the American military. And it has led the Bush Administration to retreat, though in small steps, from the large military budgets that characterized the Korean War era, the Vietnam War era, the late Carter Administration, the Reagan era and even the first days of the Bush Administrastion.
"For all of my lifetime," said Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, "the driving force for everything has been the Soviet threat." Now that it has gone away, he continued in an interview, "we are cut loose from a lot of our certainties, and we must ask ourselves first-principles questions which haven't been asked in 40 to 50 years."
What are those questions?
Former Defense Secretary Harold Brown said the first question Americans must answer is what kind of military power they want the nation to be.
"Is it really America's job to fight in North and South Korea?" he asked. "Apparently it is America's job to fight in the Persian Gulf. What about southern Africa and Latin America?"
"My own guess is that the American public wouldn't see the same motivation" in those regions that it did during the cold war, Mr. Brown said, when global military competition with the Soviet Union led to American intervention in Europe, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Asia.
"The end of the cold war should mean the end of the cold-war method of judging defense requirements," former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger wrote recently in Foreign Policy.
In an interview, Mr. Schlesinger said American society must recast its definition of power to include such elements as economic competitiveness, productivity and investment in industry. These other priorities, he suggests, will move to more commanding positions as the need for massive military strength disappears.
 
Loaded Words in the Budget
 This transition holds practical problems, however, and most of them are in Washington, where the annual budget cycle requires the Pentagon and the Congress to define "threats" to national security and then to state the "requirements" for weapons and forces needed to meet them. From this process emerges an annual Pentagon budget and five-year spending plan to "acquire" the forces and weapons needed.
But without a big threat, there is little agreement on how to proceed.
Representative Aspin recently suggested that the Persian Gulf war should be the model for future wars. The Iraq experience would be transplanted around the globe to measure the relative strength of other troublesome regional powers as a means to plan forces to defeat them. Mr. Aspin has dubbed this method "Iraq equivalents."
In August 1990, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, defined a strategy that would shrink worldwide American forces by 25 percent from cold-war levels while increasing spending for a new generation of high-technology weapons to outfit the American military of the future.
 
Military's New Tasks
 This transitional strategy foresaw the threat of regional wars in the Persian Gulf or Korea. It focused on the spreading ballistic missile threat, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, drug trafficking and the possible re-emergence of a Soviet threat in Europe.
The collapse of the Soviet Union quickly undermined this strategy and highlighted the fact that Mr. Cheney and General Powell were building so many new weapons that future defense budgets, after a period of shrinkage, would actually begin growing again by tens of billions of dollars a year later in the decade.
But Mr. Cheney and General Powell have now retrenched further.
Oppressed by the new reality that it must justify itself in a relative vacuum of "threats," the military's leaders are clinging to the truisms of military philosophy, admonishing political leaders in the way Machiavelli might have instructed his prince or Clauswitz his king.
The advice is simple and blunt: any nation that disarms invites attack; wars, when they come, are seldom the wars expected; being as good as a potential adversary is not enough; winning means not only exceeding the strengths of the opponent, but dominating him so completely that the conflict is ended early with favorable results and minimal casualties.
 
The Background
A Strategy Built On Years of Fear
 On Aug. 25, 1989, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., General Powell's predecessor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, distributed his last "national military strategy," a classified guide to waging global conflict with the Soviet Union. He did not know that in just 76 days the Berlin wall would fall, bringing the end of the cold war clearly into view.
"Should deterrence fail and war come," he wrote to Secretary Cheney, "the United States must be prepared for an extended conflict involving the survival of the nation." The document, which was sent to top military commanders, spoke of "total mobilization at home" to build the nation's wartime combat power.
"United States forces will seek out and destroy Soviet naval forces, project power ashore and be prepared to conduct attacks against the Soviet homeland," Admiral Crowe wrote. Should the war go nuclear, the document says, "our forces will hold at risk those assets that the Soviet leadership would need to prevail in a nuclear conflict and to dominate a postnuclear world."
It was a military catechism that epitomized an era -- an era in which NATO developed strategies to offset the numerical superiority of the Warsaw Pact; an era in which the United States Navy focused on resupplying Europe in wartime, on dominating the oceans and on building a maritime strategy using aircraft carriers and marines to strike on the Soviet flanks.
 
Harking Back to Their Coming of Age
 For most senior general officers in the American military today, coming to adulthood coincided with the onset of prospective East-West conflict.
General Foley, now the commander at Ft. Knox, recalled that when he arrived in West Germany in 1961 as a young second lieutenant and watched the Berlin wall going up, "I think all of us took very seriously the fact that we could go to war at any time.
"There was a fear," he said, a recognition that those officers who had brought their families to Europe might not get the opportunity to warn them in the event that war broke out with nuclear weapons.
When his wife, Sandy, and two young children arrived by transport ship in Bremerhaven and traveled by train to Bavaria in June 1962, the Foleys had been separated for a year by the Berlin crisis. Their family reunion lasted only three days before Lieutenant Foley had to be back with his unit in a high state of readiness for war.
When there was spare time, the Foleys reconnoitered the escape routes through Germany that Mrs. Foley and the children would use if war broke out.
"That's how serious it was taken," he said.
This seminal cold war experience shaped General Foley's lifetime view, leaving him with the opinion today that the United States should strive to remain a potent military power to deter threats, even if the threats were not readily apparent.
 
The Analysis
Threat Is Diverse Rather Than Deep
 For the military, and the nervous Foleys, the cold war was a time of great building and transition. The first bomber designed to carry nuclear weapons, the B-52 Stratofortress, went on 24-hour alert in 1957. The Air Force's Strategic Air Command became the first among equals of all military commands; its mission was to annihilate Soviet targets with nuclear fire.
In June 1962, the same month that Mrs. Foley followed her husband to Europe, Roy Alcala graduated from West Point and reported to tank school at Fort Knox.
The commencement speaker for Lieutenant Alcala's graduating class at West Point had been President John F. Kennedy, who admonished the cadets that the global competition between the Soviet Union and United States might send them into the third world as cold warriors against the spread of Marxist revolutions.
"I know that many of you feel, and many of our citizens may feel, that in these days of the nuclear age, when war may last in its final form a day or two or three days before much of the world is burned up, that your service to your country will be only standing and waiting," Mr. Kennedy said.
"Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth."
Five Soviet leaders and several wars later, Mikhail S. Gorbachev began the process of turning the world on its end. And after two tours in Vietnam and three years of graduate school at Yale University, Colonel Alcala and many of his contemporaries saw the decline of the Soviet Union long before the Pentagon officially acknowledged it.
"We began to see it in 1986 and the spring of 1987," he said. By this time, Colonel Alcala was running a small research group for Gen. Carl E. Vuono, the Army Chief of Staff.
Sensing the future, General Vuono mobilized his staff to formulate what he called a "successor strategy" that would allow the Army to shrink in size, while maintaining its lethalness and mobility for any crisis.
 
Change in Risk Ratio
 "Changing from the containment of the Soviet Union," Colonel Alcala said, meant that "we were preparing our forces so they could act in areas other than mainland Europe while not knowing precisely what kind of threat they would face."
"Our conclusion was that while the risk to national existence was way down, the probability of having to engage was way up.
"It took the exercise against Iraq to shed much of the old language and to demonstrate what we had done," Colonel Alcala said.
General Vuono and Colonel Alcala also understood that the service would have to shrink substantially because no set of hypothetical threats could ever measure up to the demands the Soviet military had put on American military preparedness.
 
The Outlook
The Dead Past Shapes the Future
 Veterans of the Pentagon's planning process say the military has spent most of its time for the last two years justifying a slimmed-down version of the cold-war military structure, rather than trying to design a force for the 21st century.
The notion of throwing out a decades-old system is a powerful bureaucratic threat. It rankles veterans.
"It can't be a clean sheet of paper," said Mr. Brown, the former Defense Secretary. "You have an immense capital investment, and you can't throw it away."
Planning for the future need not waste the investments of the past, some experts say. Without a clear and identifiable military threat, why not design a smaller, highly mobile and lethal military that could respond to a crisis anywhere in the world, seize territory, control the air over the battlefield and provide support from the sea, but at half the cost of the military that existed when the Berlin wall fell?
New ideas about so-called all-purpose forces are being offered. Some argue that the military has only begun to explore the possibilities offered by cost-effective combinations of computers, radars and high-technology munitions that can bring more firepower to bear on targets than at any time in history.
Mr. Aspin, head of the House Armed Services Committee, has advocated new procurement strategies to slow the development of new weapons: "rolling over" research and "skipping generations" of weapons instead of rushing into production with every new model.
It appears that the Pentagon is moving in that direction.
 
The Doubts
Inertia Hobbles A Vast Military
 Just retired from the Army that he joined in the era of Dr. Strangelove, Colonel Alcala is proud of the imprint his generation left on his service. But he has also begun to believe that the United States can remain the strongest global military power while also shedding much of the "dishonesty, pork and near-term economic gain" that impels the Pentagon's budget.
He says he would be willing to scrap the Army's tank factories and deactivate divisions that have lost their purpose. He would experiment with so-called cadre divisions that would maintain a skeletal core and fill out with reservists in a crisis.
"The right answer is probably unachievable," he said, "because it requires traumatic change and the amputation of useless limbs if we do it right. You have to cut the money, change the strategy and make the force fit the strategy. And you'll never get that on Capitol Hill."
Next: Sweeping changes proposed for the nation's intelligence agencies.

Chart: "New Weapons for an Old War"
Some weapon systems designed for cold war applications.
 
Weapon: B-2 Stealth Bomber
 Original Mission: To penetrate Soviet airspace undetected carrying nuclear weapons during wartime Development by Northrop began in 1978; first flight was in July 1989.
 Status: The Pentagon wanted 75 planes at a cost of $65 billion, but President Bush's budget proposal for fiscal 1993 calls for halting production at 20 planes. The program has already cost $34 billion.
 
Weapon: F-22 Advanced Tactical Stealth Fighter
 Original Mission: To replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Falcon fighters and maintain air supremacy over any improved Soviet fighters. The search for this new generation or aircraft that could at supersonic speeds without detection began in 1981; Lockheed won the design competition in April 1991.
 Status: Full-scale production to begin this year at an expected cost of $95 billion for 650 planes. In the fiscal 1993 budget, the Pentagon is requesting $2.2 billion for the program.
 
Weapon: SSN-21 Seawolf -- named for the first submarine in this class
 Original Mission: To succeed the Los Angeles-class submarine with the mission of preventing the Soviet Navy from seizing the oceans during wartime. The first boat, ordered in January 1989, is under construction.
 Status: The Navy wanted 30 boats for a total cost of $65 billion. President Bush's fiscal 1993 budget proposal calls for ending the program after only one submarine is built.
 
Weapon: M1 Tank
 Original Mission: To counter heavy armored Soviet tank divisions in Europe.
 Status: Congress instructed the Pentagon to proceed with the M1-A2, an upgrade of the M1-A1, even though the Defense Department says it already has more tanks than it needs. Current proposals call for $315 million next year.
 
Weapon: Aircraft carrier battle groups
 Original Mission: To maintain "deep attach" capabilitites against the Soviet Union, and to provide forward air attack abilities around the world.

HEADLINE: Plan Expected To Widen Sale Of City Bonds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
When security guards assigned to the New York City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, asked her last year how they could buy the city's bonds, it served as a reminder that the banks and Wall Street firms that sell the bonds were not reaching multitudes of small investors. Today, after years of talk, the city is expected to announce a new program to sell tax-exempt bonds at prices as low as $1,200 for a $5,000 bond due in 20 years, far less than the $25,000 minimum purchase at most securities firms.
About $50 million of the city's $750 million bond sale in early March will be earmarked for small investors and sold through a special group of firms that have agreed not to charge fees to those buyers. 
 "We are giving smaller investors the same opportunity that rich investors have had to take advantage of high yields on tax-free municipal bonds," Ms. Holtzman said in an interview on Friday. "There is a tremendous pool of money in New York among city pensioners and others who live and work here and who have a lot of confidence in the city."
At a time when many investors are suffering sticker shock at interest rates of less than 5 percent posted on bank windows, the city hopes for a good response to its bonds, which are expected to yield more than 6 percent.
 
Ads in Subway System
 To reach potential investors, monthly pension checks mailed on Thursday to more than 240,000 retired city workers included notices of the new bond program. By 11 A.M. on Friday, more than 150 calls had been received through a special telephone number (1-800-874-3645) for those wanting more information.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has donated space for advertisements in the subway system, and half a million brochures have been printed for distribution to city employees and at elementary and junior high schools, for teachers and administrators and for children to take home to their parents.
 
Prospective Buyers
 The advance publicity is intended to help a group of eight securities dealers, led by Prudential Securities, to gather prospective buyers before the March bond sale. At that sale, the eight firms have promised to fill the smallest orders before they sell to wealthier investors, whose larger orders are more profitable to handle. The firms will not charge account fees or handling charges to customers who buy only the New York City bonds, but customers who do not want to open brokerage accounts may keep accounts at the Chase Manhattan Bank, which would act as custodian and whose $2 annual fee per account would be paid by the city.
Although it wants to reach smaller investors, the city chose not to make the bonds available in amounts as low as $250, as some other cities have done and as was suggested last year by James Lebenthal, chairman of Lebenthal & Company, one of the securities firms handling the new bonds. Mr. Lebenthal's plan, which was not accepted, was similar to the United States Series E Savings Bond program, in which investors can choose when to cash in their investment.
By requiring investors to have more than $1,000 of ready money and by selling the bonds through securities dealers that are supposed to ascertain that the bonds will be a suitable investment for individual customers, the city hopes to avoid drawing money from people who should avoid investing in bonds before accumulating a financial cushion in savings.
 
'Zero Coupon' Bonds
 The new bonds allow investors to avoid the fees and charges of bond mutual funds. These funds, which offer investors a diversified mix of bonds, can often be bought in minimum amounts of $1,000 or less.
The initial purchase price of the city bonds is far below the $5,000 value at maturity because these are "zero coupon" bonds, meaning that they do not pay interest every six months, like traditional city bonds.
Because prices of zero-coupon bonds can fluctuate widely before maturity, financial advisers recommend them primarily to investors who will not need to sell early and want to build a nest egg for an anticipated expense, like buying a home or paying for a child's education.
With zero-coupon bonds, the interest for investors is the difference between the purchase price and the $5,000 that the city promises to pay when the bonds reach maturity.
If a bond is sold before it matures, the amount received will be less than $5,000, with the amount of the discount depending on the length of time before the bond matures, the level of interest rates and investors' confidence in the city's ability to pay the bonds. For the first issue of the bonds, the city does not plan to buy insurance, which would protect investors in the event of a default.
The city's bond rating slipped last year and both major credit rating agencies have warned that the trend in the city's financial condition is negative. But although the city's well-publicized financial problems and heavy borrowing needs force it to pay much higher interest rates than most local governments, the possibility of a default is considered remote.
 
Long-Term Savers
 Darcy Bradbury, the city's deputy comptroller for finance, said the bonds were intended "for people who are long-term savers." The city will issue special notices, she said, warning potential buyers that if they sell the bonds before maturity, there is a risk of loss.
The city plans to raise about $50 million in March from the sale to small investors of securities with maturities of from 5 to 20 years.
Although the $100 million a year the city hopes to raise from small investors is small compared with the more than $3 billion of bonds it sells annually, it does help keep interest rates down by reducing the amount of bonds the city must sell to the mutual funds, wealthy people and insurance companies that have been buying 75 percent of recent city bond issues.

HEADLINE: Governments to Begin Talks On Uses of Radio Spectrum

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Representatives from about 160 governments begin a monthlong meeting in Spain Monday in an attempt to reach an international agreement on how to make room for new technologies on the crowded radio spectrum.
At stake are radio frequencies for a broad family of new mobile communication services for individual consumers, from low-cost wireless telephones that can be used anywhere on the globe to laptop computers that can send and receive data using satellites. Also at stake is "digital" radio broadcasting from satellites that promises sound as crisp and clean as that from a compact disk. 
 Advances in technology over the last four years have made many such services economically feasible, and companies around the world are clamoring for a chance to offer them. Because virtually all of the radio frequencies that can be easily used are already assigned for other purposes, governments are under pressure to decide which older services should be displaced to make room for the new.
 
Ambitious List of Proposals
 As representatives from around the world assemble for the 1992 World Administrative Radio Conference in Torremolinos, Spain, they will take up an ambitious list of proposals. The conference is held approximately every four years by the International Telecommunications Union, a Geneva-based organization that establishes the rules for international radio frequencies.
Individual countries are free to write their own rules for uses of the radio spectrum within their borders. But many signals are hard to contain within national boundaries, and for commercial purposes, common standards also make it easier to cut costs through economies of scale.
Delegates from the United States, Europe and Japan say the agenda this year has made the stakes unusually high. "In the past, we'd go to these conferences hoping we wouldn't get raped and pillaged," said Jan W. Baran, the United States Ambassador to the conference. "This time, we're going into it with a whole list of futuristic proposals."
 
Agreement Far From Certain
 It is far from certain that the negotiators will reach a broad agreement. Underlying this year's conference is a basic conflict between the United States on one hand and Europe and Japan on the other about the best way to establish personal communication networks.
With its vast land mass and many sparsely populated areas, the United States wants to set aside frequencies for fleets of low-orbit satellites that can broadcast wireless telephone and data communications to large areas, an aspect especially valuable for rural outposts too remote for land-based networks. The American stance has been set in large part because Motorola Inc. and several other American companies have already proposed launching fleets of small satellites that would orbit several hundred miles above the earth.
Leaders in Europe and Japan are betting more heavily on land-based radio networks for what would resemble the next generation of cellular telephones. These systems would link pocket telephones, laptop computers and other devices through antennas scattered through urban areas.
 
Japanese Government's Position
 "To be honest, the Japanese Government is not all that interested in low-earth-orbit satellites," said Yasuo Suzuki, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in Washington for the Telecommunications Ministry. "The main purpose of low-earth satellites is for rural areas, and Japan doesn't have many."
European and Japanese officials contend that, without common global standards, the new generation of low-cost pocket telephones will not be usable in different countries and will probably cost more to make.
"I would admit that the number of customers who want to take phones from Europe to the United States is relatively small," said John Carrington, director of mobile and new business at Cable and Wireless P.L.C. in London. "But the larger the number of addressable customers that can be provided with equipment to a common standard, the lower the cost of that equipment will be."
American officials respond that the United States already has plans to allocate domestic frequencies for cordless telephone technologies and finds no compelling need for a common global standard because manufacturers can easily modify their equipment for different markets.
A satellite system would function as well in urban as in rural areas and would thus allow for economies of scale if the Europeans and Japanese agreed to it. But if the satellites cannot be used worldwide they would not be as economically viable.
Another top issue will be setting aside frequencies for "digital audio broadcasting," a technology for broadcasting radio in the ones and zeroes of computer code that proponents say will offer a striking improvement over current FM technology. In the United States, many existing broadcasters fear that digital radio threatens their very survival.
In a blow to the broadcasters, the Bush Administration decided several months ago that it would propose reserving frequencies for digital radio in a part of the spectrum that is useful only for satellite services. Broadcasters had hoped the Government would press for frequencies in a lower frequency range easier for them to use.
The Europeans and the Japanese share an interest in digital radio programming but have proposed frequencies different from those proposed by the United States. The United States proposal is for frequencies the Europeans and the Japanese want to use for land-based telecommunications.
The role of developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America is also a matter of debate. In many such nations, the biggest issues are the preservation of frequencies for old-fashioned short-wave radio. But because any new rules require unanimous consent, some countries could emerge as political allies of one side or another in the debate.
"I don't want to minimize the problems, because there are a lot of differences, but there is a lot of good will," Mr. Carrington of Cable and Wireless said.

HEADLINE: Economists Cite Benefits Of Arms Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The military spending cuts that President Bush proposed last week would certainly hurt workers who make submarines in Connecticut and fighter aircraft in California. But, economists say, if the $50 billion is used instead to increase growth by, say, increasing investment, the short-term pain would be outweighed by the long-term gain.
Lawrence R. Klein, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania and recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, says this new "peace dividend" can, if not frittered away, raise economic output in the long term in two ways. One would be to move resources into the civilian sector, making it more competitive. Another would be to reduce the Federal budget deficit, which would help push down interest rates and spur investment in the private sector. 
 Professor Klein said his studies of Pentagon spending cuts after the Vietnam War showed that if a cutback eliminated 100,000 jobs in the short run, the redirection of the money saved would ultimately create more than 100,000 permanent jobs to replace them.
Substituting civilian spending for military spending would expand the nation's production potential, Professor Klein said, because "a weapon doesn't produce goods for the next 20 years, but a new building or piece of equipment produces output for the length of its life."
 
Deeper Cuts Sought
 Many Democrats in Congress are eager to cut even more deeply into the military budget than the $50 billion over five years proposed by the President. That push, combined with the more than $100 billion in cuts already in the pipeline, has led many economists to fear a drastic drain from the Government's pool of research and development money. They were heartened that the Administration would increase spending for civilian research and development by 7 percent. Supercomputers would get $803 million, a 23 percent increase.
"If we can turn our research capacities and scientific talent to something other than weapons, then what's the big problem about defense cuts?" said Herbert Stein, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who was a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.
Certainly, there will be a big problem for the workers at the General Dynamics Electric Boat division in Groton, Conn., who were shocked to learn that the Pentagon would like to reduce its orders for the Seawolf submarine to one, down from three, if Congress, in election years particularly sensitive to job losses, permits it to. Similarly, workers at the Hughes Aircraft Company in Southern California were unhappy to learn that the Pentagon proposed ordering 20 B-2 bombers instead of 75. No one is sure how many layoffs will result from the newest round of cuts in the Pentagon budgets, but many economists say it will reach the tens of thousands.
"In terms of macroeconomics, it is not the national level but the local level we have to worry about regarding these cuts," said John Tepper Marlin, director of the conversion information center at the Council of Economic Priorities, a public policy institute in New York.
 
Retraining Is Needed
 The trauma can be reduced if local and state governments aggressively plan to help such workers adapt to a nonmilitary future, economic development officials say. Economists point to success stories like St. Louis, where St. Louis Community College worked with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation to retrain and find jobs for laid-off workers.
David Wyss, research director at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., an economics consulting group, said his research team had done studies showing that if military spending cuts were used to reduce the ballooning budget deficit, "in the long term it helps you because it will allow interest rates to drop, investment to recover and more stimulus long term."
Mr. Wyss said every dollar spent on military production generated $2.30 extra in gross national product from auxiliary industries, but public investment, like building roads or bridges, would generate a larger kick: an extra $2.50 in gross national product.
The multiplier effect was greater for public investment because in pothole-filling or bridge-building, Mr. Wyss said, little money goes overseas to buy raw materials or components. Other economist noted that such spending would also help increase productivity by reducing transportation delays and costs.
For some economists, the Pentagon's heavy research and development spending was good for the overall economy because it helped develop important technologies, like semiconductors and light aircraft frames, that were spun off to help civilian industry. These economists worried that reducing the Pentagon's budget would hurt the nation's research and development efforts.
In its proposed budget, the Administration took pains to say it was increasing outlays for the nonmilitary research budget even as it cut military spending.
Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, a public policy institute in Washington, said the proposed military spending cuts would be far smaller proportionally than those after World War II and the Vietnam War. After Vietnam, military spending was cut from slightly under 10 percent of G.N.P. to just under 5 percent. President Bush's proposals would reduce military spending by 1.8 percent of G.N.P., to 3.4 percent from 5.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Easing of Trade Barriers Is Urged

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Germany and the United States today called for drastic steps to insure a liberalization of world trade as the best means to guarantee growth and encourage market economies in the former Soviet Union.
At an annual gathering here of political and business leaders, known as the World Economic Forum, Economics Minister Jurgen Mollemann of Germany said a summit conference of the Group of Seven industrialized nations should be called next month or in April if the five-year-old world trade talks remain deadlocked. 
 Those talks, conducted under the auspices of the 105-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have stalled over the demand by the United States, Canada and other food-exporting nations for lower farm subsidies, which they contend curtail their exports.
Without an accord from the GATT talks, Mr. Mollemann said, the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe will suffer enormously because important Western markets will be inaccessible to them.
"We can't leave it to negotiators of the second rank," Mr. Mollemann said. "It's too important."
 
Mandela Speaks
 Later in the session, Nelson Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress, said South Africa under black majority rule would need a market economy to pull millions of blacks out of poverty, the Reuters news agency reported.
Mr. Mandela urged business executives to invest in South Africa but repeated his demand that economic sanctions not be lifted until an interim, broad-based government is brought in, ending apartheid, Reuters said. He also stressed that wealth and income must be redistributed.
President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa also urged the executives to invest in South Africa as it moved out of international isolation to a democratic future, Reuters said.
Mr. Mandela said the African National Congress was still discussing with business leaders whether a future government would nationalize some industries, according to Reuters.
The general feeling here was that there was little money available to stimulate the world economy or provide aid to Eastern Europe and that increased global trade is the best means to economic growth.
Summing up the feeling at the meeting of more than 2,000 officials, Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said: "Keeping markets open does not cost money, it just needs political energy. And nobody feels they have much money to spare." He predicted a sluggish growth of "not more than 2 to 3 percent" in Western economies next year.
The impasse in the GATT talks, while centered on agriculture, affects every aspect of the world's $4.3 trillion in annual trade. The European Community, led by France, is resisting calls for sharp cuts in farm subsidies, and Japan is reluctant to abandon its curbs on rice imports.
At the same time, Germany made it clear that while it was prepared to make great efforts to resolve the GATT impasse, it was not ready to spur economic growth by lowering its interest rates, which are at their highest levels in many years.
Concerned about inflation that is just above 4 percent, Germany raised its rates by a half-point in December. That angered some countries that saw the move as an unnecessary dampener on attempts to revive the world economy. High interest rates make borrowing money more expensive and tend to slow economic activity.
 
Criticism From Lithuania
 But Hans Tietenmeyer, deputy governor of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, said that controlling inflation remained a priority for Germany and that international economic coordination did not mean all the countries could follow the same policies. American interest rates have dropped steadily in the last year.
The German stand reflects a general mood among Western powers that domestic problems will not allow significant short-term initiatives to spur growth.
"The sense is that because of budgetary constraints, there's not much to be done in the short term beyond trying to keep markets open," said Mr. Volcker, who led the session on encouraging international growth. "There's some feeling of exhaustion in the West as the needs of so many countries are contemplated." He said the success of the GATT talks was vital, adding "the stakes are so big the odds must be good -- but by no means certain."
Vytautas Landsbergis, President of Lithuania, criticized the United States for not being forthcoming with aid. "Denmark has given the Baltic states $52 million, which is more than the United States," he said. "Is that not a little strange?"
He said his country needed $200 million as a stabilization fund for its planned currency, noting that this was a lot less than the roughly $6 billion sought by Russia. But Lithuania is getting little assistance, he said.
Andrei Fedorov, a prominent Russian economist, said chaos threatened the Commonwealth of Independent States if the West did not quickly provide substantial aid. "We should perhaps be thinking already of the second Commonwealth because this one is not working," he said. "I believe the Ukraine will soon defect."
Faced with such appeals, Wayne D. Angell, a Federal Reserve governor, said there was no point in providing stabilization funds before currencies actually operated as units of account. In Russia, the ruble has lost virtually all its value and been replaced by barter.
"Until Russia and other republics have a unit of value there is no point talking about a stabilization fund," he told a news conference.

HEADLINE: Battling Poverty's Ills Each Day, They Also Give to Neediest

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Donors to the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund supply the ammunition needed by seven charities to battle poverty and illness. But the nurses, teachers and social workers fighting that war have also sent donations, along with dispatches from the front lines describing the increasing needs of New York's poor, sick and disabled.
"In 17 years of working in public-funded employment and training projects, I have never witnessed such a severe need for basic social support, not to mention economic assistance," wrote Beverly O'Donnell of Brooklyn, who gave $50. 
 The staff at the Mount St. Ursula Speech Center for Communication and Learning in the Bronx wrote that they "work with children from poor homes -- in many cases, foster homes -- who come to us as an oasis." The note attached to their $25 contribution continued: "We know how important a helping hand can be in desperate circumstances, in these desperate times. We would like the money used wherever it's needed and hope it provides some measure of support to those who are struggling."
 
'We Feel Grateful'
 Although they spend their days helping others, these workers have turned to the Neediest Cases to cast a wider net of assistance. "I see people suffer every day but until I volunteered at the Manhattan State Psychiatric Center I had never seen first-hand the consequences of drug and family abuse," wrote Nancy M. Brozain, a nursing supervisor who works with cancer patients, who gave $200. "The neediest of this city deserve a chance and should know that people care."
Like many other contributors, they have given in thanks for their own good fortune and health. "For all the suffering and tragedy that we see at work and around us," began a letter from the night nursing supervisors, clinical instructors and secretaries at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, who gave $100, "we feel grateful for our health, our jobs and to God, who helps us through each night."
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled. So far more than $4.6 million has been raised from almost 15,000 donations during the 80th annual appeal, which continues through Feb. 29.
The Times covers all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected can be passed on directly to seven charities. The money finances programs for people with AIDS, provides financial assistance for poor people who cannot afford necessary operations and supports neighborhood centers that provide children with places where they can study and play after school.
Some who work with the poor and the ill contributed to help those who never make it to their offices for help. "Everyday at least one panhandler approaches me on the subway or street asking for money," wrote Emil Chynn, a resident at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital who gave $24. "But one can never be sure such money will go to food rather than drink. My 'solution' has been to volunteer at the homeless shelter on West 168th Street and to donate to your fund each year. That way I know my efforts will go to the right things, the necessities of life to provide hope for these poor people in the cold without any money."

HEADLINE: Parts Pact With Japan May Backfire

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Since agreeing that Japanese auto makers would sharply increase their purchases of American auto parts, diplomats on both sides of the Pacific have only heightened the confusion over precisely what obligations the auto makers have undertaken. But automotive executives, economists and other experts are certain of this: Unless American suppliers swiftly adjust to the vastly different priorities set by Japanese car companies, President Bush has shaken hands on an agreement that may hasten the decline of the American parts industry.
"The agreement is going to backfire on the Big Three and the parts manufacturers in a big and dramatic way," predicted Robert B. Reich, the Harvard economist. He compared the latest measure with Japan's voluntary agreement in 1981 to limit the number of cars it shipped to the United States for a few years. 
 The goal then was to restrain sales of Japanese vehicles and give Detroit time to produce cars that were more competitive. Instead, it led to the establishment of Japanese assembly plants in the United States that only increased sales of Japanese cars.
"The fastest way to reduce the trade surplus will be to transfer suppliers here," Mr. Reich said. "Japanese auto makers have been working to develop American companies as suppliers, but with the additional pressure of time to comply with the agreement, that's going to take too long."
Earlier this month, Japanese auto makers told American negotiators they would nearly double their purchases of American-made parts, to $19 billion by 1994, up from about $10 billion in 1990.
The Japanese also pledged to raise the content of American parts for all Japanese models assembled in North America to 70 percent, from 50 percent currently. About 25 percent of the $41 billion American trade deficit with Japan stems from the huge volume of parts imported to the United States.
Less than two weeks after the trip, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan touched off a diplomatic storm by stating that the dollar figures were only "goals."
That statement prompted an angry "I told you so" from Lee A. Iacocca, chairman and chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation, who harbors chronic suspicions of Japan's intentions.
Yutaka Kume, president of the Nissan Motor Company, criticized American executives for "anti-Japanese emotions." By the end of last week, Mr. Miyazawa tried to patch things up by saying in New York, "We will deliver all we promised you."
Beyond the posturing, however, remains the reality that politicians in both countries lack the authority to enforce what parts will be purchased from whom. Executives of American suppliers are left to wonder how the agreement will play out.
"The Japanese commitment was a step in the right direction," said Jack Reilly, chairman of Tenneco Automotive, the Tenneco Inc. subsidiary that makes mufflers and shock absorbers. But it "falls short of what is needed to insure a healthy U.S. automotive supply base."
 
Unclear Aspect of Agreement
 Executives of American parts suppliers who accompanied President Bush on his trip to Japan say Japanese auto makers promised "special consideration" with regard to America's 4,000 makers of auto parts. But it is not clear just how much new revenue will flow to the American parts makers, whose sales are about $100 billion annually; to the nearly 300 Japanese suppliers now operating in the United States, or to joint parts-making ventures of American and Japanese companies.
In any case, some of the revenue will supplant the value of parts imported from Japan and take a slice -- albeit a tiny one -- from the trade deficit.
The Honda Motor Company, for instance, said its goal was to buy $4.38 billion a year in American-made parts by 1995 for its assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio, up from $2.5 billion bought in America last year. It also said that in the same time span, it would aim to double, to $560 million a year, its imports of American parts for its operations in Japan. Thus, the impact on the trade deficit would be slight.
"The agreement was nothing substantive," said Candace Howes, who teaches economics at the University of Notre Dame. "Japanese suppliers will get most of it, and it reflects decisions that were made three or four years ago to increase production of Japanese cars in American plants." Ms. Howes has contended that suppliers to Japan's auto assembly plants in the United States are wiping out the jobs of two Americans for every job they provide, based on the rising market share of Japanese cars, compared with American makes.
Heinz Prechter, president of the ASC Corporation of Southfield, Mich., which makes sunroofs and convertible tops for several auto makers, agreed that Japanese auto makers prefer Japanese suppliers "because they would rather deal with a known quantity than an unknown quantity." But he said the President's agreement "is very positive because it will encourage U.S. suppliers to become more active in Japan."
He added, "The Japanese business leaders are very smart." Because they understand the potential for a backlash against Japanese products by Americans, he continued, "they will do whatever has to be done to make the agreement work."
 
Enormous Misunderstanding
 Still, the uncertainty over how the agreement will play out speaks to the enormous cross-cultural misunderstanding that has grown up between the automotive industries of the two countries. The American side wants more business, but the Americans say they have been burned in the past when Japanese promises did not turn out as hoped.
The Japanese feel stung, too; they do not wish to be blamed for political tension between the countries, but they also resent having to alter their practices to accommodate less successful competitors. Privately, managers of Japanese auto makers are worried that they may be pressured to accept parts of less than top quality in the name of trade harmony, a notion scoffed at by the American parts makers.
But it is not easy for American suppliers to get purchase orders from Japanese auto makers. "I visited Toyota for 10 years before I got my first order," Mr. Prechter said. The Japanese value a long-term relationship between the car maker and the parts maker, based on mutual trust and disclosure of one another's plans. By contrast, he continued, Detroit cares mostly about which supplier can make the right part for the least amount of money.
 
A Relationship With Toyota
 Fred Hay, president of the automotive group of the United Technologies Corporation, which makes interior trim like instrument panels, described the company's relationship with the Toyota Motor Corporation, which began in 1984, as "tough, demanding and time-consuming." Toyota demanded top quality, buried United Technologies with technical requirements and demanded proprietary information about the company's costs.
Frequent, intensive meetings were held with Toyota engineers in Japan and Ann Arbor, Mich., where Toyota has a technical center. But the reward was a contract to supply the center consoles for the 1992 Toyota Camry, which is built in Georgetown, Ky. "Making that early commitment to Toyota's stringent requirements was difficult at first," Mr. Hay said. "I'm glad we had the foresight to stick with it."
A typical vehicle is assembled from more than 10,000 parts. Traditionally, as long as the price remained rock bottom and the quality was acceptable, a supplier could keep the business. But as sales of American cars fell in the 1980's, the sales of most suppliers declined, too.
 
Different Ways of Doing Business
 American parts makers tried to pick up new business by courting the Japanese. But Japanese auto makers conduct business differently. First and foremost, Japanese auto makers expect parts makers to provide their own designs, and many American suppliers lack engineering expertise. Secondly, Japanese auto makers require intricate and detailed planning that may begin years before the model goes into production.
"Many American suppliers have never had to undertake that kind of long-term thinking or show that amount of patience," said James Olson, senior vice president for public affairs for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. in Torrance, Calif.
Nevertheless, some American suppliers have adapted to Japanese rules. Tenneco, which makes Monroe shock absorbers and Walker mufflers, for example, began meeting with Nissan engineers in the late 1970's. Monroe failed to win a contract to supply shocks for the Nissan pickup truck built in Smyrna, Tenn., but a decade later got an order for shock absorbers for the Nissan Sentra compact car, also assembled in Smyrna.
"A lot of U.S. suppliers have gotten a little bit of business," said Mr. Reilly, chairman of Tenneco's automotive subsidiary. "The real test is to get more meaningful volumes. We have the capacity to ship a million shock absorbers to Japan; we ship 5,000."
 
Incentive to Buy American
 Financially, Japanese auto makers have every incentive to buy American, since the dollar is weak and the yen is strong. Indeed, Toyota, Nissan, Honda and others have opened technical centers in the United States, which are supposed to work with prospective American suppliers. The staffs at the centers are mostly English-speaking, American-trained engineers and designers.
If a supplier has trouble with a design, Toyota engineers are ready to assist. The auto maker is also exploring the possibility of engaging independent engineering companies, which are not found in Japan, to help suppliers, he said.
But some wonder about Japanese good faith.
"You heard some serious Detroit-bashing in Japan," said Michael Flynn, assistant director of the University of Michigan's transportation study project. "If we take the pressure off, we won't see much serious action."

Anger, Assumptions and the Rush to Limit Welfare

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
"WHEN a lot of people are out of work," President Warren Harding opined in 1921, "unemployment results."
Not until a quarter-century later, though, did the Federal Government begin a meaningful measurement of joblessness. Last week, more than a half-century after the Social Security Act was signed, the Senate passed Daniel Patrick Moynihan's bill to belatedly apply the same scrutiny to welfare dependency. 
 Today, Senator Moynihan's subcommittee on family policy will examine welfare rules imposed recently by New Jersey and other states desperately seeking to balance middle-class demands for fairness with the unmet needs of people for whom welfare is a way of life. New figures raise questions about the fundamental assumptions in some political solutions proposed so far.
In 1990, one of four New Yorkers was living in poverty -- the highest proportion ever recorded by city welfare officials. The poverty rate jumped to 25.2 percent from 20.7 percent the year before -- about twice the national rate and more than three times the rate for the rest of the state.
Who was poor? Nearly one in four families (their incomes were below the Federal Government's arbitrary poverty level, which is $10,560 for a family of three). Two-thirds of female-headed households with children -- up from about half the year before. And 4 in 10 children under the age of 18 -- meaning that nearly half of New York City's poor are youngsters.
The Human Resources Administration derived those numbers from the 1991 Current Population Survey, a small sample that nonetheless suggests troubling trends, the burden imposed on the city's taxpayers and why Mr. Moynihan fears the national consensus embodied three years ago in his Family Support Act may be evaporating.
Nine states cut basic benefits in 1991. Another 31 froze them. California proposes to slice grants by up to 25 percent. Two weeks ago, Gov. Jim Florio signed a comprehensive legislative package that makes New Jersey the only state to deny an additional subsidy -- $2.12 a day was standard -- for welfare mothers who have more children.
"In the 50 years since the Social Security Act was signed," Mr. Moynihan said, "we've never had a time that slowly but suddenly, with much greater force, the country is deciding that we're spending too much money on children.
"New Jersey is saying, 'Let's show that little 6-week-old to shape up or starve,' " the New York Democrat said. "It's happening all over the country. It all begins with David Duke and his talk about the threat of the welfare culture. It's because we're in a recession, because this is much larger issue, because welfare is a code word.
"You could also say, 'You want more abortions?' " the Senator said, which might be one consequence of the New Jersey law that could place some conservatives in an ideological bind. "This is a very ugly turn and it's what comes of denial."
Also of resentment and of ignorance. Which is why one goal of Mr. Moynihan's hearings is to answer New Jersey's $64 question: Were the revised welfare provisions grounded in mean-spirited anger or in constructive disincentives to enlarging the dependent population?
New Jersey's law conforms to the Family Support Act by encouraging education and job training -- indeed, by requiring it. But do welfare mothers bear more children merely to collect another $64 a month for each addition to a three-person household?
The law includes other anomalies, too. Wages are ordinarily deducted from welfare checks, but if a woman has a baby, she can keep her welfare grant and about $200 in monthly earnings. If she marries the child's natural father, his earnings are deducted from the mother's welfare grant, but if she marries someone else, he can earn up to $21,000 a year without affecting the family's grant. So much for family preservation.
New Jersey officials offer rationales for these provisions; critics are unconvinced. "You can go to Calcutta and see people living on the street and having another mouth to feed and they're not motivated by more money," said Cesar A. Perales, Deputy Mayor in New York and a former State Social Services Commissioner.
Despite President Bush's endorsement, it is arguable whether the New Jersey law will get needed Federal waivers or survive court challenges when it, in effect, reduces benefits for a new baby and its siblings.
"Sinking more innocent children deeper into poverty will not help solve a bigger problem: producing productive adults," said Richard P. Nathan, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany.
"Yes, we should require the heads of welfare families to work and help them to do so," Professor Nathan said. "The $64 question is whether we should penalize babies once they are born for having mothers at whom the legislature is angry."
If President Harding were alive today, he might conclude that when a lot of people are poor, poverty results. Officials today may not be much better informed. When society spells relief on the basis of frustration, not facts, its judgment may be just as poor as its population.

HEADLINE: Signs of Hope for Broadway: 22 Marquees Light Up Again

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The season of the darkened marquee is suddenly becoming the season of the booking bonanza. In the next three months, 22 shows -- nearly as many as opened in the entire 1990-91 season -- will open on Broadway, and producers have been eagerly seeking theaters to accommodate this burst of activity.
The spring lineup is also unusual in that it will bring to Broadway the largest contingent of Hollywood stars to act on the New York stage in years. Producers are counting on marquee names to attract investors -- and, they fervently hope, audiences -- to salvage a Broadway season that, until now, has been deeply disappointing to producers and plagued by a severe post-holiday audience slump that has been worsening by the week. At the same time, Off Broadway theaters are cutting back on productions and other programs, a new study has found. [Page C11.] 
 The incoming shows are "a huge number when you realize that there were 28 shows during the entire 1990-91 season," said George Wachtel, director of research for the League of American Theaters and Producers. So far this season, 15 new productions have opened.
The roster includes new plays by August Wilson, Lanford Wilson, Neil Simon and John Guare; revivals of three classic American musicals, "Guys and Dolls," "The Most Happy Fella" and "Man of La Mancha," and a London hit produced by Cameron Mackintosh, "Five Guys Named Moe." But there will be none of the extravagantly produced new musical spectacles that have been a staple of Broadway in the last decade, possibly reflecting the declining public taste for such shows, and certainly demonstrating the difficulty of raising the huge investments they require.
But the heavy pace of activity on Broadway does not reflect a complete turnaround for the commercial theater. Seven new shows are sponsored, in full or in part, by nonprofit, institutional theaters like the Lincoln Center Theater or the Manhattan Theater Club, which are renting Broadway theaters to accommodate their expanding activities. While these presentations will be eligible for Tony Awards, they do not spring from the creative efforts of commercial producers, and their revenues will not primarily enrich investors.
So glum has been the Broadway picture this season that even when all the new shows now planned open, a handful of theaters will remain dark unless other producers suddenly rush in with last-minute productions.
 
So Many Stars, So Little Space
 Nevertheless, few seasons on Broadway have been greeted with as much anticipation as this spring. If this derives partly from the contrast with the dismal state of the season so far, the enthusiasm is also linked to the Tinseltown factor: it has been a long time since so many names with Hollywood sheen have planned to illuminate the Great White Way. The stars coming soon to Broadway include Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Ellen Burstyn, Glenn Close, Joan Collins, Richard Dreyfuss, Gene Hackman, Gregory Hines, Judd Hirsch, Raul Julia, Jessica Lange and Al Pacino.
The fact that so many stars are available may be in part a consequence of the recession: cutbacks in Hollywood salaries and production schedules have made it impossible for many West Coast names to find quality vehicles at their "prices," according to several producers who spoke on condition of anonymity. A limited run on Broadway, with the prospect of an award or two, may be a career-enhancing way to ride out the recession.
So tight is the crush of new bookings that many of the new shows had difficulty finding their tentative theater homes. Some producers are actively rooting for the speedy demise of planned or current shows so that more desirable theaters will be freed for new productions.
The traditional post-holiday decline in audiences and ticket sales seems to have been worsened by a recession-plagued winter, and more and more Broadway shows have empty seats. A week ago, only two shows, "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Miss Saigon," were complete or near-complete sellouts, and sales were generally so low that even solid hits like "Dancing at Lughnasa" and "The Will Rogers Follies" had seats available. Two shows, "Park Your Car in Harvard Yard" and "Two Shakespearean Actors," say in their advertising that they are in their final weeks.
"Right now there are more empty theaters than at any time I can remember, and the recession has definitely affected our industry," said Roger Berlind, a producer. Not only do theatergoers have less money to spend on entertainment, he said, "but investors have been more reluctant to risk capital in a time when everything is marked down, and their house or their art is worth less than they thought."
Although the recession has not dried up venture capital on Broadway -- the spring lineup is evidence that substantial investment money is available -- angels are clearly more cautious. Not only are they not putting money in mega-musicals, but the emphasis now is also on straight plays, which account for 13 of the new productions and cost considerably less to produce than musicals. Among the nine musicals scheduled to open soon, most are revivals of proven hits rather than riskier original works.
Since awards generate publicity and sell tickets -- a Tony-winning show is usually assured of a run through July -- producers are exercising still more caution by bunching their opening nights shortly before the Tony deadline, April 29. They fear that Tony voters, like Oscar voters, have a limited attention span.
 
Broadway and the Economy
 Despite the impact of the economic climate on investment and ticket sales, some on Broadway say the recession has been kinder to the theater than to other sectors of New York City's economy. "At a time when investment in many other businesses is at the bottom, Broadway is doing very well indeed, given the number of new shows that are planned," said Harvey Sabinson, executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers.
"I don't believe that the recession has had all that much effect," said Bernard Jacobs, president of the Shubert Organization. "The retailing business in New York is terrible, but we haven't really seen that same negative downturn in the theater."
Investment money is available on Broadway. No organization keeps year-by-year comparisons of total investments in shows, and such figures could well be misleading anyway, since recent years have seen larger investments in individual shows but fewer shows opening.
But with straight plays costing up to $1.3 million to mount, and musicals generally from $4 million to $7 million, it is clear that this spring season involves an investment of at least $40 million.
What is also clear, however, is that productions from the institutional, nonprofit theater are more essential to Broadway than ever before, and the phenomenon of their role as tenants of Broadway real estate has every prospect of growing.
On average, plays and musicals are about 10 percent more expensive this year. Investors cite the increased costs of production, notably in stars' salaries, union wages and marketing expenses. Producers are diversifying their newspaper and television advertising and adding the expense of sophisticated direct-mail campaigns.
 
Some Limited Runs
 Star-studded shows like "Death and the Maiden," to be directed by Mike Nichols and featuring Mr. Hackman, Ms. Close and Mr. Dreyfuss, will need near-capacity audiences to make money in their limited runs. The producers of "Death and the Maiden" have said that the show, which is to open at the Brooks Atkinson Theater on March 17, will cost $1.3 million to mount for 26 weeks, the time the stars are available, and that Mr. Nichols's contract guarantees him about $13,000 a week, even before the show makes back its money.
The high hopes for spring contrast sharply with the sad statistical trail of what has been an abysmal season for hit plays and musicals to this point. For the 1991-92 season, which began after the Tony Awards on June 2, Broadway ticket receipts are down $1 million, and attendance is off by nearly half a million compared with a season ago, according to last week's Variety.
Even Broadway's powerhouses, the Cameron Mackintosh mega-musicals, have been buffeted by recessionary gales. Although "Miss Saigon" and "The Phantom of the Opera" are nearly sold out every night, Mr. Mackintosh said advance ticket purchases have fallen off.
"On both sides of the Atlantic, the trend toward gigantic advances has come to a halt, due to the recession," he said. "I have five shows running in London, and all of them have 20 percent less in advance bookings than a year ago. The same is becoming true of the advance here."
 
Some Price Cuts
 Mr. Mackintosh said the economy was also the reason he established a new $15 price for hundreds of seats at "Miss Saigon," "Phantom" and "Les Miserables," starting March 9. The lowest prices have previously been $35 at "Phantom" and $30 at "Saigon" and "Les Miz."
Noting that "Miss Saigon" recouped its $10.9 million investment in 39 weeks, Mr. Mackintosh said that in deciding to lower the top price for 248 front-mezzanine seats from $100 to $65 on March 9, "the economy certainly was a factor," he said. "But also, we didn't want it to be perceived that all the seats to the show were $100."
On Jan. 24, the producers of "The Will Rogers Follies" lowered the cost of the last two rows of mezzanine seats from $50 to $20 on Mondays through Thursdays. And some tickets for "Grand Hotel" have been reduced to $7.50, the price of a movie admission in Manhattan.
The question of whether things are looking up or down in the commercial theater cannot be answered until the returns are in on the star-filled spring. In the matter of success, Broadway has a very short memory; if "Nick and Nora" had been a triumph, even the dismal fall might be more fondly remembered than the sad statistics could justify. If the incoming shows produce a fair number of hits, "the first half of the season will be forgotten quickly," Mr. Sabinson said.

HEADLINE: Recession Affecting Theaters Off Broadway

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
A new study of the recession's effects on theater Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway indicates that companies have been forced to cut back on productions, curtail audience-building educational programs, reduce staff and slash outreach programs in hospitals, community centers and homes for the elderly.
Nevertheless, while budgets have been cut and the number of productions is down, attendance and ticket sales have risen, according to experts on Off Broadway. And a significant number of productions by Off Broadway companies in the last year have achieved major success with critics and audiences, underscoring the continuing strength of Off Broadway as a creative center of theater in New York City. 
 The study by the Alliance of Resident Theaters of New York, a service group for 136 nonprofit theater organizations in the five boroughs, shows that budgets have dropped 19 percent since 1989 and that a further 16 percent decline is projected for the remainder of the season.
 
A Continuing Toll
 On Friday, Mayor David N. Dinkins released a preliminary four-year financial plan for New York City. It does not call for any new cuts in the culture budget, which aids many of the nonprofit companies that make up the alliance's membership. Nevertheless, the toll of previous budget reductions "is very sobering," said Ginny Louloudes, executive director of the alliance.
The organization counts among its members the Circle Repertory Company, the Ensemble Studio Theater, the Intar Hispanic American Theater, Lincoln Center Theater, the Manhattan Theater Club, the New York Shakespeare Festival, Pan Asian Repertory Theater, Playwrights Horizons, Second Stage Theater and Theater for the New City.
Twenty-six alliance members participated in the study and gave information to the alliance on condition that they not be named. Four organizations reported annual budgets of more than $1 million, four had budgets between $600,000 and $999,000, six between $300,000 and $599,000, four between $101,000 and $299,000 and eight less than $100,000. "We believe that the findings reflect an accurate picture of the current situation of nonprofit theaters," Ms. Louloudes said.
The study found that financing from the New York State Council on the Arts had decreased in recent years by an average of 66 percent for the alliance members studied. Support from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs has dropped by an average of 46 percent.
Decline in financial support has been so devastating that 77 percent of the theaters studied have lost corporate financing. Donations from individual contributors declined an average of $73,718. Staff size at the alliance theaters has plummeted by an average of 30 percent since 1989, and more than half of the organizations said they would have to lay off more staff members by the end of the current season.
More visibly for those in the theater, companies participating in the alliance study will produce 29 percent fewer shows than they did two years ago and hire 25 percent fewer actors than in the 1989-90 season.
 
A Growing Audience
 Paradoxically, even while they have lost private and Government money, audiences and ticket revenues have grown for many shows Off and Off Off Broadway. This season has already produced successes including "Lips Together, Teeth Apart," "Marvin's Room," "Return to the Forbidden Planet," "Tubes" by the Blue Man Group, "Beau Jest" and "From the Mississippi Delta."
Since no totals are tallied for Off Broadway attendance or ticket receipts, exact comparisons between this and previous years cannot be made. "I'm on the phone all the time with theater owners and producers, and I can tell you that audiences are up," said George Elmer, secretary-treasurer of the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers. The group, a trade association for commercial and nonprofit organizations in New York City, represents 87 theaters, producers and general managers.
"If upscale folks used to think that Off Broadway was merely some out-of-left-field people mumbling poetry, they think so no more," Mr. Elmer said. "They are coming in greater numbers than ever before, thanks to the success of 'Driving Miss Daisy,' 'Steel Magnolias' and 'Other People's Money.' "
"Grosses are up, too, because ticket prices are up," he said. "The average Off Broadway show is up $2 over what it was two years ago." Currently, Off Broadway ticket prices range from a high of $38.50 to a low of $5 or even less at some Off Off Broadway venues, compared to a top of $100 for the musical "Miss Saigon" and $45 for the play "Lost in Yonkers" on Broadway.
 
Broadway's Loss Is Their Gain
 Off Broadway shows may also have benefited from the dearth of new productions on Broadway in the first half of this season. "As the number of dramas on Broadway has dwindled, more and more people are looking to Off Broadway for the experience of live theater," Mr. Elmer said.
Audiences have ballooned for some membership theaters, too. "Subscriptions are up to nearly 15,000, an all-time high for us," said Barry Grove, general manager of the Manhattan Theater Club, which has produced such hits as this season's "Lips Together, Teeth Apart." Seeking to explain the reason for growing audiences, he said, "People need theater more than ever in a time of economic hardship."
Even for a company like the Manhattan Theater Club, blessed with comparatively large, diverse financing, the cuts in Government support will directly affect audiences. Not only has city financing for the group been reduced, but the one-third reduction in the budget of City Center, the theater's home, also means that fewer visiting companies will perform there, thus reducing the number of organizations sharing City Center's operating expenses. Thus, more than $50,000 has been added to the Manhattan Theater Club's operating costs this season.
Because of the red ink, Mr. Grove said, Manhattan Theater Club will produce one less play this year than originally scheduled, offering its subscribers an eight-play season instead of a nine-play season.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE THAW;
'The Residual Role for the Military'

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
"The opportunity for the Western democracies at present is to establish a vision of a new world order. It's thefirst opportunity of conceiving of such a vision and moving toward it since Roosevelt and Churchill put forth their vfision of a post-World War II world. They were looking to a world in which relations among nations were based on a rule of law and a form of collective security founded on the United Nations. That is possible now.
 "I'm not so naive as to believe this post-cold-war world would be without conflict. There have been 125 wars leading to 40 million deaths, largely in the third world, after World War II and before the Gulf War. These were not a function of ideological differences between East and West. They were a function of the age-old causes of war -- boundary disputes, economic conflicts, ethnic tensions. 
 "The danger is not that some group of nations will engage in conflict that will endagner the military structure of the great powers. The danger is that the great powers will fail to follow through on the vision. If the United States will give leadership in that direction and the other great powers will follows, than I believe it should be possible to cut military expenditures in the world roughly in half.
 "The residual role for the military is to deal with the conflicts that can't be deterred -- such as the Gulf. We have many, many problems in the world, such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We've got all kinds of common enemies and challenges, such as the sustainability of development in broadest sense around the world. Population stability and environmental stability are going to be increasingly serious problems."

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush and New Jersey's Welfare

 BODY:
President Bush sounded alternately demagogic and enlightened when he commented on welfare reform in his State of the Union Message.
The demagogic Mr. Bush first complained about welfare recipients who make "a life style" of the dole. He ignored the fact that the vast majority of people stay on the rolls only briefly, to get through tough times like these. 
 The enlightened Mr. Bush said he would allow states like New Jersey to reform welfare in ways that would avoid "finger-pointing," "scapegoating" and the racism that so often clouds the issue.
He seemed to be referring to the New Jersey Family Development Act, a firm but compassionate proposal for helping New Jerseyans who are trapped on the dole. The act combines an imaginative collection of incentives and punishments, some of which require waivers of Federal law before they can go into effect.
The act's most controversial provision disallows additional benefits to women who give birth while on welfare. A New Jersey welfare mother with two children receives $424 a month. The old law raised that amount by $64 for an additional child. Now those women may have to find part-time jobs to meet the new expense.
The provision might seem cruel because it taxes a poor family's meager resources. But it's worth the risk if it teaches children that work is the order of the day. The state will support the work effort with day care, transportation subsidies and a 24-hour hotline to assist with emergencies. The act wisely removes the penalties women once suffered when they went to work. A working welfare mother lost a dollar of her grant for every dollar she earned. Now she can earn up to 50 percent above the grant without penalty. Women were kicked off welfare if they married, even though their husbands were most likely to be the working poor. Now, some married women will keep their benefits; their children can have male role models and food at the same time.
The most far-reaching provision requires welfare recipients to participate in state-furnished education or job-training programs. Illiterates will be taught to read. Dropouts will work for equivalency diplomas. Those accepted to college will be given scholarships. Those who aren't academically inclined will be trained for jobs. Failure to participate could result in reduction of benefits or even temporary suspension from the rolls.
The act was developed by Assemblyman Wayne R. Bryant of Camden, a city where half the residents receive welfare. Mr. Bryant knows some people supported the bill out of contempt for the poor. But his own reasons are honorable. He has seen welfare's desolation; he believes most people will grasp a helping hand when it's extended.
The act deserves the Federal waivers it requires. It's not a demagogic scourge of the poor. It's a compassionate, realistic blueprint for dealing with an intractable problem.

End U.N. Dipbaloney

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
With forward-looking rhetoric, world leaders pledged Friday to strengthen the United Nations. But they acted like egg-handlers when it came to practical moves to overhaul this ill-organized institution and grasp historic opportunity.
Behind the scenes and of immediate concern, President Bush is expected to announce the departure of chief U.N. envoy Thomas Pickering, arguably the best-ever senior U.S. representative to that body -- just when his services are most needed. 
 It is widely believed by Washington cognoscenti that Ambassador Pickering is being posted to India for the worst of reasons: Secretary of State James Baker feels that the career diplomat is casting too big a shadow on the Baker parade.
The State Department will say that Mr. Pickering's tour has hit the three-year mark and that his replacement -- Ambassador Edward Perkins, now head of State Department personnel -- is a very able professional. True, and beside the point. If the U.N. is about to plow through the wrenching changes envisaged by Mr. Bush, this is a poor time to remove a diplomatic dynamo like Ambassador Pickering.
The U.N. needs diplomats of great talent and stature to tackle the painful issues of readjustment. Not the least of which is the future of the current Big Five permanent members of the Security Council, each (the U.S., Russia, China, France and Britain) with a veto.
That group no longer reflects the real distribution of power at the U.N. or in the world. Japan and Germany rank behind only the U.S. in economic clout. And unless U.N. members grant these two states responsibility equal to their power, the U.N. will never command the necessary resources and authority.
Of course, Britain and France seethe at the thought of Germany taking their place. And sensitive Germans wisely seek to first work matters out privately with their European Community partners.
Tokyo shows less patience, as could be seen from Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's call Friday for the U.N. to accept "the realities of the new era." Privately, Japanese diplomats say this should mean Japan's having a permanent Security Council seat by 1995. Otherwise, they make clear, their public will not continue to stand for Tokyo's paying more to keep the U.N. running than Britain and France combined.
China will oppose Japanese ascension at the U.N. And a pack of regional powers like India, Brazil and Nigeria will join in to press their claims. But some compromise has to be fashioned because Tokyo and Bonn ask only for their due.
Not less important, new status at the U.N. for Germany and Japan could help solve another growing problem: the crescendo of moaning about these two states not contributing personnel to peacekeeping operations. With an elevated U.N. role, German and Japanese leaders could overcome the resistance of their people to taking on U.N. military responsibilities.
This is another area where the world's leaders got off track Friday, talking more about proposals to establish a standing U.N. army than about what such a force should do. Under U.N. guidelines, peacekeeping means just that -- coming in after the fighting stops. But in an increasing number of situations, like Yugoslavia and Somalia, that will be too little too late. To stop civil slaughters, the U.N. will have to redefine its mission and accept greater risks.
Its leading members will also have to start paying their bills, another topic lightly fingered by the happy world leaders on Friday. Unpaid assessments total almost $800 million. Washington is the biggest deadbeat by far.
None of this is to demean the one-day summit meeting. It began as a Bush favor to aid the ailing political fortunes of Prime Minister John Major of Britain, the summit chairman. But it ended with the assembled world leaders (China excepted) saying some important things about U.N. responsibility for democracy, human rights and preventive diplomacy.
Words, yes. But the right words after decades of unsurpassed dipbaloney. Also comforting, the leaders did drop enough hints here and there to show they know what must be next on the U.N. agenda -- the grungy business of reorganizing, rethinking risk-taking and paying their bills.

HEADLINE: BUSH CONFRONTED BY SOME GOVERNORS ON ECONOMIC PLAN

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
A White House effort to rally the nation's governors behind President Bush's economic plan degenerated into a tense confrontation today between Mr. Bush and several Democratic governors who believe that the states will pay for Washington's efforts to cut the budget in an election year.
The exchange, in a meeting between Mr. Bush and the bipartisan National Governors' Association, was touched off not only by campaign politics, but also by differences between the parties over economic policy and grievances by both Democratic and Republican governors who are concerned about the states' increasing burdens. 
 Since Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message last Tuesday, governors have expressed concern about cuts in Medicaid and Medicare. Some governors have called for greater cuts in military spending than Mr. Bush proposed, and there are also differences over whether the President went far enough in his plans to end the recession.
 
Disappointing Response
 Today's session with the 45 governors underscored the difficulty the White House has experienced in trying to overcome what Administration officials concede is a disappointing public response to the State of the Union Message and in keeping members of Mr. Bush's Cabinet lined up squarely behind his modest economic proposals.
At first, Bush aides tried to manage the event and banish reporters from the meeting in the White House East Room, but that effort backfired when Democrats in the group demanded to speak before the press. Mr. Bush, clearly annoyed by the questioning, responded by trying to trap the Democratic governors into the political embarrassment of advocating a Federal tax increase or listing military bases in their states that could be closed.
After Mr. Bush spoke, White House aides began escorting reporters from the room, but Gov. Roy Romer, a Colorado Democrat, interrupted, "Could I ask the press not to leave yet?"
 
Perturbed by Questions
 Clearly perturbed, officials permitted the reporters to stay. Turning to Mr. Bush, Mr. Romer said, "There are a couple of points that you made that I think have partisan implications and I just, frankly, want to answer them before the press leaves the room."
When Mr. Romer suggested there were "other approaches" to a budget that he said included "gimmicks" that gave misleading impression of how much money was was being saved, the White House cut off the official audio feed to the loudspeakers in the press room in the West Wing.
Mr. Bush snapped back at the governors, "Are you all advocating -- suggesting a tax increase now at the Federal level?"
Later, when Mr. Romer suggested that military spending could be cut more, Mr. Bush replied testily, "What bases do you want to close? What areas do you want to shut down? What weapons systems do you want to knock off right now? Or do you want to lay off the people?"
Gov. George Sinner, Democrat of North Dakota, said, "I think you could tax the wealthy a lot more, and the fact is that if we continue into this sewer of debt, our children and the families that are suffering today, that's nothing compared to what the family of tomorrow will suffer."
While Congress and the President argue about cutting taxes, governors fear that Federal tax and spending cuts could force them to raise taxes in their own states. The governors would prefer that if someone has to take the blame for higher taxes, it be the Federal Government.
 
Rebuking Kemp
 In addition to tangling with the nation's governor's, the White House today publicly rebuked Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, who said over the weekend that some of Mr. Bush's proposals, including changes in tax withholding rates, are "gimmicks" that will not speed economic recovery. Mr. Kemp had urged Mr. Bush to be bolder in his economic proposals.
"He wants to run for office in Japan, I think," Mr. Fitzwater said today when asked about Mr. Kemp's remarks, which were made in a television interview. The White House had called Mr. Kemp on Saturday "to find out the meaning of his words," Mr. Fitzwater said, and the Secretary was forced to issue a statement saying he had been misunderstood and actually backed Mr. Bush's proposals.
Today, only minutes before Mr. Bush met with the governors, Mr. Fitzwater acknowledged that public reviews of Mr. Bush's plan to end the recession were "mixed" and offered an unusually blunt appraisal of the Administration's political problems.
"If you're an unemployed person, it is a very tragic situation to be in because the only thing that's going to make you feel real good is if you get a check or a job," Mr. Fitzwater said. "And, unfortunately, those things are not going to happen overnight. But at least people can have the assurance that we're trying to do everything we can, no matter what it amounts to."
In making its case, the White House seems to be offering a version of the folk prescription for chicken soup: Mr. Bush's economic program may not be great, but at least it will not hurt.
Mr. Fitzwater noted that four economists were interviewed on television over the weekend and that three of them concluded that Mr. Bush's plan "would stimulate in the short-term, that it wouldn't cause long-term detriment to the economy."
 
A Managed Event
 Mr. Bush's meeting today was part of the winter meeting of the National Governors Association, a bipartisan group that is headed by a Republican, John Ashcroft of Missouri.
The White House had invited the governors to the East Room for a speech by Mr. Bush, followed by comments by Governor Ashcroft and Governor Romer, who will become the group's chairman this fall, and then a question-and-answer session.
Reporters were to be escorted out after Mr. Bush spoke, before any criticism of his remarks was broadcast, and the White House had asked for the governors' questions in advance, officials said.
Despite the confrontation, by the end of the meeting the politicians were trying to smooth one another's ruffled feathers. Mr. Romer explained that he had abandoned the meeting's script in such an "abrupt way" because Mr. Bush had tried to make the case that "we as governors help you go to Congress and convince them that your approach alone is the only approach."
Mr. Bush replied, "All I was doing was appealing for an endorsement, not suggesting you endorse it. I've known you too long."

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Casting About for New Missions

SERIES: After the Cold War -- Third of six articles.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Standing in a nondescript conference room in a convention hotel in East Brunswick, N.J., James T. Fitzgerald does what he has been doing for the last 25 years: pitching the Central Intelligence Agency to aspiring recruits.
"It's not like the James Bond movies," he explains to 28 men and a woman, college graduates invited to the orientation on the basis of their resumes. "The more you learn about the C.I.A., the more you read about it, the more unromantic it becomes." 
 For an hour, Mr. Fitzgerald works with the group but never uses the words "Soviet," "enemy" or "covert," or even "espionage." Rather, he tells his audience that the mission of the agency is now so diverse it "could probably staff a small university."
Like a secret agent who carries an invented history and clean passport to a new post, the C.I.A. is struggling to create a new, post-cold-war identity. If Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, could have his way, the spy agency would shed its popular image as a hotbed of operators who conduct covert actions around the world, or seduce foreigners into committing treason in the interests of America's national security.
A child of the cold war nurtured on an us-versus-them mentality, the C.I.A. is longing to be accepted as a benign arm of the government bureaucracy, the place to come for cutting-edge information on everything from the effects of the AIDS epidemic on the emerging leadership of Africa to the possibilities of war in the Middle East over water resources.
In fact, some of the recruits said they were attracted to the C.I.A. not by the prospect of spy-movie adventure. They came for job security.
"I'm trying to get into something more structured, more stable than the job I have," said a 27-year-old man, an economics graduate who is working as a supervisor of cashiers in an Atlantic City casino. "All I need to do now is count," said the candidate, who insisted that his name not be used. "I'm choosing the C.I.A. because the benefits are good. The Government takes care of you."
 
Covert Action De-emphasized
 Only a decade ago, the agency was leading clandestine military operations against the Soviet Union or its proxies in countries like Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia. Those covert operations have ceased, as the Soviet Union withdrew from regional conflicts, then broke apart.
"In terms of dollars, the investment in covert action has already plummeted," said Gary E. Foster, the C.I.A.'s Deputy Director for Planning and Coordination.
Mr. Gates has even approved the recommendations of an "openness task force" to declassify millions of old documents and make senior officials more accessible to the public. "Transparent is now the operative word," a C.I.A. reformer says -- a revolutionary idea in an environment where success has been measured by the ability to remain opaque.
Still, the covert side has not disappeared. The agency argues that it still needs covert operators, in part to sift the increasing volume of information that is coming from newly opened societies. And it continues to give recruits a small gray pamphlet that promises adventure and unpredictability in the "clandestine service."
"The call may come in the middle of the night or on a rainy Sunday morning, or it may interrupt a dinner party or a daughter's graduation," the pamphlet says. "If it is urgent, the case officer exits his social and cover life to meet with an agent in a corner of a deserted park, at a table in a bistro, or in a safehouse."
But now, the way to move up in the agency is no longer to run successful operations against the Soviet enemy.
The M.B.A. who can trace a tortuous money trail through a foreign banking system is coming to be more important than the trench-coated spy who can follow an enemy agent through a back alley overseas. As Mr. Fitzgerald tells his young charges, "We're really looking for economists these days."
Similarly, the skills of thousands of people who collect Soviet military communications with satellites and other technical means are becoming obsolete.
After a decade or so when satellites were pre-eminent, it is becoming clearer that they are unable to discern intentions. Aerial surveillance could not penetrate the mosques or teahouses of Teheran to test the depth of opposition to the Shah. Nor could it watch Saddam Hussein's inner circle to figure out whether Iraq would use the tanks and troops it had massed on the Kuwaiti border.
"There's no real need for Field Station Berlin, or a variety of listening posts in Germany, which, among other things, listened to Warsaw Pact military communications," said Jeffrey T. Richelson, the author of several books on American intelligence agencies. "Not when there's nothing more to listen to."
 
Changes
Without Red Peril, Who's the Enemy?
 C.I.A. soul-searching stems not just from a belief that the world has become safer. There's also the realization that in a world where the postwar enemy has ceased to exist, the C.I.A. and its handful of sister agencies, with their billion-dollar satellites and mountains of classified documents, must somehow remain relevant in the minds of Americans.
This situation raises anew a question that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, asks: Without the Soviet threat, why not just abolish the C.I.A. and let the State Department take over?
For 40 years the threat of nuclear war drove the C.I.A., along with the other agencies and departments that make up the $30 billion-a-year constellation that is often called "the intelligence community." Included are the National Security Agency, which is responsible for eavesdropping around the world; the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's intelligence arm; the National Reconnaissance Office, which manages satellite intelligence, and analytical intelligence pockets tucked away in the State, Commerce and Treasury Departments.
Few if any C.I.A. officials agree with the notion that the intelligence agencies still need to focus 60 percent of their resources on the Soviet threat. In recent months, the atmosphere has been so cozy that shortly after Robert S. Strauss arrived in Moscow last summer to take up his post as President Bush's Ambassador, the K.G.B. handed him detailed wiring diagrams for listening devices in the new United States Embassy. K.G.B. agents wearing visitors' badges are being given tours of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.
William E. Colby, a former C.I.A. chief, tells of sitting around a table with the heads of half a dozen Eastern European intelligence services at a planning conference in Bulgaria in November, lecturing them on how to function in a democratic society.
"It knocked me out," Mr. Colby recalled. "I told them, 'Well, it is possible to run an intelligence service in a free society. It's a bit of a nuisance,' I said, 'but you can work out relations with Congress and adjust to a bill of rights and an independent judiciary.' "
As the conference unfolded, the Bulgarians agonized over what to do about their old boys schooled in the practice of torture, while others wondered to do with their potentially explosive files. Mr. Colby was so struck by the new mood that he said enthusiastically, "Isn't it wonderful to be allies?"
The overwhelming sense that opponents have become allies has prompted him to tape a message of peace for the Coalition for Democratic Values, an organization of liberal Democrats founded by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio.
"I'm William Colby, and I was head of the C.I.A.," he says in a recent 30-second television commercial. "The job of intelligence is to warn us of dangers to our military. Now the cold war is over, and the military threat is far less. Now it is time to cut our military spending by 50 percent and invest that money in our schools, health care and our economy."
 
Economics
A Creative Touch To the Trade Wars
 The intelligence agencies have so far been only peripheral players in a vital post-cold-war struggle: the effort to retain American economic primacy among the world's industrial nations.
As the military threat has receded, the belief that American security rests in economic strength has grown. As a result, many analysts are asking: Why not give the C.I.A. and its sister agencies the task of making the United States more competitive by spying on foreign corporations and turning over their secrets to their American counterparts?
Ethical objections aside, the critics of such an idea speak of the independence of American companies from government, and say they do not want Washington to become the handmaiden of industry. And as intelligence officers are fond of saying, they may be willing to die for America, but not necessarily for General Motors.
The most the C.I.A. will do, Mr. Gates has said, is to scrutinize the trade and financial transactions of foreign governments, particularly those of allies who are helping their industries at America's expense, and to investigate global developments in high-tech areas that affect national security. Together with the F.B.I., the C.I.A. will also step up efforts to prevent foreign corporations and governments from stealing secrets.
"We know that foreign intelligence services plant moles in our high-tech companies," Mr. Gates said during his confirmation hearings last fall. "We know that they rifle briefcases of our businessmen who travel in their countries. We know that they collect information on what we're doing, and I think that C.I.A. and F.B.I. working together should have a very aggressive program against it."
But, he added, "There is a lot of concern about doing industrial espionage, if you will, and I frankly don't think that U.S. intelligence should be engaged in that."
Other officials say they cannot become policemen for American business. The F.B.I. recently reassigned more than 300 of its counterintelligence agents to drug trafficking and domestic problems, reflecting its changing priorities at a time when spying by Eastern European intelligence services has virtually disappeared.
"If it's just a question of an American company getting beat out by another company, I don't think we'd launch a major intelligence investigation," said Wayne Gilbert, assistant director of the F.B.I.'s intelligence division. "When a foreign company actually puts agents in a company for a long period of time in a way that directly affects national security, that's when we'll act."
 
Languages
Agent of Today Is Fluent in Uzbek
 As soon as he was confirmed in November, Mr. Gates began defining a new role for the agencies he took over, arguing that they were still preoccupied, by habit and organization, with a Soviet military machine that no longer existed. If he did not make major changes and specify budget cuts, he said told intelligence officials on Dec. 4, Congress would do it for him.
As these agencies adjust to the new global realities, they are organizing around three loosely connected central concepts: the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the instability this has spawned; the spread of weapons of mass destruction, including a new risk that there are some in the former Soviet Union who would peddle their weapons and their expertise around the world, and the continued existence of totalitarian governments.
President Bush's National Security Directive No. 29, issued in November, dealt with intelligence requirements until the year 2005. It spoke of an urgent need for "a top-to-bottom examination of the mission, role and priorities of the intelligence community."
Mr. Gates hopes to devise a plan for restructuring by the end of March. Because the intelligence agencies' budget will surely shrink by billions of dollars, he intends to take the same approach that a wedding caterer might: He'll offer a range of menus for different budgets.
Many intelligence managers resist change, though. At the F.B.I., Mr. Gilbert says he has detected no marked decrease in spying on the United States by the new Russian version of the K.G.B. That assessment is shared by the C.I.A.
Arguing that the major espionage cases of the last 15 years have involved people selling secrets for money, Mr. Gilbert says the F.B.I. must remain vigilant against those who continue to sell secrets, even if Moscow's Embassy is no longer the primary bazaar.
"We don't want to rush out and have those warm, fuzzy feelings and then suddenly find there are new systems established to infiltrate our services," he said in an interview. "I'm not throwing cold water on the idea that we are one, big peaceful world. I just have to be cautious."
The C.I.A., for its part, has taken some tentative steps to reorganize. Last summer it cleared a wing of one of its buildings to make space for a Non-Proliferation Center that is now staffed by almost 100 experts. At the same time, the agency has disbanded its Soviet insurgency branch and its Soviet disinformation unit. In the last two years, it has cut its Soviet foreign policy staff by two-thirds and its weapons analysis staff by 25 percent. Agency officials are reluctant, though, to make changes that cannot be reversed.
"It's not an on-and-off switch," said George Kolt, director of the Office of Soviet Analysis, lately renamed the Office of Slavic and Eurasian Analysis. "You can't say to someone, 'You do research on Uzbekistan because people are interested in it,' then tomorrow say, 'Go do research in Latvia.' You have to train people. You can't switch people out of the blue."
Critics argue that neither the C.I.A. nor the State Department can cope with the deluge of newly available material since the Soviet collapse. They say that the Government is woefully lacking in language skills at a time of need -- when, for instance, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry has switched its news conferences from Russian to Ukrainian, and when a recent oil deal between Azerbaijan and Iran was announced in Azerbaijani.
"Before last September you could follow the non-Russian republics by reading only Russian, because the Russian press was at least as official as the non-Russian press," said Paul Goble, until recently the State Department's leading expert on Soviet nationalities and now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "Now the opposite is true, and you're in big trouble if you can't read the local language."
Asked whether it was difficult to find people to translate newspapers from the various republics, an intelligence official remarked: "Translate them? We don't even get them!"
Mr. Gates, during his confirmation hearings, acknowledged that the agency had been so focused on the inner workings of the Kremlin that it had to rely on travelers for information about the republics.
 
Frontiers
Thrill Is Gone; Mission Continues
 But reorganization and language training will not provide the intelligence agencies with a program that can compare with its grand, global, cloak-and-dagger mission of the cold war. They are taking on new issues, without the consensus that existed before. Proponents are calling them essential, while detractors say they are make-work -- "organizational maintenance," as Senator Moynihan puts it.
"In many ways the situation today is similar to 1947, when the C.I.A. was first created," said Adm. Bobby Ray Inman, former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. "The essence of intelligence wasn't yet us-versus-them, but was driven by challenges of the moment: How do you locate scarce resources, or how do you govern a liberated country? You needed encyclopedic knowledge about the world because you didn't know where next challenge would come from."
Whoever is proved right, it is difficult to imagine how analysts or covert operators can get as excited about the environmental impact of Brazil's shrinking rain forest or the dumping of toxic waste in Eastern Europe as they did about the life-and-death struggle between East and West.
Still, senior agency officials insist that the C.I.A. will have no problem finding a mission.
"If ever there was a non-problem, this is it," said John L. Helgerson, the C.I.A.'s Deputy Director for Intelligence, in an interview.
"So many people are asking us so many things -- on China, on Yugoslavia, on North Korea. Proliferation -- it's a growth industry at the moment like no other. We could put everyone in the agency in proliferation and narcotics, and we still wouldn't solve the problems."

HEADLINE: Japan Premier Joins Critics Of Americans' Work Habits

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Just back from a quick visit to the United States, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa added his voice today to those of other Japanese political leaders who have found fault recently with the way Americans perform in the workplace.
He said that America "may lack a work ethic," and that some of the country's economic ills came about because too many American college graduates headed to Wall Street in the 1980's rather than "producing things of value." 
 Mr. Miyazawa's comments, made today during a nationally televised debate in Parliament, seemed bound to further inflame the atmosphere between the United States and Japan. Two weeks ago the Speaker of the lower house of Parliament, Yoshio Sakurauchi, touched off protests in the United States when he termed American workers "lazy" and said a third of the work force was illiterate. Japanese Government officials, including Mr. Miyazawa, denounced those characterizations.
 
More Measured Comment

In many respects, Mr. Miyazawa's statements, along with criticism of American management by another leading member of the Liberal Democratic Party, Kabun Muto, seemed more measured than Mr. Sakurauchi's. Moreover, they echoed comments often heard in the United States. But they also reflected a widely held view here that fundamental problems in the American workplace, rather than just a cyclical downturn, have led to shoddy products and ultimately to national economic decline.
Tonight Japanese Government officials raced to interpret and explain away the Prime Minister's comments, aware that in a time of deep recession and growing American-Japanese tension -- epitomized by a new wave of "Buy America" campaigns -- words that might otherwise be overlooked are creating a backlash in the United States.
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement tonight noting that Mr. Miyazawa was also critical of excesses in the Japanese economy and said, "The Prime Minister regrets any misunderstanding which may have been caused." Masamichi Hanabusa, the ministry's chief spokesman, added, "The Prime Minister has no intention whatsoever of criticizing American workers."
But Mr. Miyazawa, led into the discussion of the economic problems facing America by Mr. Muto, appeared to be doing exactly that.
Mr. Muto reserved his harshest words for American managers.
Japanese auto makers, he said, were able to produce very high quality cars with American workers at the so-called "transplants" run by Toyota, Honda and Nissan, among others, succeeding where American auto makers could not.
"Americans are producing good cars," he said. "The question is how to use them skillfully."
Mr. Muto, who until recently was Minister of International Trade and Industry, the country's most crucial trade official, said he had heard Americans would not buy a Detroit-made car that was produced on a Friday or a Monday, because on those days workers were either preparing for a weekend of play or recovering from one.
"I think Americans should learn how to work properly from Monday to Friday," Mr. Muto said. "That's a good idea for everyone."
 
Wall Street Jobs Faulted
 Mr. Miyazawa, who had just returned from a summit meeting of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council on Friday, quickly chimed in, ticking off several problems facing America. He said that in the 1980's "American college graduates landed high-paying jobs on Wall Street, and as a result you and I have seen that the number of engineers able to make products has fallen year after year."
He said that while the United States was once the world's greatest source of industrial goods, its tradition of "producing things and creating value has 'loosened' too much in the past 10 years or so." Mr. Miyazawa, who is a near-fluent English speaker, used the English word "loosened" to emphasize his point, one that is often heard from Japanese industrialists.
As if in summary, Mr. Miyazawa paused and said, "I have thought for some time that they may lack a work ethic," and obliquely suggested that some Americans had forgotten how "to live by the sweat of their brow."
Mr. Miyazawa may well have thought that he was saying nothing unusual because such critiques are commonplace here -- not only on television, but also at the negotiating table. Similar arguments have emerged from the awkwardly named Structural Impediments Initiative, in which Japan has urged Americans to work longer hours and greatly improve worker training, while the United States has urged in return that Japanese take more vacations, save less money and buy more on credit to increase consumer spending and therefore the purchase of imports.
But for most of the last few years such criticisms were scarcely noticed. That has changed in the last month, with President Bush's ill-fated visit, new arguments over automobile trade and suggestions from some Bush Administration officials that the American recession was at least partly "made in Japan."
The tone of Mr. Miyazawa's comments today seemed more explanatory than argumentative, and he touched on a number of other practices, from issuing "junk bonds" to conducting leveraged buyouts, that create heavy debt loads for companies. That is not unusual for Mr. Miyazawa, who used Mr. Bush's visit here in early January to cite other problems, from drugs, homelessness, AIDS and a declining educational system as among the challenges that America must overcome.
Mr. Miyazawa is widely regarded as an internationalist with a deep understanding of the United States, so the timing of his comments today seemed difficult to explain. In recent weeks his Government has gone out of its way to compensate for Mr. Sakurauchi's comments by praising America and its workers.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
White House Responds
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (Reuters) -- The White House said today that disparaging Japanese remarks about American workers were not helpful, but that they could benefit the United States in the long run by stirring competitive juices.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, responding to Prime Minister Miyazawa's comment that Americans may lack a work ethic, told reporters today, "I would say that the American work force is second to none, that the American work ethic is legendary and has promoted the greatest prosperity in the world and throughout the world, including other countries, like Japan, and that we have been a leader in these areas for many years and any comments to the contrary are wrong."
Without criticizing Mr. Miyazawa directly, Mr. Fitzwater pointed out that "protectionist fires" were "burning very hot" in the United States and said such remarks were "probably not helpful" to relations between the two nations.
But he said the statement could benefit the United States in the long run. "These kinds of comments are probably helpful in stirring the rages in all of us who want to compete, and show who the best work force really is."

HEADLINE: Wave of Japan-Bashing Stings Pacific Northwest

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 3

 BODY:
When American automobile workers were seen on television last month bashing in the hood of a Japanese car, Ron Thornberry, a longshoreman on Puget Sound, did not like what he saw. As a dock worker at a port where the Japanese are the No. 1 customer, Mr. Thornberry fears that one international insult too many could escalate into a lost job for him and his union brothers.
And when Japanese investors came forth two weeks ago with an offer to buy the Seattle Mariners as a way to keep the baseball team from leaving town, they were hailed here as civic heroes. As a delegation led by Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington got set to plead their case with Fay Vincent, the baseball commissioner, on Tuesday in New York, there were fears that the deal would be a casualty of the latest round of cross-Pacific insults. 
 In the last month, the Pacific Northwest has had an outpouring of support for Japan unmatched in modern times. When one part of the United States bashes Japan, this part winces.
From Boeing airplanes made in Seattle and bought in Japan, to wheat grown in this state and sold for soup noodles throughout Asia, to wood that goes from the wet forests of the Cascades to homes in Tokyo, this region has linked its economic destiny to nations of the Pacific.
As such, it has largely escaped the lingering national recession: it and the other states in the region have continued to add jobs during the economic slump. While jobs tied to exports grew by less than one-half of 1 percent nationwide last year, they expanded by 4 percent in Washington, the nation's most trade-dependent state per capita.
The fiery remarks about Japan's trade policies by Lee Iacocca, the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, seemed to draw a more negative response here last month than the insults against American workers by Japanese leaders.
"The only foreign ownership I'm worried about is Tampa Bay," said Governor Gardner, referring to the Florida area that has been trying to lure the Mariners. It was Mr. Gardner, a Democrat, along with Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican, who approached Minoru Arakawa, a 15-year resident of the area who is president of Nintendo's American operations, and asked him in December to help keep the baseball team in Seattle.
The worst fear among business and political leaders in the Northwest, the part of the mainland closest to Japan, is that the woes of Midwestern automobile manufacturers could lead to protectionist measures that would seriously hurt Americans on the West Coast if Asian countries were to retaliate. Boeing, which employs 105,000 people in the Seattle area, is the nation's leading export company, and Japan is its second biggest foreign customer, behind England.
"I'm personally not that happy with what they've been saying about our workers in Japan, but I do know that if America were to have some sort of protectionism against them, it would kill us," said Mr. Thornberry, the longshoreman.
Such comments are common. "Asians have never been seen as a threat to us," said Jim Langlois, director of the National Apparel and Textile Association, which is based in Seattle and represents the booming garment industry here. While clothes made in Hong Kong may take a job away from somebody in Georgia, they add a job in the Pacific Northwest, where clothes are designed and marketed. "All the protectionism talk you hear in the Presidential campaign, that's not going to fly here," he said.
 
Some Disputes About Barriers
 Of course, there are still some disputes about Japan's trade barriers. While Washington grows more than half the nation's apples, the fruit is not allowed into Japan because of its agricultural barriers. And while Japan is one of Boeing's best customers, it bought the company's next generationaircraft, the 777, only after Boeing officials agreed to make some of the airplane's parts in Japan.
Increasingly, the American Northwest, along with British Columbia and Alberta in Canada, is trying to market itself to the world economy as a single economic unit, calling itself Cascadia. The region, which includes Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho and the two Canadian provinces, produced more than $250 billion in goods last year, which would rank it as the world's tenth largest economy by gross national product.
So, while critics in other parts of the country characterized the Mariners proposal as an attempt by foreigners to buy into the American national pastime, it was endorsed here a logical extension of this region's long ties to Asia.
"We have a vantage point on the future that others may not have," said the Seattle Mayor, Norm Rice. "We can see how old-fashioned notions like national boundaries have been shattered by communication, trade and interdependence." State officials have been actively campaigning over the last 10 years to bring in Japanese businesses.
The Mariners proposal put the interests of this region in the crossfire of a new round of name-calling between Japan and the United States. Seattle's leaders announced the plan just a few days after a leading Japanese politician called American workers lazy and illiterate. Today, on the eve of a meeting between baseball's leaders and Seattle officials, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan said that America "may lack a work ethic."
Under the proposal, 60 percent of the team would be owned by Hiroshi Yamauchi, president of the video game company Nintendo, and 40 percent by a group of corporate leaders from Seattle's leading companies, including Boeing and Microsoft. The Japanese portion would be managed by Mr. Arakawa, the son-in-law of Mr. Yamuachi. Nintendo's American base is in the Seattle area, where it employs 1,400 people.
The offer must be approved by a majority of major league baseball's 26 owners. Although the owners' initial reaction was negative, the position seemed to have softened as political leaders in this state raised the possibilty of suing for racial discrimination if the offer is rejected. The team's owner, Jeff Smulyan of Indianapolis, has given Seattle until March 27 to buy him out or he may move the team to another city.
A poll conducted over the weekend showed just how far apart the Northwest was from the rest of the nation on the issue. The nationwide sample of 1,000 people, done by the Response Center of Philadelphia, found that 71 percent opposed the purchase of an American baseball team by a Japanese corporation. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. By contrast, radio polls done in Seattle have shown strong support for the deal.
"There are plenty of people in Seattle, as elsewhere, who don't like Japanese trade policies, but they love this deal because it's the Japanese helping Seattle keep its team," said Dr. Kenneth Pyle, a professor at the University of Washington's Jackson School of International Studies.
Even before the Mariners proposal, there was a burst of resentment toward American criticisms of Japan.
Lee Iacocca, the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, harshly attacked Japanese policies as deliberately keeping American companies at a disadvantage after he returned from an Asian trip led by President Bush in January. In response, leaders in this state rose to defend Asian trade, calling Mr. Iacocca's remarks "outus and misleading."
"Ham-fisted United States policies of trade restriction and retaliation must be avoided in the politically charged atmosphere of this election year," the Washington Council on International Trade, which is made up of the leading companies in this state, wrote in a letter to Congress.
Dr. Robert A. Kapp, who is head of the Washington trade group, said Japan-bashing threatens to become part of a wave of stereotyping similiar to the Presidential campaign advertising four years ago that featured Willie Horton, the black convict who raped a woman while on a furlough from a state prison in Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: American Voice of Cold War Survives, but in Different Key

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Born 50 years ago during World War II and reforged as an instrument of the cold war, the United States Information Agency is arguing that even in a world without superpower conflict, its mission remains as important as ever.
The agency's budget has grown even as the Soviet-American struggle waned. The Bush Administration's proposed 1993 budget calls for a further increase of 4 percent, to more than $1.1 billion. 
 Its self-confidence is evident, too, in statements by its managers, who now describe their work as "public diplomacy."
Michael D. Schneider, the U.S.I.A.'s deputy associate director for policy and programs, said that during the cold war, "there were a lot of issues that were dormant."
 
Satisfying Demand in the East
 "We are doing more in areas that relate to democracy building and privatization of the economy," he said. "In the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe, they are desperate for expertise on the theory of constitutions, administrative law, setting up open elections, how to deal with environmental issues in a democracy, the role of press, citizen involvement, how to advance credit, how to open a business, how to find out what consumers want."
The new programs include management workshops for professionals in formerly Communist countries. Among the most successful is a longstanding visitor program, which brings 2,600 foreign leaders in government, business, science, the press and labor to this country for about a month each year.
The U.S.I.A. and its broadcasting arm, the Voice of America, had their origins in the Office of War Information and the Foreign Information Service in 1942.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued an executive order in 1953 making the U.S.I.A. an independent agency. Then as now, some of its senior officials were drawn from the C.I.A. Then as now, policy guidance on critical foreign-relations questions was provided by the State Department.
A former associate director of the agency, Walter R. Roberts, was asked whether the U.S.I.A. ever participated in Government clandestine operations during the cold war. He replied, "In the mid-1950s, it subsidized certain book programs and did not immediately say it was U.S.I.A. money."
 
Occasional Help to Friends
 He also said that the agency "occasionally in the beginning" provided cover overseas for C.I.A. officers. Except for this, he said, "U.S.I.A. was always overt."
Two other American outlets, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, did have covert origins. They were founded by the C.I.A., in 1949 and 1951 respectively, to broadcast to the Soviet bloc. In 1971 they were placed under the supervision of Congress.
While the U.S.I.A. maintained a combative stance during the cold war, its anti-Communist edge was blunted or sharpened depending on the inclinations of the director. During President Richard M. Nixon's first term, for example, Frank Shakespeare, as director, insisted on anti-Communist militancy to the point where he came into conflict with Mr. Nixon's plans to negotiate with the Soviet Union and China. He was replaced in 1972.
When Ronald Reagan was President, the agency gained visibility and a much bigger budget. Under Charles Z. Wick, a close friend of Mr. Reagan, an ideological emphasis was revived, with the U.S.I.A. barring scores of prominent Americans from its speakers' programs on suspicion of liberal bias.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 10.73, to 3,234.12, In Uneven Trading Session

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
Stocks edged up yesterday in trading that was marked by swift, if moderate, drops and rebounds. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 10.73 points at 3,234.12.
After a selloff, the Dow crested near 3,240 in the early afternoon and rode several dips and jumps. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was average, at 185.3 million shares, down from 197.6 million on Friday. Gaining stocks led losing ones, 923 to 820. 
 "The market remains sort of stuck in neutral," said Robert Walberg, senior equity analyst at MMS International. "People are waiting to see if an economic recovery can justify the current valuations."
 
100-Point Correction
 As a result, Mr. Walberg said, it might not take much to drive the market down. He said he expects to see the Dow drop 100 points or so in coming weeks.
"It could be a weak economic figure; it could be a donnybrook between the Democrats and the Republicans on economic policy, but something is going to come along and trigger a correction," he said.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks nudged upward 0.74 point, to 409.53. Among small stocks, the Nasdaq composite index was up 3.22, to 623.43, and the Russell 2,000 added 0.70 point, to 205.87. The American Stock Exchange composite was almost unchanged, slipping just 0.05 point, to 411.32.
Among the most heavily traded stock on the Big Board was Upjohn, up 1 3/4, to 43, with 2.3 million shares changing hands. The company reported record sales and earnings for 1991. Earnings on continuing operations were up 17 percent for the year, to $537 million, and annual sales grew 13 percent, to $3.4 billion.
Other blue-chip winners were American Express, up 1 5/8, to 22 1/4; General Motors, 1 5/8, to 34, and Coca-Cola, 1 3/8, to 78 7/8.
A stunning loser was U.S. Bioscience, which fell 13 3/4, to 17 3/4, after a Food and Drug Administration panel declined to back Ethyol, a potentially big-selling drug for use in radiation treatment.
 
Shift to Growth Issues
 Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for John Hancock Mutual Funds in Boston, noted a shift in the market toward the kind of small, growth-oriented stocks that performed well in 1991.
"The medical-care stocks, the high-tech stocks, all those that were the favorites last year are now coming back," said Mr. Freedman, who predicted a continued climb in the market driven by growth stocks.
Mr. Walberg, less optimistic, said the bullish sentiment that had drawn a flood of cash into the market since mid-December might have peaked.
"There's not much cash to fuel further growth," he warned.
Other notable stocks yesterday included Ashland Coal, up 3, to 31 1/4. the company announced it had signed a letter of intent to buy all the stock of Dal-Tex Coal, a subsidiary of the United Company, which owns sizable coal reserves in West Virginia.
Allergan rose 1 5/8, to 24 7/8, after an S.& P. panel. decided to place it on its 500-stock index effective Feb. 7, replacing USG, which the panel said was no longer representative of the building materials industry. USG was unchanged at 1 5/8.
In other markets, Alliance Pharmaceutical jumped 5 3/4, to 35 3/4, apparently because Veronica Onyskiw, an analyst at Manulife Financial, said on the television program "Wall St. Week" that Alliance was her favorite long-term investment.
Microsoft rose 4 3/4, to 125, after analysts reacted favorably to a reorganization of executives at the company.
Grenada Sunburst advanced 3 5/8, to 19, after an announcement that First Tennessee National, a bank holding company based in Memphis, would buy it. Grenada, the third-largest banking company in Mississippi, has $1.89 billion in assets.

HEADLINE: Purchasers Report No Pickup In January

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
In a report that offered few signs of an economic recovery, the nation's purchasing managers said yesterday that the overall economy expanded slowly last month, although business continued to deteriorate for the nation's manufacturers.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that its monthly index of business activity was unchanged at 47.4 percent, the second consecutive month the index was below 50 percent. The group, which regularly surveys 300 purchasing managers for American industrial companies, says a reading below 50 percent suggests a decline in manufacturing. But the association contends that the overall economy is growing as long as the index stays above the recessionary level of 44.5 percent. 
 The association noted that the index averaged 47.1 percent for all of 1991, which would roughly equate to growth of nine-tenths of a percent in the gross domestic product.
In another report, the Commerce Department said that spending for new construction of homes, offices and other projects fell two-tenths of a percent in December and 9.3 percent for all of last year. [Page D13.]
"This is disheartening, said Ray Stone, a managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, of the purchasing managers' survey. "We were looking for a number a little bit higher."
But Irwin L. Kellner, economist at the Chemical Banking Corporation, found the results in line with expectations. "It suggests growth will be very slow over the next few months, but it doesn't indicate a broad-based decline is under way in the important factory sector," he said.
The survey found that production levels inched higher, but new orders, which lead to growth in subsequent months, were down. Mr. Stone said these results did not bode well for manufacturers. "These are two things that are typically leading indicators," he said.
Before holding steady in January, the purchasing managers index had fallen for three months as manufacturers, responding to low demand, cut back their business. During that period, the index still managed to register readings above 50 percent.
The manufacturing sector would have to show signs of stabilizing "so it just doesn't fall away again," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the purchasing managers' survey committee and head of corporate purchasing for Pitney Bowes Inc.
"I have a sense that we're building a bottom here, if not in January, then in the month or two to come," Mr. Bretz said.
He said he was optimistic that lower interest rates would give consumers and businesses a chance to lighten their financial burdens and allow for more spending.
The survey indicated some positive news about inflation, as purchasing managers said their companies were paying lower prices for raw materials. Mr. Bretz said that could be a further incentive for manufacturers to increase production.
But employment continued to fall, another sign of weakness. The Labor Department's report on January employment, scheduled on Friday, will contain the Government's figures on the manufacturing sector.

HEADLINE: First Boats of Refugees Land in Haiti

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Looking nervous and confused after a sea voyage prolonged by bureaucratic delays, 381 Haitian refugees arrived here today aboard two Coast Guard cutters, forcibly returned from the United States military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Arriving at this city's grimy docks at 9 A.M., the first of the white ships, the Steadfast, immediately began discharging its passengers. Coast Guard officials said they hoped to establish a routine that would allow the rapid return of most of the 12,000 Haitians at Guantanamo, where many have lived in tents for over two months. 
 Under the watchful eyes of the Haitian police, the refugees were marched to a long-defunct cruise ship terminal. There they were interviewed and fingerprinted by Haitian authorities and given $15 and vouchers for food purchases by officials of the Red Cross.
The first group of refugees, many of whom had asked for places on their ship on Saturday after a Supreme Court decision cleared the way for their return, then piled into Red Cross vehicles with their small bags of belongings and were carried to a nearby bus terminal. Most immediately set off for their homes in outlying areas.
 
Stories Invented, Refugees Say
 "I left because others told me it was a good idea to go, that we could build a better life," said Rosana Joseph, a 26-year-old woman from the town of Archaie. "Some of these people have political problems, but not me. Most of us had no other reason than wanting a better life."
Mrs. Joseph's insistence that she had sought to flee Haiti's poverty, like the remarks of most of today's returnees, contrasted sharply with the fears of political persecution almost universally claimed by Haitians interviewed by journalists at Guantanamo in recent weeks.
Asked about the discrepancy, several of those who arrived today whispered explanations that many of the stories of political refuge had been invented to increase the odds of receiving asylum. Similarly, some said that the ubiquitous disclaimers against political activity at the port today involved attempts by some to avoid persecution.
"If people told the truth in Guantanamo, they would never be allowed into the United States," said one young man, nearly trembling as he spoke. "If we tell the truth here we could be shot."
 
Economic Refugees, U.S. Says
 The United States has said that most of the 15,000 Haitians intercepted at sea by the Coast Guard since a violent military coup last Sept. 30 are economic refugees and thus ineligible for asylum. But advocates for the Haitians have argued that many are fleeing political violence against supporters of the deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
They have urged the United States to delay the repatriation until the security of the refugees can be assured and immigration procedures refined to assure that no Haitians with legitimate fears of persecution are being returned.
Arguing that the United States faced a national emergency because of the rapidly mounting numbers of refugees, the Administration won a frantic sequence of legal battles with the refugee advocates when the Supreme Court lifted a District Court injunction on repatriations late on Friday.
After warnings from some quarters that the returnees would be subject to violence, officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross said they were satisfied that today's repatriation had gone without a hitch.
 
'Working Very Smoothly'
 "It seems to be working very smoothly," said Sally Miller, a Red Cross official who supervised the dockside operations.
But many of the returnees, wearing worried expressions, spoke with trepidation about the brutality they feared awaited them, even as they denied having engaged in any political activity.
"Our situation was no good, that is why I left," said Mondestin Essai, a 26-year-old mechanic. "Now I am afraid they're going to beat me."

HEADLINE: Credit Card Bill Passed In Albany

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The New York State Legislature passed banking legislation today that would save 1,400 jobs for Long Island but would raise credit card costs to millions of people across the country who pay their bills late.
The legislation allows banks in the state that issue credit cards to impose immediate $10 to $15 penalties for late payments, instead of requiring a 10-day waiting period. That change should insure that the recently merged Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover will consolidate their credit card operations at a Manufacturers office in Hicksville, L.I. 
 If the bill had not passed, legislators said, the credit card operations would likely have been moved to Delaware to take advantage of that state's less stringent banking regulations. Chemical has operated its credit card business from Delaware since the early 1980's.
 
Long Island Sees Benefits
 Bank officials had been so confident that the Legislature would support their cause, however, that they announced plans in November to combine their credit card operations in Hicksville.
Long Island officials applauded the legislation, which has yet to be considered by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, as good news for the stumbling Long Island economy. Hicksville, a commercial center in Nassau County, has been suffering from job losses and lackluster retail sales, and the exodus of more jobs would be a serious blow, officials said.
But consumer advocates, including the State Consumer Protection Board, immediately condemned the idea as a job-saving gimmick enacted at the expense of millions of consumers. Chemical and Manufacturers have a total of more than 4.5 million card holders nationwide and are by far the largest issuers in the state.
 
Consumer Protest
 "They're eroding consumer protection with the theory that they're going to be able to able to save jobs," said Blair Horner, legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group.
The bill also allows banks in the state to charge higher variable interest rates on credit cards than under the current law. Senator Hugh T. Farley Jr., Republican of Schenectady, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the bill's Senate sponsor, said jobs were the prime force behind the measure.
The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 41 to 16; the Assembly vote was 114 to 26 in favor.
 
Job Impact Assessed
 "We're talking about possibly bringing thousands of other jobs back into this state," Mr. Farley said, asserting that New York's stringent laws had already caused many banks to move their credit-card operations to other states.
But William J. Ahearn Jr., a spokesman for Citicorp, which has credit card operations in South Dakota, Maryland and Nevada, said it was unlikely that the new law would entice his company to return its credit card division to New York.
"One of the serendipitous things we've found is that we've landed in areas where the work force is terrific, where the cost of doing business is less, and where we can expand horizontally rather than vertically," he said. "I don't know how feasible it would be for us to pick up and move back to New York."

HEADLINE: Port Authority Cuts Back On Free-Spending Ways

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
The most obvious symbol of what the Port Authority calls its new leaner image sits high above New York Harbor, on the 44th floor of the World Trade Center.
It is an empty room. 
 Until the end of last year, that 6,310-square-foot space, with plush red carpeting and wood-paneled walls, housed the agency's executive dining room, where top officials were served subsidized meals by uniformed waiters and waitresses.
But to the chairman and executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the existence of the dining room at its headquarters was increasingly sending out an inappropriate signal, to the public, as well as to the rest of the agency at a time when its revenues are falling. So on Dec. 20, they shut it down.
In light of the $2.7 billion-a-year budget for the authority this year and last, the closing of the dining room will save a relatively small sum -- $700,000 a year, assuming that the space can be rented. But officials of the agency stress that the move represents a significant break from its sometimes lavish past, when some officials were chastised for free-spending ways like using the authority's three helicopters for personal travel.
And the dining room is just one of the perquisites that authority executives are doing without. The agency has sold off one helicopter, for $675,000; put a second on the block; pared its travel budget by 25 percent, for a saving of $1.5 million last year, and is closing its trade office in Zurich, a move that is expected to save $500,000 a year.
 
'A Major Difference'
 "This is a new thing for this agency," said the deputy executive director for policy and program operations, Anthony E. Shorris. "This is still relatively modest. But around here it is a major difference."
The agency has coupled those actions with some more painful, though far less dazzling, austerity measures. Through attrition and a hiring freeze for part of last year, the agency trimmed 300 jobs from its 9,000-worker roster. One hundred jobs are to be winnowed through attrition this year, thinning the ranks to the lowest level in seven years.
And since the beginning of last year, the agency has frozen the salaries of all nonunion employees at the levels of 1990. Though he says he hopes to raise the salaries this year, the executive director, Stanley Brezenoff, has no immediate plans to do so.
All told, last year, when revenues fell $50 million short of expectations, the agency said that its cost cutting saved more than $80 million. It expects similar measures to save $105 million this year.
But that is not nearly enough, said Dr. George Sternlieb, professor emeritus of regional planning at Rutgers University. "What you have is a 400-pound overweight weakling boasting of losing 50 pounds," Dr. Sternlieb said. "They're not down to scale yet."
The fiscal fortunes of the authority have dimmed dramatically since the late 1970's and early 1980's, when revenue was high at its three major airports and the trade center, which it owns and operates. Some former officials took that roaring revenue as a license to spend on themselves.
In the late 70's a former director of public affairs was caught padding his expense account with descriptions of meals with reporters whom he had never met, just as New York State legislators charged that agency helicopters improperly ferried top officials and sometimes their families to resorts, homes and business meetings.
That free-spending reputation has persisted into the 90's. Just over a year ago, the authority was embarrassed by an article in The Record in New Jersey that reported a board member's use of an authority helicopter to airlift a friend from Monmouth County to a dinner party in Manhattan.
But Mr. Brezenoff and the chairman, Richard C. Leone, insist that the excesses of the past have become intolerable in the present, particularly with the recession's hitting the region and the agency hard.
Mr. Leone and Mr. Brezenoff characterize their cutbacks as part of a new sense of accountability to the governors of New York and New Jersey, who can veto its budget, as well as the public, which was saddled in April with a $1 toll increase, to $4, on the six interstate crossings.
"The public has a right to expect from us that our dollars are spent in productive ways," Mr. Brezenoff said.
An executive who had access to the dining room, Frank Garcia, said its closing had not set off major grumbling among his colleagues, who must now settle for the agency's general cafeteria. Many, he said, were mindful that the cost cutting could have been far more severe.
 
Big Salaries, Great Views
 Despite the cuts, the authority retains much of its allure. These are among its features:
*Its salaries are regarded as generally higher than the rest of the public sector in the region and have helped attract some of the finest talent. Forty-nine managers, out of a total work force of 9,300, are paid more than $100,000 a year.
*The spacious main offices give many employees views that others can only dream about. The authority also has two overseas trade offices, in London and Tokyo.
*The agency boasts a 1,400-work art collection, virtually all on public display, that was purchased for $3.4 million and is now valued at $20 million.
Those descriptions may underscore how the authority has conducted itself for much of its 70-year history. But the new leaders emphasize the streamlining in the public sector as a new model.
"We have a crunch that is going to be persistent and we're going to have to look more like other agencies," Mr. Leone said. "The Port Authority had a reputation for being a place that lived better than other public agencies, in high style. You have to undo that reputation."

HEADLINE: Moving to Cut Sales Tax, Trenton Republicans Seek Other Money

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
As expected, the Republicans introduced legislation today to roll the 7 percent sales tax back to 6 percent, but they refused to say how they would replace the estimated $608 million in revenue that would be lost.
The long-promised legislation had 54 Republican co-sponsors, enough to pass it with three votes to spare and without a single Democratic vote. 
 But the Republicans may have a problem replacing the revenue lost in the tax cut because Gov. Jim Florio last week co-opted at least two big pools of money that they had their eyes on, more that $1 billion over two years produced by a revaluation of pension funds and $520 million from Federal Medicaid reimbursements that are expected but not certain.
The Republicans insisted that "everything is on the table" in their consideration of cutbacks to compensate for the lower revenue. But they seem to be studying most closely Governor Florio's $685-million Homestead Tax Rebate program and cuts in programs the Republicans have never been particularly fond of, among them the Department of the Public Advocate, a state agency with broad powers to bring suits in the public interest, including suits against the state itself.
 
A Menu of Possible Cuts
 The Public Advocate, Wilfredo Caraballo, has raised protest among conservatives by suggesting that he might bring suit to force the consolidation of school districts to achieve racial integration.
Along with the advocate's office, the Republicans have singled out the state prison system and health benefits for some 65,000 state employees as possible areas for cuts. The Republicans estimate that health costs might exceed $600 million in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Although Republicans won overwhelming majorities in both houses of the Legislature last November on a pledge to cut taxes and spending, none of the cuts they have mentioned can be accomplished easily.
Cutting the tax rebates, which return as much as $500 to homeowners and renters, could save hundreds of millions, but only at the risk of alienating voters who like getting checks, which traditionally go out not long before election day.
Nor are health benefits likely to be cut without fierce resistance from organized public employees while health-care costs are an explosive political and labor issue.
The Republican Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, acknowledged today that the Homestead rebate program might be a prime target when the Assembly Appropriations Committee considers where the budget might be cut. "We'll be talking about the Homestead rebate program and reform of that," he said, "particularly tenants who are being subsidized" and still get rebates.
But he also hinted broadly that jobs may be on the line, saying, "When you downsize government, you have to downsize people."
Beyond that, neither Mr. Haytaian nor either of the tax rollback bill's two major sponsors, Frank Catania of Hawthorne, the Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, and Assemblyman Jose F. Sosa of Passaic, provided any specifics about how the money would be made up through spending cuts.
"All I suggest to you is, be patient," Mr. Haytaian said. He has repeatedly emphasized that the Republicans would not "rush into major legislation like the Democrats did" in instituting large tax increases and major programs over the last two years while they were in the majority.
The Republicans say they expect to have the legislation for cutting the sales tax ready for the Governor by May. Governor Florio indicated in his State of the Union address that he was amenable to a tax rollback.
The Republicans battered the Democrats right up to election day for approving $2.8 billion in tax increases in 1990, and a number of them said the increases should be repealed in toto. But they veered sharply away from that position after taking control of the Legislature by veto-proof majorities.
 
Governor Pre-empted Moves
 The Republicans now contend that they never actually promised to do more than roll back the one-cent increase in the sales tax, although they still say they may do more. Estimates are that the one-cent increase would bring in $590 million in this fiscal year and $608 million, based on a predicted upswing in the economy, in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Finding ways to offset that much lost revenue will be difficult. For example, it would take the virtual elimination of the property-tax rebate program, which would yield $685 million. And making up the $608 million entirely through job cuts would mean laying off some 17,000 of the 65,000 people on the state payroll.
The revenue-replacement job is tougher because the Florio administration's $15.7-million budget proposal, unveiled last week, included revenue innovations the Republicans acknowledge they were also studying.
The proposed revision in the way pensions are financed for example, would put some $700 million in the new budget plus redirect another $341 million to school aid.
Mr. Haytaian acknowledged in an interview that the Republicans had been looking into such a pension revision. "We were, we had been looking at that," he said. "We knew it was being considered, and we had not completed our own figures" on exactly how much the pension change would realize.
Mr. Haytaian and Senator Donald T. DiFrancesco, the new President of the Senate, sent a letter to the state's 592 school superintendents last week, warning them that the latest school aid figures, which are based on an infusion of $341 million made possible through the pension revision, are "premature" and should not be relied upon because the pension proposal may be subject to revision in the Legislature.

HEADLINE: Ending the Unemployment Blues With Donations

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Many people have made gifts to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to celebrate birthdays, holidays and wedding anniversaries, but this year several donors marked the end of long periods of unemployment.
"A year ago I was out of work and crying all the time," began an anonymous letter with a $25 donation. "Christmas was horrible. I was actually out of work for 18 months and just began a wonderful job in November. Of course I am in debt, but I am grateful and I want to share my new found relief with others." 
 Kim Philips of Tuckahoe, N.Y., who gave $25, said the six months he was unemployed opened his eyes to poverty. "I was traveling through Manhattan for interviews at all times during the day and in many different neighborhoods," he wrote. "I was able to see the city in new ways and to see how many people need help. Fortunately I recently accepted a job I like a lot. I hope this will help someone who has not been as lucky as I have been."
 
'Many People Are Suffering'
 Contributors who have finally found a job said the economic storm had taught them that survival can be a precarious thing. "After a lengthy job search, recently I rejoined the ranks of the employed and consider myself very fortunate indeed in these very difficult economic times," wrote Elizabeth C. Segal of Tarrytown, N.Y., who gave $50. "I am certainly mindful of how many people are suffering in our society at this time."
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor, and disabled. The Times covers all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected can be passed on directly to seven charities.
The money provides many forms of relief including food for the hungry, homes for the homeless and clothing for those without. The seven charities also use the money to provide job training for the disabled, counseling for substance abusers and to support a wide array of AIDS-related programs.
Many people have contributed despite their own difficulties. "Whenever I feel a bout of self-pity coming on because something in my life hasn't worked out exactly as I would like or because I can't afford a vacation this year or something else equally insignificant, I think of the Neediest Cases," said a letter from Betty and Neil Lawrence of Manhattan, who gave $100. "We are blessed with a happy marriage, a lovely daughter who is about to graduate from college, a nice home, an abundance of food and clothing. We are grateful for all the blessings we have and wish we could share them with others who are so much less fortunate than we."

HEADLINE: American Express Plan To Get Cash

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Hoping to build up its financial cushion, the American Express Company announced yesterday that it planned to sell to the public a minority stake in its profitable information-services company.
American Express said it would sell up to 45 percent of its Information Services Corporation in an initial public offering. The company did not say how much the offering would raise, although analysts estimated it could be up to $800 million. 
 Analysts said the offering was intended to raise capital to funnel to American Express's travel-related services division. Profits were down sharply last year in the travel unit primarily because of recession-related losses from the Optima credit card operation. The company set aside $265 million in October to deal with defaults on Optima accounts.
 
Concentrating Resources
 "They want to concentrate their resources and capital on getting the problems squared away in the travel area," said Charles M. Vincent, an analyst wih Provident National Bank in Philadelphia. In 1991, profits in the travel division, the company's largest, dropped 59 percent, to $396 million, from $956 million in 1990.
The Information Services unit will be renamed the First Data Corporation. The unit processes Mastercard and Visa card transactions in the United States and Britain. In 1991, it handled more than 1.7 billion transactions for 700 financial institutions.
The unit earned $118 million last year, an increase of 15 percent from 1990. Its 1991 revenues were $995 million, a 20 percent increase from 1990.
James D. Robinson 3d, chairman and chief executive of American Express, said, "The public offering will raise substantial funds for American Express that will be available for general corporate purposes at a time when a strong capital base is especially important for financial services companies."
American Express stock rose $1.625 yesterday to close at $22.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"This is selling the silverware," said John Keefe, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Services. "They are not really starving for capital at this point, but they are probably getting a little hungry."
Mr. Keefe said the move would ease concern about American Express in the credit markets. In the fall, Moody's Investors Service downgraded its rating on American Express debt to A1, from Aa2.
"This is not a major portion of their business but it is growing rapidly," said Mr. Vincent, the analyst.
Last month, American Express executives said the company was exploring the sale of a stake in its Lehman Brothers investment banking arm.
 
Estimating a Price
 Analysts estimated that an information-processing company would sell for about 15 times earnings, which would value First Data at $1.77 billion. Based on that, selling a 45 percent stake would raise $800 million for American Express.
Most of the offering will be shares currently held by American Express. A small portion will be new shares issued by First Data.
Richard Schmidt, an analyst with the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said that in addition to providing more potential reserves for Optima, the proceeds could provide a cushion if more reserves were needed to cover bad real estate investments made by the company's Balcor unit.
"There are any number of areas where they may be called on to belly up to the bar with more resources," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
McGraw-Hill Profit Off 12%

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
McGraw-Hill Inc. yesterday reported lower earnings for the fourth quarter and year, largely because of a loss of advertising stemming from the weak economy.
 The company said net income in the fourth quarter fell 12 percent, to $45.4 million, or 93 cents a share, from $51.4 million, or $1.05 a share, a year earlier. Revenues edged up 1.8 percent, to $568.1 million from $558.1 million. 
 The New York-based company said continued weakness in advertising, construction and computer markets led to a 33.2 percent drop in profits before taxes and interest in the quarter in its information and publication services group, which includes Business Week magazine.
 In financial services, which includes the Standard & Poor's Corporation, operating profits jumped 13.3 percent in the quarter, in part because of expansion overseas and record issuance of new debt. S.& P. is one of the country's leading debt-rating agencies.
 Profits in educational and professional publishing slipped 24.2 percent. Broadcasting profits fell 38.1 percent in the quarter, the company said.
 For the year, McGraw-Hill's net slipped 14 percent, to $148.0 million, or $3.03 a share, from $172.5 million, or $3.53 a share. Revenues were essentially flat at $1.94 billion.

HEADLINE: An Introduction to the Joys of Biblio-Browsing

BYLINE: By ELEANOR BLAU

 BODY:
Exploring the shelves of a library with her fingers the other day, Karen Eisenstadt, who is blind, found a book in Braille that she had not known existed and that may help her in her work in an unemployment office.
The book was on a shelf of the new Andrew Heiskell Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped at 40 West 20th Street, and Ms. Eisenstadt was surprised not only at her find but also at the very act of discovery -- for she had never browsed before. Accustomed since childhood to the help of librarians, she had not experienced serendipity. 
 "I never thought of using the library that way," said Ms. Eisenstadt, who heads a citizens' committee that advised planners of the library.
The six-floor library, which opened in December, is the first public library in the country to offer a wide range of Braille, large-print and recorded books accessible to patrons on open shelves.
Braille and large-print signs guide readers through the stacks, and lighting is glare-free. The information desk is near the entrance, but is off to the left, so users can walk freely along the right, using the wall for guidance if necessary.
There are lounge chairs, tables and study carrels wired for audio playback equipment and for closed-circuit television magnifiers that enlarge print. A children's room has a stuffed lion, bear and panda, and a meeting room features a piano.
"It sort of puts you on a level with a sighted person," said Virginia Bass, who is blind and also a member of the citizens' advisory panel.
Louis Berkel, an assistant branch librarian, said that was the intention. "The idea is to make this function as closely as possible to a regular library," he said.
The library is open for walk-in use from 1 to 5 P.M. weekdays.
The library is so new, however, that walk-in use has not yet made a dent in statistics. About 85 percent of its material is still circulated by mail order, as it was at the site it replaces: a dilapidated library on Spring Street that never was envisioned as a place people could visit and use.
 
An Intricate Mail System
 To handle that volume -- mailing out 2,500 recorded and Braille books each day and processing incoming material -- the library has a complex, high-tech system adapted from industrial use and guided by computers. It is believed to be the most fully automated system in use by any library for the blind.
All six floors are joined by pneumatic vertical lifts and conveyors resembling airport baggage carriers. Tow lines recessed in the loading dock floor haul heavy bulk mail to a sorting desk. The mail is then placed in totes that go up spiral tracks to the third floor.
Revolving storage carousels -- like clothes racks in drycleaning establishments -- hold returned books, most of which have already been requested by other patrons. The computer compares requests with returns and then generates mailing labels for items to be reshipped.
The Andrew Heiskell Library, named for the former board chairman and current trustee of the New York Public Library, occupies the bottom half of a 12-story former warehouse built in 1910.
Renovated with $16 million appropriated by New York State, it is a sort of hybrid -- managed by the New York Public Library, yet part of a Library of Congress network of 53 regional libraries for the blind and physically handicapped. The library serves all of New York City and Long Island and gets most of its books and recordings from the Library of Congress.
 
A Fraction of Potential
 It also received private money, for an outdoor reading terrace on the second floor, for instance, and for some equipment and material.
The library has areas for volunteers to record books not available from the Library of Congress.
And there is a room for repairing the special listening machines that play cassettes and flexible disks for the blind. The library repairs not only its own machines but also those that are loaned to all eligible patrons for home use. The recordings are on non-commercial speeds to prevent their recreational use by people who do not need them.
The second floor is not yet open to the public, because of a lack of staff members.
Envisioning more staff members and longer hours in some happier economic time, Tara M. Phethean, a library spokeswoman, said the library now has 14,000 active patrons. The estimated potential number, she said, is 140,000.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKET;
Dollar Ends Session Mixed As Germans Reach Pay Pact

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against European currencies yesterday but rose against the Japanese yen as the market appeared to worry about the potential inflationary impact of a German wage settlement.
Gold prices rose overseas but fell in United States trading. Gold closed at $356.70 an ounce on the New York Commodity Exchange, down from $357.00 on Friday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $355.75, off $1.00. 
 Traders said the dollar had initially fallen on a report suggesting that the United States manufacturing economy continued to fall in January, but then the currency recovered.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index of business activity was unchanged at 47.4 percent. When the index registers under 50 percent, it indicates the manufacturing economy is declining.
Of more concern was the settlement of a German steelworkers contract that offered higher wages. The dollar initially rose against the mark on news a strike had been averted, but then fell as some traders grew concerned that the settlement could be inflationary if it set a pattern for other industries.
Inflationary concern could prompt the German central bank to keep interest rates at their current high levels, said Paul Yarden, a corporate currency dealer at Credit Suisse in New York. That could hurt the dollar since it makes investments in the mark more attractive.
In Europe, the dollar fetched 1.5975 German marks, down from 1.6070 late Friday. In New York, the dollar traded at 1.6000 marks, down from 1.6110 late Friday.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.13 yen, to a closing 125.65 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 125.60 yen. But in New York, the dollar closed at 126.20 yen, up from 125.75 late Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7995, from $1.7905 late Friday. The pound cost $1.7961 in New York, more expensive than $1.7870 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.4265 Swiss francs, down from 1.4333; 5.4525 French francs, down from 5.4870; 1202.00 Italian lire, down from 1,211.00, and 1.1753 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17475.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Dividend News Gets Better; Often Bad News for Stocks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Notwithstanding highly publicized actions by Bethlehem Steel and Westinghouse, the number of companies providing bad dividend news to shareholders is rapidly falling, an indication that the worst of the recession may be over.
At the same time, the number of companies announcing higher dividends is on the rise. Oddly, in the past, such increases in good news have often been followed by bad news on stock prices. 
 Figures released yesterday by the Standard & Poor's Corporation showed that only 11 companies stopped paying dividends in January, among them the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. That figure was down from 28 a year earlier and from 18 in December and was the lowest for any month since August 1989, well before the recession began.
There was also a drop in the number of companies cutting payouts to shareholders. There were just 11 such announcements, less than half the 24 companies that announced such moves in January 1990 and down from 16 in December. One of the January announcements was made by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which cut its dividend by almost half last week, citing losses from its financial services operation.
Similarly, the report showed that 124 companies announced dividend increases during the month, up from 112 a year earlier and 102 in December. That figure was the highest of any month since April 1990, also before the start of the recession, which officially began in July of that year.
It was the fourth month of the last five in which more companies raised dividends than in the month a year earlier, but those increases are coming off a depressed base, the period between the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the allied victory over Iraq. It was during that period that pessimism, among corporate managements as well as consumers, reached a peak.
While the number of companies providing good news is up, the overall level of dividends for the Standard & Poor's 500 has just began to budge. The current indicated level of dividends for the index, assuming an investor bought a portfolio of fractional shares for $408.79, the index level at the end of January, and assuming that all 500 companies make no changes in dividends, would be $12.16, the same as a month earlier but up 5 cents from the end of November. That would mean a dividend yield of 2.97 percent, a figure that is near the low end of the historical range.
That fact has been cited by some as a warning that the stock market could be vulnerable. But the market sometimes moves up rapidly for a time, even after reaching such a level. In 1987, the dividend return fell below 3 percent as early as February, but prices kept rising until August, by which time the return was down to 2.6 percent, the lowest in recent history.
Another indicator that could warn of trouble for stock prices is the dividend-dip indicator, which is based on comparisons of the number of companies raising payouts over a six-month period, compared with the period a year earlier. Historically, the stock market has tended to decline after the number of companies raising payouts begins to rise, and to rise when the number of companies increasing dividends is on the decline. Presumably, that reflects the fact that the stock market often moves as a leading indicator of economic conditions, while dividend actions are lagging indicators.
Over the last six months, 568 companies announced higher dividends, 12 more than in the period a year earlier. It was the first time the six-month comparison was positive since June 1989. A month later, the figure turned negative, providing a buy signal for stocks when the Dow Jones industrial average was at 2,660.66. That index ended January at 3,223.39, an increase of 21 percent.
The dividend-dip indicator has sometimes provided early sell signals. It turned negative in 1987 at the end of February, when the Dow was well below the peak it would eventually reach before the market crashed in October. For that reason, back-tracking the index indicates better performance for an investor who followed it only twice a year, at the end of June and December. But an investor who followed every move would also have substantially outperformed the market since the mid-1950's, the longest period for which comparable data are available.
Excluding dividend income, and excluding the interest that would be gained from investing in cash during the periods when an investor was out of the stock market, an investor who bought the stocks in the Dow industrials when the first buy signal was given at the end of August 1956, and followed each sign thereafter, would have seen a profit of 805 percent through the end of last month, compared with 541 percent for a buy-and-hold investor.
Using only the semiannual signals, and begining at the end of 1956, the comparable figures would be 1,081 percent for the dividend-dip follower, and 545 percent for the buy-and-hold investor.

HEADLINE: Pratt & Whitney's Comeback Bid

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST HARTFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
After losing much of the aircraft engine business to General Electric during the 1980's, Pratt & Whitney appears to be making a comeback.
Lackadaisical customer service, with erratic parts supplies, are only bad memories. Now, a leaner company has a head start in the contest to supply a new generation of wide-body aircraft with the most powerful airline engines ever built. 
 Sales to airlines are critical to Pratt & Whitney and to its corporate parent, the United Technologies Corporation, the nation's second-largest aerospace concern after the Boeing Company.
As military orders decline with the end of the cold war, and President Bush lays plans for further cuts, Pratt is expecting to lay off thousands of workers in central Connecticut. The jobs of thousands more depend on winning civilian orders.
Pratt's strategy is to match the General Electric Company's lower production costs through internal efficiencies and international alliances.
Pratt and G.E., with Rolls-Royce P.L.C. a distant third, are vying to power the large two-engine airliners that are emerging as the dominant type. Some analysts estimate that engine sales could total $20 billion over the decade.
Officials of Pratt & Whitney, the largest single division of United Technologies, are hoping that the new PW4000 series will become the best-selling high-powered engines.
United Airlines, the initial customer for the new Boeing 777 wide body, chose them over the offerings of G.E. and Rolls-Royce to power a fleet of planes scheduled to fly in 1995. All Nippon Airways, formerly a G.E. customer, also chose the PW4000 for its fleet of 777's.
Last year, Pratt officials said they won 39 percent of the firm orders for engines on wide-body aircraft, compared with 49 percent for G.E. and 12 percent for Rolls-Royce. G.E. said that Pratt's accounting was close to its own.
Layoffs and plant closings, Pratt says, are part of an effort to become as efficient as G.E. "We estimate that G.E. has had a 5 to 10 percent cost advantage over Pratt," Arthur E. Wegner, an executive vice president of United Technologies, told analysts last month. He said the company's goal was to become the low-cost producer by 1994.
 
Forging International Alliances
 Pratt & Whitney is also emulating G.E. by forging international alliances to spread the cost and risk of developing new engines. G.E. has parceled out 45 percent of its new engine project to French and Japanese companies.
United Technologies' chairman, Robert F. Daniell, said that last year's deal to develop jet engines jointly with a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany exemplified Pratt's direction. Since airplane and engine sales are politically influenced in many parts of the world, links to local companies give a supplier insider status and also help reduce outlays.
The new engines -- capable of developing more than 90,000 pounds of thrust, compared with about 40,000 for engines on a 757 -- reflect changes in the airline business.
Although the recession has reduced air travel, airlines and aircraft suppliers are optimistic about the longer-term trend. Because few new airports are being built, airlines are buying bigger airplanes, to put more passengers on each available flight.
The Boeing 777 embodies the airlines' thinking. In an all-economy configuration, it can carry more than 400 passengers, second only to the huge 747 in capacity. Both Boeing and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, are discussing the possibility of building even larger planes, carrying 600 passengers or more, to fly early in the next century.
Meanwhile, the number of engines per airplane is shrinking. The Boeing 747 has four, the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 has three, but the 777 will have only two, despite being designed with enough range to cross oceans.
 
A Future for Twin Engines
 "The future is with twins," said Selwyn D. Berson, president of Pratt & Whitney's commercial engine business. Twin-engine airplanes consume less fuel and require less maintenance than those with three or four engines. These are important cost considerations for airlines in an era of deregulation.
The airlines are also confident that the big twin engines are highly reliable, since they will be seeking certification from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly over oceans, with a safe landing place up to three hours away.
Boeing's most recent models, the 757 and 767, also have only two engines, as does the forthcoming Airbus A330.
Since airlines like to use just one brand of engine, so as to reduce parts inventories and the complexity of maintenance, winning an airline's initial order on new airplanes like the 777 assures an engine maker of orders for more engines when new airplanes are purchased.
 
Pratt's Lead Over Rivals
 G.E. has won only one 777 order, with British Airways P.L.C. G.E. has faced criticism for paying a high price to buy the airline's maintenance operation at about the same time that the order was placed, to take the order away from Rolls-Royce, British Air's traditional supplier.
Rolls has won only one 777 competition, a small order from Thai Airways. Over all, Pratt officials say they have won 55 percent of the competitions for large engines since the PW4000 first went into service in 1987.
Pratt & Whitney and General Electric are using sharply different strategies for the big new engines. Pratt is increasing the power of its existing PW4000 line, while G.E. is developing an entirely new engine it calls the GE90. Each is the most powerful civilian engine its company has ever produced.
Pratt officials say their new engine is based on a design that has proved itself by flying millions of miles, assuring its reliability. "We are the lowest-risk engine," Mr. Berson said.
General Electric says it is looking to the future with its new design, which will be capable of greater power than Pratt's. Boeing already has plans for stretch and extended-range versions of the 777 that will require more thrust. The proposed superjets -- Boeing has been showing Asian airlines a 747 with a full upper deck -- would probably require greater power, as well.
"We are designing the engine for up to 95,000 pounds of thrust," said Ronald E. Welsch, general manager of the GE90 project. The company plans to win F.A.A. certification to operate the engine at 87,400 pounds, then tune it down to 75,000 pounds for early versions of the 777. He added that the ability easily to increase power gave airlines more flexibility in choosing aircraft.
Analysts said the Pratt & Whitney engine might be better suited to smaller aircraft flying shorter routes, and the GE90 for larger aircraft on longer routes.
 
New Fans Have Huge Diameter
 "When you get 90,000 pounds of thrust and beyond, G.E. will probably have the advantage" in efficiency, said Paul H. Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential Research.
More power means bigger in the jet engine business. The fan in front of the PW4000 for the 777 will have a diameter of 112 inches. The GE90 fan will measure 123 inches, more than 10 feet, in diameter. Boeing officials say the cylindrical housings holding the engines on the 777's wings will be wider than the entire body of the 727.
More powerful versions of the Pratt & Whitney engine would use a fan more than 140 inches in diameter, and G.E. also plans to use wider fans in the enhanced version of its engine.
 
Strategies for Cutting Weight
 The enormous size of the fans has forced both companies to push their technology to hold down weight. Pratt & Whitney is sticking with metal but is hollowing out its titanium blades 60 percent. G.E. has decided to switch to a composite of graphite fiber and epoxy plastic.
Rolls-Royce's experiments with a composite fan almost put the company out of business in the early 1970's, when the blades failed to survive hits by birds. Mr. Welsch said that materials had improved strikingly in the last 20 years and that computer technology now enabled more precise analysis than was possible 20 years ago.
But Marnix A. J. Hoogewerff, an engineering manager at Pratt & Whitney, said his company had chosen a more sensible course. "We do not think there is enough weight advantage with composite fan to overcome the risk," he said. "We can come within a hair of the weight using metal."

Insecurities In the Ranks Of Managers

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
THESE days middle managers with jobs worry about how secure their positions are. Those without jobs wonder not only how long they must search for new ones but also how much security they will have once they find a new one.
Jerome M. Rosow, who heads the Work In America Institute Inc., a research organization, based in Scarsdale, N.Y., thinks such managers may not have to worry much in the future. He says the pendulum that has swung away from job security for middle managers will swing back again. 
 "It will take a while longer, perhaps until the year 2000," he said in an interview last week. He noted that a few leading companies like Pfizer, Merck and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing had kept the idea of job security for managers as a principle.
Mr. Rosow deplored the trend of layoffs of managers, pointing to the effect on morale and productivity at a time when global competition demands more of both. As a result, he said that even now he was urging companies to reconsider their approach and to instill a sense of more job security among their work force, especially among the managers.
His institute regularly holds productivity forums for leading companies in the industrial and service areas, like General Electric, Miller Brewing and American Express; for big labor unions, like the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, and for governmental units like the Department of Defense, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York City and New York State's Department of Labor. Until the mid-1980's these companies and institutions tended to be committed to not reducing staffs through layoffs -- an unwritten social contract understood by the managers of those days.
"Then it all fell apart starting in 1984," Mr. Rosow said. "It's amazing how fast the situation changes. I think it was poor management. American managers must take a harder look in the mirror and not look for scapegoats. It was a matter of a long-term social contract with workers and managers collapsing."
"The loss of the social contract has profound effects on more than two million managers and professionals who lost jobs during the 1970's and 1980's." Mr. Rossow said, stressing that the threat diminishes both the financial and emotional security of the managers and their familes.
He calls for a resumption of the practice of providing assistance for managers who do a good job but are involuntarily displaced through no fault of their own. Such corporate help might involve placement in another part of the company, or outplacement services paid for by the company -- the help of a professional firm dedicated to assisting the displaced manager with resume writing, psychological support, office space with secretaries and telephones.
There should also be adequate bridging money, which Mr. Rosow describes as "maintenance of income and benefits, and dignity during the transition to the next job." A few companies like Polaroid have maintained this policy despite its large numbers of layoffs in recent years, but many others that once had generous policies have changed or eliminated them as the number of managers dismissed increased sharply.
But there has recently been some good news for middle managers and top managers. The Association of Executive Search Consultants Inc. reports that "maybe the end is in sight" for the recession and poor hiring opportunities. It said last week that statistics compiled for the fourth quarter of 1991 indicated a 15 percent gain over the third quarter of 1991 and a 10 percent gain in searches for managers compared with the final quarter of 1990.
This appears to indicate "the beginning of the long-awaited economic turnaround," the association said. Its members include more than 100 management recruiting firms that specialize in finding managers for jobs paying more than $60,000 yearly.

HEADLINE: RJR Reports Profits for Quarter and Year

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
The RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation said yesterday that it earned $161 million, or 14 cents a share, for the fourth quarter of 1991, compared with a loss of $13 million for the comparable period in 1990. It also reported a profit for 1991, its first full-year profit since the company was acquired in a leveraged buyout in 1987.
For the year, the company earned $368 million, or 22 cents a share, compared with a $429 million loss in 1990. That difference was largely the result of lower interest payments. It paid $2.1 billion in interest in 1991, compared with $3 billion a year earlier. 
 During the year, the company paid off $4.3 billion, leaving a still-hefty debt of $14.4 billion from the buyout, the largest in United States history, which left it $29.1 billion in debt.
For the fourth quarter, RJR's sales were $3.98 billion, up 7.9 percent from $3.69 billion a year earlier.
For the year, sales were up 7.9 percent, to $14.99 billion, from $13.88 billion in 1990. Operating income rose 3.9 percent, to $2.93 billion from $2.82 billion.
Saying 1991 "really was a milestone year" for the company, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., RJR's chairman and chief executive, declared, "We put the LBO behind us several years ahead of schedule."
The company's share price rose 25 cents, to $10.50, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Two of RJR's three main businesses performed well during the fourth quarter, food and international tobacco, while the third main business, United States tobacco, declined.
Overseas, sales of tobacco rose 12 percent in the quarter, and operating profits were up 10 percent, because of gains in Europe and the Middle East. Operating profits of the domestic tobacco business fell 11 percent.
Over all, tobacco sales were up 6.8 percent for the quarter, to $2.20 billion from $2.06 billion.
 
Declines for Winston and Salem
 "Winston and Salem have been losing a lot of market share" to bargain brands, said Ronald B. Morrow, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. In addition, Philip Morris's Marlboro brand gained share last year.
Food sales in the fourth quarter were $1.78 billion, up 9.2 percent, from $1.63 billion for the quarter in 1990. Operating profits rose 11 percent in the quarter for the food group.
The company also took advantage of lower interest rates to refinance some of its debt in 1991.

HEADLINE: Neanderthals: Dead End or Ancestor?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
EVER since Neanderthals were discovered nearly a century and a half ago, they have been seen as something less than fully human. Their bones suggest that they were beetle-browed, squat, thick-boned, heavily muscled and incredibly strong, with short forearms and shinbones, a face pulled so far forward that the chin disappears, a side-to-side gait and a grip that might break a person's fingers.
But anthropologists now believe that Neanderthals closely approached the earliest modern humans in intellect and level of culture, and in some regions may even have equaled them.
Were Neanderthals our ancestors or an evolutionary dead end? 
 Debate is flaring once more over the relationship between modern humans and Neanderthals in the period between 200,000 and 35,000 years ago, when the Neanderthals lived. One school of thought, led by Dr. Christopher B. Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London, holds that Neanderthals were driven to extinction and replaced by modern humans who originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago. Another school, led by Dr. Milford Wolpoff of the University of Michigan, argues that modern humans evolved from Neanderthals in Europe and from other archaic species of Homo sapiens in other parts of the Old World.
Everyone agrees that the earliest ancestors of both Neanderthals and modern humans appeared in Africa at least 5 million years ago. Eventually they evolved into a pre-human creature called Homo erectus, which migrated out of Africa into the rest of the Old World. Separate populations of Homo erectus then evolved in different places into the various archaic versions of Homo sapiens, including the Neanderthals of Europe. The argument over Neanderthals' relationship to modern humans is about what happened after that.
Some of the latest evidence bearing on the debate is to be examined at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago this Saturday.
In Dr. Stringer's view, anatomically modern humans evolved from an archaic form of Homo sapiens in Africa and then, about 100,000 years ago, swept out of Africa to colonize Europe, Asia and eventually the rest of the world. There was little or no interbreeding between the moderns and archaic forms of Homo sapiens like the Neanderthals, in his view.
But the takeover by the modern humans was probably not a conquest or genocide. "There was no holocaust," said Dr. Stringer."It would have been an economic competition" for food and other resources, "one in which the Neanderthals gradually lost out." The replacement took thousands of years, he says, because the Neanderthals and moderns were so closely matched intellectually and culturally; otherwise, it would have happened much more rapidly.
Dr. Wolpoff, on the other hand, says Neanderthals were ancestors of modern Europeans, although the evolving Europeans of that era may have interbred with their counterparts in other regions. Dr. Wolpoff and those who support him cite archeological evidence from central Europe that, they say, shows that the earliest modern humans there had some clearly Neanderthal features.
Furthermore, says the Wolpoff school, the evolution of modern humans was more complicated than Dr. Stringer would have it, taking different paths and twists in different parts of the Old World. In Israel, they say, where Neanderthals overlapped with early moderns for about 50,000 years, the two populations were intellectual and cultural equals. "Their behavior was the same," said Dr. Wolpoff. "If you saw this any other time you'd say these were two races in contact" rather than separate species.
Scientists have been arguing about Neanderthals since the discovery of a partial skull in a cave in the Neander Valley of Germany in 1856. The latest phase of the debate began in the mid-1980's, when genetic analysis suggested that modern humans first appeared in Africa and then spread out from there.
The genetic findings were based on an analysis of DNA contained in the mitochondria, tiny structures that generate energy for body cells and which are inherited, via the ovum, only through the female line. Using this technique to draw up a family tree of modern human populations, scientists at the University of California at Berkeley calculated that the earliest modern humans emerged from Africa about 200,000 years ago.
Dr. Stringer and others who believe Neanderthals were an evolutionary dead end say that the modern humans spread from Africa into the Near East, and thence to the rest of the world. The remains of early modern humans found in both Africa and Israel, about 100,000 years old, are "what I consider to be genuine modern humans," Dr. Stringer said. "If you look for modern humans in other parts of the world, there is no evidence until 40,000 years ago or less."
Last June, French scientists reported that a Neanderthal skeleton discovered near the village of Saint-Cesaire, north of Bordeaux, was about 36,000 years old. Dr. Stringer interprets this to mean that modern humans and Neanderthals must have coexisted in Europe for thousands of years.
 
Contribution Called 'Negligible'
 If there was any interbreeding between moderns and European Neanderthals, he says, it was insignificant. "The Neanderthal contribution to the evolution of modern people is negligible," he said.
Dr. Stringer says modern humans did not supplant Neanderthals by conquering or killing them, just that they had an edge in technological or demographic competition, even though the tools found at Saint-Cesaire suggest that later Neanderthals were almost as accomplished as moderns. "I believe the Neanderthals did lose out because they were inferior, but I don't see them as being massively inferior," said Dr. Stringer. "Otherwise, they would have lost out much sooner."
Ezra Zubrow, an anthropologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo, has calculated that a rise of even 2 percent in the mortality rate of Neanderthals, caused by disease, perhaps, or lack of food, could have led to their extinction in only 1,000 years, or 30 generations. The shape of the Neanderthals' upper respiratory tract, which evolved to aid nasal breathing in a cold, dry climate, may have predisposed them to serious respiratory infections, putting them at further disadvantage, says Dr. Jeffrey T. Laitman, an anthropologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. The Neanderthal larynx was higher than that of modern humans, Dr. Laitman believes, limiting the Neanderthals' ability to speak.
Dr. Stringer has written that Neanderthals were gradually displaced to environments where food supplies were less reliable and "where their dwindling numbers would have suffered greater attrition from the vagaries of fluctuating climates and food supplies, as well as disease," adding, "The Neanderthals probably went out with a whimper, not a bang."
 
Using Fossil Records
 Dr. Wolpoff and his colleagues argue that Dr. Stringer's ideas, however elegant, are contradicted by the fossil record. Abundant evidence from central Europe, they say, establishes that early modern humans still displayed many traits that are clearly Neanderthal in character, and therefore evolved from them. Many early modern skulls, for example, display a tell-tale bone near the place where the mandibular nerve enters the jaw. The bone is a well-established characteristic of Neanderthal skulls, says Dr. David Frayer, a physical anthropologist at the University of Kansas. Another marker seen in both is the space between the third molar and the jaw.
In addition, says Dr. Fred H. Smith of Northern Illinois University, the backs of most Neanderthal skulls look "as if a little bun were stuck there." Skulls of early modern humans found in Czechoslovakia also display this feature. But it is found in neither the Neanderthals nor the early moderns in Israel. "How did the earliest modern humans in Eastern Europe get it unless they got it from Neanderthals?" Dr. Smith said.
In the past, said Dr. Frayer, scientists have compared Neanderthals with modern skeletons no older than 100 to 300 years, concluding that there was a huge anatomical gap between Neanderthals and all modern humans. "We're going to be showing at the Chicago meeting that the gap isn't that great," he said.
Neanderthals and early moderns who coexisted in Israel, 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, are said to display an especially striking cultural similarity. "Their archeology is so identical, it's shocking," said Dr. Wolpoff. They made the same kinds of tools, using the same techniques. They hunted and butchered the same animals in the same way. They buried their dead in the same manner, with the same artifacts.
As for the European Neanderthals, Dr. Wolpoff suggests that they followed a separate evolutionary course from those of the Near East. They might have differed as, for instance, a modern Swede and a modern Iranian differ. And in fact, their skeletons, while clearly of the Neanderthal type, differ in some details from those of their European counterparts.
Dr. Wolpoff and his allies question the reliability of the mitochondrial DNA studies that bolster Dr. Stringer's ideas. Some critics say that the DNA analysis assumes that evolution takes place in the minumum number of steps possible, but that there is no reason to believe it actually operates so tidily and efficiently. The exodus of modern humans from Africa may have occurred far earlier, in their view, than the DNA analysis implies.
A number of anthropologists believe the truth may lie somewhere between the two schools of thought. Dr. Smith, for one, believes that although modern Europeans evolved in large measure from Neanderthals, other early moderns from elsewhere, including Africa, probably moved into Europe and interbred with the evolving Europeans.
Why were the Neanderthals in Europe for so long, only to fade out? Dr. Smith proposes what he calls "a possible scenario."
Neanderthals' physical characteristics, he suggests, enabled them to adapt well to the cold of ice-age Europe. The most recent ice age lasted from about 120,000 to about 18,000 years ago, when the ice sheets began a gradual withdrawal. The Neanderthals had large babies, and size helps babies survive cold better. From an adaptation standpoint, the other physical characteristics of Neanderthals may have been secondary.
During a warm interlude in the last Ice Age, Dr. Smith's scenario continues, early modern people from elsewere, lacking the Neanderthals' physical adaptation to cold, drifted into Europe and interbred with its Neanderthal population. The Ice Age reasserted itself for a time, but by then the surviving popluation had developed better clothing, more efficient fires and better houses to withstand the cold.
A robust body adapted to cold became less important and even a liability because it required more energy. As the generations passed, the human population lost its Neanderthal features under the culling of natural selection.
But while the Neanderthal physical type disappeared, Dr. Smith says, the breed "did not go extinct in the classical sense." Rather, he said, Neanderthal genes live on today in Europeans and those who, like most Americans, trace their lineage to Europe.

 Neanderthals' stone tools remained unchanged for thousands of years, like typical point above. Tools of early moderns in Europe were more specialized, like those below from southwest France and nearby areas in Spain, contributing to theory that more advanced moderns soon bested Neanderthals in competition for resources. This theory holds that early moderns were able to dominate critical advantages of valleys -- water, shelter, edible plants and game -- and eventually to expel Neanderthals from these hospitable territories to harsher high altitudes with fewer supplies. However, some early modern skeletons have some Neanderthal features, lending support to a rival theory that Neanderthals were ancestors of present-day peoples; Neanderthal tool-Mousterian point

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Vincent Facing a Week of Critical Decisions

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

 BODY:
The furies have continued without a let-up through Fay Vincent's tenure as the commissioner of major league baseball. Debates have extended long after his decisions about whether to resume the 1989 World Series after an earthquake, whether to ban the Yankees' owner, George Steinbrenner, and what role to play in the 1990 player lockout.
But never before has Vincent faced a week like this one, in which he returns from a 10-day vacation to confront the dramas of the potential sale of the Seattle Mariners to Japanese interests, of the Yankees and Steinbrenner and Daniel McCarthy, and of baseball's never-ending economic angst. 
 Many of his fellow players on baseball's turbulent stage have labeled the week ahead for Vincent and baseball very important, very sensitive and crucial.
"I think it's all piling up at once. Maybe that's the reason Fay took a vacation, to get prepared for it," Haywood Sullivan, general partner of the Boston Red Sox, said with a wry laugh. "Seriously, though, even though it's the business of baseball, it's not the normal business of baseball. And it is going to be one heck of a busy week."
No one knows that better than Vincent. Asked whether he feels beseiged and beleaguered as he returns from a vacation in Jamaica, Vincent concedes that he's closer to that point than what he would like.
"There's a lot going on -- Seattle, some other difficult issues, not all of them visible," Vincent said. "It's a full-time job. But I have no complaints. I think that it's just more difficult and intense than even I thought."
Today, Vincent will make his first official appearance since Jan. 23, when he restated what he said was baseball's policy against selling franchises to off-shore interests in response to the news that a group primarily financed by Nintendo of Japan wanted to buy the Mariners.
Vincent is scheduled to meet with the Governor of Washington, the Mayor of Seattle, plus civic and business leaders from the Pacific Northwest who are concerned about keeping the Mariners in Seattle. Sure to be addressed is that group's concern about a baseball policy that could harpoon the one offer put forth that could prevent the flight of the Mariners to Florida or elsewhere.
On Wednesday, Vincent will meet with the owners' executive committee, an advisory group. "Economic issues are a top priority," said Bud Selig, president of the Milwaukee Brewers and a member of both the ownership and the executive committees. "But Seattle will be discussed, too."
On Thursday, Vincent will settle back into an issue that grips New Yorkers as he meets with McCarthy, the man trying to secure from both Vincent and the major league owners approval of his appointment as the Yankees' general partner. Then it's on to the ownership committee and back to the Seattle conundrum that same day.
Seattle will dominate as the ownership committee, which consists of the two league presidents and four owners from each league, wrestles with what is now a formal bid of $100 million placed on the table by Nintendo and its Seattle partners.
"There are going to be a myriad of questions," said an American League owner who sits on the committee and declined to be identified. "And the issues are real, the local ownership question is real. I have always believed that the more local ownership you have, the better off you're going to be. Does this group fit the bill? Give us time to see."
"No prior transfer that I can think of has attracted so much attention," said Jerry Reinsdorf, the owner of the Chicago White Sox and a member of the committee.
Why? The Seattle issue comes with all kinds of baggage, including charges of xenophobia to not-so-subtle threats that baseball could risk losing its Federal antitrust exemptions if it causes the Mariners to seek buyers in other states.
 
'Difficult Issue'
 "Seattle has been a very difficult issue for the better part of a year, but now it's interlaced with the international issue," Vincent said. "I saw it coming. That's why about a year ago I asked Eli Jacobs and Walter Haas, owners who knew something about international business, who had international dealings, to look at it."
Jacobs is the owner of the Orioles and Haas is the owner of the Athletics.
"I wanted the ownership to have a clear point of view," Vincent said. "And they did develop a clear point of view, which was that they didn't want any participation outside of North America. That was their point of view and it still is as far as I know."
Could Vincent have reacted differently? He could have vetoed the bid, remained silent or blessed the Japanese for their interest. He said, however, that the whole issue would have to be more thoroughly discussed by owners.
"What he said was a reaction and I believe he got out in front too fast," said a lawyer familiar with the commissioner and baseball operations.
Vincent said he doesn't have second thoughts. "I don't think that you can manage these things," he said. "I mean, when the question comes up, there is a policy, there is a point of view that is never going to be 100 percent popular. On this issue, I think it was a no-win proposition for baseball. We were going to be killed one way or another."
 
Controversial Statements
 So Vincent spoke out on Jan. 23, having what he considered a consensus already. His statement set off the controversy and baseball has been labeled racist and exclusionary, not to mention a prime example of growing anti-Japan movement in America.
"I guess the timing couldn't have been worse, but I really don't know if the response could have been different," Steve Greenberg, the deputy commissioner, said. "Fay was not stating his personal view, but that of ownership based on where the owners were the last time they looked at the issue in the abstract."
Dealing in the abstract is history now, in light of the fact that Nintendo is willing to guarantee 60 percent of the $100 million bid.
Also, baseball's antitrust exemption is being called into question as is usually the case whenever baseball crosses swords with politicians. And there are politicians in this mix, mainly Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, and Tom Foley, the speaker of the House of Representatives, who hails from Washington.
 
Danger Points
 So Vincent must determine the danger points not only in the state of Washington, but also in the nation's capital. Just as important, Vincent must determine if owners, and their views, are different from what they previously stated. And the silence emanating from that group has been all but deafening.
"I think that once Fay came out with his statement, a lot of owners said, 'I don't have to say anything,' " the lawyer added. "Then, once they saw the flack start to develop, they chose not to say anything."
"I have my own views, but it's our position to let Fred Kuhlmann, chairman of the ownership committee, speak for us," said an American League owner, referring to the president of the St. Louis Cardinals. Kuhlmann will say only that he promises to reveal the final decision on Seattle.
Sullivan understands the reluctance of owners to speak. He also understands the nature of Vincent's job.
"And regardless of who sits in that office, whether it be Ueberrothh or Kuhn or Fay or Giammati, that is one tough position," Sullivan said. "It's just like being George Bush; somebody had got to have a finger pointed at him and most of the time it's none too complimentary. So I think it takes a real person, someone fortunately like Fay to say 'This is what I think should be done,' and be capable of standing up and letting people know that this is what he thinks is right. I think that's what is foremost on his mind right now."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Campaign's New Phase: Impress Voters, or Die

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 3

 BODY:
The Democrats are entering the Hobbesian phase of the New Hampshire primary campaign: It will be nasty, brutish and short. Then New Hampshire's voters begin their "winnowing" -- a bucolic word that fails to capture the rough process of deciding which campaigns will die here and which will roll on to warmer climes.
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts enters this phase in the happy position of doing better than expected. He has stubbornly held on to second place in the New Hampshire polls, behind Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and has made subtle political capital out of the obvious fact that with his mumbling, professorial presentation he will never be a slick media candidate. 
 Already, one can sense incipient guilt pangs in the press and pundit class, the nervous little twinge of fear that they overlooked the virtues of the unglamorous tortoise, once again.
Mr. Tsongas was at a breakfast with reporters in Washington today, busily trying to stoke those feelings. But as he gets his political moment, his second look, he still faces a basic question: Where does his campaign go after New Hampshire? Would a second-place finish here generate enough money and attention to carry him through the harrowing round of primaries that follows, particularly on March 10, Super Tuesday?
His campaign advisers say, with the stolid patience of the persistently underestimated, that he might just win New Hampshire. That may be what it takes. The contests that follow New Hampshire demand media, money and organization -- and perhaps favor the hares.
For weeks now, the designated hare in this race was Governor Clinton, who has the most money, the edge in the early polls, a cheering section among the commentators and the benefit of a primary calendar that gives heavy influence to his native South. He has clung to his position in the polls despite a two-week struggle with charges from a supermarket tabloid that he conducted a 12-year affair with a former cabaret singer.
Last weekend, he campaigned in Nashua and Manchester with the gusto of a man who believes he has dodged a bullet and now considers himself bulletproof.
Still, not everyone shares Mr. Clinton's euphoria about his political stock, post-Gennifer Flowers. The plain fact is he faces a critical test in New Hampshire. Only a strong showing is likely to allay the fear in his party of producing a wounded frontrunner. With a big win in New Hampshire, Mr. Clinton might scare off any late entries by big-name candidates who would have run if they had known the field would look this weak and scattered at the start of the February sweepstakes.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska is still trying to present himself as a Clinton alternative, but he has yet to take off in the polls; in fact, he may be wondering what he gained from his campaign shakeup of a month ago.
If any candidate could have profited by a longer campaign, it was Mr. Kerrey, who has yet to find a way to match his idiosyncratic but often compelling political style to the demands of a presidential campaign.
"He is a hard person to try to fit into the usual categories," said Harrison Hickman, his poll taker. "He is who he is, and he's trying to communicate that." The clock, however, can be brutal on a candidate still trying to connect at this stage of the game.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa is now running neck and neck with Mr. Kerrey in some recent polls here, after taking his economic populism, including images of closed and empty plants, onto television in campaign ads. Mr. Harkin is expected to handily win the Iowa caucuses next Monday. The Iowa bounce has created Presidential front-runners in the past, but since Mr. Harkin comes from Iowa, his bounce is likely to be minimal.
"Nobody's going to give us a break out of that," concedes his adviser, Donald R. Sweitzer.
Rather, the Harkin campaign is hoping for a good enough finish in New Hampshire to position the Iowa Senator as the Clinton alternative in the states to come, with the "underpinning," as Mr. Sweitzer put it, of supporters in organized labor.
The subtext: Mr. Harkin and Mr. Kerrey are vying for the same role coming out of New Hampshire.
That leaves former Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who is last in the New Hampshire polls but continues to mix it up in the debates, where he often torments his rivals. On Friday night, for example, he was the one who mentioned the allegations against Mr. Clinton in the closing minutes of the debate.
Mr. Brown, rarely accused of being a conventional politician, seems motivated by calculations other than the usual Presidential strategy.
All of these candidates will have their fates decided by an electorate that is angry, anxious and unpredictable. The next 14 days will be rough.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
Buchanan's Run Exposes Fissures in the Right

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 3

 BODY:
Whatever the outcome of the fight over the Republican nomination, Patrick J. Buchanan is exposing fault lines in the conservative movement at a time when the twin epoxies that bound conservatives -- Ronald Reagan and international communism -- have melted away.
As he campaigns in New Hampshire, Mr. Buchanan, a former White House speechwriter who is at times to the right of the two Presidents he served, has made clear that his goal is not only to unhorse President Bush as the titular head of the Republican Party, but also to change the direction of the conservative movement. 
 At a recent campaign stop in Littleton, N.H., Mr. Buchanan acknowleged the ideological fracturing among conservatives and argued that his campaign had become its focal point. "There is tremendous ferment in America, politically and ideologically," he told a gathering at the Littleton Elks Club. "The old conservative movement is breaking apart. Some of my friends are barely on speaking terms with each other; some aren't on speaking terms with me."
There is little doubt that many in the right wing of the Republican Party, especially those outside government, and not beholden to the Administration, yearned for a conservative besides David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi sympathizer, to challenge Mr. Bush. These conservatives view Mr. Bush as nothing short of a Judas who sold them out when he reneged on his pledge not to raise taxes and when he signed the civil rights bill.
 
Some Balk at Buchanan
 But by espousing positions on trade, immigration and the role of the United States in the world, views tinged with a kind of isolationism and protectionism that are anathema to many free-market and globalist conservatives, Mr. Buchanan is seen by some as an imperfect spear with which to impale the President.
"One has this almost irresistible urge to leap out of your chair and say, 'Pat, this guy deserves to be socked. Do it!' " said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. "But Pat's mission is not just to sock the President, but to change conservatism in a way I don't like."
For some conservatives, supporting Mr. Buchanan therefore seems like a Faustian bargain. Their long-shot hope is for the challenger to bloody Mr. Bush in New Hampshire so that the President withdraws from the fray or a more acceptable conservative like Pete DuPont, the former Delaware Governor or William J. Bennett, the former Education Secretary, is enticed to enter the race.
But if Mr. Buchanan embarrasses the President and no other conservative takes up the challenge, "then conservatives are stuck with either Buchanan or Bush," said Burton Yale Pines, vice president and director of research for the Heritage Foundation. "It is not a pleasant choice."
 
Worries on the Right
 Equally worrying to some conservatives is that a strong showing by Mr. Buchanan, while felling the President, also gives impetus to Mr. Buchanan's style of conservatism.
Mr. Keene said a debate had raged for a time in the Buchanan camp with some advisers urging the candidate to tone down some of his language to avoid being tagged as an isolationist or a protectionist. But Mr. Buchanan rejected that strategy, Mr. Keene said, saying voters should see the "whole package."
Officials with the Buchanan campaign deny there was an internal debate. But they say the candidate decided early that he would not modulate his views to increase his appeal to some conservatives.
At stops throughout New Hampshire Mr. Buchanan has bashed the Japanese for conducting what he terms "predatory trade policies," railed against the free-trade agreement being negotiated with Mexico, advocated possible United States withdrawal from multinational agencies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, criticized the invasion of Panama and the economic blockade of Haiti and said he was against extending $10 billion in housing loan guarantees to Israel.
 
Not Cowed by Labels
 He has refused to be cowed by the neo-isolationist or protectionist labels some have tried to pin on him and has asserted that the tough economic times and voter discontent will force conservatives who disagree with him to adopt similar positions.
The core of Mr. Buchanan's message is that with the end of the cold war the prevalent force in the world today is nationalism. He argues that with countries like Japan centering their policies on their own national economic interests, the United States would be foolish to adopt purely free-trade practices or surrender authority to multinational agencies.
Such themes are reminiscent of the conservative isolationism advocated in the 1940's and 1950's by Robert A. Taft, the Ohio Senator who fought Wendell Willkie and Dwight D. Eisenhower for leadership of the Republican Party. The rise of the Soviet Empire, however, caused Mr. Taft's brand of conservatism to be subordinated to the goal of defeating Communism.
 
Some See Anti-Semitism
 "With the decline of the cold war, the underlying strain of isolationism among conservatives is now feeling more freedom to express itself," said A. James Reichley, a former researcher at the Brookings Institution who wrote "Conservatives in an Age of Change.".
Some conservatives, especially neo-conservatives like Norman Podhoretz, editor of Commentary Magazine, are also troubled by what they see as anti-Semitism in some of Mr. Buchanan's statements about Israel and what he calls Jewish influence on United States policy in the Middle East. These conservatives see in Mr. Buchanan a re-emergence of the type of anti-Jewish attitudes that haunted much of the conservative movement for years and that figures like William F. Buckley have since the mid-1950's sought to expel from American conservatism.
Last month in a long essay on anti-Semitism that appeared in National Review, Mr. Buckley after reviewing remarks Mr. Buchanan made on television talk shows, in interviews and in his columns, wrote, "I find it impossible to defend Pat Buchanan against the charge that what he did and said during the period under examination amounted to anti-Semitism."
Still, Mr. Buckley said, Mr. Buchanan's alleged anti-Semitic outbursts were probably motivated by "an iconoclastic temperament," rather than bigotry. And in a recent issue of Human Events, a conservative weekly newspaper, Mr. Buckley said that if he lived in New Hampshire he would probably vote for the challenger.
But polls show that Mr. Buchanan's campaign has so far failed to ignite voters in New Hampshire despite the state's sorry economic condition. And the ambivalence of the right wing of the Republican Party toward Mr. Buchanan's insurgency is a marked contrast to support in 1976 for Mr. Reagan's challenge to Gerald Ford.
"This is not a division among Republicans like Taft versus Eisenhower or Dewey," Mr. Reichley said. "It's not a battle royal like it was in 1948 or 1952. Buchanan would like it to be, but what he has is a splinter group, rather than a large wing of the party."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Banking Troubleshooter Gets a Healthy Change

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Lawrence K. Fish, who presided over the death throes of the Bank of New England, is back in banking, this time as head of the Citizens Financial Group of Providence, R.I., one of the region's strongest banking companies.
"It will be quite a change," Mr. Fish said, noting that the old Bank of New England had "single troubled credits that were larger than all the bad loans at Citizens." Mr. Fish, 47, came to the Bank of New England in early 1990 as part of a rescue mission after losses on commercial real estate had brought the bank to its knees. 
 Mr. Fish spent 15 months at the Bank of New England selling assets and cutting staff in a futile effort to keep it in business before regulators forced its sale to the Fleet/Norstar Financial Group of Providence, R.I., last summer. Mr. Fish said his move to Citizens on April 1 would be "a chance for growing rather than shrinking and for making money rather than losing money."
The opportunity for Mr. Fish comes with the departure of Citizen's 60-year-old chief executive, George Graboys. Mr. Fish will join the bank as president and then take on Mr. Graboys's job when he leaves on Sept. 30 to start a new career as an educator and lawyer.
Mr. Graboys, who joined Citizens in 1969, avoided the pitfall of excessive lending for real estate, which felled many other New England banks, and guided Citizens through a series of acquisitions and internal growth that resulted in a company with $4 billion of assets, up from $800 million in 1981. He also managed the sale of Citizens in 1986 to the Royal Bank of Scotland for $440 million.
"I love my job, but now that I am 60, it is time to do other things while I am still healthy," Mr. Graboys said in an interview yesterday. At the top of his list of new ventures is an seminar on economics he is developing for high schools in the region. "There are students now who go through college without ever learning how to apply the theories of classical economics to practical situations," he said.
While Citizens is operating profitably and earned $8.9 million last year, Mr. Graboys said the New England economy remained depressed. "Consumers have still not regained confidence in the economy and the region," he said.
For banks burdened with large amounts of bad loans, the weak economy is a severe blow that makes it hard for them to outgrow their problems. Mr. Fish said he expected to take advantage of the situation by acquiring weaker or failed banks in Connecticut and Massachusetts to expand Citizens' existing network of 47 offices in Rhode Island and 4 in Massachusetts. Last year, Citizens bought the Rhode Island subsidiary of the Bank of New England.
Although Mr. Fish spent his career at larger financial institutions, and once ran the Tokyo office of the Bank of Boston, he is no stranger to managing branch networks specializing in consumer and small business accounts. He ran the branch system at the Bank of Boston in 1988 before briefly heading Columbia Savings and Loan in California.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
New Magazine Spurns Gloom

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
As the nation's economic woes linger, more marketers are pegging their advertising to financial and recession themes. In at least one instance, the potentially dolorous message is being leavened with humor.
Worth, a personal-finance magazine being introduced this week, is running a series of humorous television and radio commercials in large markets around the country. One spoofs consumers who think the best way to cope with economic dislocations is to clip cents-off coupons. Another mocks an old-fashioned financial expert who mouths platitudes like "Real estate is always your best investment." 
 W. Randall Jones, chief executive of Worth and its parent, Capital Publishing said the tongue-in-cheek approach "is not to make light of the fact that money, and protecting money, is a very serious subject." But, he added, "I want people to read the magazine, and people are tired of doom and gloom."
Welch & Nehlen Advertising Inc. in Garden City, L.I., created the radio spots. The television spots were created by the Sterling Partnership in Boston and Drury Design Dynamics in New York. Welch & Nehlen also created a trade advertising print campaign, which began this week.

HEADLINE: The Ideological War Over Health Care;
Conservatives Ignore History

BYLINE: By Paul Starr; Paul Starr is professor of sociology at Princeton and co-editor of The American Prospect, a quarterly.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
The response of conservatives to rising health care costs and the unraveling of private insurance has been a triumph of ideology over experience.
President Bush's new proposals for tax credits still ask Americans to fend for themselves in a health insurance market with staggering administrative inefficiencies and little capacity to bring costs under control. 
 Historically, conservatives have upheld experience, prudence and tradition, while the left has been devoted to theory. Since the French Revolution, conservatives have cautioned against utopianism, social engineering and bloated bureaucracies; the left, until recent years, has presented a vision of a new, untried society.
Today, on health care the sides are reversed. The right upholds a theory, the free market, which is not applied to health insurance anywhere in the West. Conservative thinkers issue theoretical designs for free market reform and managed competition (related but distinct ideas); when confronted with the record of market failure in health insurance and the disappointing results of market-oriented reforms, they often respond that the true market has yet to be tried, much as some on the left still say true socialism has yet to be tried.
In contrast, liberal critics of our health insurance system are resolutely factual, emphasizing that the U.S. has higher costs, lower coverage and greater dissatisfaction than do countries with national health insurance.
Ordinarily, Americans expect conservatives to support lower-cost alternatives in social policy and liberals to be generous to a fault. But America's high-cost health system finds defenders on the right, which has a tender regard for the insurance and health care industries. It is the liberals who favor the reforms that have enabled Germany and other Western European countries to keep their per capita health spending at half the U.S. level.
Political conflict in the U.S. is commonly said to be more pragmatic than in Europe. But from the earliest campaigns for universal health insurance here, the issue has evoked much sharper ideological differences. European conservatives often introduced national health insurance programs that U.S. conservatives have denounced as socialized medicine.
The debate in the U.S. has been more inflammatory, as proposals for universal insurance have been accused of alien and subversive origins. Such proposals first died in 1918 when they were labeled an insidious German idea. They died again in the 1930's and 1940's amid charges that they were Soviet-inspired. Lately, conservatives have condemned Canada's system as socialism that individualistic Americans could never accept, even though Canadian health care providers are private and Canadians choose freely among them.
Yet while conservative rhetoric counterposing socialism and free choice has remained unchanged, conservative ideas have been transformed. Conservatives once saw the right to choose any doctor as essential to all health plans; now, with health maintenance organizations, they consider that right expendable.
More ironically, many Americans find that the health system restricts their economic liberty in another way: they cannot exchange jobs, for fear of losing coverage of pre-existing medical conditions.
What is puzzling is that in other Western countries with national health insurance, health care is still overwhelmingly private and capitalism is alive and well. A U.S. national health plan that provided universal coverage, squeezed administrative overhead and contained health prices would help employers control costs and broadly benefit the economy.
A public program with options for H.M.O.'s, which liberals generally support, would provide more choice and better managed competition than individual employers can provide.
It is a pity Marxists were wrong about our politics. If capitalism's interests really governed our political life, conservatives would have lost the health insurance battle long ago.

HEADLINE: LAWMAKERS VOTE EXTRA ASSISTANCE FOR MANY JOBLESS

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Congress voted overwhelmingly today to extend unemployment benefits for two million jobless people for 13 more weeks, agreeing on an issue that inspired bitter debate much of last year. President Bush has promised to sign the bill quickly.
The quick and nearly simultaneous actions of the House and the Senate demonstrate that the White House and Congressional Republicans want to avoid being portrayed as insensitive to the needs of those who have been hard hit by the recession in an election year. 
 Last year Mr. Bush killed two versions of a similar bill, arguing that they would have unacceptably expanded the budget deficit. Under intense political pressure, Mr. Bush finally signed an extension of benefits in November.
For their part, the Democrats compromised by not pressing for a more costly, longer extension of benefits that Mr. Bush might have felt compelled to veto.
 
10 Republicans Vote No
 The House approved the measure by a vote of 404 to 8. The Senate followed suit, 94 to 2. All 10 negative votes were cast by Republicans.
By voting to spend an additional $2.7 billion on unemployment benefits, Congress added 13 weekly payments of $170 for workers in all states on top of the extended benefits enacted last November. That legislation provided payments of 13 or 20 weeks, depending on the unemployment rates of each state, but benefits in some states will begin to expire within the next two weeks.
The emergency payments will be available to people who have lost their jobs, cannot find work and have exhausted their 26 weeks of state-financed benefits by July 4. People exhausting those payments after July 4 would not be eligible for extra benefits.
 
At Least 52 Weeks' Benefits
 In all states, unemployed workers receive 26 weeks of state-financed jobless benefits. Last November Congress approved the 13 or 20 weeks of Federally financed payments. The vote today, another effort to help unemployed workers caught in the lingering recession, extends benefits for 13 more weeks.
Consequently, in most states, including New York, the jobless will be eligible for a the total of 52 weeks of benefits. In states where unemployment is highest, including Connecticut and New Jersey, the total will be 59 weeks of benefits -- longer than in any previous recession. The previous record was set in 1976, when some workers were paid up to 55 weeks.
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, said during the House debate that passage of the bill showsed "Congress and the Administration can work together in a timely fashion to respond to the problems of the country." But he added that the extension of benefits was merely an aspirin that "eases the symptoms but doesn't cure the illness," and that Congress now needed to work on the far more difficult task of passing a comprehensive economic growth package.
During a floor debate in the Senate that was long on oratory though short on disagreement, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, a Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, said: "The reasons for acting now to pass this legislation are clear. The unemployed need it, the state of the economy demands it, the Congress strongly supports it, and the President says he will sign it."
Judy Smith, a White House spokeswoman, said today: "We are delighted Congress acted so quickly. We are anxious to get the bill so we can get the benefits to those in need."
 
A Dissenting Voice
 One of the few dissenting voices was that of Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, who said: "For many, a vote for this bill is an easy one to cast. It won't be so easy when members are called upon to pay the piper and raise taxes on employment a few short months from now."
Tens of thousands of workers are already running out of benefits extended last year. By July, that number of people who will be eligible for the extra benefits will reach 2 million. About 8.9 million people are unemployed.
The Administration released a statement last week saying it strongly supported the extension of benefits after Representative Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, dropped a more generous proposal that would have cost $4.5 billion and not expired until October. Senate leaders last week did not commit themselves to the plan immediately, but Mr. Bentsen predicted that the measure would be approved.
 Like November's legislation, the new measure will be financed with accounting devices and not by new taxes or spending cuts. It is not clear where all the money will be found, although part of it would come from $500 million raised by obliging some companies to pay higher estimated tax payments sooner than originally scheduled.
The remaining $2.2 billion would come from savings that the Office of Management and Budget says were made by Congress last year by extending taxes in future years and by other financial devices.
The bill adopted in November was paid for by accelerated payment of unpaid student loans and faster payments of estimated tax by some high income taxpayers.
Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Long Island Democrat who was a leading sponsor of the legislation extending benefits last year, announced today he would soon propose a new bill to change the extended benefits program permanently by expanding eligibility and bolstering the financing of the unemployment benefits. "We need to act quickly to insure that jobless Americans have the safety net they deserve," he said on the floor.
 
Reflection on Suffering
 In the debates on the bill, members reflected on the suffering the unemployed. Not surprisingly, Democrats voiced the more pessimistic economic prognoses, and argued that more ambitious Federal programs were needed.
"The recovery seems as far away as ever," said Senator Bentsen. "Consumer purchases, corporate investment and industrial production are dropping. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators has just fallen for the second month in a row. Consumer confidence has declined steadily this winter to the lowest level in 12 years."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Seeking to Stem Dispute Over Proposals for the Homeless

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins moved yesterday to quiet feuding between members of his administration and of a mayoral commission on the homeless that has called for sweeping changes in New York City's shelter system.
In his first public comment on the commission's recommendations, the Mayor said he was open to all of its proposals, including rent subsidies for the homeless and creation of a new agency to manage programs for the homeless. 
 The Mayor called those ideas "intriguing" but made no promise to support them in a letter to the chairman of the commission, Andrew Cuomo, that was released yesterday. The Mayor seemed more enthusiastic about encouraging the use of nonprofit groups, rather than the city, to develop sites for shelters, saying this route "may well, as you suggest, make for a more effective approach."
 
Stakes Are High
 The spectacle of the Mayor's staff's bickering with the Mayor's commission over the last few days had threatened to detract from Mr. Dinkins's efforts to seize the initiative on homelessness. Several municipal officials, including Deputy Mayor Cesar A. Perales, greeted the commission's proposals last week with skepticism, a stance that incensed Mr. Cuomo and raised the possibility that efforts to reform the system would come to nothing.
The stakes in the debate are high. The intensity of the dispute reflects a struggle for power and money between the vast public bureaucracy and the private agencies that would benefit enormously if the Cuomo recommendations were adopted. The outcome will determine who controls the city's homeless system and the more than 20,000 homeless people who live in it, as well as more than $400 million that the city spends each year on the problem.
This comes at a time when the city's fiscal problems have prompted much discussion about scaling back the size of the city government and turning a variety of services over to private groups.
So far, Mr. Dinkins's attempts to reform the city's homeless system -- a promise in his election campaign -- have been largely frustrated. He wanted to close dangerous, drug-ridden armory shelters, but his plan for the city to build 24 small shelters providing intensive social services in middle-income neighborhoods led to a firestorm of opposition from residents. The commission agreed with the Mayor's contention that small shelters are better but advocated that nonprofit groups pick the sites. Communities that mistrust the city government are likelier to accept shelters run by nonprofit groups with good track records, the commission said. And drug treatment centers would probably not be in residential communities at all, but in commercial or mixed-use areas, or outside the city limits entirely, the report said.
A switch from city to private development of shelters might help break the political logjam that has paralyzed city leaders' stated preference for small shelters over big ones. City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, who promised to kill the Mayor's plan because it would "destroy neighborhoods," has praised the Cuomo commission's alternative.
 
'Mayor Is Very Open-Minded'
 While the Mayor made no promises to support the commission's recommendations, he said he would study the panel's full report when it is completed.
"The Mayor is very open minded and wants to heed the criticism and move in a constructive direction," said the First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel.
The brouhaha over the recommendations comes even before the 14-member commission has finished its full report, which was originally due on Jan. 31. The commission sent a synopsis of its recommendations to the Mayor on Friday. Mr. Dinkins extended the deadline for the full report to Feb. 28.
The report, which has not yet been released, criticized the policies of the last decade, saying they had cost "a remarkable $2 billion in government funds" and failed to address the problems of homelessness.
"There must be a recognition that radical, structural change of the system is necessary," the report stated. That can be accomplished, the report said, "without significantly increased spending."
Despite Mr. Dinkins's apparent efforts to rein in the criticism of the proposals within his own administration, some members of the Cuomo commission continued on the offensive. Mr. Cuomo and George McDonald, two of the four commission members who are drafting the final report, said yesterday that the city's Human Resources Administration bears much of the blame for the city's failed policies on the homeless.
A new city agency or public authority should take over the task, they said. It would be responsible for the shelter system now run by the Human Resources Administration, as well as for permanent housing for the homeless now provided through the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the commission report said.
 
Criticism of H.R.A.
 "The city is spending close to $20,000 a year for a cot in a miserable armory," said Mr. Cuomo, the son of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. "It's absurd. H.R.A. is responsible for the system. We're saying that has to change." Mr. Cuomo runs a nonprofit agency, HELP, that operates shelters for families.
Mr. McDonald, president of the Doe Fund, a nonprofit group that works with the homeless, described H.R.A. as a wasteful bureaucracy. "It doesn't help people," he said. "Just ask any homeless person."
Another commission member, Victor Kovner, who recently resigned as the city's corporation counsel and who frequently advises the Mayor on homeless issues, disputed the notion that the Human Resources Administration is to blame, though he said creation of a new agency merited study.
"This is a system Mayor Dinkins inherited," said Mr. Kovner, who is one of the four people drafting the commission's report. "It was not well designed from the beginning. That's not H.R.A.'s fault."
A spokeswoman for the agency, Sheila Jack, said agency officials would have no comment on the report until it is made public. The head of the agency, Barbara J. Sabol, served on the commission and opposed the creation of a new agency, commission members said.
Last week, Dinkins administration officials, including Mr. Perales, questioned whether the city should "create more bureaucracy" by setting up a new agency on homelessness, as well as proposals for rental vouchers and greater reliance on nonprofit groups.
Mr. Perales did not return calls yesterday. But Mr. Steisel pointedly noted that Mr. Perales had not read the commission's report when he commented on its recommendations. Mr. Steisel said the proposal for a new agency or authority to manage the homeless system should surprise no one.
"Despite some successes we've had, we need to take an overall look at the system," Mr. Steisel said.

HEADLINE: Bush Encounters the Supermarket, Amazed

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 4

 BODY:
As President Bush travels the country in search of re-election, he seems unable to escape a central problem: This career politician, who has lived the cloistered life of a top Washington bureaucrat for decades, is having trouble presenting himself to the electorate as a man in touch with middle-class life.
Today, for instance, he emerged from 11 years in Washington's choicest executive mansions to confront the modern supermarket. 
 Visiting the exhibition hall of the National Grocers Association convention here, Mr. Bush lingered at the mock-up of a checkout lane. He signed his name on an electronic pad used to detect check forgeries.
"If some guy came in and spelled George Bush differently, could you catch it?" the President asked. "Yes," he was told, and he shook his head in wonder.
Then he grabbed a quart of milk, a light bulb and a bag of candy and ran them over an electronic scanner. The look of wonder flickered across his face again as he saw the item and price registered on the cash register screen.
"This is for checking out?" asked Mr. Bush. "I just took a tour through the exhibits here," he told the grocers later. "Amazed by some of the technology."
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, assured reporters that he had seen the President in a grocery store. A year or so ago. In Kennebunkport.
Some grocery stores began using electornic scanners as early as 1976, and the devices have been in general use in American supermarkets for a decade.
Having sampled the ways of the American shopper, Mr. Bush tried to identify with the American bad mood.
He pounded a lectern and raised his voice. He accused "professional pessimists" in Congress of conducting class warfare by criticizing some of his programs as favoring the wealthy. He talked sarcastically about advisers who urged him to get "the right political ring" into his oratory and his policy proposals. And he told jokes.
Reminding the audience of his "love for sports," Mr. Bush added: "And this being an election year, my competitive juices are flowing more than ever. And so today I'm making an announcement that many of you have been expecting for a long time. I am officially declaring my entry into your best-bagger contest. Just one question -- paper or plastic?"
It was a clearly improved version of the promotional speeches the President has been making for his economic proposals, and it drew a wildly enthusiastic response from the grocers in Orlando.
But Mr. Bush could not seem to escape the impression that, with the Democratic field still in disarray and the economy still in recession, he was still running against himself.
 
Mom and Apple Pie
 Mr. Bush can raise cheers from his audience, as he did today, by attacking government regulators with a late 20th-century version of an old American saw. "Regulations may have stated aims as wholesome as Mom and the apple pie," he said. "But you know better than anyone that when regulators carry that regulation too far, there won't be any apple pie for Mom to buy."
And the President could also note with a tone of satisfaction that the grocers' convention included a seminar entitled "The Regulators Are Back." But he had to leave it there and not go into more detail, since the "regulators" mentioned are in his Administration, which resumed issuing regulations at an energetic pace after the deregulation frenzy of the Reagan years.
After drawing a distinctly unenthusiastic response from a crowd in Philadelphia last week, when he gave a professorial recitation of his economic proposals, Mr. Bush seemed determined to rouse his audience with exhortations today.
He urged his listeners to pepper their Congressional representatives during the Feb. 8-17 Congressional recess with demands that they pass his economic proposals by March 20, the deadline he set in his State of the Union Message last Tuesday.
Mr. Bush acknowledged that the nation had "run into some hard times," but told the grocers not to listen to "professional pessimists" who he said "tell us America has become weak and disabled -- that our economy has fallen and it can't get up."
"Well, that's plain bunk!"the President said, his voice rising and his fist pounding the lectern.
 
Focus on the Economy
 Mr. Bush focused his remarks almost entirely on the economy and other domestic issues, part of a campaign tactic of avoiding talk of foreign policy to avoid criticism that he spends too much time on diplomacy.
He did mention foreign affairs, drawing applause for his leadership in the Persian Gulf war. He also talked about his meeting with world leaders.
"I had a fascinating visit with Boris Yeltsin up at Camp David on Saturday," Mr. Bush said. "This man's got some tough reforms here. Got to stay with him. Got to help him make them work."
But the President quickly brought the talk back to politics, suggesting that Congressional Democrats are lagging behind even the Russians in moving into the new world. "Isn't it ironic that at the exact moment the world is turning to our values of more economic freedom and competition, some in the United States want to go just the opposite way," he said.

HEADLINE: Defining the New Plowshares Those Old Swords Will Make

SERIES: After the Cold War -- Fourth of six articles

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
On a narrow street near art galleries and boutiques, next door to an acupuncturist who trades in Chinese herbs, is an encouraging sign of how the nation's scientific best and brightest might redirect themselves now that the cold war is over.
It is the Prediction Company, a private spinoff of the Los Alamos laboratory, the birthplace of the atomic bomb high in the mountains near here. Computers and young men with ponytails dot the office. Company scientists, once on the Federal payroll, are now private entrepreneurs using world-class skills in chaos theory to predict the rise and fall of stocks and bonds.
 
Some Win, Some Hunker Down
 "We have something that wins," J. Doyne Farmer, 39 years old, a company founder and theoretical physicist, said with an easy smile, his computer screen alive with numbers. 
 But for every adventurer like Mr. Farmer, thousands of scientists and engineers in the military-industrial complex are hunkered down in their old jobs, fearful that shrinking budgets will cripple or end their careers. Others struggle to find constructive new roles for Federal research, like healing the environment or helping American industry compete with foreign rivals. Still others dream of turning back the clock to days of glory.
These wizards of the cold war are the greatest force of scientific and engineering talent ever assembled. Over the decades this army of government, academic and industry experts made the breakthroughs that gave the West its dazzling military edge.
Now, these experts suddenly have no clear mission. Thousands are already out of jobs. If these individuals cannot be redirected, if they can find no place to utilize their skills, some experts believe the country might be lost.
"They're critical to the country's fate," said Edward A. Knapp, a former director of the National Science Foundation who now heads the Santa Fe Institute, which backs interdisciplinary research.
"Being on the leading edge of technical change will continue to be essential to our well-being," he said. "These people can help keep us there. They're very important for meeting the new challenges to our security that are sure to arise in the future, be they military or commercial or intellectual."
Up the road, Colorado Springs is working hard to redirect its focus. The city is home to hundreds of high-technology companies that thrived on military contracts in the 1980's when billions of Pentagon dollars flowed into exotic research. Today, amid an economic slump and contractor layoffs, the city has received commitments for thousands of new civilian jobs from high-tech pioneers like Apple Computer and MCI Telecommunications.
But even specialists eager to meet the future can find themselves left behind as the effects of defense cuts are compounded by general economic malaise.
"It's going to get worse before it gets better," said Richard A. Ellis, director of manpower studies at the American Association of Engineering Societies. He said that about 100,000 engineers lost their jobs last year -- most perhaps because of military budget cuts -- and that the number of unemployed engineers was likely to rise.
"The real serious cuts," he noted, "are still coming down the pike."
 
Military Thesis
40 Years of Bombs And Missiles
 By some measures, the cold war was the best thing that ever happened to research. The explosion of money, talent and tools far exceeded anything in previous eras. Early in the century the Government cared little for science. But the Manhattan Project in World War II changed all that. Buoyed, some would say blinded, by nuclear success, the Government quickly grew into the largest patron of scientific research of all time, pouring money into any field that promised hope of gain over the Soviets.
Since 1955, the Government has spent more than $1 trillion on research and development of nuclear arms and other weaponry. According to the National Science Foundation, that represented 62 percent of all Federal research expenditures. In addition, untold dollars went into related efforts, like the civilian space program's $90 billion race with the Soviet Union to land men on the Moon.
An incalculable part of the price was that military research was often cut off from American society and many of its democratic values. The right of free speech was routinely waived in exchange for a security clearance. The secrecy was meant to bar the transfer of any possible advantage to the Soviets, and those accused of doing so could get the ultimate penalty: Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953 after being convicted of conspiracy to deliver secrets of the atomic bomb to Moscow.
 
From Stealth Bombers to Teflon
 Out of all this came the hydrogen bomb, laser weapons, spy satellites, intercontinental rockets, nuclear-powered ships and submarines, the neutron bomb, stealth warplanes and the precision armaments that helped win the Persian Gulf war.
So did Teflon, modern television, passenger jets, weather satellites, computer chips, microwave ovens -- the whole industries of aerospace, communications and electronics, now pillars of the economy.
Some of the innovative edge has already shifted to civilian areas. Starting in 1980, American industry surpassed the Federal Government as the nation's prime patron of science research and has kept that lead ever since.
Finally, with the end of the cold war, budgets for military research began to fall, killing some programs, curtailing others and creating a general sense of forboding in the military-industrial complex.
 
Civilian Antithesis
Setting New Goals In the Labs
 Today, the brightest lights in the military-industrial complex are often tempted to leave for challenges in commerce and industry, sometimes taking unclassified skills and technologies with them. Los Alamos veterans founded the Prediction Company here in Santa Fe in July. It now has nine employees.
While at Los Alamos, Mr. Farmer, the company's vice president for research, pioneered ways to predict chaotic phenomena like ice ages, sunspots and fluid turbulence. Now, he says, he and his colleagues are forecasting the moves of financial markets. Each day computer predictions are matched against market performance. No trades have yet been made, he said; the company hopes to do its first trading this spring.
Down the road in Albuquerque is another team of Los Alamos refugees, their tidy offices packed with complex electronic gear. Cell Robotics Inc. is pioneering "laser tweezers" that use beams of concentrated light to move tiny bits of biological material with great precision and near-perfect hygiene.
"Now we're flying," said Tudor N. Buican, inventor of the "tweezers" and the company's chief scientist, as he directed a light beam to lift a tiny particle one-fiftieth the diameter of a human hair.
With such control, he said, a sperm showing good vitality could be picked out to fertilize an egg. Or a natural killer cell could be set next to a tumor cell to fight cancer. The seven-person company, prototype unit in hand, expects to sell its first machine this year for about $25,000.
"It's been much more work than we've ever done before," Mr. Buican said. "But the independence, and the prospects opening in front of the company, are extremely attractive."
 
From Missiles to Satellites
 The shift to civilian work has been slower but still significant at aerospace companies.
The Lockheed Missiles and Space Company in Sunnyvale, Calif., built six generations of Navy missiles, including the Poseidon, the Trident 1 and the Trident 2, which can hurl aloft a dozen or more nuclear warheads.
Today, Lockheed is aiming at new civilian areas while nurturing its Pentagon ties. It has won more than $1 billion worth of work on NASA's space station, a laboratory in the sky for astronauts that is to fly in the late 1990's. It is also drawing up designs for Motorola's Iridium system of 77 satellites to relay signals from pocket phones around the globe.
Despite new business, Lockheed Missiles has had its share of layoffs and early retirements as military work has dwindled. Its cadre of engineers and scientists has shrunk steadily since 1987, going from 11,526 to 9,636 last year. The company expects to lose another 430 technical experts this year.
John N. McMahon, its president, recently told edgy employees that the company's past achievements and technical strengths readied it for projects "sufficiently diverse and numerous to provide a healthy future." But he gave no examples of new opportunities.
 
Shrinkage at M.I.T.
 On the opposite coast, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a bastion of arms research, is wrestling with the same kind of change. After years of explosive growth, Pentagon funds are shrinking, from $438 million in 1990 to $402 million in 1991.
Experts say the worst is yet to come for M.I.T., especially for its 2,700-person Lincoln Laboratory, created as a military brain bank in the late 1950's by both the university and the Air Force. Recently, the lab has perfected new kinds of space sensors and laser communicators. During the Persian Gulf war, its tiny experimental satellites eased congested communications for allied troops.
Today, Lincoln is eager to find new customers, including Government bodies other than the Pentagon. For the Federal Aviation Administration, for example, it is studying whether anti-collision systems on passenger jets create distractions for air traffic controllers.
Walter E. Morrow Jr., Lincoln's director, said the lab's survival strategy was to keep a core of military work while expanding its horizons as much as possible, including helping private companies eager to do battle with foreign competitors.
"Our work for others," he said, "is going up steadily."
 
Commercial Synthesis
New Partnerships For New Products
 The core of the military-industrial complex is a secretive maze of military research laboratories owned by the Federal Government, including such places as Los Alamos, which still has about 7,400 employees despite a slow exodus.
This maze is scattered across America, often hidden behind armed guards and barbed wire. And it is huge. The Defense Department has 66 labs that employ 60,000 and spend about $7 billion a year. The Energy Department has three labs for nuclear weapon design, including Los Alamos, that employ 24,000 and spend $4 billion a year.
In step with the times, Washington is pushing this complex to share its high-technology skills and tools with industry. The buzz words are technology transfer, and the means include liberalized patent licensing and new kinds of cooperative research with industry.
 
So Far, the Rewards Are Meager
 For instance, a metals consortium founded by the Energy Department has grown to include 13 companies trying to improve products like jet engines by incorporating new kinds of high-performance alloys. In all, the Energy Department has 44 agreements with industry for cooperative research and the Defense Department has 171.
Despite much hoopla, the Federal payoff from these programs has been slim. In 1990 the Government received only $9.4 million in royalties from all its commercial research ventures, a minuscule return on an investment of $70 billion. For 1991, preliminary estimates are that the return rose slightly, to between $10 million and $12 million. Federal officials vow that returns will rise farther, but the process can take years because royalties are often linked to sales volume.
But private experts voice doubts. Smart business executives, they say, shy away from substantial links to programs like these because the military complex has traditionally cared little about low cost, looking for high performance instead. The upshot, analysts say, is that military experts often have a loose attitude about cost control.
"It's hard to retool engineers who have been taught to be sloppy and wasteful," said Eric Arnett, an arms expert at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington.
 
Making It Work
The New Scene Still Out of Focus
 Even with Government contracts diminishing in number and size, the end of the cold war has in no way lessened calls for military readiness through advanced research. In some cases it has increased them. Some military experts see a host of potential new dangers on the horizon.
"Ominous threats are growing steadily in the third world," John S. Foster Jr., chairman of the Pentagon's Defense Science Board and a former director of the Lawrence Livermore weapons lab in California, said in a recent speech. Worry over the spread of ballistic missiles, fanned by Iraqi Scuds during the Persian Gulf war, has already increased Congressional interest in ground-based defenses similar to the Patriot interceptor.
Jacques S. Gansler, a former Pentagon procurement official, has long argued that in peacetime the Pentagon must expand research, not shrink it. "In time of reduced tensions," he said, "you need to increase your intelligence gathering so there are no surprises and increase your long-term investment so that if tensions rise, you're in a position to move."
 
Urging Break With the Past
 But an increasingly vocal group of analysts argues just the opposite, saying the military-industrial era is essentially over. Military threats, they say, have been eclipsed by economic ones. Besides, they add, any needed innovations for national defense should now come from the civilian sector, which has pulled ahead of the Pentagon.
They argue that most attempts to adapt cold-war research to the new era are doomed. What is needed, they say, is a clean break with the past and new Federal mechanisms to lower the price of peace.
These analysts applaud the growing displacement of scientists and engineers, saying the traumatic shift is planting seeds for whole new industries. But the Prediction Company and Cell Robotics notwithstanding, relatively few refugees from the arms complex have taken the entrepreneurial route.
Many analysts are less than sanguine about the odds of transforming the giant aerospace companies, saying most have been spoiled by big Pentagon budgets and are now unfit for the harsh world of free markets.
"The situation can be cured only by cutting defense budgets and redirecting national resources into broad industrial reinvigoration," Ann Markusen and Joel Yudken argue in "Dismantling the Cold War Economy," to be published in April by Basic Books.
Critics say the nation no longer needs three big centers for nuclear weapon design, or 66 Defense Department research labs, where endless red tape in hiring and procurement are often a recipe for poor performance.
But Congress, sensitive to pressure from millions of constituents and business leaders in the military complex, often fights shrinkage like this. One solution, experts say, is to cut wherever possible and throw open the rest of the cold-war complex to industry.
"These are critical resources," said Erich Bloch, past director of the National Science Foundation and a former executive at International Business Machines who now lobbies for Federal policies to enhance industrial vigor. "We're spending two-thirds of the Federal budget for research and development in this area. We have to get more out of it."

HEADLINE: Job Losses Were Undercounted

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The declining economy in 1991 may have eliminated nearly twice as many jobs as previously estimated, a Labor Department official said today.
The department's widely tracked survey of employers showed non-farm payroll jobs totaled 108.8 million in December, 782,000 fewer than a year earlier. But, Martin Zeigler, an assistant commissioner in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said revisions that would be incorporated into the survey by June would probably subtract an additional 650,000, for a total loss of 1.4 million jobs. 
 The expected revision of 650,000, first disclosed three months ago in Labor Department testimony to Congress's Joint Economic Committee, is roughly twice the size of the typical annual revision, he said.
Economists said the revision, would not change their view that the economy will recover this year. They noted that the changes were concentrated in the first three months of 1991, when the economy was at its weakest.

NEW YORK CITY
 
THE MAYOR WEIGHS IN
Mayor Dinkins moved to quiet feuding between members of his own administration and a mayoral commission on the homeless that has called for sweeping changes in the city's shelter system. In his first public comment on the commission's recommendations, the Mayor said he was open to all of its proposals, including rent subsidies for the homeless and the creation of a new agency to manage programs for the homeless. A1.
 
DEPUTY MAYOR TO RESIGN
Deputy Mayor Milton Mollen, who for two years oversaw New York City's vast criminal-justice programs and coordinated the Dinkins administration's anti-crime policies, will resign tomorrow or Friday to accept a private job, city officials said. He will be the highest ranking official to leave the Dinkins administration. B3.
 
MR. DINKINS GOES TO ALBANY
Mayor Dinkins went to Albany to lobby for approval of the local tax increases he has proposed in his budget and for a rejection of cuts in social-service programs proposed by Governor Cuomo. But as in previous trips to Albany, the Mayor was greeted by the harsh realities of the state's complex politics and fiscal plight. B3.

Revamping Takes a Toll On Kodak

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company today reported a loss for the fourth quarter of 1991 and full-year earnings of only $17 million because of close to $1 billion in restructuring charges.
Even without the charges, earnings slumped sharply, as the recession continued to slow film sales. Kodak announced the results after the close of the stock market; its shares rose 87.5 cents today, closing at $50.75 on the Big Board. 
 Kodak said it lost $400 million in the quarter, compared with a profit of $326 million, or $1.01 a share, in the 1990 quarter. The full-year profit, which was equal to 5 cents a share, was down 97.6 percent from earnings of $703 million, or $2.17 a share, in 1990.
Sales for the quarter were $5.16 billion, down slightly from $5.2 billion in the comparable 1990 period. For the year, sales were up 2.6 percent, to $19.65 billion from $19.15 billion.
 
More Retired Than Expected
 On Dec. 20, Kodak said it would take a $495 million charge primarily because more than twice as many employees as expected had enrolled in an early retirement program and to cover expenses for streamlining overseas film production and sell some businesses. The December announcement brought to $930 million the after-tax total of special charges the company took against 1991 earnings to reduce overhead and focus on its core photography business.
Without the restructuring charge, fourth-quarter earnings would have been $197 million, or 61 cents a share, down 40 percent from the similar period a year earlier. Earnings for 1991 would have been $1.05 billion, or $3.23 a share.
The 1990 results were reduced by a litigation judgment against Kodak in favor of the Polaroid Corporation. Without the judgment, Kodak's earnings for that year would have been $1.27 billion, or $3.91 a share.
Kodak's chief executive, Kay R. Whitmore, blamed the weak economy for the company's poor performance.
 
Recession Is Blamed
 "As if recession in the U.S. economy and a lackluster background for business in most of Europe were not enough to overcome, depression in the travel industry induced by the Mideast war continued throughout the year," Mr. Whitmore said.
"The fourth quarter was particularly difficult," he added, "as consumers restrained their spending and businesses put off purchases of office equipment."
Sales in Kodak's core imaging business -- which provides more than half the company's profits -- were down for the quarter and the year. Mr. Whitmore said sales in the company's information and chemical segments also fell short of targets in 1991.
Robert Maney, an industry analyst with Prudential Securities, said he did not believe that the film operations would be affected to such a degree. "Film used to be impervious to recession," he said. "It's just proven that it's not."
Mr. Whitmore said he did not expect to see significant improvements in the United States economy or in major European markets until the second half of 1992. Still, he said, the company expected to see higher sales and better earnings as a result of last year's restructuring.

HEADLINE: Aid Is Good, but Job Would Be Better

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Feb. 4

 BODY:
To people who have been out of work a long time, Congress's approval of 13 more weeks of unemployment benefits today was good news, but not nearly as good as a job.
"I think it's a good idea; it's needed," Ray Bradley, a computer salesman from Fairfield, said as he left the State Employment Security Division office here, where he had come to straighten out his eligibility for an initial 20 weeks of emergency benefits that Congress approved in November. 
 "But," he added, "I think the biggest thing we could do is take the income tax off unemployment. I've been out for a year, and I had to pay taxes."
If unemployment offices are rarely happy places, the mood in Connecticut's offices has soured badly in the last year, as people have taken longer and longer to find new jobs, whether blue-collar or white-collar.
"The whole tenor has changed in the last six to eight months," said Diane Krevolin, assistant manager of the unemployment compensation office here. "There's a pall over everyone."
Statewide, unemployment in November, the last month for which figures are available, was 6.9 percent, up from 2.5 percent in April 1988.
For the two-week period that ended Jan. 18, the Connecticut Labor Department reported 99,528 claims for unemployment benefits across the state. Of those people, 35,925, or 36 percent, had been out of work more than 26 weeks and so were eligible for the emergency benefits approved in November.
In Bridgeport, which had 9,352 claims during that period, 3,933, or 42 percent, were for the emergency extended benefits.
The numbers of claims are also up sharply, at their highest level since 1977, according to the Labor Department. Even though office hours have been extended, Ms. Krevolin said, on most days as many as 200 people are waiting in line outside when the doors open at 7:30 A.M.
Statewide, unemployment in November, the last month for which figures are available, was 6.9 percent, up from 2.5 percent in April 1988.
Those first emergency benefits will start expiring later this month, and so the additional 13 weeks approved today will carry people into May. While Mr. Bradley and others are glad to have the assistance, several people said that the benefits are only a help, not nearly a substitute for their former incomes, and that they are not encouraged about finding work soon.
"Basically, I've been overqualified for every job I've applied for," Mr. Bradley said, noting that he could not win even an interview until he deleted all dates from his resume, so as not to give away his age. He is 47 years old.
Frank Pope, who recently moved to Bridgeport from New Haven, has looked up and down southern Connecticut for work since the tire company where he worked shut down in October. He, too, is now receiving emergency benefits.
"To go out and try to find work in an economy like this is like trying to find a needle in a haystack," he said.
David Taft, a welder from Bridgeport who lost his job as a maintenance man at a private school in Southport in November 1990, said he had taken a train to Hartford on Monday to look for work. Like Mr. Bradley, he spent several months on his own, without benefits, before Congress extended the standard 26-week period.
Last November, with no income, he took a part-time job cleaning up for a welding shop, at $5 an hour. After a few weeks he quit.
"The thing is," Mr. Pope said, "you can find work, but you can't find work worth working for." On top of longer benefits, he said, "They could give us access to better jobs."

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans to Sharpen Focus Of Its Sanctions Against Haiti

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that it would modify its embargo against Haiti's military Government to punish anti-democratic forces and ease the plight of workers who lost jobs because of the ban on trade.
As the State Department announced that the Administration would be "fine tuning" its economic sanctions, efforts in Congress to grant "temporary protected status" to more than 10,000 Haitian exiles in custody at the United States Navy base at Guantanamo, Cuba, were running into serious problems in both the House and the Senate. This status would freeze the return of refugees until the end of the Haitian crisis. 
 Members of Congress, sharply divided on the issue of how to deal with an influx of refugees, cite bad economic times, an election year and, occasionally, fears of reported high rates of infection with the virus that causes AIDS among Haitian exiles for opposition to Congressional action.
 
'Time Is Just Not Right'
 "The time is just not right," said Arthur C. Helton, director of the refugee project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, one of many rights organizations, religious groups and prominent individuals protesting the resumption of forced return of Haitians on Saturday. Several hundred would-be refugees are being returned daily.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate subcommittee on immigration and refugee affairs, said today that he would introduce a bill to suspend forced returns for two weeks, until President Bush can certify that conditions in Haiti are safe. In the House, Representative Charles Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, has been leading the call for temporary protected status for Haitians.
The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said today that the Administration would be collecting evidence on alleged financiers of the Sept. 30 coup or backers of army and police violence so that any assets they held in the United States could be frozen. The deposed Haitian President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has been advocating this, asserting that while poor Haitians are suffering, rich and influential ones are drawing on American bank accounts.
Miss Tutwiler said today that Washington could also deny visas to these Haitians.
The Treasury Department would also grant licenses to American companies to resume assembling goods in Haiti for re-export, the State Department said. More than 40,000 Haitians have lost jobs in the assembly sector because of the embargo.
The State Department spokeswoman said she did not know when these new measures would be put into effect.
At the same time, new diplomatic initiatives are being taken by Washington and other nations in the region to persuade the wavering democratic forces in Haiti's Parliament and some cooperative officers in a split military hierarchy to unite as a matter of urgency behind a new Prime Minister, Rene Theodore, whose nomination is stalled in the legislature.
The decision to modify the United States embargo is the latest in a series of Administration moves that have been alternately tough or concessionary as Washington tries to stem the flow of Haitian refugees while looking for more effective ways to hasten the collapse what the Administration calls an illegal Government in Haiti. The Organization of American States enacted a similar embargo in October, freezing Haitian Government assets, but not those of individuals, and barring trade except for humanitarian aid.
For more than two months, the Administration sought to overturn injunctions against forced returns, and finally were successful in both the Supreme Court and a Federal district appeals court in Atlanta. Refugee and human rights groups as well as some members of Congress called this approach inhumane.
"It was not our finest hour," said Dennis Gallagher, executive director of the private Refugee Policy Group in Washington, after the return of refugees resumed on Saturday, hours after a Supreme Court decision in the Administration's favor.
 
Administration Hard-Liners
 Support for a tough line against would-be refugees came from the National Security Council and President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, according to human rights and refugee groups who are in touch with Administration officials.
But a few days earlier, the Administration announced that Haitians fearing persecution could apply in Haiti for refugee resettlement in the United States, bypassing a risky boat trip and an asylum hearing in Miami. People granted refugee status abroad arrive in the United States with legal status.
In addition, in recent weeks the Immigration and Naturalization Service interviewers at Guantanamo have allowed 3,445 people to proceed to the United States to lodge formal requests for asylum -- about a third of the 9,937 Haitians interviewed.
International and national rights organizations and some members of Congress believe that the United States is violating the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and a subsequent 1967 protocol that prohibits sending home refugees with fears of persecution.
Other members of Congress take the Administration's view that the expanded immigration interviewing, with its high rates of asylum candidates, indicates that the United States is going out of its way to take in people with good reasons not to return to Haiti.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
MCI Profits Up 13%, to $144 Million

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The MCI Communications Corporation said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 13 percent.
In light of the lingering recession, the gains at the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier were strong compared with the profit decline recently posted by A.T.& T., the industry leader. Earnings growth at U S Sprint, the No. 3 carrier, which is scheduled to report later this week, is also expected to be weak. 
 MCI reported that its fourth-quarter earnings rose to $144 million, or 52 cents a share, from $127 million, or 47 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Last month A.T.& T. said earnings in the fourth quarter had dropped more than 20 percent, to $635 million, or 48 cents a share. Quarterly revenue totaled $11.95 billion, up less than 1 percent. A.T.& T. cited the recession, growing competition and the sluggish performance of its new computer acquisition, the NCR Corporation.
 
Discount Plan Helped
 O. Gene Gabbard, MCI's chief financial officer, acknowledged that MCI, too, was being hurt by the recession but the damage was largely limited to small-business customers. MCI was helped mainly by additional customers attracted to the company by a new discount-calling plan.
But analysts said changes in bookkeeping also helped, such as a shift in depreciation policy that decreased quarterly operating expenses. "They basically decided that their plant and equipment was going to last longer than they had previously accounted for, thus reducing their costs by $5 million," said Robert B. Morris 3d, a telecommunications analyst for Goldman, Sachs.
Fourth-quarter revenue rose 8 percent, to $2.16 billion, from $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 1990.
MCI shares rose $1.625 each to close at $33.50 in over-the-counter trading yesterday.
For the full year, net income totaled $551 million, or $2.01 a share, up more than 84 percent from $299 million, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. Annual revenue totaled $8.43 billion, up 9.8 percent from $7.68 billion.
MCI benefited somewhat from sharply lower interest costs as well as a full year of profitable revenue from its acquisition of Telecom USA, which had 1989 revenue of $713 million and was the nation's fourth-largest long-distance carrier when MCI acquired it in August 1990.
In the fourth quarter alone, a better basis for comparison because Telecom USA revenue was included in both the 1990 and 1991 periods, revenue growth was only 8 percent, slightly off the full-year pace for 1991.
 
Building Market Share
 MCI said its "Friends & Family" discount calling program had increased its business substantially, with five million customers enrolled -- about two million of them joining in the fourth quarter alone. MCI says that about half of these customers were new. Under the program, customers are given 20 percent discounts, in effect for recruiting relatives and friends to become MCI customers, who in turn qualify for discounts.
But there are limits to how long MCI can afford to build market share this way, since each subscriber to the plan reduces the company's profitability. A.T.& T., with a majority of the residential market, could not duplicate the plan without cannibalizing its own profits.
MCI said it had gained nearly 1 percent of market share in 1991, but did not specify whether it was share of revenue or of the minutes-of-use measurement by which actual telephone traffic is counted. Goldman, Sachs estimates that MCI traffic grew only four-tenths of 1 percent. Mr. Morris said MCI's minutes of use totaled 56.1 billion, or 17 percent of the market, up from 51 billion minutes, or 16.6 percent, in 1990.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
After Bad Start, Bush Seems To Have Steadied Support

BYLINE: By R.(TM)W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Feb. 4

 BODY:
President Bush's political standing in New Hampshire has finally begun to stabilize, Republican leaders here say, but some of them describe the electoral situation as highly volatile and suggest that he could still be seriously damaged by Patrick J. Buchanan's insurgent candidacy in the state's Presidential primary two weeks from today.
Former State Attorney General Tom Rath, who is considered one of New Hampshire's ablest Republican strategists, said that "the bleeding has been stopped" after a dangerously slow start by Mr. Bush. But he warned, "The electorate is not as settled as it should be at this stage from the President's point of view." 
 Having emphasized most of last month that the President cared about the recession in New Hampshire, the Bush campaign's current tactic is to blame higher taxes and other economic woes on the Democrats in Congress. Mr. Buchanan attributes the state's problems in considerable part to Mr. Bush.
A television commercial that went on the air last Friday shows the President in the Oval Office, promoting the economic recovery plan outlined in his State of the Union address, and telling New Hampshire voters: "I need your help now to send a real message to Congress to get this job done."
Mr. Buchanan, the conservative columnist and commentator, replied in an advertisement that went on the air this morning with an invitation to the state to "send Bush a message." The commercial ends with voters here chanting, "Read our lips!" -- a taunting reprise of the President's "No new taxes" pledge, which he broke in 1990 in a deficit-reduction deal with Congress.
But a poll taken for television station WMUR of Manchester by the University of New Hampshire suggests in a number of ways that Mr. Bush is winning the argument.
Conducted by telephone from last Thursday to Sunday, the poll showed that 62 percent of the respondents thought Mr. Bush had been "forced by Congress" to raise taxes, while only 19 percent thought the President had "betrayed voters' trust." The rest said they remained unsure.
Of 499 respondents in the survey, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percent, 60 percent said they supported Mr. Bush, with 23 percent backing Mr. Buchanan and 17 percent still undecided. That was one of the President's strongest showings since the campaign got under way, although the figures showed some undecided voters shifting to Mr. Buchanan.
"There is great discontent in the state among Republican voters," said Prof. David W. Moore, director of the university's survey center. "They are not satisfied with the economy, but they are nonetheless remaining quite loyal to the Republican President. For the most part they do not blame Bush for the poor conditions but rather the Democratic Congress."
Many seasoned Republican politicians in the Bush camp, some of whom expressed concern two weeks ago about his prospects, now say they expect him to get 65 percent or more of the vote. State Senator Susan McLane, who plans to write in the name of Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts rather than vote for Mr. Bush, said that "in the end, the undecideds will slide into the Presidential fold, because when they listen to Buchanan, they know he isn't the answer."
Gov. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who is managing Mr. Bush's campaign, put the situation this way: "I think there's no question we've taken the offensive. We have a message and we're delivering it aggressively. What worries me is that a lot of furious, frustrated people think they can vote however they want in the primary without having any effect on who lives in the White House next year.
"We have to convince the doubters that their vote has consequences. A vote for Pat Buchanan is a vote for Ted Kennedy and the Democrats, I keep saying, because it weakens George Bush in his fight against Congress."
But Paul Nagy, Mr. Buchanan's state manager, said the challenger was "on target as far as organization goes," and he contended that Mr. Buchanan was still "in a good position to get 20, 25, 30 percent of the vote." That would be enough "to hurt George Bush," Mr. Nagy said, even though well short of Mr. Buchanan's own recent statements that he hoped to win here. Other Buchanan aides said they had sensed a certain loss of momentum in recent days, but Mr. Nagy said he had noticed no slackening of pace.
One thing that could hurt the Bush effort would be a reopening of the old wounds in the state Republican heirarchy -- especially a revival of the long-standing enmity between Mr. Gregg and his father, Hugh, a former governor, and another onetime New Hampshire governor, John H. Sununu, the former White House chief of staff dismissed by Mr. Bush.
Until recently, the Greggs and Mr. Sununu had submerged their past differences to make common cause in behalf of the President. But the Governor and his father were reportedly infuriated by a column by Rowland Evans and Robert Novak this week that they believed to have been inspired by Mr. Sununu. The column suggested that Mr. Sununu had been dispatched to the state "to save Bush from embarrassment or worse."
Bush strategists deny that any such change of strategy happened and said Mr. Sununu had always been part of the campaign plan for New Hampshire. Governor Gregg said tersely and with evident displeasure, "As long as we win, we don't care what he does."
 
Bush Plans a Return
 Mr. Bush is to return to the state next week. In the meantime, a succession of surrogates have been carrying the fight to Mr. Buchanan, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who was in New Hampshire on Monday. A whole group of conservatives who are supporting Mr. Bush will be at a local group's fund-raising dinner in Manchester on Saturday, including Mr. Sununu, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Buchanan plans to be there, too.
Mr. Rath, the Attorney General, said the next step for the Bush campaign would come in a third wave of commercials later this week. For the first time the President will have ads that focus on his foreign-policy record, especially the American victory in the Persian Gulf.

HEADLINE: Dow Surges 38.69 in Hopes of Lower Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Fueled by renewed hopes of lower interest rates and a firm bond market, stocks rose yesterday in active trading, with the Dow Jones industrial average and some other indexes hitting record levels. By gaining 38.69, to close at 3,272.81, the Dow inched 0.67 point past the record it set on Jan. 28.
Investor sentiment was divided between those encouraged by the Congressional testimony of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and those focusing on economic uncertainty. The mixed feelings led to choppy trading, with the strength in bonds the decisive upward force. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 233.7 million shares, up from 185.3 million on Monday, with gaining issues easily outpacing losers by 1,116 to 620. The Big Board composite rose 2.18, to 228.79.
 
S.& P. 500 Rises
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 4.32, to 413.85, while the American Stock Exchange composite rose 2.36, to 413.68.
Trading was just as as heavy on the Nasdaq, as the composite hit a new high of 613.00, up 7.57, 0.18 over its Jan. 15 level. The Russell 2,000, another market barometer, reached a new high of 207.82, up 1.95.
Ricky Harrington, director of equity investment for Marion Bass Securities, said the tone of the market was essentially set by the bond market, which was responding to Mr. Greenspan's remarks that the Fed had not ruled out further interest-rate cuts.
Mr. Harrington said the bond market rally carried over into the stock market, outweighing any possible disappointment that might come as a result of today's announcement by the Treasury on the size of the Government's quarterly refunding and by the employment report due out on Friday.
"Conditions in the market are still not set for a correction and as long as interest rates are stable or fall it will be difficult for the equity market to move lower," Mr. Harrington said. "But a correction is still out there."
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said it tracked a number of programs that when combined lifted the Dow 13.19 points.
Philip H. Smyth, an analyst with Birinyi, noted that among the Dow's big movers yesterday were Merck, up 4 1/2, to 158 7/8, on news that the Food and Drug Administration was expected to recommend approval for Proscar, a new prostate drug. Goodyear Tire was up 2 3/4, to 64 3/4, and Du Pont was up 2, to 48.
Kemper shares were sent tumbling, after the Chicago-based insurance group announced lower earnings and an addition to reserves against possible decline in its real estate investment portfolio. Analysts said the announcement reflected a reversal of earlier comments on the portfolio's status and took Wall Street by surprise. The stock fell 4, to 36 3/4, as investor concern was noted in other insurance stocks as well, Aetna Life and Casualty was down 1, to 42 1/2, and Cigna, slipped 1/8, to 55 1/8.
Amid speculation that it will report a smaller-than-expected loss sometime this week, Chrysler stock rose to its highest level in a year, 16 3/8, up 1 3/8 in active trading.
Better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings by Amgen Inc. lifted the biopharmaceutical company's standing with several analysts who raised their earnings estimates. Amgen rose 1 1/4, to 71.
Advanced Micro Devices said it could only speculate about the rise in its stock price to 20 5/8, up 1 1/8, in active trading, guessing that it may be a technical rebound from last week's decline.
Cummins Engine, rose 2 3/8, to 58 7/8, after the diesel engine maker reported higher profit margins and a smaller-than-expected loss in its fourth-quarter earnings.
Jill Krutick, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, rated Mattel, Hasbro and Fisher-Price stocks "buys," noting that an analysis of how toy stocks traded over the last six years show that they rise an average 20 percent in the weeks before and after the American International Toy Fair, which takes place next week. Mattel, was up 1 1/8, to 33 1/2; Hasbro rose 1 3/4, to 41, and Fisher-Price was up 1/4, to 37 1/2

HEADLINE: Loss Is Reported by Goodrich

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The B. F. Goodrich Company reported today that it lost money in the fourth quarter and all of 1991, partly because of one-time charges totaling $90 million.
John Ong, the chairman, said the company was also hurt by the recession. 
 The specialty chemicals, vinyls and aerospace company said it lost $106.7 million in the fourth quarter, in contrast to earnings of $14.1 million, or 47 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1990. Sales rose 5.2 percent, to $607.4 million, from $575.8 million.
The company said the special charges in the fourth quarter included $77.4 million, or $3.05 a share, for the phasing out of high-cost vinyl operations at three locations, and $3.7 million, or 14 cents a share, for a voluntary retirement program.
Without the one-time items, the net loss for the fourth quarter would have been $16.9 million, the company said.
Quarterly operating income rose to $22 million at the aerospace business, from $12 million a year earlier. But the specialty chemicals division had an operating loss of $3.4 million, while the vinyl products business lost $141 million.
For all of 1991, the company lost $80.6 million, in contrast to net income of $136.3 million, or $5.04 a share, in 1990. Sales increased 1.6 percent last year, to $2.47 billion, from $2.43 billion in 1990.
Shares of Goodrich were down 75 cents today, closing at $41.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Doesn't Bar Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
In unusually direct language, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today that the central bank had not ruled out further interest rate cuts as insurance to push the economy out of its doldrums.
In testifying before the House Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan, the nation's most influential economic policy maker, seemed to aim his remarks at the nation's financial markets, which had tumbled last week after he testified before the Senate Banking Committee. 
 Today stock and bond prices surged, with the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average climbing 38.69 points to a new record of 3,272.81. [Pages D10 and D16.]
 
Markets Fell Last Time
 Mr. Greenspan said today, as he had last Wednesday, that he believed the rate cuts already ordered by the Federal Reserve would be enough to lift the economy out of recession. But when he had said the same thing before the Senate panel, stock and bond prices dropped sharply because many investors concluded that monetary easing was over.
Today Mr. Greenspan said: "We expect that the amount of monetary ease in the pipeline is adequate to turn the economy onto the path of sustained recovery. But assessing the economic outlook at the present time is extraordinarily difficult."
Expressing surprise that investors had taken his comments last week to mean that interest rates had bottomed, Mr. Greenspan added that the Fed was "of course continuing to evaluate whether some additional insurance in the way of further monetary ease would be appropriate."
In the view of some analysts, Mr. Greenspan's comments took on added importance because the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, held its first meeting of the year today as soon as the Fed chairman finished testifying.
 
Increasing the Chances
 The report of the deliberations at the closed two-day meeting is not scheduled to be released until early April, and Fed watchers have been saying the central bank would probably not reduce rates until March or April, if at all, after assessing the economy's progress. But Mr. Greenspan's testimony appeared to some both to increase the chances of a rate cut and to move up the date.
With the economy continuing to stall and the Federal Reserve facing pressure from the Bush Administration, the central bank cut short-term interest rates a full percentage point on Dec. 20. It reduced its discount rate, the rate at which it lends money to banks, to 3 1/2 percent, and the Federal funds rate, the rate that banks lend money to each other, to 4 percent.
The cuts the Fed has engineered over the last several months have brought interest rates to their lowest point in 27 years.
Long-term rates, however, have edged up slightly in recent weeks, and when asked why today, Mr. Greenspan pointed to two possible causes: a belief among some investors that the economy has bottomed out, and the heavy borrowing to finance the Federal deficit. He said he doubted such a rise resulted from increased inflationary expectations because he said inflationary pressures continued to ease.
Mr. Greenspan said the economy's performance had been "disappointing," adding that "some strong forces have been working against a typical cyclical revival in economic activity."
In this recession, he noted, households and business had unusually high debt ratios, which have been keeping them from increasing expenditures. But he said lower interest rates were helping to ease debt burdens as consumers refinanced mortages and companies replaced debt with equity.
 
Cites Consumer Confidence
 "We thus have already made considerable progress in the balance sheet adjustment process, and this unusual restraint on economic activity should begin to dissipate, hopefully in the reasonably near future," he said.
He added that stubbornly low consumer confidence was also holding back recovery. Consumer confidence, he noted, is far lower than during the 1974-75 recession, when unemployment and the loss of output were greater. In his view, consumer confidence continued to stay low because of a concern that American living standards were growing more slowly -- or even declining.
Mr. Greenspan's other main message to the House committee today was that Congress and the President had to do more to bring down the mushrooming budget deficit, which he said was an "insidious" force that sapped the nation's savings, investment and, ultimately, living standards. He said the Government's deficit spending reduced the amount of money available for the business investment needed to improve productivity and living standards.
Mr. Greenspan was called before the House committee to give his views on budget proposals and the state of the economy. As he did last week before the Senate committee, Mr. Greenspan said he opposed Congressional and Administration plans to spur the economy by lowering taxes or spending more -- although he noted that many eminent economists disagreed with him.
He voiced fears that these competing stimulus proposals could produce "bidding wars," which were "to be avoided at all costs. Mr. Greenspan said, "It would be extremely detrimental to our longer-term outlook if this budget process hemorrhaged in an endeavor to come to grips with the admittedly very difficult short-term economic problems that currently confront us."

 BODY:
The Bush Administration and Congressional Republicans proposed legislation today to change the rules of litigation in Federal courts, continuing a campaign that has positioned Vice President Dan Quayle as a scourge of the legal profession.
The main proposals of the legislation, which is intended to reduce the number of frivolous or otherwise unnecessary lawsuits and to speed the civil-trial process, are carefully limited in scope. 
 But they have provided a highly visible and, his aides say, a broadly popular campaign theme for Mr. Quayle, who heads a White House regulatory council that endorsed them last year.
"Non-lawyers support our proposals 100 to 1," Mr. Quayle said at a news conference on the legislation today. "More importantly, lawyers support our reform package 4 to 1. That ought to be a message to the leadership of the American Bar Association."
 
An Unflattering Light
 The association has been critical of the Administration's proposed litigation rules, in part because it disagrees with some of the particulars, but mainly because of how Mr. Quayle has presented them -- in a light that is distinctly unflattering to lawyers.
Officials of the bar association offered little objection today to the bill itself, which was introduced on the Administration's behalf by Representative Hamilton Fish Jr., a Republican of upstate New York, and Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa. Some of the proposals conform to the A.B.A.'s own suggestions.
Even the central and most widely debated provision, which would in some civil cases require that litigants who bring unsuccessful lawsuits pay some of the legal costs of the defendants, was shrugged off by Talbot S. D'Alemberte, the president of the bar association.
"It seems to me that is a modest proposal, and I don't have any personal great objection to it," he said in a phone conversation from Dallas, where the association's House of Delegates is meeting.
 
Some Important Exceptions
 The "loser pays" provision would apply only to cases that were brought before Federal courts instead of state courts at the choice of the claimant. Cases that were moved to Federal courts because a defendant wanted it that way would not be affected.
There would be two limits on the costs of defense to be paid by an unsuccessful claimant. First, these costs could not exceed the amount spent by the claimant in pressing the lawsuit. Second, a judge would have discretion to reduce or eliminate the payment simply by deciding that doing so would serve justice.
Mr. D'Alemberte welcomed another facet of the Administration proposal, which would encourage litigants to settle their cases through mediation. During a three-year experiment, each Federal judicial circuit would designate a courthouse where mediators would attempt to settle cases out of court. Mr. D'Alemberte cautioned, though, that funds would have to be provided to make this idea work.
He criticized a third proposal, which would require claimants to give written notice of their claims and set forth the damages before bringing suit. Here, too, the idea is to encourage out-of-court settlements, but Mr. D'Alemberte argued that the result might be simply another layer of procedure.
 
Not Meant as 'Attack'
 The bar association is to unveil soon its own proposals for litigation changes, which will include expanding legal aid for poor and middle-class people, he said. The Administration plan includes no such provisions.
Representative Fish, who like Mr. Quayle is a lawyer, said the legislation "is not intended as an attack on our nation's legal system or the legal profession." But he added:
"The fact is that the American people sense that something is wrong with our legal system. They believe there are too many lawsuits, too many excessive damage awards. They believe that there is too much litigation, and this is hurting the American economy."
Mr. Quayle himself, as he has done in a series of appearances for the last six months, lashed out at the bar association in a way reminiscent of the 1988 Bush-Quayle campaign's frequent criticisms of the American Civil Liberties Union. The Vice President said:
"The American Bar Association's position is this: They want to increase taxpayer financing for litigation, they want to increase a new bureaucracy in the Justice Department to hire more lawyers, and they want more grants for lawyers.
"Well, that may be the reform package of the American Bar Association, but that is not the reform package of the American people. I'm telling you the American people are on my side on this issue."
In response, Mr. D'Alemberte said sarcastically that he was "absolutely delighted" by the title the Administration had chosen for its bill: the Access to Justice Act of 1992.
"I hope that they really do mean to increase access to justice," he said. But he said the version introduced today offered "nothing for the Legal Services Corporation," the Federal agency that provides free legal assistance to the poor, "and nothing to make justice more accessible to the poor and middle class."

HEADLINE: Haven for Haitians Backed in Miami

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 4

 BODY:
After months of indecision and a complicated legal battle, the Bush Administration has begun forcing 15,000 Haitian refugees to return to their homeland. But here in the city that was the main destination of those boat people, Mayor Xavier Suarez has been handing out bumper stickers that read "Interdict Drugs, Not Haitians."
Like hundreds of thousands of other people in the Miami area, Mr. Suarez, a 42-year-old lawyer born in Cuba, came here as a refugee from a dictatorship that repressed and impoverished its people. For those immigrants, as for many of those who were born here, Washington's decision to classify most Haitians as "economic refugees" ineligible for political asylum, a policy that The Miami Herald on Sunday called "Operation Racist Shield," smacks of hypocrisy and a double standard. 
 "In my case, how could I not be in their favor if I was accepted here 31 years ago and and the whole world extended a hand to me and my family," Mr. Suarez said, expressing a sentiment that is being echoed in call-in programs broadcast on Spanish-language radio stations here.
"I think the old distinction between political and economic refugees just doesn't wash any more. The Haitians come here with a lot of good strong societal values and just want an opportunity. We should give it to them."
 
Election-Year Policy
 Florida officials and refugee advocates say the Bush Administration's forced repatriation of Haitians from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base is motivated at least in part by a desire not to alienate voters here. The President's advisers are said to harbor fears that a new flood of immigration into Florida could cost Mr. Bush and the Republican Party support in the nation's fourth largest state in an election year.
"Many senior-level officials have emphasized that this President is not Jimmy Carter," who lost Florida in 1980 to Ronald Reagan amid an influx of Cuban refugees, said Arthur Helton, who as director of the Refugee Project of the Lawyers' Committee on Human Rights has had many conversations in Washington. "That fear was animating discussion in the Government last fall when this issue was unfolding."
But most public officials here, regardless of party, regard that line of reasoning as inherently flawed. According to a poll conducted for The Miami Herald and a Miami television station in December, 57 percent of Florida residents believe that Haitians should be allowed to remain in the United States until it is safe for them to return to their homeland.
"People are ambivalent, but they do want to give a break to folks who will be in danger if forced to go back to their countries," said Robert Joffee of Mason-Dixon Opinion Research, which conducted the survey. "They don't seem to view these immigrants as a serious threat to their own well-being, and they don't make a distinction between political and economic refugees."
 
Backing for Refugees
 Mr. Joffee said 813 people were interviewed in the telephone poll in a four-day period. The margin of sampling error was 3.5 percent, and the results showed that "so far as immigration attitudes are concerned" there is no distinction "between those who are in trouble because of the recession and those who aren't," he said.
According to the poll, 51 percent of all whites were in favor of allowing the Haitians to take refuge in the United States. Support was even stronger among Hispanic residents, who are the largest single ethnic group in the Miami area, making up half of the population of Dade County, and blacks, 80 percent of whom wanted the Haitians to be granted refuge.
Support for granting refugee status to the Haitians appears to cut not only across racial and ethnic divisions, but partisan lines as well. Indeed, Florida's Republican Senator, Connie Mack, has been one of the most outspoken critics of the refusal to grant refugee status to Haitians, calling the Administration's policy "morally wrong" and "a disgrace" and introducing legislation that would grant Haitians who arrive here temporary protected status.
"He has taken a strong position, and is definitely an ally and friend," said Jacques Despinosse, president of the Haitian-American Democratic Club here. "We are Democrats, but if the election were held today, we would tell all Haitian people to vote for Connie Mack because he believes in human rights."
 
2 Waves of Immigrants
 The prospect of an influx of Haitians has awakened some hard feelings in Florida, political and community leaders here agree. But most of that resentment seems to be directed at the Federal Government, which has done little to help the state defray the costs of absorbing two large waves of immigration in recent years.
As a result of the Mariel boatlift in 1980, some 125,000 Cuban refugees came to the United States, most of whom eventually settled in Miami. Then, in the late 1980's, at the height of the Reagan Administration's efforts to unseat the Sandinista Government, more than 100,000 Nicaraguans came here hoping to escape civil war and political repression in their homeland.
In a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr last month, Gov. Lawton Chiles complained of "the federal Government's inaction on this issue since 1982." He urged the Bush Administration to make it possible for Florida to apply for $35 million included in an Immigration Emergency Fund, noting that his position had the support of all 21 members of the state's Congressional delegation.
In the letter, Mr. Chiles, a Democrat, noted that Mr. Barr has stated that "immigration and foreign policies are the exclusive province of the President and Congress" and added that "I could not agree with you more."
Florida officials have said they are still awaiting reimbursement for more than $100 million spent to resettle Cubans and Nicaraguans and want Washington to bear the expense of accommodating Haitians, 85 percent of whom have expressed a desire to settle in Florida.
"People agree that we should give them refuge," said Daryl L. Jones, a state representative whose district has large white, black and Hispanic populations. "It's just a question of cost. The common person doesn't make the distinctions the President does. They see a country in turmoil, they remember Baby Doc. On this issue, it's hard to tell Republicans from Democrats."

HEADLINE: Kentucky Trying to Find Money to Better Schools

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
The five-year plan for Kentucky school reform, the broadest education overhaul ever undertaken by a state, faces a stern test in its second year as legislators grapple with how to finance the plan in a recession.
The plan, which went into effect in the 1990-91 school year, cost nearly $600 million in its first year alone for changes in 176 districts, including offering early childhood education, instituting school-based management and raising the compulsory school age to 18 years old from 16. It also gives state education officials the authority to remove boards and superintendents and take over districts for not complying. 
 Like New Jersey and Texas, Kentucky was forced by the State Supreme Court to revamp its school-financing system after 66 districts charged that it was inequitable because it was based primarily on property taxes, enabling rich districts to spend more. The high court also told the state to overhaul the very structure of its education system, calling it unconstitutional.
"Even though people disagree with this piece of the legislation or that piece, there is no other effort that comes close to what Kentucky is doing," said David Hornbeck, a school-restructuring expert who helped to design the state's package.
But after the plan's first year, which was supported entirely by increases in taxes and the creation of new ones, lawmakers face tough decisions on how to finance the second year. State revenue is off because of the recession.
Gov. Brereton C. Jones, a Democrat who took office last year, is expected to unveil his budget tomorrow to the legislature, now in session in Frankfort. The Governor and key lawmakers said they support the plan, so some education officials said they expect financing for other departments and services to be cut.
One pressing need is additional money to award districts under a local tax-incentive plan. Under that plan, school districts can receive extra state aid if they raise their local tax rate above 35 cents for every $100 in property value. The state allocated $25 million last year and this year for the program, but more districts than the state expected raised their taxes beyond that threshold. As a result, the state now owes school districts $75 million for the first year alone, according to the State Education Department.
Each district has received about a third of what it is entitled to under the plan. Bill Griffith, a spokesman for Governor Jones, said, "The Governor's priority is to keep the reform package alive and going."

HEADLINE: In Space, and in East-West Politics, It's a Very Long Voyage to Mars

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
As the nation's civilian space program drifts aimlessly, undone by the cold war's demise, calls are rising for the United States to join its former Russian foes in history's most ambitious voyage -- sending humans across many millions of miles of space to explore Mars.
The undertaking would tap skills of East and West and give both sides needed new direction, experts say. They note that NASA's $14 billion-a-year budget is under fire and that Moscow's space program is cracking under political and economic problems. 
 "There's a reservoir of skills, facilities and capabilities in the former Soviet Union that ought to be used for common objectives," says John M. Logsdon, a space-policy expert at George Washington University. "It makes no sense to throw it away."
Last month, Russian scientists called for a Mars mission, echoing earlier proposals by private American groups like the Planetary Society, the National Space Society and the Federation of American Scientists.
 
Just Talk, for Now
 The White House is said to be actively interested, if uncommitted. In 1990 President Bush announced an "exploratory dialogue" with the Soviet Union about joint ventures in space, including a manned trip to Mars. So far, however, East-West action on this issue has gone no farther than polite discussions.
Originally, the space programs of both East and West were anything but aimless. Both were cold-war creations, weapons in a costly race for technical superiority and global intimidation: The Soviet Union launched the first satellite in 1957 and the first man into space in 1961, then America forged ahead by landing men on the moon in 1969. The United States pressed onward in 1981 to launch the world's first reusable spaceship, the winged shuttle.
But this extraordinary feat of engineering initially had no mission aside from getting to the Moon before the Russians did. "The cold war turned our space program into a propaganda program, always in search of spectacular, high-profile stunts," said Walter A. McDougall, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania.
The Russians concentrated on heft -- bigger rockets, longer missions, more frequent launchings. Beginning in 1971, the Soviet Union put into orbit a series of manned space stations that have kept Moscow's astronauts circling Earth for increasingly long periods.
 
What Each Could Contribute
 Space experts say this experience in long-duration space flights would be of great value on Mars voyages. The Russians could also help in rocketry. Recently, scientists from Moscow described their efforts to perfect nuclear engines and proposed collaboration on an atom-powered trip to the red planet.
For its part, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has much technology critical for a Mars venture and has sent astronauts to a planetary body and returned them safely. But NASA is leery of a joint expedition. Among other things, it worries that political discord in the former Soviet Union would rule out the kind of long-term cooperation needed for the endeavor.
Advocates of a joint Mars voyage say that it would foster the kind of political stability Moscow now wants, bolstering the Russian Government's legitimacy and helping to stem the growing exodus of Russian scientists and engineers to arms factories in foreign lands, a gnawing Western worry in the post-cold-war world.

HEADLINE: Montreal Journal;
The Proud City of 'Great Events' Has a Great Fall

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
When a 55-ton chunk of concrete fell from the outer wall of the Olympic Stadium here last summer, the immediate casualty was the rest of the home season for the Montreal Expos, the city's baseball team. But because the stadium is a landmark, the crumbling of its wall was taken by many here as a symbol of the economic and social problems that have gnawed away at the city's self-confidence.
Stylish and innovative, the stadium seemed like an ideal talisman for French-speaking Canada when it was commissioned for the 1976 Summer Olympic Games. But because the structure and its retractable roof were plagued with technical problems, it ended up costing the province of Quebec more than $2 billion, some of it still being paid off by Montrealers with a special property tax. 
 Many Montrealers say their city, like the stadium, has become a monument to broken ambitions, a place where spectacles and illusions overwhelmed reality. In the 1960's there was Expo '67, a shimmering world's fair. In the 1970's there were the Olympics, and a new airport.
In the 1980's Montreal's leaders boasted that the city was becoming the most international on the continent, a Paris of North America that would add the charm of its French culture and 18th-century architecture to inflows of capital and technology from Asia, Europe and the United States.
 
The Bubble Has Burst
 But in the 1990's the city is in the grip of bitter self-reproach, centering on a realization that the billions of dollars spent on the "great events" of recent decades created a bubble that has burst.
"There is a lot of morosite right now," Jean Dore, the city's 47-year-old Mayor, said in an interview, using a French word for gloominess.
In 1986 Mr. Dore led a reform movement that took over city hall from Jean Drapeau, the Mayor who ran Montreal as a personal fief for a quarter of a century. For those seeking a scapegoat for the current problems, Mr. Drapeau, now in retirement, is an easy mark. But Mr. Dore said Mr. Drapeau's era had to be seen in perspective.
"In the period from 1960 to 1985, those 'great events' put us on the map," he said. "But we paid a price, and that was that we did not adopt a strategy for basic economic renewal until the mid-1980's."
Much about Montreal, particularly the old town, with its snug cafes and theaters and art galleries, remains as alluring as ever. But elsewhere, the markers of the distress press in: rising rates of violent crime; heightening racial tensions between the police and immigrant communities; a 20 percent unemployment rate among the city's 1.3 million people; crowded soup kitchens and homeless shelters; vacant development lots and abandoned construction sites.
New hotels and office buildings begun in the 1980's struggle with crippling vacancy rates, while St. Catherine Street, heart of the central shopping district, is gap-toothed for a mile or more with stores that have been abandoned or are holding going-out-of-business sales.
For shelter from harsh winters and humid summers, many of the city's chic boutiques have moved into modern shopping atriums, but they too are often deserted at the height of the business day.
Along with these problems, common across Canada in the recession, there is a distinctive and painful one for a city that has been the energizing heart of French Canada since its founding 350 years ago: A flight of middle-class Quebecers to the suburbs, which has reduced the proportion of inner-city residents speaking French as a first language to barely half.
 
Immigrants Move In
 As native residents have moved out, immigrants, many unemployed, have moved in. About 25 percent of those on welfare are immigrants, and a rising proportion of these, many from Haiti, are black.
Marcel Cote, an influential economist, wrote in a report he delivered to the Quebec government last year on behalf of Groupe Secor, a Montreal consulting concern, that behind an "illusion of prosperity" the city had remained rooted in a rusting past of steel foundries, refineries and textile mills. As a result, he said, the city had declined not only relative to Toronto, its traditional rival, but to cities in the Northeastern United States, including Boston, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
But while just about everybody agrees that Montreal is in trouble, comparing its problems with those of America's blighted cities may be overdrawn. Mr. Dore, for one, seemed chagrined at the comparison.
"We have 60,000 people living downtown, and our streets are safe," he said. "Even if our economy was slow for 10 years, we'd still not be in as big a mess in terms of social problems as Detroit or New York."
The Quebec government announced in December that it would spend $350 million on a new development plan for the city, one that will focus on efforts to foster "clusters" of smaller businesses around high-technology industries like aerospace, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications.
 
Language Laws Are Issue
 In what many here see as a more startling acknowledgment of the need for new approaches, some French-speaking politicians and commentators have begun urging a repeal, or at least an easing, of the French-only language laws adopted in the mid-1970's that did much to prompt an exodus of 200,000 English-speaking Montrealers to Toronto.
Others believe that the city's economic woes will have more far-reaching political consequences, perhaps even deciding the struggle over Quebec's future as part of Canada. A referendum on independence is scheduled for Oct. 26.
A parade of Montreal business leaders have argued in recent weeks that the economic costs of independence would be too great. Mr. Dore has not said how he will vote. But he acknowledged that Montreal's hopes for recovery were being damaged by the bitterness of the independence struggle.
"We want the situation resolved as quickly as possible," he said. "Uncertainty is always a killer in terms of economic development."

Les Cours Mont Royal, a shopping mall, was nearly empty at 6 P.M. on a recent Friday. (Jonathan Wenk for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Key Congressmen Vow To Act Soon on Taxes

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Both the House and Senate tax-writing committees will vote this month on President Bush's tax and growth program and on competing Democratic proposals, their chairmen said today. Votes in both houses are expected before the March 20 deadline set by Mr. Bush last month.
Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, said his panel would act by the end of next week. And Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, said in a brief interview that he expected his group to act during the week of Feb. 24. 
 Mr. Rostenkowski said his committee would not follow Administration wishes and split its tax proposals into two bills, one for quick action and one for later. Dividing the bill, he said, "would start us down the slippery slope to a 1981-style bidding war."
The powerful chairman, who is often readier to deal with Mr. Bush than some of his Democratic colleagues would prefer, complained today that in a Presidential election year the Administration wanted a few popular tax cuts up front, with the difficult actions needed to pay for them to come later.
Quick Congressional action could have both political and economic consequences. Action before March 20 would make it much harder for President Bush to accuse the Democratic-controlled Congress of prolonging the recession. And fast action would enable business executives, home buyers and others to know what the tax rules were going to be, reducing any tendency to delay purchases because of uncertainty.
Mr. Rostenkowski made his comments as he sought to assert control of this year's tax-writing process at the beginning of three days of hearings on tax and growth measures. In today's session the Administration and Democrats exchanged ritualistic criticisms of each other's pet ideas.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, told Representative Beryl Anthony, Democrat of Arkansas, "I believe it would be very dangerous" to try to pay for some of the Administration's tax cuts by increasing tax rates on higher-income earners, a key Democratic objective.
Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, scorned the Administration's central proposal, a cut in capital gains taxes, as a "tax break for the rich." He told Nicholas F. Brady, Secretary of the Treasury, that his extravagant claims on the economic good such a cut would do amounted to a boast that "other than curing the common cold, it will do just about everything."
In recent years, advocates of a higher maximum tax and supporters of a capital gains cut have battled to stalemates with no change in the law.
The Administration witnesses and such Republican committee members as Representatives Bill Archer of Texas and Philip M. Crane of Illinois suggested that quick adoption of seven measures in Mr. Bush's program was all the committee needed to do right away.
But, acknowledging political reality, Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the Administration would of course welcome consideration of more parts of Mr. Bush's package.
He said that if the committee wanted to add other proposals to the Administration's short list, which includes captal gains, accelerated depreciation of investments and a $5,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, it could pay for them by picking and choosing among various proposals for spending cuts in the Administration's budget. He said the House leaders could direct other committees to make the spending cuts.
 
Trading Off on Taxes
 Mr. Rostenkowski rejected that proposal, saying the tax bill would have to be revenue neutral on its own, setting the stage for an almost certain Democratic attempt to impose some sort of surcharge on high-income taxpayers to pay for some sort of middle-class tax cut.
The shape of the committee proposal will probably not become clear until it starts voting on specific provisions next Wednesday. Mr. Rostenkowski said today that he would keep the committee in session to vote on the bill "through the weekend if necessary." There is no clear scheduling beyond that.
Under that timetable the whole House could be ready to act during the week of Feb. 24. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley today predicted "a very early vote." He said it would come well before the March 20 deadline Mr. Bush proclaimed in his State of the Union speech.
Mr. Boskin offered the most urgent call for adoption of the heart of Mr. Bush's program, which also includes modifications of the alternative minimum tax for business, the easing of passive-loss restrictions on real estate developers, the waiver of penalties on I.R.A. withdrawals by first-time home buyers, and several proposals to facilitate real estate investment by pension funds and others.
He told the committee that the Administration's forecast was that the economy would grow 2.2 percent in 1992 and 3 percent in 1993.
"The unemployment rate may rise slightly early in the year," he said, "but if the President's policies are enacted, should start to decline thereafter. Inflation and interest rates should remain relatively low. If the President's proposals are not enacted, the economy is less likely to improve and the improvement is likely to be slower and weaker."
Committee Democrats pressed the Administration witnesses over their failure to include on their quick action list Mr. Bush's proposal to increase the personal tax exemption for each child by $500. Mr. Brady said that "we did not conceive the personal exemption as a growth measure" requiring fast action.
Representative Marty Russo, Democrat from Illinois, also complained that an increased personal exemption for children would benefit high-income taxpayers more than low-income people. He said the proposal should be made into a tax credit.

HEADLINE: Credit Markets;
U.S. Securities Up in Thin Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose and interest rates fell in thin trading yesterday, reversing the price declines recorded Monday.
Traders and analysts said market participants took some comfort from Congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, who went out of his way to emphasize that the Fed stood ready to lower interest rates further if that was needed to promote a recovery. 
 In addition, a report on car sales for the last 10 days of January showed a pickup, which some analysts attributed to pent-up demand and lower interest rates, as well as depressed sales a year earlier because of the Persian Gulf war. But for the entire month, sales remained mired around 5.9 million units, analysts said, roughly the same level recorded for December.
"These numbers show that pent-up demand is still waiting to be unleashed," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at the Paine Webber Group. "Right now, the economy is still treading water."
Uncertainty about today's announcement from the Treasury about the size and makeup of the quarterly refunding auctions limited the size of the gains, and also served as a disincentive to trade.
"We are trying to build a little bit of a base," one government securities trader said. "But you can't get a good view of what the market is going to do until we get a look at the refunding package. Right now, most retail accounts that normally are in the market have moved to the sidelines."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10231/32 late yesterday, up 7/8 point, to yield 7.74 percent, compared with 7.81 percent late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10121/32 , up 19/32 , to yield 7.25 percent. The 6.25 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 7/32 , up 10/32 , to yield 6.43 percent. And the 4.875 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 5/8, up 3/32 , to yield 5.07 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates, which should be most sensitive to a change in market sentiment about a coming shift in Fed policy, fell yesterday, but only modestly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.82 percent in late trading, down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.87 percent.
In other developments, an offering of $85 million worth of New York State general obligation bonds met with strong demand in the tax-exempt municipal bond market, particularly among retail investors.
But the effects of the recent downgrade of the state's bond rating pushed up borrowing costs by as much as 30 basis points from November, the last time the state sold general obligation debt.
The securities, which were sold at competitive bid, were won by an investor group led by Paine Webber.
 
New York State Bonds
 The bonds were reoffered to investors with yields ranging from 3.70 percent on securities maturing in 1993 to 6.10 percent in 1998, 6.60 percent in 2003, 6.95 percent in 2008 and a maximum yield of 7.10 percent on bonds maturing in 2012.
The last New York State issue in November, 1991, carried a maximum yield of 6.80 percent.
The securities are rated A by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Investment bankers at Paine Webber said that as of late yesterday the issue had an unsold balance of $18.5 million.
In the high-yield junk bond market, demand was so strong for an offering of senior subordinated notes by the Stop and Shop Store Companies that the size of the issue was increased to $250 million, from $200 million.
The 9.75 percent noncallable notes were priced at $100, or par, 2.45 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
 
Strong Showing by Junk Issue
 It is the first time a security carrying a B rating has priced an issue at less than three percentage points above Treasuries, according to the BT Securities Corporation, which acted as lead manager for the underwriting.
The securities are rated B by Moody's and B-1 by Standard & Poor's.
New issue activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by a two-part, $325 million offering of 10-year and 30-year first mortgage bonds by Texas Utilities Inc.
The $150 million worth of 10-year 8.125 percent noncallable bonds were priced at $99.759 to yield 8.16 percent, 88 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The remaining $175 million of 30-year bonds maturing Feb. 1, 2022, have a coupon of 8.875 percent and were priced at $99.65 to yield 8.908 percent, 1.15 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing. These securities are noncallable for 10 years.
Both parts of the issue are rated Baa-2 by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose by about a quarter of a point.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities said prices of most widely quoted issues had dipped by an eighth of a point in sluggish trading.

HEADLINE: Aquarium Raises Hopes for Camden's Waterfront

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Feb. 4

 BODY:
Along a stretch of Delaware River waterfront near where the Campbell Soup Company once produced 10 million cans of soup a day and helped nourish Camden into a thriving industrial town, officials are pinning their hopes for the city's revitalization on fish.
Nearly 10 years after the idea was born and just more than three years after building began, the New Jersey State Aquarium will open on Feb. 29 amid expectations that it will be an immediate tourist attraction and the anchor for a number of waterfront projects that will end Camden's long economic and social slide. 
 "We anticipate that this aquarium will generate enough revenue over the next five years to exceed the current $220 million tax base in Camden," Senator Walter Rand, a Democrat who represents the city in Trenton, said today.
The aquarium, which was begun during the administration of former Gov. Thomas H. Kean and will bear his name, is the lead project in a planned $500 million revitalization of the waterfront that is to include a hotel and marina, an international trade center, a performing arts center and office and commercial development.
 
Image Concerns
 "There's no question that this wouldn't have happened without this aquarium project being here," said Judith L. Wellington, the chief operating officer for the aquarium and the vice president of the New Jersey Academy for Aquatic Sciences, the state agency that will operate it.
At the heart of the project is an effort to save a city that Ms. Wellington and Camden's mayor, Aaron A. Thompson, say has unjustly become a state and national symbol for urban blight and crime.
Camden, New Jersey's eighth-largest city with nearly 88,000 people, ranks near the bottom in just about every category measured by the state. Camden County is 17th among 21 counties in per-capita income; only two counties in the state commit juveniles to jail at a higher rate, and only six have higher high school dropout rates.
Last month, Time magazine published an article that said, "only people with no alternatives choose to live in Camden."
The article -- under the headline "Who Could Live Here?" -- appeared just as aquarium officials were gearing up for a campaign to lure people to the Camden waterfront.
"Obviously we are concerned about the magazine article," Ms. Wellington said. "But we have a substantial security force, and we have made it as safe and enjoyable an atmosphere as you will find anywhere."
From its pristine grounds and building to the security force assembled to protect it and its visitors, the aquarium stands apart from the city it is meant to save.
The aquarium complex, built at a cost of $52 million, covers an acre on the Delaware within the shadows of downtown Philadelphia's skyscrapers to the west and bordered on three sides by some of the most squalid parts of Camden. Road signs guide visitors along a route that skirts the city's tougher neighborhoods.
Officials have been concerned about attracting visitors from Pennsylvania when ferry service is restored next month between Penn's Landing in Philadelphia and the aquarium, which is built on the site of a ferry terminal that closed 40 years ago.
On Monday, Attorney General Robert Del Tufo announced an agreement under which state, county and city law enforcement officers will police the aquarium and the area around it and a state police boat will patrol the Delaware. Mounted officers will patrol a parking lot, and security guards will be posted on every floor of a parking garage.
 
Regional Rivals
 The aquarium also will have private security guards and, according to the attorney general's office, a cadre of Camden youths known as community services representatives "will patrol the streets and public areas of the district."
First Assistant Attorney General Frederick P. DeVesa, who coordinated the plan, said that the security arrangement was unusual because of the jurisdictions involved. But he said the security force was not a comment on crime problems in Camden.
"The fact is whenever you are trying to have a complex where perhaps a million people will be visiting a year you need this level of security," Mr. DeVesa said. "That's true whether it is Camden or Short Hills."
Ms. Wellington and other aquarium officials say they expect a million visitors in their first year and offer immediate competition for aquariums in New York City, Boston and Baltimore.
The aquarium has 60 species of fish native to New Jersey and its coastal waters, including striped bass, clearnose skates, rays and sandbar and sand tiger sharks. Its 760,000-gallon open ocean tank is the second largest of its kind in the United States, after a 5.6 million-gallon tank at Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla.

HEADLINE: Money Spent On Buildings Surges Again

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Spending on school construction increased for the sixth straight year in 1990, as more school districts replaced aging buildings or modified crowded ones.
The construction boom, documented in an annual building survey by American School and University magazine, totaled nearly $9.7 billion in 1990 -- the last year for which information was available -- compared with $9.3 billion in 1989. Spending for new school construction was $4.1 billion in 1990; in 1989 it was $3.7 billion. 
 The magazine's survey was the second in recent months to show that many school buildings are in need of improvement. Last November, the American Association of School Administrators found that one in eight school buildings had deteriorated to the point that they provided a poor atmosphere for learning.
 
Problems of Aging Schools
 Half of the country's 110,000 school buildings were erected 30 to 40 years ago, the association survey said.
"The schools that were built in the 1950's and 1960's are not appropriate for today because of the increasing emphasis on technology," said Joe Agron, the editor of American School and University.
But aging school buildings are only part of the construction picture. In some regions of the country, robust growth has produced more students and a need for more schools. In addition, some school districts, particularly in the Northeast, have been harder hit by the recession than others, so that additions and modifications have had to substitute for construction of new buildings.
 
Southeast and West Boom
 New construction last year was strongest in the Southeast, at nearly $1.5 billion, with about the same amount spent on additions and modifications. The West also reported robust growth in both new construction and additions and modifications.
But in the Northeast, construction of new schools totaled $385 million, one of the smallest totals of any region. The costs of adding on to schools there or modifying them totaled nearly $1.1 billion, however, as many districts chose those less expensive alternatives.
In some cases, school construction was the result of legislative mandates. In Nevada and Kentucky, for example, lawmakers limited the number of students who can be in a single classroom, thus requiring many districts to expand.
In other states, school districts that were compelled by legislatures to offer computer training had to modernize the wiring in their old buildings.

HEADLINE: Albany Sells Bonds, but at a Higher Interest Rate

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 4

 BODY:
New York State sold $85 million worth of general-obligation bonds today, a move that will cost taxpayers an extra $1.5 million to $2 million in interest costs because of the state's recently lowered bond rating.
It is impossible to calculate what the lowered bond rating will ultimately cost taxpayers, officials say, when all the state's bonds for this quarter are sold. But they estimated that once the state sells an anticipated $3 billion in various types of bonds in the first quarter of 1992, taxpayers can expect to pay tens of millions dollars more than they would have before the ratings were lowered.
 
Rebuke Over Budget
 In January, in a severe rebuke to the state for the way it runs its budget, Standard & Poor's announced that it was lowering its rating on New York's general-obligation bonds from A to A-, the state's lowest level ever and the second lowest in the country, higher only than that of Massachusetts. 
 The lowered rating, affecting bonds that are backed by the full faith and credit of the government and are usually considered the state's safest investment, came just a week after Moody's Investors Service lowered the rating of the state's appropriation-backed debt from A to Baa1, the second-lowest of any state.
The two credit monitors recently reaffirmed New York's current ratings. But they made it clear that they were closely watching the state to see if it could improve its performance and maybe even pass a budget on time this year, something it has failed to do for the last seven years.
Today's bonds, to raise money for hazardous-waste cleanup, were sold for $85 million at an interest rate of 6.7196 percent, for a total interest cost of $60.8 million. The bonds are redeemable between 1 and 20 years.

HEADLINE: In Test of Kentucky Education Law, State Takes Over a Troubled District

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARLAN, Ky., Jan. 31

 BODY:
For as long as anyone here can remember, there have been reports that many Harlan County School Board members engaged in nepotism and cronyism, with a business-as-usual attitude. But only recently, after months of reviewing the board's practices, did state education officials move against the board.
In the first test of the punishment mechanism in Kentucky's pioneering legislation aimed at improving schools, State Education Commissioner Thomas C. Boysen charged the five board members with a variety of infractions, including awarding school contracts to relatives and obtaining kickbacks from businesses for school contracts. 
 After a hearing before a state education panel two weeks ago, Mr. Boysen dismissed three school board members, all of whom said they would appeal. A fourth board member was acquitted of similar charges, and charges were dropped against another board member and the school superintendent when they resigned.
The ousters and state takeover by education officials in Frankfort, the capital, have upset residents in this rural county of 36,000 people in Eastern Kentucky, where people still talk about the bloody fights over unionization of the coal mines in the 1920's and 1930's.
In a county where the unemployment rate is almost double the state figure of about 7 percent, the takeover is the main topic of discussion in the community. The resentment is not so much because of the charges but because of the loss of control.
 
Residents Want Control
 "People are unhappy with the loss of local control of their school system," said Ken Moody, a Harlan restaurant owner, whose children attended the schools and whose wife works for the district as a finance officer. "People want their government at home. They don't want to be dictated to from Frankfort."
By beginning to crack down on errant school boards, Kentucky is moving into one of the most sensitive areas in the drive for improved schools -- local management. And as the nation demands better performances from both students and schools, the boards in this and other states are feeling mounting pressure from state legislatures to improve their management skills or face ousters and state takeovers.
"There's more attention being paid to school boards and the people who serve on them," said Gordon Aumbach, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, an organization representing the top education official in each state. "State legislatures have been looking at results of school districts in terms of student performance, and there's been a real shift to hold school boards more accountable."
 
16 States Act on Boards
 That is a task easier said than done, education analysts said. Seats on the nation's 15,000 school boards are elective offices typically pursued by private citizens whose skills may not be up to par in the increasingly demanding job of managing schools. But 16 states have tried to make school boards more responsive by passing laws in the last nine years giving education departments the authority to seize control of districts for managerial, fiscal or academic deficiencies.
New Jersey took over school systems in Jersey City in 1989 and in Paterson in 1991 because of academic and fiscal woes. The school boards in both districts were removed, a trend that continues in Harlan County, a system with 6,400 students and 16 schools.
The trouble in the school system began brewing a year ago when several residents anonymously called state education officials to complain about the school board's management. State officials declined to comment on details of the investigation because of the anticipated appeal by the ousted board members.
But based on those anonymous complaints, the Office of Education Accountability, a watchdog agency created by the State Education Reform Act that was passed two years ago, began investigating the district's affairs. Last October, the agency presented its findings to Mr. Boysen, who decided to press charges against all the board members and the superintendent.
At closed hearings, a panel of state education officials heard the charges of violating state law or state education policies, including accepting credit form a local store, awarding contracts to relatives and violating state competitive bidding laws.
Benny D. Coleman, the board chairman, was found guilty of four of five charges; Ron Ball, another board member, was found guilty of three of five charges, and David Lewis, the third member who was dismissed, was found guilty of two of three charges.
Similar charges against Robert Shepherd, the superintendent, and Garry Henson, a board member, were dropped when they resigned last fall. David Kennedy, the other board member, was acquitted of all charges and remains the lone member of the board.
The Harlan County Prosecutor, Ron Johnson, plans to review the education department's findings to determine whether criminal charges should be filed against any of the former school officials.
Mr. Ball said the three plan to appeal their removals to the Harlan County Circuit Court. Their ousters, he said, "haven't gone over well here."
 
'Stigma to Eastern Hills'
 In October, when the charges were filed against the board, about 400 school employees rallied in front of the school administration building in a show of support. Some were carrying signs that called the state's charges a "witch hunt," and this month, days before the hearings began, residents sent petitions with 2,000 signatures to state officials expressing confidence in their school board.
"There's a stigma attached to the Eastern hills of the state," said Patricia Baker, an elementary school teacher. "People in the state think we're hillbillies, that we need to be saved from ourselves. We're smart people. We don't need to be saved from ourselves. The school reform has just started, and people need a chance to get used to it. I really feel the school district has been wronged."
Despite the conflict, Harlan County's schools have been operating without any apparent glitches. The acting superintendent, Grace Ann Tolliver, and Stuart Pepper, a state-appointed trustee sent to Harlan County, will pay the district's bills and perform other tasks usually assumed by the board until a new board takes office, which is expected in mid-March. A Harlan County Citizen's Committee appointed by Mr. Boysen is selecting potential members, from which state education officials will pick four.
However pained by the notoriety of the board's dismissal, some residents believe it's time for change.

HEADLINE: Mollen Is About to Resign From Deputy Mayor Post

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Deputy Mayor Milton Mollen, who for two years oversaw New York City's vast criminal-justice programs and coordinated the Dinkins administration's anti-crime policies, will resign tomorrow or Friday to accept a private job, city officials said yesterday.
As the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, Mr. Mollen is the highest ranking official to leave the two-year-old administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins. Other high-ranking city officials who resigned recently are Correction Commissioner Allyn R. Sielaff, Sanitation Commissioner Steven M. Polan and Personnel Commissioner Douglas H. White. 
 Another of the city's five deputy mayors, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, who is in charge of finance and economic development, has told the Mayor she intends to step down soon.
 
A Former State Judge
 Mr. Mollen, who is 72 years old, was a high-ranking state judge when he joined the administration. He is leaving for personal reasons and has not had any policy disputes with Mayor Dinkins, aides to the Mayor and Mr. Mollen said.
The aides, who agreed to be interviewed only on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Mollen had told them that he would resign his $106,000-a-year City Hall post to accept a "law-related position." Asked yesterday if he was planning to resign, Mr. Mollen said: "I can't comment. There may be an announcement later this week."
Jennifer A. Kimball, a spokeswoman for Mayor Dinkins, said, "If and when the Mayor has an announcement to make regarding that decision, he will make it."
The Mayor entrusted Mr. Mollen to handle several of the administration's most sensitive issues, including the investigation of the crowd crush that killed nine people at a City College gymnasium in December.
 
'Safe Streets, Safe City'
 Mr. Mollen played a major role in expanding the Police Department's community-policing and anti-crime program, known as "Safe Streets, Safe City." He was the administration's chief negotiator last year when it obtained the authorization of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the State Legislature and the City Council for taxes and a lottery to pay for the $1.8 billion program over four years.
The administration has described the Safe Streets program as a major effort to reduce crime by assigning more officers to foot patrol and by funneling funds into crime prevention and education plans. The program also provides for jail space to handle an expected surge in arrests.
Mr. Mollen joined the administration in March 1990, two months after Mr. Dinkins became Mayor. Mr. Mollen had been presiding justice for 12 years of the State Appellate Division for the Second Judicial Department, the appeals court with jurisdiction for Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island. He had previously been a state and city judge for 13 years.
In appointing Mr. Mollen, the Mayor elevated the position to the rank of Deputy Mayor from the previous title of Criminal Justice Coordinator. Mr. Mollen was responsible for reviewing policies of the Police Department, the Fire Department, the Correction Department and the Probation Department. He also supervised plans to streamline the city's courts and reduce court congestion.
Aides to Mr. Dinkins said he viewed Mr. Mollen as a "troubleshooter" in many matters and in March assigned him to be in charge of contract negotiations with municipal unions after Eric J. Schmertz resigned as Labor Relations Commissioner.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Rise 11.1% In Period

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose 11.1 percent in late January, the auto makers reported today. The gain prompted many analysts to predict that the auto industry may be nearing a turning point.
Ronald A. Glantz, an automotive analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco, and other experts attributed the gain to several factors: the war with Iraq, which depressed sales a year earlier; pent-up demand for new vehicles; lower interest rates, and a slight improvement in consumer confidence. 
 "These results are the first concrete sign that consumer confidence is building," said Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association. Mr. Glantz predicted that "we've seen the low for the second dip in the recession."
 
 
Japan's Market Share Is Up
 Some analysts also speculated that the fallout from President Bush's trip to Japan had motivated Americans to buy cars. Despite widespread public relations pressure to "buy American," however, Japanese brands gained market share at the expense of the Big Three in the most recent 10-day period, as well as for the month.
The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for American-built cars was 6.1 million for late January, compared with 5.3 million for the period a year earlier. For the month, the selling rate was essentially unchanged at 5.9 million.
Despite the gains of Japanese brands -- spurred in part by an inexpensive lease special offered by Honda on its Accord model -- several multi-franchise dealers said the buy-American effort had resulted in improved sales of domestic brands and weaker sales of foreign makes.
Mel Farr, who owns four domestic and foreign dealerships in the Detroit and Cincinnati areas, said sales at his Toyota showroom declined about 25 percent in January from a year earlier, while sales at his Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealerships showed no decline.
 
 
Patriotic Sentiments
 At Biener Pontiac-Nissan in Great Neck, L.I., sales of Pontiacs were double the dealership's projections in January, while Nissan sales dropped by half. The dealership's general manager, Jerry Kramer, said many Pontiac buyers were trading in imports. "People come in and say that this time they will buy only an American product," he said.
Mr. Kramer added that Pontiac dealers in the New York metropolitan area would release another round of buy-American advertisements this week in response to recent remarks by the Japanese Prime Minister about the work ethic of Americans.
Mr. Kramer said that he was skeptical of such ads -- fearing that they could backfire if consumers saw them as "childish retribution" -- and that he thought the ads should simply focus on American quality. Another dealer said he had heard more consumers say they were aware that some foreign models, like the Toyota Camry, were built by Americans.
 Ray Green, who owns five foreign and domestic dealerships in Illinois, said January was his best sales month since 1988. He also reported "excellent results" at both his import and domestic dealerships. He attributed the gains in part to consumers who had reduced the debt on their current vehicles and were now able to make a trade.
A spokesman for the General Motors Corporation said that the company's dealers were also seeing more shoppers in their showrooms and that prospective customers were taking more test drives.
For the 10 days that ended on Jan. 31, sales of cars built in North America, which are considered domestically made, totaled 197,991, a rise of 6.8 percent from a year earlier. Sales of light trucks rose to 116,603, up 19.4 percent. There were 10 selling days in the period in both 1992 and 1991.
 
Big 3's Share Drops
 During January, the Big Three auto makers' market share slipped to 69.8 percent, from 70.5 percent in January 1991. The share for Japanese brands rose to 24.7 percent last month, from 23.9 percent in January 1991. The market share of all other imports fell slightly to 5.5 percent, from 5.6 percent.
 For the entire month, sales of all cars and trucks, domestic and imported, rose 3.5 percent from a year earlier, to 854,447. G.M. sold 190,670 cars built in North America in January, a decline of 1.8 percent from a year earlier; the Ford Motor Company sold 112,138 cars, for a gain of 3.5 percent, and the Chrysler Corporation sold 43,412, down 24.6 percent.
G.M.'s total market share for all cars in January was 35.5 percent, compared with 36.6 percent in January 1991. Ford had a 21.1 percent share, compared with 20.3 percent a year earlier. Chrysler's total share of the car market was 8.5 percent, down from 11.2 percent.
The Toyota Motor Corporation's market share was 9.6 percent, up from 8.2 percent. The Honda Motor Company's share was 9.8 percent, up from 8.2 percent.

HEADLINE: East Meets West, Dollars Apart

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The new East met the old West here this week, but there was scant indication of a meeting of the minds.
While Russian ministers and economists pleaded for billions of dollars in Western support to stabilize the ruble and the reform movement, the voices of Western industry and officialdom huffed about recession, rising labor costs and other distractions from salvaging the former Soviet republics. 
 "Until we have a stable convertible ruble, we cannot do anything and we need perhaps $5 billion to $6 billion from the West to accomplish that," said Anatoly Chubais, the minister in charge of Russia's privatization program. He added that about another $5 billion would come in handy as balance-of-payment support to get foreign trade going again. Meanwhile, he would also welcome a few billion dollars in emergency and technical aid.
 
A Lukewarm Response
 But with elections looming this year in the United States and Britain, and recession or anemic growth afflicting industrialized economies, the response was less than enthusiastic. As Richard Pipes, a Harvard historian and expert on Soviet affairs, commented, "The Russians think we can produce $30 billion for them, but they do not yet understand the imperatives of democratic politics."
The setting for this ticklish encounter was the ski resort of Davos, where about 2,000 government officials, executives and academics met for an annual gathering of what is known as the World Economic Forum. With 120 Russians present -- their air fares paid by a Swiss foundation because each round-trip ticket amounted to several months' salary -- the get-together amounted to a wide-ranging opportunity for Europe to come to terms with its new incarnation.
On the basis of the meeting, which ran from Friday until today, that process will take a long time. Even Switzerland, once an island of certainty and prosperity in a divided Europe, offered little reassurance. There was much talk of a Swiss identity crisis and the difficulties of being neutral in a world without opponents.
Carl H. Hahn, chairman of Volkswagen, was blunt in underlining that the preoccupations of many West European industrialists were very close to home, where they also saw the need for some new thinking.
"Labor in Western Europe is thinking in terms of the first half of this century," he declared. "We have to shed the traces of a certain socialism that exists in the West even as it has gone under in the East."
He was speaking just after German steelworkers, represented by the powerful I.G. Metall union, obtained a 6.4 percent pay increase in wage negotiations. The probable inflationary effects of the increase make it unlikely that Germany will soon heed requests to lower its high interest rates as part of an effort to revive the world economy. Without more robust economic growth in the West, Eastern Europe will have to be patient about its requests for help.
Nonetheless, elaborate plans were not lacking on the Russian side. Mr. Chubais outlined the intention of President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government to privatize 20 percent of state property in Russia this year.
The priority, he said, would be the privatization of retail stores and wholesalers, of which 75 to 100 percent would be in private hands by the end of the year. The state expects to garner 92 billion rubles from the process this year, compared with 2 billion last year. Foreign investment in the privatization drive was, he stressed, welcome. But the value of the rubles he was talking about was far from clear -- a point not lost on Western businessmen.
 
Inflation and Unease
 President Yeltsin's abrupt liberalization of prices on Jan. 2, while industry and agriculture remain predominantly in state hands, has led to higher inflation and widespread uneasiness.
Marshall I. Goldman, a professor of Soviet economics at Wellesley College, suggested that the privatization of farms should have been the initial step on which the Russian program was based. But Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist who is a key adviser to the Yeltsin Government, insisted that the reform program was proceeding as it should and that the next step should be the privatization of stores. "In all countries, privatization starts with trade," he said. "The marketplace is the essence of the market."
The caution of Western officials was so widespread that clearly nothing on the scale of the Marshall Plan, the American reconstruction of Europe after World War II, will be forthcoming for the countries of the former Soviet bloc.
Wayne D. Angell of the Federal Reserve Board expressed reservations about a fund to back the ruble. Some Western analysts suggested there might be as much as $10 billion of Russian capital in foreign banks that could be brought home to support the economy. And whatever happened, one analyst asked, to Soviet gold?
This cautious mood was plainly reinforced by the spectacle of several prominent Russian economists arguing bitterly and predicting imminent disaster.
"The Yeltsin team is playing on the brink of catastrophe," said Boris G. Fedorov, the head of Soviet affairs at the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, charged with rebuilding East European economies.
Andrei Fedorov, an economic adviser to Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, the Russian Vice President, who has recently warned of growing disorder, added his own prediction: "There is too much theory and too little management in the running of our economy and this experiment may be shortlived."
Still, amid the pessimism and irritation, there did seem to be some consensus on one point: the best hope lies in steering Russia and other republics into the International Monetary Fund and World Bank as soon as possible, perhaps by July.

GTE's Operating Earnings Rise

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The GTE Corporation, the nation's second-largest telecommunications company, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter operating earnings rose more than 10 percent, to $481 million, or 53 cents a share, from $435 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier.
The results were within analysts' expectations, a surprise in itself. "This is the first time in nearly three years that I haven't had to revise earnings downward for GTE and the 'Baby Bells,' " said Gregory R. Sawers, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "That may be an indication the economy is bottoming out." 
 On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., and one of the country's most widely held stocks, closed at $31.25, up 25 cents a share.
The operating results reflect GTE's planned sale of its Electrical Products Group, which sells Sylvania light bulbs as well as cutting tools and other products. The numbers also reflect payouts to preferred shareholders. Without these factors taken into account, final profit in the quarter rose 10.3 percent, to $515 million, or 57 cents a share, compared with $467 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier.
Earnings from discontinued operations, the Sylvania light bulb business, $34 million in the 1991 quarter and $32 million in the 1990 quarter, contributed to net income. But GTE said accounting practices required that income from a unit not yet sold or spun off to be treated as if it were already discontinued.
For the full year, GTE earned $1.58 billion, or $1.75 a share, down 8.1 percent from $1.72 billion, or $1.93 a share, for 1990. Full-year revenue totaled $19.62 billion, up 2.4 percent from $19.16 billion.
 
Growth in Cellular Phones
 GTE, which in addition to its vast local telephone company holdings is the second-largest cellular phone operator after McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., said customer growth continued robustly despite a lackluster economy. Some 84,000 new cellular customers were signed up in the fourth quarter, totaling 811,000 by the end of the year, slightly below the 820,000 expected by analysts. GTE's cellular subscribers increased by 37 percent from 594,000 a year earlier.
Cellular revenues reached $765 million in 1991, up 30 percent from $590 million a year earlier. GTE has about 52 million potential customers, the standard measure in the cellular industry, which includes adults, children and infants in the count.

HEADLINE: Bank Fund Yields Mixed

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit were mixed for the week ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.
"Major money center banks outside New York apparently believe that short-term certificate of deposit yields have touched bottom," Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. "By contrast, the Big Apple institutions are still reducing their yields slightly. In any case, rates definitely are leveling off nationwide, with the prospect of investors seeing only modest changes over the next several weeks. After that, the direction will be dictated by economic conditions." 
 Among New York-area commercial banks, the average money market account yields dropped 11 basis points, to 3.58 percent from 3.69 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percent point.
Among the savings institutions in the New York area, yields on money market accounts averaged 4.16 percent, off 7 basis points from a week ago.
For money market accounts, the steepest cut among area banks was made by Manufacturers Hanover, which lowered its rate by 51 basis points. The Connecticut National Bank led the way in cutting rates on its three- and six-month certificates of deposit, dropping them 20 and 21 basis points, respectively.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yield at 20 large banks outside the New York area had declined slightly -- 2 basis points, to 3.68 percent for money market accounts, and a basis point, to 3.87 on six-month certificates.
By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, the average rate at auction was 3.86 and 3.93 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: U.N. Study Assails the Way B.C.C.I. Was Shut by Western Central Banks

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The swift seizure and shutdown of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International last year by Western central bankers has undermined trade from several third world countries and increased the risk that depositors will suffer large losses, according to a United Nations research group.
The group, the United Nations Center on Transnational Corporations, was highly critical of the country-by-country settlements pursued by some Western nations. 
 The largest of these was in the United States, where the bank had comparatively few customers but assets of $550 million, which the Government seized. Under an agreement announced last December, American authorities have promised to put some of those assets in a fund for the bank's depositors worldwide, but only after all claims and penalties in the United States have been settled.
 
More for Victims Urged
 With a more coordinated, international settlement process, "a lot of innocent victims could have recovered more than they will,"
Peter Hansen, executive director of the United Nations group, said.
"We are not living in a world where an ad hoc club of the West should be handling these transnational issues alone," he said.
In its 24-page report, the center said that by simply shutting down the 70-nation banking network that financed international trade of $18 billion a year, the economic damage fell hardest on countries like Nigeria, Bangladesh and Zambia, where B.C.C.I. was an important institution. With credit lines frozen in the shutdown, many companies in third world countries have been forced to cut back sharply or go out of business.
 
Dividing the Bank
 The report, though not a public document, has been sent to some 60 central bankers worldwide. And while its authors say it is not intended to be a solution, it will certainly contribute to the debate about how international bank failures, like B.C.C.I.'s, should be handled in the future.
Instead of closing the bank entirely, the group said the bad loans and fraud-tainted portions of the bank should be separated from the rest, which should be kept in operation under the supervision of an internationally appointed group of trustees. "The uncompromised portions of B.C.C.I. could be kept going to enhance North-South trade," Mr. Hansen said.
The preferred approach, according to Clive Russell, a London accountant and member of the study group, would amount to "an international Chapter 11," a reference to the American bankruptcy law under which insolvent companies are allowed to operate under court protection.
Under the current liquidation plan, expected to be approved soon by a London court, depositors and creditors outside the United States will receive from 10 to 40 cents for every dollar they had with B.C.C.I. Devised by B.C.C.I.'s liquidator, Touche Ross in London, the plan calls for the Government of Abu Dhabi, the bank's main shareholder, to make a contribution of up to $2.2 billion in return for creditors agreeing to make no further claims on the emirate.
 
Dissatisfied Depositors
 One group of B.C.C.I. depositors, dissatisfied with the Touche Ross plan, has hired Paine Webber Inc., the American investment bank, to fashion an alternative settlement that involves a larger payout to depositors. A confidential Paine Webber proposal has been sent to Abu Dhabi for consideration, but it seems an 11th-hour effort.
One depositors' representative, who asked not to be identified, estimated that assuming a substantial contribution from Abu Dhabi and removing claims of those suspected to have participated in the B.C.C.I. fraud, legitimate depositors and creditors could recover 80 percent of their funds placed with the bank.
The participants in the United Nations study group included representatives from some of the third world countries most affected by the B.C.C.I. shutdown, including Nigeria, Jamaica, Zambia and Bangladesh.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Reduced Sentences
TAMPA, Fla., Feb. 4 (AP) -- A judge has reduced the sentences of three convicted Bank of Credit and Commerce International executives in return for help in the investigation of their superiors at the bank, according to court records.
A fourth convicted banker, Amjad Awan, still faces a 12-year term, but could get special consideration for his testimony in the drug trial of Manuel Noriega, the deposed Panamanian leader.
At the request of prosecutors, Federal District Judge William Terrell Hodges last week reduced the sentences of Akbar M. Bilgrami, 36 years old, a marketing officer in B.C.C.I.'s Miami branch, from 12 years to 6 years, 6 months; Syed A. Hussain, 31, who worked in B.C.C.I.'s Panama branch, from 7 years, 4 months to 3 years, 10 months; Sibte Hassan, 32, marketing director for B.C.C.I.'s Paris branch, from 3 years, 1 month to 2 years
Officials have not specified what information the three executives gave investigators on higher-ranking executives.

HEADLINE: Tax Proposals Can Backfire at First

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Like many medicines, the tax breaks proposed by the Administration to help nurse the economy back to health involve some temporary unpleasantness and annoying side effects. The President's advisers hope these will be minimal -- though one substantial impact has already emerged.
Almost inevitably, when it became clear in late autumn that the President would need to propose an economic rescue package, speculation mounted that it would probably include an incentive for corporate America to invest in modernization. And so Mr. Bush proposed last week a 15 percent investment tax allowance for new equipment bought between Feb. 1 and Dec. 31.
 
Expecting a Break
 
 The Government has repeatedly provided such a temporary spur; the latest version ended in 1986. So, business executives, expecting some kind of tax break this year, did the only rational thing. They deferred such plans, and orders for manufactured durable goods tumbled at a 5 percent annual pace in December, the biggest monthly decline in more than a year.
"Companies were well aware of the proposal for tax relief in 1992, and this clearly seems to have caused a 'wait and see' reaction by business," said Michael P. Niemira, an economist at Mitsubishi Bank in New York. And orders for January, too, he suggested "probably will remain depressed."
Then there are the various incentives for real estate, including the widely hailed 10 percent tax credit, up to $5,000, to encourage people who have not owned a home within the last three years to buy one. To get the credit, a sales contract must be signed this year but the transaction may be completed as late as mid-1993.
Since the residential real estate market was slowly perking up for much of last year, aided by falling prices and interest rates, it is less clear that talk of an incentive has caused substantial deferrals.
Still, even though the plan would apply retroactively to home purchases, beginning last Saturday, some buyers will sit tight while Congress debates the President's proposal and while the real estate industry invents a way, in effect, to turn the credit into an immediate benefit. Such aid could help to meet a down payment, which for many first-time buyers is the biggest obstacle to a purchase.
Some real estate brokers say they fear a chilling effect on the market while people try to figure the financial possibilities.
One sign that home buyers are paying close attention to tax implications came in reports from real estate brokers of wild scrambles by buyers to defer until this week closings that had been scheduled for late January.
 
A Matter of Timing

 
 The investment allowance and the home-buyer credit would both expire at the end of the year, a feature intended to spur early action, and distortions in activity could prove to be mostly a matter of shifting the time at which transactions occur.
One specific proposal, to abolish the tax exemption for certain kinds of annuities, has inspired a frenzy of buying by people wanting to get such annuities before Congress can act.
But some economists contend that putting any major tax proposal on the table introduces such general uncertainty that the economy could suffer damage that would not necessarily be made up.
Until, say, June or July, when the final outlines of legislation become clear, said Sung Won Sohn, head of an advisory panel of the American Bankers Association, the proposals could delay economic revival. "It will actually depress economic conditions in the meantime," said Mr. Sohn, who is chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "It's doing the opposite of what's intended."
Many in Washington, however, believe it will not be as long as June or July before a clear view of the legislation emerges, but that it could come in March or even late this month.
But in Mr. Sohn's view, shared by other members of his panel, the Administration plan invites an election-year bidding war that could well balloon the budget deficit, thereby frightening the bond market.
Indeed, interest rates on high-quality securities have already climbed in recent weeks by two-fifths of a percentage point from their lows, while rates on conventional mortgages have bounced back to 9 percent from a low of 8.25.
To be sure, the lowest mortgage rates in two decades set off a stampede to refinance, but there is no doubt that the market is also factoring in the risk that the competition to lavish benefits on voters could get out of control, as it did in 1981.
Other economists, however, are not so worried as Mr. Sohn. Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for the Chemical Banking Corporation, acknowledges that while orders for durable goods were no doubt delayed in advance of the Bush plan, the economy should be little harmed either in coming weeks or over the balance of the year.
This is because business activity is weak and because of broad sympathy on Capitol Hill for many, perhaps most, of the President's proposals. "It's not all one-sided" politically, Mr. Kellner said. "There's probably enough for both parties to like," thereby keeping legislative uncertainty to a minimum.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Lower On Signs of More Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday, as signs increased that interest rates would drop further, lowering the attractiveness of the currency.
Gold prices were also lower, closing at $356.20 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, down 50 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $355.70, off 5 cents an ounce. 
 Traders said the dollar fell in part because of comments by the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan. He told a Congressional committee that the central bank was considering further interest-rate cuts if needed as "additional insurance" to spur a sluggish economy.
Lower rates tend to make the dollar and dollar-denominated investments worth less relative to investments in other currencies.
The currency market is also concerned that the January unemployment figures, scheduled to be released on Friday, will provide a further impetus for a rate cut.
"People are expecting lower interest rates," said Urs Bernegger, the chief currency dealer at Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York.
A further drag on the dollar was the growing strength of the German mark. The currency has risen on the belief that a wage settlement reached on Monday with German steelworkers could be inflationary, preventing the Bundesbank from lowering the high interest rates that have supported the mark.
In European trading, the dollar fell to 1.5920 marks, from 1.5975 on Monday. In New York, the dollar brought 1.5931 marks, down from 1.6000 late on Monday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8010, from $1.7995 late on Monday. In New York, a pound cost $1.8015, more than $1.7961 late on Monday.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.60 yen to close at 126.25 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 126.10 yen. In New York, a dollar bought 126.15 yen, down from 126.20 late on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Friday, included: 1.4220 Swiss francs, down from 1.4265; 5.4270 French francs, down from 5.4525; 1,197 Italian lire, down from 1202.00, and 1.1814 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1753.
In London, gold fell to a late bid price of $356.35 an ounce, from $357.50 bid late on Monday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $356.05, from $356.85 late on Monday.
Markets in Hong Kong were closed yesterday for a national holiday. They will reopen on Friday.
On the Comex, silver bullion closed at $4.173 an ounce, up from $4.17 late on Monday. Silver rose in London to a late bid price of $4.18 an ounce, up from $4.16 on Monday.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Saatchi Sets Network for Health Care

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
LIKE pediatricians who move their offices closer to nursery schools, Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C. is changing the way it does business to exploit the rapid growth in health care.
Effective today, the London-based global advertising giant has formed Healthcom, a worldwide network of health-care agencies that previously operated as part of its two general international agency networks, Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide. 
 The consolidation, which establishes a single global brand name for the Saatchi agencies that focus on health care, creates the third-largest such international network, with billings of $214 million and income of $27 million. First is Medicus Intercon International Inc., owned by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in New York, followed by Sudler & Hennessey, owned by Young & Rubicam Inc. in New York.
"We looked at our various holdings," Richard F. O'Brien, vice chairman of Saatchi Worldwide, said in an interview at the agency's office in downtown Manhattan, "and decided that we had in place good health care agencies in most of the economies of the world."
"But they never had been knitted together into a cohesive, global force," he added. "Perhaps that time has come."
The consolidation, in development for six months, responds to a boom in health care advertising, which has surged as health care has expanded around the world. For instance, global sales of over-the-counter drugs, now about $23 billion, are expected to exceed $50 billion by 2000.
Billings in health care advertising are growing at an annual rate of about 9 percent, said Gary D. Landis, who has been named managing director of Healthcom, while there has been little or no growth in general advertising billings.
The consolidation also responds to the needs of clients, which are merging, amalgamating and forming strategic alliances at a feverish pace as they seek to become worldwide forces in marketing prescription and over-the-counter drugs, herbal and homeopathic remedies and even healthier, better-for-you foods that are advertised as if they were drugs.
Among such companies are Pfizer, which Healthcom has as a client in France, Germany and Britain; Upjohn, a Healthcom client in Canada, Spain and the United States, and Glaxo, a Healthcom client in France, Italy and Britain.
"The concept is simple," said Mr. Landis, who is 51 years old, a longtime Saatchi executive who joined Mr. O'Brien for the interview, "to create a global health care communications capability to service a global health care industry."
The consolidation, which Saatchi calls a joint venture of the two networks, involves eight agencies in eight countries: Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United States. Five had been under Backer's aegis and three under Saatchi Worldwide. Two other agencies in Australia and Japan, one from each network, are scheduled to come aboard around April.
In each case, the agency adds the prosaic Healthcom name, a telescoping of the words Healthcare Communications, to its existing name. For instance, Klemtner Advertising Inc. in New York, a health care agency from the Saatchi Worldwide network, with billings of about $125 million, is being rechristened Klemtner/Healthcom.
This is Saatchi's second amalgamation of services under a single banner in two months, following consolidation of its direct-marketing operations under the network of Kobs & Draft, formerly a Backer unit.
"In some of these specialized services, it doesn't make sense to maintain two competitive resources around the world," Mr. O'Brien said.
"Why have two," he added, "when one will do?"

Soaking Lawns, Not Taxpayers

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
FROM San Diego to Marin County, Californians are discovering the dubious pleasures of the drier life -- of 60-second showers, econo-flush toilets and gardening with waste water. Just punishment, one is told, for the hubris of building cities in the desert.
But economists and their sometime allies among savvy environmentalists see it differently: Even in the worst of droughts, argues Tom Graff, a lawyer at the Environmental Defense Fund, California should have enough water to go around. The real problem, he insists, is the failure to allow markets, rather than politicians and planners, to decide who gets what. 
 And happily for both parched urbanites and the wildlife that depends on runoff from mountain snows, Washington is listening. Congress is on the verge of overhauling the federally financed Central Valley Project, the source of one-quarter of California's total water supply. Farmers are likely to pay far more to get somewhat less Government water. But in return they will secure the right to sell their allotments to thirsty municipalities.
Uncle Sam has invested the equivalent of $3.77 billion in today's dollars to collect water from Northern California and deliver it to the central valleys. But according to a Senate staff analysis, the water has been priced so low that the Government has only managed to recoup a nickel for each dollar spent. Farmers typically fork over $20 to $30 for enough water to flood a football field a foot deep, while coastal communities scrounge in vain for new supplies at 10 times that price.
One obvious (though, arguably, inequitable) solution would be to create a market, permitting growers to sell their water rights to the highest urban bidders. Since agriculture now absorbs about 90 percent of all California water, just a modest fraction of rural supply would suffice to fill every bathtub and drench every lawn.
But the political web has proved too tangled to unravel in the obvious way. Some farmers see no reason to fix a system that from their perspective is not broken. Others would be delighted to take the money and run, but worry that the financial windfall would be challenged by both urban consumers and environmentalists who do not think the farmers appropriated the water fair and square.
That is where Congress fits in. Many of the original 40-year water contracts in the Central Valley Project are now expiring. And as chairman of a subcommittee on water, Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, is challenging the local authorities' right to renew on the old subsidized terms.
Mr. Bradley is not alone: He has a powerful ally in Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Committee. Legislation is thus likely to make it through the Senate this year. Once it does, it is expected to breeze through the House. The real question is what terms the growers can extract.
A best guess now is that roughly half the water will be guaranteed with subsidies-as-usual, with the rest going at sharply higher prices that are closer to the real cost of delivery. In return, irrigation districts would gain the clear legal right to sell water to urbanites.
Environmentalists may win a bonus in the form of a percentage set aside from each contract renewed, or a commitment to divert enough water to protect wildlife in periods of drought. Even if they do not, though, the environment will gain because pressures to tap environmentally fragile sources of new water would be relieved.
The right to sell water might induce some farmers to plant fewer acres -- a possible outcome that has led farm workers' unions to oppose water markets. A lot of water could be diverted, however, simply by planting less-thirsty crops. In 1988, some 215,000 acres were devoted to growing rice, a plant better suited to the monsoon-flooded fields of Thailand than the California desert. A lot more could be saved by reducing seepage from irrigation canals, and using more efficient irrigation techniques.
Paradoxically, analysts say the interests with the greatest potential for sabotaging the reform are probably those with the least tangible stake: the water bureaucrats.
Officials in the Interior Department, who have fought water-trading in the past, would presumably be forced to get with the program. But Federal contracts allocate water to irrigation districts, not individual farmers. And if some farmers oppose trades, water authorities may well balk at the initiative of the ones who prefer to green their bank accounts rather than their fields.
Planners, it seems, do not have to call each other comrade to share an aversion to free markets.

HEADLINE: A Restaurant Family Thrives, Always Together

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
ASK the Sindonis anything about their family -- who is related to whom, how many restaurants in New York are owned by their cousins, what life was like in Sicily -- and an extended debate, partly in Italian, ensues. But ask them for the secret of their successful restaurant dynasty, which has spawned five restaurants in seven years, and there is no dispute: Hard, hard work, and family ties.
It all begins, not surprisingly, with the mother, Maddalena, whose life has been alternating periods of tragedy and triumph. When her mother died in 1930, 4-year-old Maddalena was sent off to be raised by nuns because her father was unable to cope with a total of nine children. 
 Maddalena married and settled in her hometown, Palermo, but when she was in her 40's her husband died, leaving her with four children. Believing that Sicily offered no opportunities for a woman on her own, she moved to New York in 1973.
After years of work in factories and restaurants, Mrs. Sindoni and three of her children, Marcello, Vittorio and Mariella, opened a restaurant, Azzurro, in 1985. Since then, they have started three more in New York and one in Miami. Their second Miami restaurant will open this spring. The recessionhas hurt the restaurant business, but they are surviving and prospering.
"What makes them a success has a lot to do with their energy level," said Tony Chi, a New York restaurant designer who has done work for the Sindonis as well as a variety of clients, ranging from large companies like Pizzeria Uno to small ones, like Zen Palate. Mr. Chi says their family ties help them survive the recession.
"Believe me," he said, "they've seen better days. But they're dealing much better than everyone else because they are family. We have many clients who are dealing with it alone."
The Sindonis work from 9 or 10 in the morning until 11 or 12 at night. Maddalena is behind the cash register at Azzurro, an elegant but comfortable restaurant on 84th Street near Second Avenue that attracts an older clientele. It is managed by Vittorio, who is 33. Mariella, the 26-year-old daughter, presides over Baci, a lively, crowded place on Amsterdam Avenue near 79th Street.
Marcello, 37, is in charge of Vucciria, an airy setting on West Broadway between Spring and Prince Streets in SoHo that draws a mix of artists, tourists and stockbrokers. He also oversees the newest Sindoni venture, Meatballs, a three-month-old family-style restaurant in Miami.
A cousin, Massimo Scoditti, runs Brio, a chic, cozy restaurant on Lexington Avenue near 61st Street, in partnership with the Sindonis.
But if the entire family is considered, the empire is larger. Two of Maddalena Sindoni's sisters emigrated to New York, and both run restaurants. One, Erminia Lattanzi, who came here in 1966, owns five with her family: Lattanzi, on West 46th Street near Ninth Avenue; Tevere, on East 84th Street near Lexington Avenue; Erminia, on East 83d Street near Second Avenue; Va Bene, on Second Avenue near 82d Street, and Trastevere, in San Diego.
Another sister, Maria Carino, who came here in 1946, owns two restaurants in New York: Carino, on Second Avenue near 88th Street, and Via Oreto, on First Avenue near 61st Street. A cousin, Marlo Gitto, just opened Vespa, on 84th Street near Second Avenue.
When the Sindonis opened Azzurro with $50,000 in 1985, they raised half the money from relatives and half from the landlord. They also learned the business partly by working in restaurants owned by their cousins. The influence of family is so strong that Marcello Sindoni looks puzzled when asked whether he would go into business with a nonrelative. "No," he finally answers. "I don't believe in that. I never was in a position to go into business with a stranger."
None of the family members can fully explain why they have gravitated to the restaurant business. Circumstance and necessity played a part. "As an immigrant," said Vittorio Sindoni, "you are trying to accommodate yourself to whatever a city might offer."
Everyone in the family, though, clearly has a talent for the business. Their customers feel that someone really does care if they live, die, or return. They have an exuberance and a warmth that is immediately engaging. Twirling around Azzurro late one afternoon, Marcello Sindoni introduced himself: "It's Marcello, like Mastroianni, but without the money."
Almost all their food in New York is made from recipes Mrs. Sindoni used when her children were growing up -- Sicilian dishes like pasta con sarde, a robust mixture of sardines and fennel, and rigatoni con cavolfiori, which is pasta with cauliflower. The preparation is consistently competent: fish is moist, pasta is al dente and sauces are flavorful. Meatballs, their Miami restaurant, is Italian-American, with dishes like, well, meatballs. With red sauce.
In Sicily, Mrs. Sindoni routinely prepared two large meals a day; breakfast, generally just bread, was the only quick and easy meal. Money was scarce, so every bit of food had to be used well. "I remember when we would eat leftover pasta from the night before," said Marcello. "Fried with a little sugar on top. In those days, we did it because of need. Now, I do it because of pleasure."
Their cousins also trace their inspiration to their mother, Erminia Lattanzi. Paolo Lattanzi, the head chef for his family's restaurants, said his mother had a genius for creating something from nothing. "She could make dessert from eggplant," he said.
The Lattanzis lived in Rome, near the Jewish section, and their food reflects their roots; two of their restaurants are kosher. The Sindonis grew up in Sicily; their food, too, reflects their roots.
Although few customers go to the Sindoni restaurants just because the food is Sicilian, those who do are taken home by the experience. "They come up to me and say, 'It reminds me of when my mother used to cook the same food,' " Mrs. Sindoni said.
Anna-Teresa Callen, a cooking teacher who leads tours to Sicily, said the Sindonis were cooking food both genuine and good. Before they came here, she said, "What passed for Sicilian food was something that was not Sicilian at all."
Mr. Chi, the designer, said the Sindonis operate in very old-style ways. "They really believe in trust," he said. "I have never had any paper work with them. I treasure that."
Watching over everything, he said, is Mrs. Sindoni. "I call her the insurance company," he said. "She's superconservative because of her hard life in Italy." Her role, he said, is to provide moral support and keep the family together.
Mariella Sindoni said: "We're all very close and very warm. When people come in, they feel that."
Keeping customers is tough in this recession, though, and lately the Sindonis have had to work harder for less. Business has dropped 30 to 40 percent over the last few years. To draw more people, they cut their prices at Azzurro by $3 a dish, which lowered the average check to about $30 a person. They save on expenses by using fewer employees and persuading landlords to lower rent bills.
At least twice a month, the three Sindoni siblings meet with their mother to talk about business. One can never really know what transpires at these meetings. "We get spanked," Vittorio said.
Marcello added, "We ask for the raise she doesn't give us."
Their affection for their mother is palpable. They remember how hard life was as new immigrants and how she struggled to keep them together in a new and hostile country. Vittorio Sindoni remembers how Queens looked to him at 14, when he arrived from Palermo: "It was very close, very ugly. No one understood me."
Their mother believed they would eventually be better off, but it was years before they felt comfortable. "For five years," Mariellasaid, "we always had the luggage down."
She remembers her mother going off to work each day in a shirt factory. "I would say, 'Mama, come back, I want to tell you something,' " she said. "I would just hug her and hug her, and finally, after 10 times of calling her back, I would let her go."
Now the Sindonis feel like Americans. Their homeland has become rich enough to keep its young people at home; these days, the immigrants who work in kitchens are primarily from Central and South America. And Marcello, passing on what he has learned, teaches them to cook the dishes of his childhood.

HEADLINE: Book Notes;
Heathcliff and Huck Going Way of Scarlett

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
Literary trespassers are out there this coming book season, sneaking back into works of fiction that the original authors had finished and closed off.
First, there was the enormously successful "Scarlett" (Warner Books), in which, with the consent of Margaret Mitchell's estate, Alexandra Ripley poached the characters from "Gone With the Wind" and took them to Ireland and back. Now, readers will find that Huck Finn has grown up and will learn what happened to Heathcliff when he left Wuthering Heights. 
 Is no literary legend safe? Will future authors borrow Oliver Twist and turn him into a successful banker, or have a surgeon perform a miraculous operation on Anna Karenina and have her enter a convent in penance?
Lin Haire-Sargeant, who has written "H.: The Story of Heathcliff's Journey Back to Wuthering Heights," to be published in the summer by Pocket Books, said she thought of her book as a homage to Emily Bronte's classic, not as a ripoff.
"Art often refers to other art," said Ms. Haire-Sargeant, who teaches English at the University of Massachusetts-Boston and says she has had a lifelong obsession with Emily Bronte and her sister Charlotte. "I think this kind of writing is fair as long as the author has something legitimate to add. I think Heathcliff has become a kind of literary myth, and I often found myself wondering what happened to him in the years he was gone."
Richard White, a high school teacher from Nashua, N.H., said he found himself similarly curious about the man Huckleberry Finn became and decided that the only way he would ever find out what happened to him "was to write it myself."
Which he did, in "Mister Grey, or the Further Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," due out this spring from the publisher Four Walls Eight Windows.
"I think of Huck Finn as America's child," Mr. White said. "And not to be tedious, but he is what we were, and I always wondered whether he made it to the territories ahead of everyone else."
But in Mr. White's hands, Huck is no more the mischievous eternal child. He is now, as the catalogue copy says, "a grown man, strapping two six-shooters, lording it over a cowboy town in Wyoming in the 1880's."
When Warner Books published "Scarlett" last fall, it made few pretenses that the venture was anything but commercial. Scarlett O'Hara was, in effect, a brand name on which Warner was capitalizing, and Margaret Mitchell's wishes that the "Gone With the Wind" saga end with her final period were blatantly ignored. The authors and publishers of "H." and "Mister Grey" say they are counting on readers' identification with established characters, but they take umbrage at the suggestion that they are coasting on an established literary success.
"These are figures who have entered into the American cultural vocabulary," said John Oakes, a co-publisher of Four Walls Eight Windows. "I don't think of it as lazy. I think of it as playful."
And in keeping with what has become a genre unto itself, it's not only literary characters whose lives are fictitiously fleshed out in new books. This spring, Hyperion plans to publish "Clairvoyant: The Imagined Life of Lucia Joyce," a novel by Alison Leslie Gold about James Joyce's schizophrenic daughter, and HarperCollins is planning "Queen of Desire," a novel by Sam Toperoff that imagines certain crises in the life of Marilyn Monroe.
 
Moving Forward at Viking
 Al Silverman has been publisher and editor in chief of Viking for less than a week. The letterhead still lists his previous title, vice president and contributing editor of Penguin U.S.A., and the Viking-Penguin switchboard operators still identify him the same way.
But Mr. Silverman said he and his staff had already thought about the new program on which Viking would focus under his leadership. The publishing house has firm credentials in literature, he said, naming two writers he inherited when he came to the company in 1989 as an editor: Robertson Davies and William Kennedy.
"What we are going to do now is focus more tightly on serious American nonfiction in history and current affairs," said Mr. Silverman, previously the chairman and chief executive of the Book-of-the-Month Club. "We don't think that Random House and Simon & Schuster should corner that market, and we are going to be more aggressive in forming ideas for nonfiction books and recruiting particular authors to write them."
Penguin U.S.A. has weathered difficult financial times in the last two years. Profits fell in 1990, and the company went through several executive changes and reorganizations that included layoffs, economizing and scaling back on the number of books published.
But in 1991 the company had the best fourth quarter in its history, said John F. Moore, president of Penguin U.S.A., and Mr. Silverman said he believes he has been given the editorial and financial support for his aggressive new mandate.
"We've come through the fire in the last six months," he said. "We're more than ready to move forward."
 
More Joyce and Sexton
 The "new" new edition of James Joyce's "Ulysses" is to be published by W. W. Norton. The book is part of a series, "The Dublin Edition of the Works of James Joyce," being edited by Dr. John Kidd, director of the James Joyce Research Center at Boston University. Dr. Kidd caused a literary scandal several years ago when he charged that a much-hailed new edition of "Ulysses" produced by a team of German scholars was riddled with errors. . . . Houghton Mifflin is trying to ride the coattails of the critical and commercial success of "Anne Sexton: A Biography" by Diane Wood Middlebrook by reissuing "Anne Sexton: A Self-Portrait in Letters," edited by Sexton's daughter, Linda Gray Sexton, and Lois Ames. The new edition contains a forward by Linda Sexton addressing some of the controversy created by the Middlebrook biography, which drew on confidential tapes of psychiatric sessions between the poet and her doctor.

City Opera Ensemble Does 'Tosca' in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
For one Manhattanite, a trip to the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College on Saturday evening to hear the New York City Opera National Company perform "Tosca" was a sentimental journey. In the mid-1960's, a touring production of "Tosca" by the New York City Opera at the University of Wisconsin in Madison furnished this critic's first experience of live opera.
A quarter-century of subsequent performances have obliterated almost any memory of that original "Tosca" beyond the fact that the staging was, understandably, rudimentary. Such was the case here, too. In Dona D. Vaughn's economical and tightly unified production, the basic layout remained the same for all three acts, with a wall sloping down and back from the right side of the stage and a few props focusing the action to the left and center. 
 Still, for all its simplicity, the physical setting had a sophisticated look. Miguel Romero's scenery was richly evocative, right down to the splashes of color in Scarpia's study, blood-red yet not garish. Joseph A. Citarella's costumes were also attractive, and Mark W. Stanley's lighting imparted a subtle, haunting glow to the last act.
Musically, it must be inferred, that ancient "Tosca" cannot have been altogether discouraging for a neophyte. But for a more experienced listener, there was cause for disgruntlement on Saturday, mainly in the pit. Joseph Colaneri, the touring company's music director, conducted with scant regard for his young singers or for the problematic acoustics of Whitman Hall. His 31-member orchestra produced a loud and aggressively articulated curtain of sound that stifled the voices for entire phrases.
Under these circumstances, the lead singers, drawn from the company's rotating pool, fared reasonably well. Nina Warren was especially effective as Tosca despite an occasional hard edge to her soprano, or perhaps because of it, since it helped her carry over the orchestra with fair consistency. There was also an appropriately vulnerable side to both her characterization and her singing.
Kenneth Shaw was less fortunate vocally. His baritone was slightly recessed to begin with, and the constant challenges from the pit seemed to wear him down in the second act. Antonio Adame was uneven as Cavaradossi, producing a few raw, forced high notes and some tremulous vibrato but rising admirably to "E lucevan le stelle."
The rest of the cast sang passably and acted indifferently. Mr. Shaw's coiling and slithering Scarpia seemed to set the dramatic tone, and the action seldom rose above posing and caricature.
The production is sung in Italian with English supertitles. Currently in New England, it will continue to tour through March 28.

Seattle Group Displays Major Show of Support

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH

 BODY:
The Governor of the state of Washington and the Mayor of Seattle met with major league baseball officials yesterday to try to persuade them that there is sufficient business and community support to keep the struggling Mariners in the city.
To that end, the Seattle contingent promised to supply major league baseball with details of a three-year, $39 million advertising and ticket-sale revenue package today. 
 The group did so after receiving assurances from Commissioner Fay Vincent that the Mariners would remain in Washington for the 1992 season, even though the present owner has put the team up for sale.
Not discussed in the meeting, however, was the other issue looming over the Seattle situation: how baseball will act upon a bid by a Japanese company to buy a controlling interest in the Mariners.
That issue will come up tomorrow when baseball's ownership committee meets to address the $100 million bid by a group backed by the Nintendo Company of Japan. Even though Vincent has several times repeated the owners' policy against ownership outside North America, he said in an interview Monday that the owners "may change it."
"They may revise it or interpret it in other ways," he added. "I think that the ownership is going to be interested in accommodating all interests."
The policy, Vincent indicated, is in fact a set of guiding principles based on what he thinks is an ownership concensus favoring hometown ownership and opposing sale to foreign interests.
 
Going to the Community
 As for yesterday's meeting, he noted that the Seattle officials arranged it about two months ago to report on their progress in raising enough money to assure that any owner, whether it is the current owner, Jeff Smulyan, or someone else, feels secure enough to leave the team where it is.
"This meeting was not held to discuss any ownership group, but rather to discuss what the community can do to retain baseball," Vincent said.
Smulyan put the team up for sale on Dec. 9 and gave local interests a deadline of March 27 before he would begin entertaining bids from outside the area. Potential owners from the Tampa-St. Petersburg area have expressed interest in the team. In all practicality, the deadline would not allow the team to be sold and moved before the 1992 season is under way.
The specifics of the revenue package were not disclosed yesterday, but Herman Sarkowsky, a Seattle businessman, said they would be made public today.
"We have finally been able to focus the attention of the Seattle business community on the Seattle Mariners," said Sarkowsky, a former owner of the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League and the founder of the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association. "The goal we had was to increase the revenue stream by $13 million a year. That has been accomplished."
Mayor Norman Rice said, "We're here to show that there is strong community support for the team in Seattle, that we have a package that's very strong and can be moved forward."
Before meeting with the Seattle group which included Governor Booth Gardner of Washington, Vincent talked at length about a situation that remains complex.
"It's a very difficult set of issues, but I think that people will work at it," Vincent said. "I continue to think that the best course is for the team to stay in Seattle. I just don't know if that's going to be possible. Seattle has been a very difficult issue for the better part of a year but now it's interlaced with the international issue."
That second set of concerns arose Jan. 23 when the Nintendo Company of Japan announced it would be the major stockholder in a group bidding for the Mariners.
 
Presentation Called Important
 Meanwhile, Vincent termed the Seattle presentation important because he said: "I have always thought that the only perfect answer from baseball's point of view would be for the team to stay there with proper community support locally. We have to look at that issue very carefully as well."
Gardner and other Seattle representatives obviously think that there are threats greater than those baseball feels are posed by offshore interests.
"The only foreign investor I'm concerned about is Tampa Bay," Gardner said at a recent news conference in Washington, referring to groups in Tampa and St. Petersburg, Fla., interested in buying the team should Seattle not meet the financial stipulations set by Smulyan by the owners imposed deadline of March 27.
On Monday, Gardner stated anew the arguments to save the Japanese bid as well as the Mariners. "My own gut feeling is that all the ingredients are there," Gardner told The Associated Press. "If the mix is wrong, if people are concerned about the percentage of ownership, I think that can be dealt with. We should be able to come up with a way to do it, a formula."
 
Sullivan Sums Up Position
 Few of the owners of the other 25 major league clubs have been willing to articulate the reasons for baseball's policy against investment outside North America or even state publicly what the policy is. Haywood Sullivan, general partner of the Boston Red Sox and a member of the owners' executive council, summed up what he believes to be the general reasoning behind the owners' decision on foreign investors.
"It's to try to control your own business within your own confines," Sullivan said. "This would have applied whether you had somebody from Germany or Mexico or Brazil or Japan involved in it."
But Sullivan, like other baseball executives, was not surprised that the first major overture came from Japan, or that it raised the resolve of those opposed to foreign interests. "Their economy is flourishing so fast and everything is going in such a rapid, rapid pace, that it might be conceived that maybe it would have overrun us in a lot of aspects," Sullivan said.

Vanbiesbrouck Hopes To Stay With Rangers

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RYE, N.Y., Feb. 4

 BODY:
No current Ranger wore the Blue Shirt before John Vanbiesbrouck, who played his first game with the team in 1981 at the age of 18. And if unrelenting trade speculation has any validity, no current Ranger could leave sooner than Vanbiesbrouck, who shares the lesser half of the goalie position with Mike Richter.
In the meantime, Vanbiesbrouck will probably guard the net again Wednesday night when the Rangers return home to protect their various peaks and streaks against the Penguins at Madison Square Garden. 
 Richter is still ailing with an injury first described as a deep thigh bruise and now called a pulled thigh muscle. The Rangers have four consecutive victories and have gone seven games without a defeat. They lead the Patrick Division and have the best overall record in the National Hockey League.
 
Vanbiesbrouck on a Roll
 And Vanbiesbrouck, the winning goalie in the last three games, is coming off what may have been the best game of his career. When the team finished a 4-0-1 road trip Saturday night with a 2-1 victory at Minnesota, Vanbiesbrouck stopped 40 shots. Some saves, like the diving glove grab on Brian Propp in the final minute, were the kind that cause fans to slap their foreheads with the palms of their hands.
"I'd like to think that it was one of my best games, that's for sure," Vanbiesbrouck said today after practice. Told that his save on Propp would probably make many highlight films, Vanbiesbrouck replied: "That's nice. I usually make the post-game reels as the goalie being scored upon."
While that is an exaggeration, there certainly have been such moments. The worst was last season, in a game at Pittsburgh in late March, when Vanbiesbrouck lost control of a soft shot by Kevin Stevens and let the puck squirt past him for the winning goal in overtime.
At the time, the Rangers were plunging from first place, en route to a first-round playoff elimination; the Penguins were on their way to a division title and a Stanley Cup. Vanbiesbrouck and Richter had been rotating until then, but, after that, Vanbiesbrouck clearly became No. 2.
 
Mutual Respect
 Richter has played in 31 games this season and Vanbiesbrouck 28. Richter is 18-7-2 with a 2.96 goals-against average. Vanbiesbrouck is 16-10-0 and 3.22. The trade rumors continue because few teams have such a good pair of goaltenders. The theory is that with their best shot at the Stanley Cup since they reached the finals in 1979, the Rangers could trade Vanbiesbrouck for one or two skaters to add the scoring and checking depth they will need in the later rounds.
Vanbiesbrouck remains on good terms with Richter and he is philosophical about his predicament.
 
'It's Strictly Business'
 "It's strictly business and you can't let your business relationship interfere with the personal side," he said. "I definitely do not want to leave. I don't think the grass is going to be greener on the other side. This team is very chemically balanced right now. I would hate to be the guy to lessen the chemistry."
Vanbiesbrouck is playing out the option year of his contract. He could move to another team next season on his own, depending on the free-agency rules of the collective bargaining agreement now being discussed.
"Economically, I have to do what is best for my family," he said. "They always come first."
 
 
SLAP SHOTS
 Coach ROGER NEILSON of the Rangers said MIKE RICHTER has "a little muscle pull" in his thigh and might practice Thursday for the first time in a week. He could play Friday in Washington, Neilson said. The backup at practice Tuesday was BORIS ROUSSON, up from Binghamton. . . . The team scrimmaged for the first time this season, with uniformed officials and a scoreboard clock. . . . MIKE GARTNER didn't skate because of a sore knee and Neilson said "we're not going to take any chances" by bringing him back too soon.
Defenseman PAUL COFFEY has pulled a hip muscle and will miss the Pittsburgh Penguins' game Wednesday night with the Rangers. Coffey joined MARIO LEMIEUX and JAROMIR JAGR on the sideline. Lemieux has a herniated back muscle and Jagr has been suspended for bumping a referee. "I pulled it about a week ago, and it's not getting any better," Coffey said Tuesday after missing practice in Pittsburgh.

'We Have to Do It With Manufacturing'

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
"I think the U.S. has every reason to be extremely proud of what it's accomplished over the last 50 years. We've done tremendous things for the world. Now we have to think about ourselves a little, but not step totally away from the world issues. The unfortunate thing is that as we've been altruistic, other economic regions, particularly Europe and the Pacific rim, have been able to focus their energies on economic competitiveness, so we find ourselves disadvantaged.
 "The little corner of the world that I'm interested in changing is manufacturing capability. The United States has lost its ability to manufacture competitive products today. It's particularly true when we're talking of high-volume, low-cost manufacturing, the kind of thing that has made TV's and VCR's so popular today. 
 "We don't know how to design a product; We Don't know how to manufacture it once it's designed. This is our biggest technological problem. The answer is to get a group of ocmpanies together, involve the Government and cooperate in systemic and generic manufacturing. If we don't rebuild our industry, we can't remain a leading country. We can't do it with nuclear weapons now. We have to do it with manufacturing.
 "The big science projects we're thinking about are good ones. But they should be global projects. The human genome. The superconducting supercollider. The manned exploration of Mars is something we can't pass up. But those are things we ought to do as a planet. We don't have to be macho and do it ourselves any more."

Plan to Share Sites Seems a Long Stretch

BYLINE: By ALLAN GOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COURCHEVEL, France, Feb. 4

 BODY:
To help offset the surging cost of staging the Olympics, future Games may be held in several regions of a country or in even more than one country, the president of the International Olympic Committee said today.
But one city would continue to have overall responsibility for an Olympics, said Juan Antonio Samaranch, in a speech at the opening ceremony of the committee's 98th session. 
 In the speech, Samaranch also said that the Olympic movement's primary concern in the future would be insuring that the environment is protected, attempting to defuse growing criticism of the way in which some Olympic sites are constructed.
Olympic Games cost host cities and countries hundreds of millions of dollars and it is a constant struggle to break even.
Several towns in the Savoy region here nearly went bankrupt by renovation expenses in preparation for the Albertville Winter Games, which begin Saturday and are stretched over an area of more than 600 square miles.
 
Questions Arise
 Samaranch's idea will to some extent be tested in these Games. But the possibility of an Olympics that extends beyond national borders with venues spread even farther apart raises questions about whether visitors will support Olympic Games where events could be hundreds of miles apart, and whether intraregion or international cooperation is even realistic.
Also reinforced is the idea that the huge worldwide television audience that Olympic Games attract is becoming more important than the convenience of people who come to watch the Games in person or the sense of community that evolves at Games where participants are close to one another.
Already, the possibility of spectator disenchantment has been raised in these Games.
"In choosing the Savoy town and the whole Tarentaise Valley behind it," Samaranch said, "the International Olympic Committee knew what it was letting itself, and the organizers, in for."
There are 13 Olympic venues sprawled over an area nearly twice the area of New York City. The Olympic sites include 53 miles from Albertville, the site of opening and closing ceremonies as well as skating events, to Val d'Isere, where most Alpine skiing competition will be held.
 
Catching a Lift
 Few people disagree that it is an unwieldy arrangement. Traffic can be a problem here in the best of weather, but it remains to be seen how smoothly the Games will proceed in conditions like today, when snow fell and the fastest way to get around was on a ski lift.
But Samaranch today applauded the Albertville organizing committee for overcoming obstacles posed by geography, economics and politics and said its work had "served us well by opening up new possibilities."
Addressing another issue of increasing importance to the Olympic Committee, Samaranch pledged that environmental concerns would be taken into account when cities were selected for Olympic Games. Committee reports on candidate cities will contain a section on ecological impact.
 
'Attached to Nature'
 "The Olympic movement has a very clear position on the subject: We are very deeply attached to nature," Samaranch said. "Our entire culture is rooted in it. It is and has always been in nature that sport can thrive most happily. This is especially true of snow and ice sports."
Samaranch noted that the committee had altered its construction plans for an Olympic museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, to save a hundred-year-old oak tree. Nonetheless, advocates for the environment would assert that the committee's position is rather late in coming.

HEADLINE: Toward a Policy That's No Longer Foreign

BYLINE: By Roger Morris; Roger Morris, author of "Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician," was on the staff of the National Security Council under Presidents Johnson and Nixon.

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
As is the case with all triumphs, America's cold war victory brings with it new difficulties. None is more troubling than the gathering irrelevance of U.S. foreign policy.
Militarily, America has emerged unrivaled, yet much of our arsenal is destabilizing, unusable and irrelevant in new tasks of national security. Economically, the Soviet defeat is complete, yet the cold war era also devoured our own productivity, real income and competitiveness, leaving a malignant gap between rich and poor and disgraceful and dangerous social conditions. Politically, we led a successful anti-Soviet alliance, yet the victors now bicker, with no collective security against a threatening depletion of environment and resources. 
 Not least are the moral costs: abroad, a bitter legacy of our many interventions; at home, a democracy diminished by national security demagogy and extra-constitutional acts, still governed by garrison-state conformity and myopia. America is neither the power nor the ideal that began the cold war 45 years ago.
Ominously, the real global revolution of our epoch is only beginning. We now face simultaneous upheavals that are far more momentous than the Communist challenge: in technology, weapons proliferation, population growth and migration, economic and political aspiration, national disintegration, resource scarcity and environmental decay -- all culminations of the old imperial, industrial orders that symbolically climaxed in the fall of the Soviet Union. It is indeed a new world, yet without its own order -- or an American policy for living securely within it.
Our victory at least releases us from a Faustian choice between ideals and interests, principle and pragmatism. In the cold war, we often sacrificed what was right for what was expedient. A redeeming irony of this new era is that its realities make principles pragmatic and ideals not only affordable but essential. National security in the post-cold war period comes with policy that is no longer foreign.
In a properly enlightened Washington, that policy would rest on a new trinity of military, economic and political-scientific security.
Militarily, the U.S. would forge ahead of the post-Soviet commonwealth in reducing strategic and conventional arms. To hoard a vast nuclear advantage amid Russian decline would be a Versailles-like peace, provoking eventual revision. To prevent that tragedy, we would go well beyond current negotiations that leave America's preponderance unredressed. America would initiate sweeping cuts in strategic weapons, sponsor dismantling of superpower and allied arsenals and set a timetable for verified demilitarization of the cold war victor as well as vanquished.
We would spur a new coalition for similar elimination of the nuclear Saturday Night specials: the existing or would-be arsenals of South Africa, Syria, Israel, China, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, the two Koreas and Iran as well as Iraq. Nothing so threatens peace as these anachronistic, apocalyptic weapons, relics of a vanished era.
We would recognize that conventional arms also consume our common future. The U.S. would cease trafficking in 40 percent of the world's munitions, stop giving or loaning $100 billion for military purchases, press Russia to embargo its share of the two-thirds of the arms trade we conduct together. On a planet where poor nations squander $50 billion a year on weapons, we would shed old military clients and quarantine arms merchants as we once checked fascist and Communist aggressors. And with billions of dollars saved by that new containment, America would invest in equally essential commercial security.
Economically, we would respond to a multipolar world with international trade and domestic industrial policies as concerted as was our commitment in the cold war. Gauging the mercantilist policies of our partner-competitors, their discipline of capital and labor, we would mount a comprehensive public investment strategy, promoting a new preparedness economically, educationally and fiscally.
America would continue its devotion to free trade, yet would strategically manage domestic markets and international businesses, preventing the exploitation of people and the environment at home and abroad as a matter of national interest. We would understand that security depends not only on a dynamic domestic economy but on the well-being of all nations.
We would see clearly that we cannot live safely in a world where four billion to five billion people are excluded from economic opportunity, where there persists an immense transfer of wealth from poor countries to rich, where third world babies are grown on farms to provide organ transplants for first world customers, where 11 million children die every year and there are 200 new corpses each minute in what the World Health Organization calls a "silent genocide" of preventable famine and disease, where the smoking shantytowns of the forgotten surround shrinking enclaves of affluence.
Washington would promote worldwide reinvestment in human capital, in education, jobs and land reform in the poorer nations. Using the billions now spent on third world arms, it would be a bargain, high dividend purchase of new security: international economic justice and the resulting stability would create vast new markets for U.S. goods and services.
As a third principle, the U.S. would organize a collective body to oversee environmental action, with planetary management of resources and technology. This world alliance would mobilize scientific and managerial talent to confront crises of climate and conservation, population and pollution. It would address dangerous imbalances of technology and resources, mass population migrations and the spurting growth of sovereignties.
Like cold war alliances, such a collective would be integral to U.S. security. It would epitomize international cooperation amid exploding nationalism and open new avenues for U.S. science, technology and business.
World revolutions now surround a Washington that is paying lip service to change, yet mired in spent missions -- bureaucracies defying the death of their raison d'etre. A stagnant Foreign Service was crudely politicized in the Reagan-Bush years. Exposed by recent hearings, the C.I.A. stands derelict in insight and integrity. For senior officialdom, Republicans draw on stock-option bureaucrats revolving between public office and consulting for the highest bidder, and the Democrats from a similarly dubious if dogged regime-in-waiting.
Intellectually, our security needs in the 1990's are plain -- new sensibility to the cultural, demographic, economic and environmental waves breaking over us, a fresh conceptualization of diversity and globalism. That creativity makes obsolete a venal establishment. Above all, national security requires a more open, representative foreign policy, a new generation of thinkers and doers.
We may continue to have a divided, poisoned planet, to remain a debt- and caste-ridden America, for a while at least. Or we may choose an era of secure diversity, equitable endowment, true community.
Policy no longer foreign would fulfill that poignant promise of George Washington, of an America not safe or prosperous by what it possessed but in what it was -- "a nation," he hoped, "which would have a meliorating influence on all mankind."

Evan's Two Moms

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
Evan has two moms. This is no big thing. Evan has always had two moms -- in his school file, on his emergency forms, with his friends. "Ooooh, Evan, you're lucky," they sometimes say. "You have two moms." It sounds like a sitcom, but until last week it was emotional truth without legal bulwark. That was when a judge in New York approved the adoption of a 6-year-old boy by his biological mother's lesbian partner. Evan. Evan's mom. Evan's other mom. A kid, a psychologist, a pediatrician. A family.
The matter of Evan's two moms is one in a series of events over the last year that lead to certain conclusions. A Minnesota appeals court granted guardianship of a woman left a quadriplegic in a car accident to her lesbian lover, the culmination of a seven-year battle in which the injured woman's parents did everything possible to negate the partnership between the two. A lawyer in Georgia had her job offer withdrawn after the state Attorney General found out she and her lesbian lover were planning a marriage ceremony; she's brought suit. The computer company Lotus announced that the gay partners of employees would be eligible for the same benefits as spouses. 
 Add to these public events the private struggles, the couples who go from lawyer to lawyer to approximate legal protections their straight counterparts take for granted, the AIDS survivors who find themselves shut out of their partners' dying days by biological family members and shut out of their apartments by leases with a single name on the dotted line, and one solution is obvious.
Gay marriage is a radical notion for straight people and a conservative notion for gay ones. After years of being sledgehammered by society, some gay men and lesbian women are deeply suspicious of participating in an institution that seems to have "straight world" written all over it.
But the rads of 20 years ago, straight and gay alike, have other things on their minds today. Family is one, and the linchpin of family has commonly been a loving commitment between two adults. When same-sex couples set out to make that commitment, they discover that they are at a disadvantage.
No joint tax returns. No health insurance coverage for an uninsured partner. No survivor's benefits from Social Security. None of the automatic rights, privileges and responsibilities society attaches to a marriage contract. In Madison, Wis., a couple who applied at the Y with their kids for a family membership were turned down because both were women. It's one of those small things that can make you feel small.
Some took marriage statutes that refer to "two persons" at their word and applied for a license. The results were court decisions that quoted the Bible and embraced circular argument: marriage is by definition the union of a man and a woman because that is how we've defined it.
No religion should be forced to marry anyone in violation of its tenets, although ironically it is now only in religious ceremonies that gay people can marry, performed by clergy who find the blessing of two who love one another no sin. But there is no secular reason that we should take a patchwork approach of corporate, governmental and legal steps to guarantee what can be done simply, economically, conclusively and inclusively with the words "I do."
"Fran and I chose to get married for the same reasons that any two people do," said the lawyer who was fired in Georgia. "We fell in love; we wanted to spend our lives together." Pretty simple.
Consider the case of Loving v. Virginia, aptly named. At the time, 16 states had laws that barred interracial marriage, relying on natural law, that amorphous grab bag for justifying prejudice. Sounding a little like God throwing Adam and Eve out of paradise, the trial judge suspended the one-year sentence of Richard Loving, who was white, and his wife, Mildred, who was black, provided they got out of the state of Virginia.
In 1967 the Supreme Court found such laws to be unconstitutional. Only 25 years ago and it was a crime for a black woman to marry a white man. Perhaps 25 years from now we will find it just as incredible that two people of the same sex were not entitled to legally commit themselves to one another. Love and commitment are rare enough; it seems absurd to thwart them in any guise.

HEADLINE: Indonesia Acts on East Timor Killings

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Tiananmen in East Timor" (editorial, Jan. 21) leaves the erroneous impression that the response of the Indonesian Government to the tragic killings in Dili last Nov. 12 has been the same as that of Beijing: arrogant indifference and domestic cover-up. This is not the case, as you report Dec. 27 and Dec. 29, and as has been covered in, for instance, the Far Eastern Economic Review. 
 An independent, civilian-dominated investigating commission reported to President Suharto of Indonesia that the Army was culpable for the use of "excessive force" and lack of discipline in crowd control. The commission's version of the Dili killings was much more like that of the eyewitnesses and supported the conclusions of Gov. Mario Carrascalao of East Timor, who blamed the military.
Unlike the stony intransigence of China's masters, President Suharto, on receiving the report, instructed that it be released to the press. Within two days he had sacked the military commander in Timor and the Bali-based military commander of the military district under which the East Timor command falls. Furthermore, a separate commission has been set up to determine whether and what charges should be brought against individual military personnel before a military tribunal.
Perhaps the United States position on the killings at least partly reflects Indonesia's prompt investigation and assignment of ultimate responsibility to senior military officers, rather than, as you suggest, cold-war concerns about offending a large, friendly Asian country.
We can hope that the Indonesian self-examination of the Dili tragedy will prompt a broader review of development and integrationist policy in the province, as well as addressing the question of civil-military relations.

Chess
Masters Theater
310 Riverside Drive, at 103d Street
Manhattan
Through Feb. 23
 
Music by Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus; book and lyrics by Tim Rice; directed by David Taylor; scenery by Tony Castrigno; lighting by John Hastings; costumes by Deborah Rooney; new arrangements and orchestrations by Phil Reno; sound by Creative Audio Design; production stage manager, Doug Fogel; assistant director and choreographer, Madeline Paul. Presented by the Artists' Perspective, in association with Chess Players Ltd.
WITH: Bob Frisch, Jan Horvath, Patrick Jude, Kathleen Rowe McAllen, J. Mark McVey and Ray Walker. 
 "Chess," the board-game musical, is working its way back to a record album. After previous elaborate incarnations in London and on Broadway, the show reopened Off Broadway in what is supposed to be the new, improved, definitive version. It is shorter, which is the most complimentary thing that can be said about this continually misfiring musical.
This is, as you may remember, a show by Tim Rice without Andrew Lloyd Webber, with music written by Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus. When "Chess" was first done in London in 1986 it had a certain novelty, but it was already dated in its treatment of global politics. Today, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, it is a lukewarm leftover of the cold war.
Unless one has seen an earlier, more detailed production, it might be difficult to know what all the singing-shouting is about. Mr. Rice has jettisoned Richard Nelson's Broadway book and its top-heavy subplot in favor of a show that has more singing and less speaking. The simplification highlights the score, which is a pop pastiche that veers between the pleasant and the argumentative while evoking familiar strains. But because of the shorthand style of storytelling, the politics seems even more confusing.
While trying to be economical, David Taylor's production becomes reductive. In London, the set was an enormous hydraulic chessboard, which was raised and lowered to symbolize the tilt in the power struggle (obvious but eyecatching). On Broadway, the characters played hide and seek around monolithic towers. Now the stage is dominated by a bleacherlike staircase, which might be used for a touring company of "The Will Rogers Follies" but is pointless as a background for "Chess."
Ray Walker and J. Mark McVey, who play the two chessmen, are stronger at singing than at acting. Kathleen Rowe McAllen, as the woman involved with both men, gives the evening's sharpest performance. "I Know Him So Well," the duet she sings with Jan Horvath, is, as before, the most memorable number in the score.
Surrounding the musical is a mountain of portentousness. Anthems are sung about chess as if it were the French Revolution, which is more dramatic weight than the show can support. After repeated attempts, it should be time for Mr. Rice and his collaborators to resign from this match and move on to more rewarding musical territory.

No Faults Allowed In This Business

BYLINE: By Glenn Rifkin

DATELINE: MARLBORO, Mass.

 BODY:
IN an industry where profit-killing competition and slumping business are the norm, Stratus Computer Inc. continues to defy the odds by stringing up quarter after quarter of solid profits.
Stratus has quietly and steadily built itself into the second-largest maker of "fault tolerant" computers. Such machines are designed with enough backup components that they are never supposed to fail, as most conventional computers occasionally do, and they have become a mainstay in businesses where uninterrupted computer service is essential. Automatic teller machines, electronic-funds transfers and Wall Street trading operations all rely on fault-tolerant machines.
For the fourth quarter ending Dec. 29, Stratus's earnings rose 30 percent, compared with the corresponding quarter in 1990. For the full year in 1991,profits jumped 34 percent, to $49.7 million, on revenues of $448.6 million. 
 Since going public in 1983, Stratus, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SRA, has not had a single losing quarter. Analysts see no end soon to that run. "Stratus can grow 20 percent per year for the next four years," said David Wu, an analyst with S. G. Warburg & Company. "They survive recessions very well."
The company that created the first fault-tolerant computers, Tandem Computer in Cupertino, Calif., holds more than 70 percent of the $2.3 billion market, according to John B. Jones of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. But Stratus, founded in 1980, has steadily whittled away at Tandem's lead, growing from a 10 percent share in 1985 to 24 percent in 1991.
"Tandem was in the business for a good six years before Stratus ever shipped its first system," Mr. Jones said. "I expect them to continue to gain market share against Tandem."
Stratus's own sales force sells more than half the company's machines, but the company also has agreements with I.B.M., Olivetti, NEC and Ericsson, among others, to resell Stratus computers under their own labels.
Even as demand grows for fault-tolerant systems, companies are willing to pay a premium price for them, compared with conventional computers. "Any system where the computer has direct contact with the customer is a candidate for fault-tolerant computers," Mr. Jones said. "People are willing to pay 15 percent to 25 percent more for continuous availability."
Despite the premium, Mr. Wu said, the cost of fault-tolerant computers is falling, enticing more companies to take a look at the technology they once considered too expensive. The starting price for Stratus machines is $50,000, though high-end machines can cost $9 million or more.
The telecommunications market has become a major target for Stratus and Tandem in the last two years, as telephone companies are increasingly using the machines to provide call waiting, voice mail and other new network services. Stratus has made strong inroads into that market, which company executives see as a potential $4 billion to $8 billion market in the next four years.
But Stratus also faces increased competition from giants like Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu and Hitachi, which have all entered the fault-tolerant market in recent years. To maintain its pace, Stratus has pushed its technology in the direction of "open systems," the computer industry trend to make different brands of computers work together.
Moreover, Stratus last year began shipping computers with more advanced components, based on the technology known as RISC, for reduced instruction set computing. As part of this move, Stratus is shifting its entire product line away from Motorola microprocessors to RISC chips made by Intel. Customers of Status's RISC-based systems will be able to use the same hardware to run either the company's VOS software operating system or the more widely used Unix operating system to control the computer's internal operations.
John Adams, an analyst with Adams, Harkness & Hill in Boston, said Stratus's biggest challenge was a management concern: "how to fight 'creeping large company-itis.' "
To ward off corporate sprawl, William Foster, Stratus's founder, president and chief executive, has built a fiscally conservative corporate culture. The company has incurred little long-term debt, accrued $100 million in cash and has fought the uncontrolled growth that is now haunting larger competitors like the Digital Equipment Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation.
Gary E. Haroian, senior vice president and general manager of Stratus, said: "We want to avoid reducing employment like so many others have had to do. With our profits up 30 percent last year, we only added 100 people to the payroll."
Mr. Jones of Montgomery Securities rates Stratus a 'buy,' predicting that the stock will outperform the market, with the price rising 10 percent within six months. He estimates earnings per share at $2.70 for 1992, up 22 percent. Mr. Wu rates the stock a "hold," waiting for a small price correction. "It's trading at $47 now and should be at $60 in 12 months," he said. "But the rewards are not high enough to put out a 'buy' just yet."

Despite Slump in Atlanta, Mall Plans Are Under Way

BYLINE: By Ford Risley

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
THE construction of a big new shopping mall and the expansion or renovation of five others are among the few bright spots in Atlanta's slumping retail construction market.
The Homart Development Company and the JMB Retail Properties Company have begun construction of North Point Mall, a 1.3-million-square-foot center in suburban Atlanta. The project, which is expected to be completed in mid-1993, will be anchored by Rich's, Sears and J. C. Penney. 
 Elsewhere, two of the city's best-known malls, Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza, are getting big face lifts. Three other suburban malls around Atlanta are also being expanded.
In general, however, retail construction in Atlanta has slowed drastically. Despite the city's continuing growth, overbuilding, tightening credit and continuing retailer failures have led to a prolonged slump in the construction of new shopping centers.
Only 14 new centers of varying sizes, with a total construction value of $52 million, were begun in metropolitan Atlanta in 1990. That was down for the third straight year and less than half the number of centers started in 1989, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Figures are not yet available for 1991, but shopping center construction is known to have dropped again, said Terry Sullivan, vice president for retail services at Coldwell Banker Commercial in Atlanta. "New construction has come to a virtual standstill," he said.
North Point will be the first new mall to open in Atlanta since 1986. The mall is being built near the town of Alpharetta, one of the hottest growth areas in metropolitan Atlanta. The population of the mall's trade area doubled in the 1980's to about 240,000 and is expected to increase to 295,000 by 1995, said Jack Oliaro, head of Homart's Atlanta office.
Even with such growth, the mall could not begin construction until a bankruptcy court judge gave permission for Rich's to put a store in the mall. Rich's parent company, Federated Department Stores Inc. of Cincinnati, is expected to emerge from bankruptcy as early as this week.
Mr. Sullivan said malls like North Point were dependent on finding big retailers to anchor them, and the dwindling number of retailers is making the task more difficult. He cited, for example, R. H. Macy & Company, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week. There are Macy's stores in most of Atlanta's big malls, and in the past the retailer could have been counted on to move into a mall like North Point, Mr. Sullivan said.
The entry of a new retailer to the Atlanta market, Parisian Inc., a department store chain in the Southeast that is based in Birmingham, Ala., permitted the long-delayed expansion of Phipps Plaza to proceed.
Phipps, an affluent mall in the city's Buckhead area, is getting a $140 million expansion and renovation that will nearly double its size to 827,000 square feet, said Jeffery R. Jones, development manager for Compass Retail. The mall, which is anchored by Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue, is getting a new three-level wing that will have a Parisian store and a 50,000-square-foot AMC Entertainment Inc. movie theater as its main tenants. The work is to be completed by fall.
Across the road from Phipps Plaza on Peachtree Street -- Atlanta's best-known thoroughfare -- Lenox Square is getting a $40 million renovation, although no new space is being added. Work on the 1.4-million-square-foot mall, the largest in Atlanta, will begin later this year and be completed in late 1993, said Jane Fortenberry, vice president of the New York-based Corporate Property Investors, owners of Lenox.
Ms. Fortenberry said it was a coincidence and not a response to Phipps Plaza's expansion that Lenox was now having a big renovation. "We've been working on this for several years," she said.
Three other suburban Atlanta malls owned either in whole or part by Corporate Property Investors are also expanding this year, Ms. Fortenberry said.
Gwinnett Place and Town Center malls are both getting 130,000-square-foot Parisian stores as well as 75,000 square feet of additional retail space. Work on Town Center is scheduled for completion in the fall of this year, while construction at Gwinnett Place will be finished in the fall of 1993.
Another Corporate Property Investors property, Northlake Mall, is getting a 10,000-square-foot food court. Completion is expected later this year.
The addition of so much new space to the market has developers scrambling to find tenants. Although the recession has hampered their efforts in some cases, mall officials expressed confidence that the space would be leased.
"There's been a lot of tenant interest in this mall," said Mr. Oliaro of Homart. "But if you asked me if I would rather be doing this when we are not in a recession, the answer would be yes."

HEADLINE: A Garland of Freeze-Dried Vegetables

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
DON'T eat those strawberries!
To the world of dried roses and stuffed owls, add freeze-dried strawberries, asparagus and bibb lettuce made into topiaries, nosegays and garlands. 
 Lois Muller, the owner of Juniper Farms, a floral design shop in Locust Valley, L.I., freeze-dries fruits, vegetables and flowers. She then treats them with chemicals so that they last at least a year, or, as Mrs. Muller said, "indefinitely, as long as they're kept out of direct sunlight and handled like any other fragile piece." Once the food is treated, Mrs. Muller arranges it into topiaries, wreaths and still lifes in baskets.
She introduced her designs at the Winter Antiques Show last month. Thomas K. Woodard and Blanche Greenstein, antiques dealers in New York, asked her to fill two 19th-century clay urns with mounds of strawberries topped with gardenias, all on a base of artichokes entwined with raffia. "It looked like an extraordinary dessert," Mr. Woodard said.
Mrs. Muller chooses strawberries that are bright red but "not too mature, not too ripe, because you want the least moisture." She puts 5,000 at a time in her freeze dryer, the same sort of machine used by taxidermists for preserving carcasses and by hospitals for saving tissue samples.
Within eight hours, the fruit is frozen at minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit; the machine also vacuums the moisture from the fruit so that it does not spoil. Then Mrs. Muller treats the fruit with chemicals. She will not say what chemicals she uses, other than to say, "some are glosses, but I don't use polyurethane."
She designs topiaries of strawberries topped with gardenias ($650) or cranberry beans resting in a basket of asparagus ($375). She has also made fireplace screens of roses and artichoke leaves and lined a platter with bibb lettuce and roses.
"Even if freeze-drying flowers has been done before, it hasn't been done with this great amount of taste," Mr. Woodard said. "Besides, in a recession, it's an answer to replacing fresh flowers, which are expensive."
Juniper Farms can be reached at (516) 674-6080.

HEADLINE: 23 Charged With Bribery At Javits Hall

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Twenty-three men, including two former state police officers, were accused yesterday of charges of union corruption, extortion, fraud, thefts and violence that authorities said inflated exhibition costs and discouraged business at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
Almost from the day the crystalline-enclosed center opened on Manhattan's West Side in 1986, exhibitors have complained of shakedowns by employees, thefts and excessive labor costs. The indictments unsealed yesterday are the first significant criminal charges brought against union officials and employees connected to the center. 
Prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office who conducted the investigation said there were strong indications of the control of organized crime at the center.
Among the main allegations in the indictments brought by a state grand jury in Manhattan were that a theatrical union official got a $27,000 bribe from a show manager for a sweetheart contract to permit the employment of nonunion workers; that teamsters union members were paid $1,500 by a trucker after threatening to block deliveries and that a teamsters official extorted $1,000 to allow flowers to be delivered to a trade show display.
 
Information Leaks
 A former New York State Police lieutenant, James F. Tansey Sr., was charged with leaking information in 1990 to targets of the convention center investigation that wiretaps and listening devices had been installed in a teamsters union office in the convention center. Prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office said the premature disclosure of the secret eavesdropping devices might have compromised the investigation.
Another former state police officer, Vernon J. Smith, a senior investigator who in 1990 had been in charge of state police detectives assigned to the convention inquiry, was indicted on charges of using stolen state government credit cards to make personal telephone calls.
"These things happen," Lieut. Col. Michael J. Hulihan, a spokesman for the state police, said of the arrests of the two dismissed officers. "It never makes you feel good."
The 23 defendants pleaded not guilty at arraignments in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Ten were charged with using fictitious identities to evade income taxes or to hold "no-show" jobs at the center while obtaining unemployment or disability benefits.
In interviews last year, companies that organize trade shows said that some costs at the center were twice as high as in any other city.
One example often cited was an $80 charge to plug in a lamp and payments to carpenters and teamsters of a day's wages of $150 even if they only worked one hour.
At a news conference in District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau's office in lower Manhattan yesterday, the center's president and chief executive officer, Fabian G. Palomino, said that he was renegotiating contracts with five major unions to reduce costs by changing work rules on the number of employees that must be hired for different jobs and minimum wage scales.
To encourage more business at shows, Mr. Palomino said he had asked the unions to permit exhibitors to assemble by themselves small portable displays.
Mr. Palomino, who was appointed to the top post in January 1991, said the center recently instituted security measures, including undercover investigators, television surveillance and payroll audits to deter crime and corruption.
The United States Attorney's office in Manhattan, in a civil-racketeering suit filed in 1990 against the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, the major union for carpenters in the city, described the center as a hiring hall for mobsters and former convicts.
"There is a strong indication of organized-crime involvement at the center and this investigation is not over," said Michael G. Cherkasky, who is the head of the Manhattan District Attorney's Investigations Division.

Meeting the Neighbors, Old and New

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
Residents of the Central Ward were skeptical when police officers and state troopers moved into a dilapidated apartment in a small building there 13 months ago, saying they would work with tenants to drive out drug dealers.
But not any more. Now, some of those same skeptics have embraced their new neighbors. 
 "Before, we lived in fear for our lives," said Mikki Parker, a 23-year-old with a 5-year-old son, who grew up in the Central Ward of Newark. "Street shootings were part of our daily routine. Before, we didn't communicate, didn't know our neighbors. But once we began talking and working together, we were able to pull together and take back our community."
Working together and taking back the community were the goals when the officers and state troopers moved into the apartment as part of Operation Homestead, a program to rid neighborhoods of drugs. The program is part of Fighting Back, a $40 million national initiative covering 13 cities and financed mainly by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, based in Princeton. Fighting Back will also provide drug treatment and education, offer training in parenting skills and help develop long-range plans for economic improvements.
So far, Operation Homestead in Newark seems to be paying off, said Lieut. Thomas Brennan of the Newark Police Department. Police statistics show that assaults, thefts and vandalism are down and that drug arrests are up, although thieves did break into Operation Homestead's apartment last summer and steal bulletproof vests, video equipment and anti-auto-theft locks. Most of the stolen equipment was recovered because tenants identified the thieves.
Tenants measure progress by the changes in their everyday lives. Residents say they are no longer afraid to walk their dogs after dark, children ride their bicycles along the streets and there has not been a robbery attempt at the corner grocery store in a year.
"I look out the window, and I see kids playing because their parents are more comfortable these days letting them go out into the neighborhood," said Richard Grossklaus, a homeowner.
The police and state troopers occupy their apartment at 719 Martin Luther King Boulevard in eight-hour shifts for 16 hours a day. The officers say they now have a keener understanding of tenants' problems. When the police officers moved into their apartment, for example, they did not have lights. Things are not that much better now. The ceiling still sags, and the walls still need painting.
To help win acceptance, the police gave parties for the neighborhood children at Halloween and Christmas. They also helped clean up a debris-strewn lot and put up backboards for basketball. (Two were vandalized within 24 hours.)
Because parents were afraid to let children walk to a nearby recreation center to swim, the police marked out a safe route, which they patrol. They added bright outdoor lights in an alley to discourage drug dealers and users. But mainly they just made themselves available and highly visible.
Many small gestures helped form bonds between tenants and the police, said Sgt. Pat Ciccone, 45 years old, who used to teach sixth grade in the Newark schools.
"The way this community has come together is vital because eventually residents will have to depend on their own resources," he said. "We cannot afford to be a permanent crutch."
Tenants help tenants as never before. Ms. Parker, for one, persuaded an addicted mother to seek treatment; that woman then induced another neighbor to get treatment. Another resident, Lateefah Baskerville, works days caring for children at a local hospital but is also studying at Essex County College to become a drug-treatment counselor because she wants to help her neighbors.
"I celebrated my 34th birthday last week and my 5th anniversary free of drugs," she said. "I really have reason to celebrate."
Fighting Back builds on the support of such people, said Irene James, the program's director. "They are what I call natural helpers," she said.
The police role in "Fighting Back" was never conceived solely as a law-enforcement activity, said Barbara Wright Bell, chief executive of the Boys' and Girls' Clubs of Newark, which helped develop a network of more than 150 individuals, Government representatives, businesses and neighborhood groups to help forge a program qualifying for assistance from the Johnson Foundation.
"The police were going into the community to become partners," she said. "We gave them someone on the other side to partner with."
