HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Stumbles Against Yen; Pound Surges on Rate Hopes

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar's rally against the Japanese yen faltered yesterday as the bond market fell unexpectedly and demand surged for the British pound, which hit a four-year high against the United States currency.
But traders said that the thin market exaggerated price movements and that the forces that pushed the dollar higher in 1996 remained firmly in place. Japan's market was closed and will remain so until Monday, and many traders in Europe and the United States quit early for the New Year's holiday. 
 "The only people in the market were the speculative accounts," said Steve Skillman, a vice president at Westdeutsche Landesbank in New York. "People are still fairly bullish on the dollar."
In New York, the dollar stood at 115.93 yen, off from 116.15 yen Monday; it was the dollar's first drop against the yen in a week. But the dollar still ended 1996 with a 12.1 percent gain against the yen, and many traders expect it to test its 45-month high of 116.18 yen, which was reached on Monday.
The dollar traded at 1.5415 marks, off from 1.5555 marks on Monday. But the dollar still ended the year with a 7.3 percent gain against the German currency.
The pound surged to $1.7125 in New York, up from $1.6915 Monday and the highest level since mid-October 1992. Demand for pounds picked up as speculation intensified that British interest rates were likely to rise on Jan. 15, the date of the next policy-making meeting between Eddie George, the Bank of England's governor, and Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Higher interest rates would give securities denominated in pounds higher returns, making the currency more attractive.
Traders said part of the dollar's weakness yesterday came on a drop in the bond market, which was hurt by data that showed an unexpectedly strong gain in new-home sales in November and a surge in consumer confidence in December to the highest level in seven years.
"Most people were ill prepared for such strong data, which shook everybody up a little bit and gave people an excuse to sell off," said Elliott Dix, assistant vice president of foreign exchange trading at the Signet Banking Corporation in Richmond.

HEADLINE: A Powerful Final Quarter Makes Wall Street's Year

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock and bond underwriting roared back in the final three months of 1996, ending a year on Wall Street that left many rubbing their eyes with disbelief.
It is perhaps difficult to remember, but the securities industry entered the fourth quarter on a somewhat hesitant note. Activity shriveled in the summer from earlier in the year, largely from uncertainty over the direction of the stock market and interest rates. 
 That all changed in the fourth quarter, when a rally of such power was unleashed that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, wondered whether investors might not be becoming "irrationally exuberant."
Still, compared with the third quarter, "there were clearly more positives for financial markets," said Eric S. Dobkin, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company, who is in charge of global equity capital markets.
"Interest rates stabilized, the dollar rallied significantly, and some of the economic statistics came through better than expected," Mr. Dobkin said. "And markets are willing to extend as long as they think the underlying fundamentals are going to be there."
In the quarter, the securities industry underwrote $251.6 billion worth of domestic debt and equity issues, according to Securities Data, a 22.5 percent increase from third-quarter levels, and 29.2 percent more than was underwritten in the fourth quarter of 1995.
For the year, Wall Street stock and bond underwritings totaled a record $953.4 billion, up 33.6 percent from a year ago.
"It's been a great year," said Sallie Krawcheck, a Sanford C. Bernstein & Company analyst. "It was one of those years when almost everyone in the business did well, with the exception of municipal bond underwriting."
But even though a number of municipal underwriters left the business, those who remained were not entirely displeased.
New tax-exempt debt volume was just over $180 billion, well down from the record-breaking years of 1992 and 1993, when new issues exceeded $225 billion, but 15 percent over 1995.
A rising tide may have lifted all boats, but the biggest boats got the biggest lift.
Merrill Lynch, the world's biggest securities firm, once again topped the combined debt and equity underwriting chart.
Mostly familiar names rounded out the top five, with Goldman, Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers finishing behind Merrill. But J. P. Morgan & Company, which its rivals like to call a commercial bank, inched out Morgan Stanley, its investment-banking cousin, for fifth place.
For the year, however, Morgan Stanley placed fifth.
And together, Morgan and the four other "bulge bracket" firms accounted for more than 56 percent of the stock and bond underwriting market for the year.
The boom in mergers and acquisitions continued to help drive the underwriting business, particularly on the equity side.
"A major factor throughout this merger-and-acquisition cycle, which began in 1993, has been corporate restructuring or strategic business combinations," said Bruce Fiedorek, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley.
"Many of these have been accomplished with equity as a form of consideration, or have been encouraged by positive reaction in the equity market."
Mergers involving substantial amounts of equity that were announced in the fourth quarter include the Boeing Company's planned acquisition of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation for stock now worth $14 billion, and the the CSX Corporation's $9.3 billion offer to buy Conrail.
For the year, nearly $650 billion worth of merger and acquisition transactions were announced, according to Securities Data, up nearly 25 percent from a year ago.
Morgan Stanley was the clear winner in the global advisory business. The firm captured more than 24 percent of the market, outdistancing Goldman, Sachs, with 17.5 percent. Merrill Lynch, CS First Boston and J. P. Morgan rounded out the top five. Morgan Stanley was also the leading firm for domestic merger and acquisition transactions.
Not surprisingly, those deals, plus a booming market for initial public offerings, as well as in other aspects of the investment banking business, generated record fees.
Fees disclosed totaled $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, up more than 50 percent from the third quarter. And for the year, Securities Data figures show that the industry charged a record $9.2 billion in fees, just above the $9.16 billion charged in 1993.
The surge in stock prices during the quarter led to a barrage of initial public offerings: 257 issuers raised more than $14.6 billion. But a number of big deals, including $2 billion of Deutsche Telekom offered in the United States, accounted for the bulk of the dollar volume.
Still, by virtually any measure the entire year was extraordinary: 869 issuers, roughly 50 percent more than in 1995, raised nearly $50 billion, 66 percent more than a year ago.
Once again, Goldman, Sachs dominated the initial public offering market. For the year, Goldman raised nearly $10 billion for 51 issuers. Morgan Stanley, its closest competitor, raised just under $7 billion for 42 issuers.
Compared with the booming equity market, conditions in the debt market were fairly quiet. But positive fundamentals, including largely stable interest rates and low inflation, were incentive enough for corporate treasurers to float a significant number of new issues.
During the quarter, Wall Street underwrote $85.5 billion worth of straight debt, up a bit less than 25 percent from the comparable period a year earlier. And for all of 1996, straight debt underwritings amounted to $330.8 billion, a 21.7 percent increase from 1995.
"It was a strong year," said John C. Qua, co-chief of global debt capital markets at Merrill Lynch. "Not as good as 1993, but as close as you can get."
Perhaps the biggest change over the last few years, Mr. Qua said, were the issuers offering debt in the capital markets.
"Among investment-grade corporate issuers, 25 percent to 30 percent of our activity is now foreign names," he said. "Two years ago, the comparable percentage was 10 percent to 15 percent."
As they looked toward the new year, a number of bankers said they were cautiously optimistic that 1997 would be another solid, if not necessarily record, period.
"We have a benign macroeconomic environment," said Ernesto Cruz, a managing director for equity capital markets at CS First Boston, "with interest rates and inflation under control, justifying or rationalizing the exuberance Mr. Greenspan is concerned about. For that reason, we think 1997 will be a year of good, constructive markets."

HEADLINE: Swiss President Says Pleas for a Holocaust Fund Are 'Blackmail'

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: ZURICH, Dec. 31

 BODY:
President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz today dismissed as "blackmail" calls to set up a compensation fund for Jews who might be entitled to money left in Swiss banks during the Holocaust.
He also accused foreign critics of trying to undermine Switzerland's role as a world financial center by charging that the Swiss had profited cynically from World War II. 
 "Economic competition is fierce and this affair proves it," he said. The remarks were published today after an interview with a French-language Swiss newspaper, Tribune de Geneve.
The World Jewish Congress, which has urged the creation of such a compensation fund, said the Swiss President had shown "shocking insensitivity" and that the comments presented "an assault and challenge to the very soul of Switzerland."
Mr. Delamuraz, in some of the strongest public statements made so far by a Swiss politician, brushed aside demands by international Jewish groups for speedy compensation to Holocaust survivors and their heirs, who say they have been denied money left in Swiss banks as a safe haven from the Nazis.
He rejected the creation of a $250-million fund that he said had been proposed to Switzerland's special ambassador, Thomas Borer, who met in December with representatives of the World Jewish Congress and the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Alfonse D'Amato.
The World Jewish Congress had suggested that Switzerland set up the fund as a gesture of "good faith" toward elderly Jews pending the outcome of investigations.
"This is nothing less than extortion and blackmail," Mr. Delamuraz said. "This fund would make it much more difficult to establish the truth. Such a fund would be considered an admission of guilt."
He repeated the Swiss Government's stance that any compensation should await the findings of a nine-member panel appointed by the Cabinet two weeks ago to open a "sweeping study" into Switzerland's financial dealings during the war.
Mr. Delamuraz, who turns over the rotating one-year presidency to Justice Minister Arnold Koller as of Jan. 1, said the initial Swiss reponse to the criticism had been naive.
"Apart from dogged research into historical truth there is also a strong political desire to destabilize and compromise Switzerland," he said.
Swiss politicians and bankers have long argued privately that bad publicity over missing Holocaust accounts and purchases of Nazi gold by the Swiss National Bank were aimed in part at weakening the growing global role of Swiss banks.
While estimates of the accounts, which included cash, art and other items, vary widely, some experts say they may have held more than half a billion dollars in 1946.
Switzerland set up the nine-member panel of Swiss and international historians, including an Israeli and the director of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, to open Swiss banking records and investigate the amount and fate of the deposits.
The panel is to issue its findings in a report after no more than five years. The inquiry is separate from an international panel set up by Swiss banks and Jewish groups last May to search for individual Holocaust accounts and to help return the assets to their rightful owners.

HEADLINE: North Korea's New Message

 BODY:
North Korea's apology Sunday for attempting to infiltrate South Korea by submarine-borne commandos last September was remarkable enough, coming as it did from a country whose past statements have been largely limited to apocalyptic military threats and crude ideological belligerence. But Pyongyang's expression of "deep regret" for the submarine episode and its promise to make sure that such infiltrations will not be repeated turns out to be part of an even broader and more promising diplomatic breakthrough.
For years, North Korea has tried to freeze out South Korea by seeking an exclusive dialogue with the United States. But in the process of negotiating the apology for the still-mysterious submarine incident, which left 24 North Korean commandos and several South Korean civilians dead, Washington has won the North's agreement to meet jointly with Seoul and Washington as a prelude to talks on officially ending the Korean War. 
 This is an impressive diplomatic triumph, turning a crisis into a chance for peace. It may also signal a significant easing of North Korea's dangerous isolation from the rest of the world. The Clinton Administration and its individual negotiators deserve high marks.
North Korea did not apologize directly, as it should have, to South Korea, which Pyongyang ritually denounced on Monday. Nevertheless, the wording, carefully negotiated between North Korea and the United States, was designed to meet Seoul's minimum conditions for resuming pragmatic cooperation with the North.
That cooperation will now occur on several levels. There will be the proposed peace talks, which are meant to include the United States and China as well as the two Koreas. South Korea will help replace North Korea's nuclear power reactors with models less likely to produce potential bomb fuel. Finally, Seoul should now also feel sufficiently mollified to resume humanitarian food assistance to alleviate a flood-produced famine in the North.
For its part, North Korea accompanied its statement of apology with an agreement to maintain storage safeguards on its spent reactor fuel and Washington indicated that it will now unfreeze export licenses for commercial food shipments to the North.
North Korea's actions this week suggest strongly that the long-isolated Communist regime may indeed be nervously seeking to re-enter the community of civilized nations. No outsider can be sure about what goes on in Pyongyang's inner circles. But the apology and the agreement to meet jointly with Washington and Seoul seems to support the Administration's hopes that careful diplomatic engagement could encourage steps toward North-South peace.
Ever since the Bush Administration, American policy has been based on the assumption that North Korea fears deeply for its future in a world where it can no longer count on the support of its two giant neighbors, Russia and China, for support. Both of those countries have strengthened their ties with the more prosperous South Korean regime at Pyongyang's expense. North Korea has also been suffering from severe food shortages following two years of disastrous floods.
Washington fears that these adverse developments could tempt Northern leaders into rash military adventures or precipitate a sudden and disastrous economic collapse. But it also believes that careful diplomacy can avert these dangers. That is why, despite the impatience of some critics, Washington has moved deliberately and delicately to reach an accommodation on issues like nuclear safeguards, food assistance and the submarine affair. That strategy has now been rewarded with two quick successes, the submarine apology and the promise of wider talks.
It is important for the two Koreas to build on this week's achievements, the South by moving ahead with food relief and the new nuclear reactors, the North by entering formal peace talks and permanently suspending its propaganda attacks on South Korea and its elected leaders.

HEADLINE: Now, What About Lilco's Debt?

 BODY:
The proposed merger of Brooklyn Union Gas and the Long Island Lighting Company should provide Long Island residents some modest financial relief. But those residents will still pay more for their utility bills than most Americans do. The solution to their problem is for state leaders to put aside partisan bickering and agree on a plan that would allow the state to assume Lilco's huge debt.
A merger would allow the companies to cut administrative and other costs. It would also bring Brooklyn Union's highly regarded management skills to bear on Lilco's gas operations. Most experts agree that the merger could produce savings of about $1 billion over 10 years, knocking a few percentage points off utility rates. But the major reason that Long Island rates are high is that Lilco makes exorbitant interest payments on money it borrowed to build a $5.5 billion nuclear plant, Shoreham, which Gov. Mario Cuomo refused to open following intense opposition by nearby residents. 
 The problem could be solved by engaging in what amounts to a legal tax dodge. A state agency, the Long Island Power Authority, would take over part of Lilco. The state-owned utility would no longer pay Federal taxes on income or dividends to shareholders. It could borrow money at tax-free, therefore low, interest rates. Replacing high-cost debt with tax-free debt and other savings would cut utility rates by perhaps 12 percent. In effect, the state would be shifting hundreds of millions of dollars of interest payments each year onto the Federal Treasury.
Democrats and Republicans agree that a partial state takeover is the answer. But some Democratic leaders want the state to take over almost all of Lilco, including its transmission wires and power plants. Under this plan, the newly formed Brooklyn-Lilco would keep only Lilco's gas operations. Republican leaders would transfer control of only Lilco's transmission and distribution facilities, permitting Brooklyn-Lilco to keep Lilco's power plants as well as its gas operations. By controlling the transmission lines, the state could invite utility companies around the country to compete to sell electricity to Long Island customers.
Either plan could work as long as the state makes sure there are additional transmission lines to the Island so that other power companies can compete for business. Once Albany resolves how to take over Lilco's debt payments, then Brooklyn Union and a pared-down Lilco can complete merger plans. But if the companies merge without a state takeover of Lilco's debt, Long Islanders will reap little more than scraps.

HEADLINE: Reports Show New Strength In Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Boding well for continued economic strength in 1997, reports issued yesterday showed consumer confidence at a seven-year high and sales of new homes up sharply.
The Conference Board, a business research group in New York, said its Consumer Confidence Index for December rose 4.3 points from November, to 113.8, its highest level since November 1989, when it reached 115.1.
The Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes surged 14.2 percent in November, the steepest rise in three and a half years.
Both reports were well above economists' expectations.
"Consumers in general are feeling pretty good about the state of the economy," said Gary Thayer, a senior economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "That means we should head into next year in pretty good shape."
But bond prices fell sharply on the news, as traders were disappointed by the surprising strength and worried that substantial growth could spur inflationary pressures. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction to the price, rose to 6.64 percent from 6.54 percent on Monday. The drop in bond prices hurt the stock market, and the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 101.10 points, to 6,448.27.
"All the reports were stronger than expected, and the bond market hates nothing more than growth," said Alan Levenson, a money market economist at UBS Securities Inc.
Measures of consumer confidence are watched closely for indications of future consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economy. The report was also one of the earliest economic indicators for December.
The confidence index, calculated from a 1985 base of 100, is derived from responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide, polling them on matters ranging from job availability to home-buying plans.
A separate index showed that consumers' opinions of current business conditions rose to a seven-year high, gaining 3 points from November. Also, their expectations for the next six months climbed 5 points.
In the main index, consumer optimism was widespread across much of the nation, with the biggest gains seen in the Rocky Mountain region. But confidence in New England fell by 20 points in December after showing big gains in the three previous months.
In the report on home sales, the Commerce Department said sales of single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted 772,000 annual rate in November, up from a revised 676,000 in October, when sales were initially estimated at a 714,000 rate.
It was the highest level since an 820,000 rate in August and the biggest increase since sales rose 16.6 percent in April 1993. The dip in October had pushed the rate below 700,000 for the first time in 1996.
Each of the four regions of the country -- the Northeast, the South, the Midwest and the West -- shared in the gain, posting double-digit increases, led by a 40.3 percent jump in the Northeast.

Gabriel Lewis Galindo, the Panamanian diplomat and businessman who helped negotiate the Panama Canal Treaties, spearheaded efforts to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and served until recently as his country's Foreign Minister, died on Dec. 19 in Denver, where he had been undergoing medical treatment. He was 68 and suffered from fibrosis of the lungs.
Within Panama, Mr. Lewis was regarded as his country's leading expert on foreign policy. But perhaps more than any Latin American diplomat in the last three decades, Mr. Lewis, a round, bald figure with an exuberant nature and a raspy voice, had an understanding of the political process of the United States and how to make it work to his country's benefit. 
 A wealthy member of one of Panama's most prominent families, Mr. Lewis had business interests that included real estate, a bank and a brewery. But when Gen. Omar Torrijos came to power in a coup in 1968, he was one of the few figures from the elite to immediately support the new populist Government, and he quickly became a friend and confidant of General Torrijos.
When Jimmy Carter entered the White House in 1977, General Torrijos appointed Mr. Lewis as Panama's Ambassador to the United States in hopes of reaching an agreement under which Washington would transfer control of the Panama Canal to Panama. Mr. Lewis not only proved to be skilled and imaginative during those negotiations, but his outgoing, back-slapping nature were later credited with winning over several senators who had been dubious about ratifying the resulting treaties.
During the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, Mr. Lewis again came to the aid of the United States. When the Carter Administration had difficulty finding a country where the Shah of Iran and his family could take refuge, Mr. Lewis, with the approval of General Torrijos, offered his own home on the island of Contadora, where the deposed Iranian ruler remained until just before his death.
But after General Torrijos died in an airplane crash in 1981, Mr. Lewis's relationship with the military dictatorship eventually deteriorated. In 1987, when opposition to General Noriega erupted into civil disobedience and street protests, Mr. Lewis urged the military strongman to resign and fled into exile in the United States after the military responded with threats against his family.
Drawing on his broad network of contacts in Washington, Mr. Lewis soon emerged as the opposition coalition's chief representative abroad. He not only financed some of their activities, but vigorously lobbied State Department officials and members of Congress and the press and devised several ways for the United States to exert economic pressure on Panama, which led the Noriega Government to call for his arrest on charges of treason.
Neverthless, when the Democratic Revolutionary Party, the party of Torrijos and Noriega, returned to power in Panama in September 1994, the new President, Ernesto Perez Balladares, once again turned to Mr. Lewis. Aware that many in the United States were deeply suspicious of the new Government's intentions, the new President named Mr. Lewis Foreign Minister and asked him to repair relations with Washington.
Once again, Mr. Lewis proved skilled in earning Washington's gratitude. In what was almost his first official act, he agreed to allow the United States to intern up to 10,000 Cuban refugees, who had fled their country on rafts a month earlier, in camps in the former Panama Canal Zone until the crisis could be solved.
Thereafter, even as his health was deteriorating, Mr. Lewis devoted much of his time to reassuring Asian and European countries that Panama will be able to manage the Canal once it gains control in 2000 and to discussions with the United States about maintaining a military presence in Panama. But this summer, his illness finally forced him to step down, and he spent most of his last months at his apartment in Miami.
Mr. Lewis is survived by his wife, Nita, six children and 21 grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Banking Dynasty on the Move;
Spain's Santander Hopes to Become No. 1 in Latin America

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
What Spain's monarchs lost in the 19th century, Emilio and Ana Patricia Botin are determined to reconquer in the waning years of the 20th: Latin America.
Mr. Botin, the 62-year-old chairman of Banco Santander, Spain's biggest bank, is on the move all over the globe. But recognizing that Europe is overbanked and Santander will never be more than a second-tier player in Asia and North America, he is devoting most of his energy to expanding in Spain's former colonies in the Western Hemisphere, where, he believes, Santander has a shot at being No. 1. 
 And, breaking with Spain's patriarchal tradition, Mr. Botin has enlisted Ana Patricia, his 35-year-old American-educated daughter, to help lead the charge. Together, they orchestrated an acquisition binge by Santander throughout Latin America in 1996. In April, the bank paid $495 million for a 51 percent stake in Banco Osorno y La Union, the largest bank in Chile. In October, it took control of Mexico's fourth-largest bank, Banco Mexicano, for $425 million. And just before Christmas, it snapped up a 90 percent share of Banco de Venezuela, that nation's second-largest bank, for $338 million, and simultaneously acquired 55 percent of Banco Comercial Antioqueno of Colombia for $151 million.
While the father-daughter pairing may be unusual for Spain, the lure of Latin America is not. The cream of Spanish business, sensing the same opportunity to exploit cultural and linguistic ties, has been rushing in as governments have liberalized their economies. In recent years, Spain's national telecommunications giant, Telefonica de Espana S.A., has cut a broad swath through the region, forging joint ventures and buying shares of local companies. So have some of the country's biggest television companies, including Television Espanola S.A., one of the world's largest producers of Spanish-language programming.
And other Spanish banks have pushed in hard on Santander's heels. In December, for example, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the No. 2 Spanish bank, took over Venezuela's largest bank, Banco Provincial, in a deal worth $300 million.
"Our policy is, ultimately, to have 50 percent of earnings through Latin America," Mr. Botin said over breakfast at the bank's Madrid headquarters. "In 1996, it was near 20 percent, and in 1997 we expect it will be 25 percent; by 1998 and 1999, I hope, it will be 30 percent."
Ana Botin also heads Santander's ambitious push into the highly profitable, if extremely competitive, world of investment banking. There, the Botins hope to carve out a Latin American niche in a business dominated by American and European giants. In just the last five years, investment banking's share of Santander's total net income has climbed to nearly 12 percent from less than 3 percent. Santander has become the No. 1 money-market and pension-fund manager, as well as the leading stockbroker, in several Latin American countries, including Argentina and Chile.
Its New York-based brokerage operation, Santander Investment Securities, ranked second among firms trading in Latin American stocks in the 11 months ended Nov. 30, with nearly 14 percent of the market, after Merrill Lynch, with 16 percent, according to Datablock, a Boston statistics company. In 1995, Santander ranked seventh.
"We like fee income," said Juan Rodriguez Inciarte, the head of Santander's global banking division. "That's the strategic way forward."
Mr. Botin had long been grooming his daughter, one of six children, for a career at Santander, despite Spanish banking's overwhelmingly male culture. He sent her to the United States in the late 1970's to earn a degree in economics at Bryn Mawr College and to put in a seven-year stint at J. P. Morgan, the New York investment bank, specializing in risk management for corporate clients and debt conversion for Latin American governments. In 1988, she left J. P. Morgan to become chief executive of Santander's investment banking subsidiary, from which she has engineered much of the bank's Latin American invasion.
Father and daughter are both dark and handsome, and both are impeccable dressers, but their personal manners differ. He is serene, takes the large, philosophical view and harbors a deep interest in music and art. His wife, Paloma, is an accomplished pianist, and paintings from the family art collection, which he oversees, adorn Santander's headquarters, including a magnificent Holy Family by El Greco, which hangs in the lobby. He is also an avid golfer (though he will not betray his handicap); his youngest daughter, Carmen, is married to Spain's golfing hero, Seve Ballesteros.
Ms. Botin shares many of her father's passions, but unlike him, she is fast talking, hard driving, a good saleswoman -- traits she probably honed at J. P. Morgan. A fluent English speaker who lives in Madrid with her husband, also a Santander banker, and her three children, she travels endlessly, spending lots of time in the financial centers of London and New York but also frequently darting off to Latin America.
Moreover, while Mr. Botin has always been known for his discretion, almost never granting interviews, Ms. Botin is outspoken, publicly declaring that one of Santander's weaknesses may be failure to communicate and make itself better known, for example.
Some bankers say that, like most of Mr. Botin's investments, the bet he placed on his daughter has more than paid off. "She really worked hard, and has very clear ideas, and what's important, she understands Wall Street, which a lot of Europeans don't," said Alberto Sanchez, a former Madrid banker who is now part of the Bear, Stearns emerging markets group in New York. Ms. Botin, he added, "spends a lot of time explaining to colleagues, 'be patient, it's going to cost money'; she knows it."
In some ways, the drive into Latin America represents a return to Santander's past. Founded in 1857 in the northern Spanish port of the same name, the bank cut its teeth financing trade between Spain and its colonies. Mr. Botin's father and grandfather were important shareholders and bank executives.
The family dynasty has flourished even as ownership of the bank has spread outside of Spain, with nearly half the bank's equity now held by foreign shareholders, mainly large British and American funds. Ms. Botin's younger brother is an executive in the commercial banking division, and the chairman's younger brother, Jaime Botin, sits on Santander's board. Jaime Botin is also president of Bankinter, a Spanish retail bank that Santander founded in the 1970's with Bank of America, but is now independent. "People like to say that at Santander, Botin is first, Botin is second, and Botin is third, and that after Botin, there is Ana Botin," said Jesus Rivases Cabbarus, the editor of the financial newspaper Negocios.
That may be something of an exaggeration. In 1996, Mr. Botin hired a powerful outsider, Francisco Luzon, the former head of Argentaria, the Government-controlled banking group, to help formulate Santander's global strategy, and some see him as a possible successor as chairman to Mr. Botin. Asked what Mr. Luzon's future role might be, Mr. Botin replied, "The sky's the limit."
Santander's expansion beyond its borders began in earnest in the 1980's. Awash with profits in Spain's industrial rebirth after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco, and the country's entry into the European Community, Santander first forged a strategic alliance with the Royal Bank of Scotland. In the early 1990's, Mr. Botin set his sights on the United States, acquiring gradually a 23 percent share of First Fidelity, a New Jersey bank. When First Fidelity was snapped up shortly thereafter by First Union of Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Botin was left with a 9 percent share of First Union, and a profit of more than $1 billion.
Santander is also looking to other growing markets. It opened offices in the Philippines in 1996, and Mr. Botin said the company hoped to generate 10 percent of its worldwide revenues in Asia by 2000. In Eastern Europe, it is using its German consumer banking subsidiary, CC Bank, to expand consumer loan services into formerly Communist countries, where consumer demand is vigorous for everything from cars to homes.
Nor is Mr. Botin neglecting the home front. Santander's takeover of Banesto, the troubled Banco Espanol de Credito, in a 1994 deal worth $2 billion nudged it into the position of Spain's market leader. Besides its links with the Bank of Scotland and its flourishing consumer-credit business in Germany, Santander recently acquired a 3 percent stake in Italy's No. 1 bank, Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino.
To be sure, the Botins know their global ambitions are not without risks. For all Santander's elevated position in Spain and Latin America, it is a relative dwarf in investment banking. With its limited resources, it must compete against European giants like Union Bank of Switzerland and Deutsche Bank's Deutsche Morgan Grenfell subsidiary, as well as against Wall Street firms like Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and Bear, Stearns. Some of its rivals, in fact, say they doubt Santander's claim that it is making a profit in global investment banking.
Moreover, for all Latin America's recent embrace of democracy and free-market capitalism, many countries remain vulnerable to political instability and economic upheaval. And Jose Sevilla, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in Madrid who follows Santander, said the bank had a big job on its hands in adapting its management style to differing national customs and cultures.
In addition, Mr. Sevilla said, "they have to take a strategic decision about Brazil," a huge and vigorous Portuguese-speaking country where Santander, like many other Spanish banks, remains virtually absent.
Ms. Botin brushes aside such concerns. About six years ago, she said, Santander made a decision to make Latin America its big priority because that is where it holds the best cards. "We have a universal banking approach; we've been in the region for 50 years," she said. "We believe we have key advantages. One of the them is timing, which in these places is critical, since business cycles are much more pronounced. Another is people on the ground.
"Over all," Ms. Botin added, "I personally am very bullish."

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 101, Closing Out A Generally Exuberant Year

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
The last day of the year disappointed investors looking for the stock market to end 1996 with a last burst through the finish line.
After sprinting to a record close of 6,560.91 on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average stumbled backward yesterday, falling 101.10 points, or 1.54 percent, to close at 6,448.27. 
 Concern over the possibility of an overly robust economy and some end-of-the-year selling by investors helped push the Dow down.
While small-company and many technology stocks managed to avoid much of yesterday's retreat, large-capitalization stocks like General Electric, which fell $2.75, or 2.7 percent, and I.B.M., which dropped $2.125, or 1.4 percent, gave up ground.
News of stronger-than-expected sales of new homes and high levels of consumer confidence caused some investors to worry about the coming year and whether it would bring higher inflation and interest rates, which hurt both stocks and bonds. Yesterday, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 19/32 points, its yield rising to 6.64 percent.
Many investors also ushered 1996 out by tidying up their portfolios, either closing out their positions or doing some last-minute selling for tax purposes.
While few market watchers put too much emphasis on the activity of the last two days, investors have little reason to look at 1996 with anything but appreciation. Leading the way, the Dow gained 26 percent in the last 12 months. The Standard & Poor's 500 index, a broader measure of big-company stocks, was up 20 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq composite index rose nearly 23 percent.
"Basically, the year was one when almost everything went right for the equity market," said Arthur A. Micheletti, chief economic and investment strategist for Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a money management firm in San Mateo, Calif.
The combination of strong corporate earnings early in the year and faith in interest rates remaining low sent many stocks into record territory. Proving the caution of some forecasters wrong, the market's stellar performance also came on the heels of an even stronger year in 1995. The S.& P. 500's back-to-back gain of roughly 54 percent is a performance not experienced in decades, according to Arnold Kaufman, editor of the Standard & Poor's Outlook newsletter. The index returned 51 percent in 1975-1976 and 71 percent in 1954-1955.
This year's market has been adept at defying skeptics. After shrugging off summer doldrums, stocks have made substantial gains over the last three months. The Dow has returned 9.6 percent since Sept. 30, with stocks like Philip Morris, American Express and I.B.M. posting returns above 20 percent. Even the jitters caused earlier last month by remarks by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, seem to have been forgotten as investors who continue to put money into the market after declines are rewarded. "It has reinforced investor confidence," Mr. Kaufman said.
Not everybody had as much reason to celebrate, of course. Large-company stocks were the clear favorites during the year as investors sought the security and safety of well-known names in large multinational companies like Coca-Cola as protection against the whims of the economy. Small stocks, as measured by the Russell 2000 index, fared less well after this summer's downturn. The Russell ended 1996 up 14.76 percent, to close at 362.61 -- near where it was trading in May.
The year's exuberance has made some pause and wonder. "Investors have to be very happy," Mr. Kaufman said. "They're surprised, shocked and a little concerned because they didn't expect this and don't know what to make of it."
And as they did at the end of 1995, some experts are warning investors not to expect more of the same. The last decade has blessed stocks with all the right ingredients: the slashing of interest rates and inflation, tax-cutting and the fattening of corporate profit margins, Mr. Micheletti noted, adding, "A lot of forces behind the bull market are mature, long in tooth and unlikely to repeat."
Still, investors may not want to make the kind of contrarian bets that have paid off in the past. While some are betting on a resurgence in smaller stocks, which showed some signs of occurring early in December, these stocks may not be outperformers in 1997.
"The economy is brutal in terms of competitiveness," said Thomas McManus, a strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, who cautions investors not to discount the strength of large companies, which have proved more profitable than some of their smaller counterparts.
The market's future remains murky even as yesterday's decline was a reminder of just how anxious investors are. While some forecasters say the economy could heat up enough to warrant interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve, others are convinced that the economy is slowing down. "People have been swinging back and forth on the economy," Mr. Kaufman said.
Among individual issues yesterday, shares of the Zitel Corporation, which plunged on Monday, rebounded slightly. The stock gained 3 3/8, to 44 3/8. Zitel, a software company, had risen last month, partly because of speculation that the financier George Soros was buying shares.
Gillette rose 2 1/8, to 77 3/4, a day after shareholders approved the company's purchase of Duracell International. Yesterday, Merrill Lynch repeated a "buy" recommendation on Gillette shares.
Olympic Steel surged 2, to 25 3/8. The company was named the "single best idea" for investors by Prudential Securities, which raised its 12-month price target to $52 a share from $42 previously.

HEADLINE: Girls in White Dresses;
The Debutante Returns, With Pearls and Plans

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

 BODY:
The invitation to the International Debutante Ball was addressed to Mr. and Mrs. David Eisenhower. Tucked into a pink envelope with silver writing, it rekindled bright memories for Julie Nixon Eisenhower, who recalls her sleeveless white dress, her long kid gloves, the series of deb "pre-parties" and, most of all, her date: David, the grandson of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a young man she had met as a child playing in the White House.
"He was dating other people at college," she said. "I knew we'd generate a lot of publicity and he knew if he accepted he was basically burning all his bridges with the others." 
 Despite the invitation's Proustian quality, Mrs. Eisenhower did not even think to ask Jennie, her daughter, an 18-year-old freshman and theater arts major at Northwestern, if she wanted to participate.
"I never thought she'd want to do this," she said.
She was wrong. Jennie loved the idea. And so Ms. Eisenhower became part of a wave of young women between the ages of 17 and 22 who have spent the last several months attending gown fittings (mostly at Vera Wang and Bergdorf Goodman), lining up escorts, sitting for Bachrach portraits and ordering engraved calling cards. All to partake in this year's debutante season, which started at Thanksgiving and runs through this week in New York City.
Hard to imagine, but being a debutante is back. Cotillion chairmen in New York say they have not seen this many young women participate in a decade. Popular in the 1950's, the debutante ball fell on hard times in the 60's, sustained mostly by Southerners ("I came out in the 60's -- my mother insisted -- but I went barefoot in protest," said Kathleen S. Bingham of North Carolina, whose daughter, Sarah Stroh, was presented at this year's International).
There was a comeback in the boom of the 80's, but then a backlash, due in part to the quest for publicity by the socialite Cornelia Guest, who took the title Deb of the Year and, many felt, made a mockery of the institution.
But, in contrast to the excess spending of the 80's, when the debutantes were "overdone," with lavish dresses and huge diamonds around their necks, this time the entry is more subtle, the gowns are simpler (of imported silk and lace), and what looks like grandmother's pearls are back around the girls' necks.
Some say all this is tied to the economy, others say it is a yearning for a romantic period, as the end of the century approaches, and still others see the return of the cotillion as a quest for civility.
"It's fine that she has a career, but I want her to have some polish -- it just makes life more pleasant," said Christian Swiers, the mother of a debutante, also named Christian, who was being presented at the International on Saturday night.
Based on an 18th-century English ritual of families introducing their young daughters, all primped and proper, into a class-restricted marriage market, the balls have become, in recent decades, more of a networking tool for parents to socially connect (and escalate) both their daughters and themselves.
"It's just like pre-school in New York," said Margaret Hedberg, the director of the International Ball, whose aunt founded it in 1954. "It's not about the kids, it's about the parents."
And there are plenty of opportunities for the parents to connect, with a lot more daughters of doctors and small businessmen mingling with the old-money progeny, although the cost for a single event can run over $10,000.
"In the past, there would have been an almost perfect congruent, everyone would know each other," said Nelson W. Aldrich Jr., author of "Old Money: The Mythology of America's Upper Class" (Knopf). "It was a seamless texture of life from the summer place to the school to the parties on the holidays back to the summer place. "Money and desire seem to be the prime determinant here. Now there are no reliable indicators of social or economic status except perhaps for your income tax return."
As Mrs. Eisenhower remembers 1966, two years before her father became President: "Though my father was in politics, we would have never gotten into the other New York balls. We were from Whittier, Calif. Those others were always so closed to anyone who wasn't from old New York families."
Leading up to the International ball, starting the day after Thanksgiving, there were pre-parties, after-parties, lunches, brunches and teas all over town, including the suites of the Waldorf-Astoria, where most guests took rooms.
Then there was the ball.
At the grand ballroom of the Waldorf, 800 guests dressed in black tie greeted the 36 debutantes lined up in the Basildon room of the hotel for two and a half hours.
Mr. and Mrs. Eisenhower stood at the head of the line with their daughter, while the other debutantes stood in place around the room. It was a sea of white silk, Shantung and tulle. Each guest met each deb, shaking their white gloved hands as they introduced themselves.
"Hi, I'm Sarah Stroh from New York City, so nice to meet you," Ms. Stroh said, over and over and over. The debs smiled the entire time and kept up those firm handshakes.
As her mother had done before her, Ms. Stroh took off her shoes. "We all did, we figured no one was going to see our feet," she said, adding that the gesture was about hurt feet and not about making a political statement.
Then it was on to dinner, debutantes with their two escorts (one military, in uniform, and one civilian, in white tie and tails) on the balconies, guests seated around the dance floor. Champagne was flowing, filet de boeuf was served and business cards were flying. The premiere society band leader, Lester Lanin, did not take a break for six hours, passing out his signature hats periodically.
Curtsies were practiced everywhere: in the bathroom, in the hallways, even on the steps. When the debs are presented to the room, each one is expected to curtsy twice.
Texas debutantes have the hardest job. Tradition calls for them to perform the Texas dip, a to-the-floor curtsy with a bow of the head that could certainly topple a nervous deb.
From 11 P.M. to midnight, the debs were presented. No one toppled, though one cadet did faint from standing too straight for too long under the lights.
Each deb walked across the dance floor with her two escorts by her side. The announcer stated the names of the parents and the deb and where they were from. She curtsied as she entered and again as she completed the walk. Her civilian escort brought her up to the stage, while her military escort walked off to the side holding the flag of her state or country.
Ms. Eisenhower went first. Her curtsy seemed extra special: she added a bow of the head after dipping smoothly to the floor.
"A former debutante just taught me that trick in the bathroom," she said. "Since I have a full dress on I didn't have to cross my legs in the back. I just went straight back with my leg and no one could notice. Then she told me to add that head bow at the end.
"I'm so happy I got through it," she said, holding onto the arm of her civilian escort, Dante Bradley.
Ms. Eisenhower attended her senior prom with Mr. Bradley, who is a pre-medical student at Villanova and also her boyfriend of nine months. But for the debs without boyfriends, at this ball the dates are assigned -- by committee. An escort who does a good job is called a "Deb's Delight" and is invited back, party after party.
One escort, Graham Stroh, a 21-year-old sophomore at Bard College and the brother of Sarah Stroh, had mixed feelings about participating in his second ball.
"Well, I wasn't completely into it, though I have to admit it was fun," he said. "People are always worried about how other people will see them. You're almost a little afraid to tell them that you're doing this deb thing. It's so far from what you consider right.
"If you look at it as a major kind of aristocratic and exclusive thing, which in some cases it is, then it's horrible, if you look at it that you're meeting people from around the world that you'd never normally meet, then it's O.K."
Some New York cotillions do still have heavier social requirements, much like Park Avenue co-op boards, with finicky committee members choosing (carefully) who will be allowed to make her debut at their cotillion. But connections can be worked.
And is it all worth it?
Christopher Forbes, who held the pre-cocktail party for the International at the Forbes Magazine Gallery with his niece Catherine Forbes, encouraged both his daughter Charlotte, who is a senior at Princeton, and his niece to "come out."
"I launched them two years ago," said Mr. Forbes, the son of the late Malcolm Forbes. "It was a great way for them to meet people and to be introduced around."
Did they meet anyone?
"Oh, Charlotte met someone at school -- she actually spent Christmas with his family," he said, clenching his teeth.
But, marriage is not what this is all about, insisted Mrs. Hedberg, the head of the International.
"For this to be a marriage market now," she said, "we'd have to do this when the girls are in their 30's."
 
Five New York Debutante Parties
 
DEBUTANTE COTILLION AND CHRISTMAS BALL, called the Infirmary, Waldorf-Astoria: Combination of Old New York, Greenwich, Conn., Tuxedo Park, N.Y., and certain New Jersey suburbs. Debutantes have to perform intricate cotillion figures while carrying candles and singing Christmas songs.

MAYFLOWER BALL, Plaza Hotel: Debutantes must be descendants of those who arrived on the Mayflower. And she cannot just say she is; she must have the paper work. Some years, this ball presents only one or two debutantes.

JUNIOR ASSEMBLY, Plaza Hotel: Old New York family ball. This one is like a country club party. Debutantes are not presented. They just get up and dance with their fathers, because everyone is expected to know everyone else. This one is not about wealth so much as social connections.
INTERNATIONAL DEBUTANTE BALL, Waldorf-Astoria: This one is the most democratic. Debutantes range from French princesses to daughters of small businessmen. Girls are presented with two escorts, one military and one civilian.

JUNIOR LEAGUE, Plaza Hotel: Mothers are members and basically bring their daughters into the league with this party. But the league does not like to use the words cotillion or debutante, calling it a winter dance instead. Girls are presented, and this year carried big green feathered fans.

 BODY:

Consumer Confidence And Home Sales Surge
Exceeding economists' expectations and boding well for a strong 1997, consumer confidence surged to a seven-year high in December, and sales of new homes showed their steepest advance in three and a half years during November.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose 4.3 points, to 113.8. The Commerce Department said home sales surged 14.2 percent. [62.]
 
Concern over the possibility of an overly robust economy, as well as end-of-the-year selling by investors, caused stocks to plunge. The Dow Jones industrials fell 101.10 points, or 1.54 percent, to close at 6,448.27. But the index still rose 26 percent for the year. [65.]
 
Bond prices fell sharply, ending a year in which they dropped during much of the first six months, recovered most of their losses and then turned down again. The 30-year bond yield rose to 6.64 percent from 6.54 percent. The yield ended the year nearly three-quarters of a percentage point higher than the level, 5.96 percent, at which it started the year. [64.]
 
Underwriting Roars Back in Quarter
Stock and bond underwriting roared back in the year's final quarter, despite a somewhat hesitant beginning, to end a year that left many on Wall Street rubbing their eyes in disbelief. During the quarter, the securities industry underwrote $251.6 billion worth of domestic debt and equity issues, Securities Data said. That was a 22.5 percent rise from the third quarter and a 29.2 percent gain from a year earlier. [64.]
 
Lilco Stock Windfall Possible
Long Island Lighting shareholders will get a stock price bonus if the state takes over $4.5 billion in debt for the company's defunct Shoreham nuclear plant, according to Lilco's merger agreement with Brooklyn Union Gas. If the bonus is included, analysts said, Lilco owners are likely to see their long-troubled stock rise a third in value. [45.]
 
Northeast Utilities has mismanaged its nuclear plants for a decade, and if the company cannot turn its operations around in the next year, it may not survive, an audit ordered by Connecticut indicated. [45.]
 
Heating and Crude Oil Prices Up
With freezing temperatures and snow blanketing much of Europe, the prices of heating oil and crude oil jumped in a shortened session on expectations that higher European prices could reduce American supplies. Natural gas and copper prices also rose. [71.]
 
British Pound at Four-Year High
Demand surged for the British pound, which hit a four-year high of $1.7125. The dollar's rally against the Japanese yen faltered in thin trading, with the dollar settling at 115.93 yen, down from 116.15 yen on Monday. [71.]
 
Fraud Accusation Against Schott
Marge Schott, whose ethnic comments have undermined her position as managing partner of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team, faces potentially more serious trouble over accusations of fraudulent sales reports that General Motors has lodged against her concerning actions at her Chevrolet-Geo dealership. [58.]
 
Travel Costs Expected to Rise
Travel industry consultants see higher 1997 costs. They expect hotel rates to climb 5 percent, domestic air fares to go up 5 percent, international fares 7 percent, and car-rental rates to rise 4 percent to 5 percent. They also see more women and more upper-echelon executives on the road. Business Travel. [63.]
 
A Call for Belt-Tightening
French and German leaders urged their restive citizens to keep making sacrifices so their countries could meet increasingly tough global economic competition. [4.]

Islamic Militancy vs. Money-Making in Iran

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: ISFAHAN, Iran

 BODY:
Isfahan, wrote Jean Chardin, the 17th-century French traveler, "was expressly made for the delights of love."
With its richly decorated domes and lush gardens, the royal city is a sensual delight, a place where shifting light and shadow caress the turquoise-and-cream-colored tiles of the mosques and where long arcades and soaring vaults spellbind even the most jaded tourist. 
 It is the splendor of Persian treasures like Isfahan, 200 miles south of Teheran, that Iran has begun to use to lure foreign tourists.
As part of its campaign, Iran announced last August that it would issue visas within 24 hours to foreigners seeking to visit the country. Even Americans, with a bit of persistence and pull, can get a visa within two weeks, although the State Department's official warning on Iran urges Americans to stay out "because of the generally anti-American atmosphere and Iranian Government hostility to the U.S. Government."
But nearly a generation after the ayatollahs seized the palaces of kings, Iran is still locked in a fierce and bitter struggle over how hospitable it should be to the non-Muslim world.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolution's late spiritual leader, used to rant about "the Western sickness among us." But the reality is that in a country with raging inflation, 20 percent unemployment and little foreign investment, hard currency counts. And tourists from places like Germany and Japan spend more than twice as much money as devout pilgrims from other Islamic countries.
With rulings that ban alcohol, forbid any display of affection among nonmarried couples and require women to cover their heads with scarves and wear clothing that hides the curves of their bodies, it is not all that easy being a tourist in Iran.
"I'm incredibly hot," complained one middle-aged female British teacher dressed in a flowered kerchief and long wool coat, who was part of an organized group of British high school students touring Isfahan. "Our guide keeps telling me to pull my scarf down over my hair, and I keep pushing it back."
Another obviously foreign female visitor who tried to check into a hotel with a man who was not her spouse (separate rooms, of course) was greeted with a look of terror by the receptionist at the front desk.
In the holy city of Qum, women dressed in scarves and trench coats but not the standard long black chador are such a curiosity that they can stop traffic. And the men of Qum -- even the turbaned clerics -- do not lower their gaze as required by a strict interpretation of Islam when the women walk by.
Not all of Iran is ready for a foreign invasion. In the southern city of Kerman, the public baths tucked away in the 300-year-old bazaar do not beckon. The colored tiles are broken; paintings on the ceilings are largely worn away. Floors are grimy; there are more cockroaches than bathers in the changing rooms.

Scoring a Caviar Connection
There was a time, in the days before Iran's revolution, when the thing to do on a sleepy afternoon in Teheran was to lunch at Leon's -- the upscale Russian restaurant in the heart of the capital that served double orders of rich beluga on paper-thin blinis accompanied by a bottle of Russian vodka encased in ice.
But Leon's closed soon after the Government turned Islamic. And since then, Iran's caviar market has been rocked by pollution, corruption and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Poachers in the four former Soviet republics bordering the Caspian Sea that produce 90 percent of the world's black caviar are both overfishing the sturgeon and saturating the market with caviar of questionable quality.
To make matters worse for Iran, the Caspian Sea has been rising for more than a decade, submerging hatcheries and blocking the sturgeons' spawning areas.
Since Iran exports most of its caviar for hard currency, there is none in the markets of Teheran these days and few of the better hotels and restaurants that list caviar on their menus actually stock it.
This scarcity has created a cottage industry for middlemen, who turn up at embassies and businesses with sacks full of contraband small-grained sevruga, at considerable risk, for as little as $80 a pound. "Caviar," said a food dealer in one market, "is more dangerous to sell than heroin."
One European ambassador acknowledges that he sometimes expedites tourist visa requests for his caviar vendor and his family. "He gets the papers he needs from the Embassy," the Ambassador said. "We get the caviar."

Uncle Sam Slips Through
The hunger in Iran for things Western, particularly American, seems insatiable -- from books and videos to clothing and foodstuffs.
The Clinton Administration's economic embargo against Iran has not made American goods disappear, just made them more expensive. Under Iranian customs regulations, Iranians entering the country are allowed to bring in one appliance, which has led to a lively importation of items like refrigerators. In a country where a mid-ranking civil servant's salary is less than $200 a month, a 27-cubic-foot General Electric refrigerator costs more than $5,000, a slightly used General Electric washing machine about $1,200.
In the Behjeatabad indoor food market in central Teheran, L'Oreal hair spray and a small jar of six German sausages sell for about $18 apiece, a bar of Dove soap for $4.
The Iranian Government remains deeply uncomfortable with foreign influences. Parliament recently passed a law banning Iranian companies from using Western names, and there is a move to purge the Farsi language of English words.
But schoolchildren routinely study English as their second language. English words (computer, fax, electronic, mechanic, secular, program, police, fluorescent, telephone, intellectual) are hard to translate. And a typical English lesson in the English-language daily, the Iran News, illustrates the pervasiveness of American culture: "A dime is an American coin. A dime is equal to ten cents. Ten dimes are equal to one dollar."

Freedoms That Come and Go
Iran is a country of fitful repression and unsettling unpredictability intended to keep the clergy in power and the population at bay.
Since last spring's parliamentary elections, the Government has tightened restrictions on the media and book publishing, intensified its confiscation of illegal satellite dishes and pressured artists and writers with arrests and ominous denunciations on television.
The system is still loose enough that Iranians routinely hold parties where women wear no veils and Armenian-made vodka flows freely. But many outspoken Iranians who have felt a layer of protection under the anarchy that has pervaded the country since the revolution suddenly have begun to ask foreign visitors not to call them at home.
Even diplomats are not immune. Last summer a dozen security police from the Ministry of Security and Information broke up a dinner party for six Iranian writers and intellectuals held by Jens Gust, the German Embassy's cultural and press attache. Mr. Gust was not allowed to call his embassy; the guests were interrogated and jailed for the night.
The Foreign Ministry apologized the next day; Germany, which as Iran's largest trading partner and closest friend in the West, is reluctant to antagonize the Iranians, responded by temporarily reassigning Mr. Gust to Bonn.

HEADLINE: Iran Contributed $500,000 to Bosnian President's Election Effort, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 31

 BODY:
Even as the United States was trying to roll back Iran's influence with the Muslim-led Government of Bosnia, Iran contributed at least $500,000 last summer to boost the election campaign of Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic, Administration officials said today.
The contributions, delivered by the Iranians in at least two suitcases full of cash, came on the eve of the national elections in September, in which Mr. Izetbegovic won a seat on the three-member presidency that is now to govern Bosnia after four years of war, the officials said. 
 The Central Intelligence Agency informed the White House and the State Department about the contributions shortly after they occurred around June, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the Administration concluded they did not explicitly violate Bosnia's pledges to sever ties with Iran as part of the peace accords negotiated in 1995 in Dayton, Ohio.
The Administration was nonetheless troubled enough that it raised its objections directly with Mr. Izetbegovic, the officials said. One declined to discuss Mr. Izetbegovic's reaction except to say, "He got our point."
The campaign contributions, first reported in the Los Angeles Times today, provided still more evidence of Iran's efforts to influence the Muslim-led Government, which relied heavily on Iranian military assistance, arms and even troops during its civil war with the Bosnian Serbs and Croats.
Iran's presence in Bosnia has exposed President Clinton to sharp criticism, particularly from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have argued that the Administration opened the door for Iran when it decided not to object to the flow of Iranian arms into Bosnia in 1994 in violation of an arms embargo.
Officials at the State Department and the C.I.A. said today that Mr. Izetbegovic's Government was now complying with its commitments to end military and intelligence cooperation with the Islamic Government in Iran. But the State Department acknowledged that cultural, economic and diplomatic relations, highlighted by the campaign contributions, continued despite repeated American protests.
John R. Dinger, a spokesman at the State Department, said that the United States strongly objected to any relations with Iran, which it brands an outlaw nation that sponsors terrorism.
Mr. Dinger said the United States would "remain watchful" of economic and diplomatic contacts between it and Bosnia.
"We clearly object to any ties with Iran, cultural or economic, as we would with any country," Mr. Dinger said. "But fundamentally we have to leave that to the Bosnian Government to decide."
Mr. Dinger and a spokesman for the C.I.A., David Christian, declined to discuss the campaign contributions, saying it was an intelligence matter. But the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they were an example of Iran's continuing efforts to aid the Muslims in Bosnia.
It was not clear how the money was used in the campaign or whether it had any real impact, since Mr. Izetbegovic handily won the seat in the three-member presidency set aside for a Muslim.
During the last year, the United States has pressed the Government in Sarajevo to end its cooperation with Iran. In June, President Clinton certified that Bosnia had cut off Iran's supply of arms and expelled thousands of Islamic guerrillas who fought beside Bosnia's army, clearing the way for some $200 million in aid for training and equipment.
In October, the Administration held up $100 million worth of tanks and other weapons intended for the military of the Bosnia and Croat Federation until Mr. Izetbegovic dismissed his Deputy Minister of Defense, Hasan Cengic. The Administration accused Mr. Cengic, a fervent Muslim nationalist and friend of the President, of having very close ties to Iran. Mr. Izetbegovic eventually dismissed him a month later.
Those steps have persuaded the Administration that Mr. Izetbegovic had carried out his pledges, although it has acknowledged in the past that some of the foreign volunteers have settled in Bosnia. "The analysis indicates that Iranian arms shipments have stopped and that military and intelligence links have been broken," Mr. Christian, the spokesman at the C.I.A., said today.
At the same time, Iran appears eager to maintain a presence in Bosnia. It has an embassy in Bosnia, and, as one official put it, "they do try to make diplomatic and cultural inroads."
The United States, the official and others said, continues to raise its objections with Mr. Izetbegovic, through diplomatic channels and through a commission it created with the Bosnian Government last fall as a forum to address its concerns.
"It's a serious problem," one official said. "It's one that we have addressed and continue to address."

HEADLINE: It's Jan. 1? Where Could Clintons Be?

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: HILTON HEAD, S.C., Dec. 31

 BODY:
Why, for the love of Pete, does President Clinton keep coming back to "Renaissance Weekend," the annual, deeply earnest, invitation-only intellectual and spiritual chaternalia held during the New Year's holiday?
Participants are assigned to read Kierkegaard and Pascal for half-day seminars devoted even on sun-kissed days to topics like "Moral Compasses for Modern Leaders." (Mr. Clinton arrived the day after that one.) They cluster indoors late into the night, listening to mild jokes about aging -- when you're 91, why go outside when there's the Weather Channel? -- while their adolescent offspring, giggling and unchaperoned, pile into the steaming whirlpool. The adults are seen wearing loafers when they walk on the beach. 
 And they unwind by networking, a pursuit from which Mr. Clinton, having just nailed his second Presidential election, can surely afford to retire as world champion.
Oh, sure, there's golf. In fact, when Mr. Clinton arrived on Monday afternoon, he headed straight for the links without stopping at the beachfront home he is borrowing here.
But Mr. Clinton, fellow weekenders say, also prizes the retreat for what Philip Lader -- who founded it in 1981 with his wife, Linda LeSourd Lader -- calls its commitment "to the premise of the incredible transforming power of ideas and relationships."
This is Mr. Clinton's 13th Renaissance Weekend, and as usual he came with his wife, Hillary, and their daughter, Chelsea. At a dinner on Monday night, he stayed until midnight, chatting with all comers, said participants and White House staff.
This morning, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton spent more than an hour in a panel discussion on "Spiritual Life in a Secular Society." The Clintons just listened, people who were present said.
The panelists included Rabbi Harold S. Kushner, author of "When Bad Things Happen to Good People," and Sister Charlotte Rose Kerr, identified in the official program as a "Catholic nun/acupuncturist."
Some 450 families are attending Renaissance Weekend, the overwhelming majority of them repeat visitors like the Clintons. The weekend costs $550 for a family and $500 for a couple, not including lodging. The Laders run four such weekends a year.
Guests may choose among 311 panel discussions or seminars running from 8 A.M. to 11:30 P.M. Described as generally freewheeling, they range from "Skepticism and Faith" to "Money Matters" to "What I've Learned About Love," with panelists drawn from the guest list. Children can attend the adult panels or ones designed for them, like "How Grade-A Professionals Can Avoid F's as Parents."
Outside the panels, the attendees bunch in hotel hallways and restaurants, throwing off conversational sparks that titillate uninitiated passers-by.
Urgent, booming voice: "Religion in the schools, prayer, teen-age pregnancy!"
Milder, slightly awed voice: "It's funny how we all come from immigrants in this country."
Agitated voice: "AND I'm supposed to have a book done by May."
Q: "Did you know all that stuff?"
A: "Kind of."
Much is made of the absence of titles and formality among the distinguished guests. From toddlers up, all but Mr. Clinton wear names tags on loops around their necks, presenting a first name in large letters and the second name in much smaller ones (BUD Zumwalt, for example, on the chest of Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt, the former Chief of Naval Operations).
Many see the sessions as a model for the country.
"Renaissance captures the civil discourse that ought to be normative in America at large," said Tony Campolo, president of the Evangelical Association for Promotion of Education.
The attendees include Lady Bird Johnson; Gail Sheehy, the author; Ron Silver, the actor; Stephen L. Carter, the Yale law professor, and Jim Rogers, the investment adviser.
It is a crowd where Barbra Streisand could be found empathizing with Senator Larry Pressler about his recent election defeat. Mr. Pressler said Ms. Streisand cited the setbacks suffered by the heroine of her recent movie, "The Mirror Has Two Faces."
Mr. Pressler, a frequent participant over the years, confessed to doing a little networking of his own this time.
"I'm looking for a job," he said. But the South Dakotan added that networking was far from his chief goal. "You have to be kind of a semi-searcher for the truth," he said.
The panels are all off-the-record. But many journalists are attending the retreat, including Thomas Edsall of The Washington Post, Paul Goldberger of The New York Times, and several from the newsmagazines.
On Monday morning, Jonathan Alter, the Newsweek columnist, was spotted trying to talk Clay Felker, the founder of New York magazine, into attending a panel on charter schools. They went to one on the budget instead, with such high-profile panelists as Joseph E. Stiglitz, Mr. Clinton's outgoing head of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Lawrence H. Summers, the deputy secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Alter cheerfully explained that, while the sessions are off-the-record, he got valuable story ideas from them.
Other journalists seem less comfortable discussing their presence here.
"No comment," said Howard Fineman, also of Newsweek, when asked if he was enjoying the conference. But as he walked away, Mr. Fineman allowed over his shoulder that he was having a good time.
Mr. Lader said that the weekend retreats -- which often, like this one, spill into midweek -- help the high-achieving attendees put their lives in perspective. Many of them, he said, juggle many balls, most of which are made of rubber and bounce if dropped.
"But some of the balls -- marriage, family, health, faith -- are made of crystal, and if you drop one of those balls it might crash and be lost forever," continued Mr. Lader, who is Mr. Clinton's administrator of the Small Business Administration. "Renaissance Weekend is an opportunity for gifted people who are very busy to spend time learning from each other, to help think through on their own and to reflect on which of the balls are made of rubber and which are made of glass."

 BODY:
The hallmark of the Clinton Administration's foreign policy over the past two years has been the low cost and low risks of its activism. Although critics charge that the Administration is prone to dangerous, wholesale interventions, a close look at the record shows that the military operations it has initiated have been discretionary and largely successful.
In Haiti, Bosnia, Macedonia and the Taiwan Strait, the use of limited force for limited ends was the correct approach for a great power to take. A selectively activist foreign policy -- the approach advocated by Secretary of State-designate Madeleine Albright -- has generally proved to be the most effective way of achieving American goals. 
 Such success seemed unlikely just two years ago. In the crises that faced the new Administration -- most of them legacies of the Bush years -- the Clinton national security team appeared hesitant and uncertain. There was the embarrassing initial aborted landing in Haiti, while in Bosnia the Administration at first threatened to use air power and to arm the Bosnian Muslims before it had a comprehensive plan.
Moreover, the Administration was stifled by Gen. Colin Powell, who as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was consistently unwilling to deploy American troops abroad except in overwhelming numbers, making any mission politically infeasible. It was not until General Powell retired in 1993 that the Pentagon could be counted on to provide forces commensurate with American goals.
Then the Clinton foreign policy started to take hold. In the three most difficult cases inherited from the Bush years -- Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia -- Mr. Clinton succeeded in furthering American interests without locking us into a military quagmire.
In Somalia, where President Bush had committed troops even though it was of no strategic importance, Mr. Clinton had to find a way to withdraw. It was a messy operation -- 18 American soldiers died -- but it removed the issue from the agenda.
The United States invasion of Haiti in September, 1994, made possible a free election. It is a shaky democracy, but it is better than anything Haitians have known in their tragic history. No one is being murdered by government thugs, and the corrupt old guard is in exile in the nightclubs of Panama City.
After the deployment of 30,000 troops, the uncertain peace negotiated by the Clinton Administration endures in Bosnia. Yes, Defense Secretary William Perry has announced that about 7,500 American soldiers will have to stay in the region well beyond the deadline originally set for December. But it is only because of the American presence in Bosnia that a long-term settlement has even a prayer of coming to pass.
And a few hundred United States troops insured that Serbian expansion did not extend into Macedonia, a strategically important fledgling nation.
American gunboat diplomacy defused the crisis in the Taiwan Strait in the spring of 1996 when the Chinese were conducting missile tests off Taiwan's shores. By sending the warships, President Clinton reassured the Japanese that the United States was an ally to be counted on and respected. Shortly thereafter, Tokyo backed off its threat to kick the American military out of bases in Japan and Okinawa.
To build on these triumphs and define a foreign policy for the next decade will mean dealing with more than the debris of the cold war. It will also require more than brandishing high-tech weaponry and airlifting troops to troubled regions. The United States must face up to the issues of growing global economic inequities, cultural and religious attacks on modernity, looming environmental disasters, terrorism and a world financial economy increasingly beyond the control of traditional nation-states.
We will surely not be able to solve these problems alone; only a truly internationalist foreign policy -- not an isolationist one nor a unilateral one -- could even come close to doing so.
Nonetheless, there will be occasions for the use of limited force for limited ends, and an American foreign policy team that vacillates over the use of United States armed forces would undermine our power to further larger strategic goals. Of course, it would be equally dangerous to stage an ideological, neo-Wilsonian campaign to be the world's policeman enforcing a Pax Americana.
Ms. Albright would do well to follow the tradition of pragmatic realism as forged by two of her most illustrious predecessors, John Quincy Adams, architect of the Monroe Doctrine, and Dean Acheson, who established the cold war policy of containment. Her record suggests that she understands this tradition of activism at its most sophisticated and unhesitating.

Expansion Control Helps Smooth Airlines' Wild Earnings Ride

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The airline industry has made remarkable progress in recent years in smoothing out its historically wide-swinging business cycle. For a lot of consumers, that is too bad.
After all, it has long been one of the industry's failings that in good times, the airlines as a group would order far more aircraft than they really needed. By the time the planes were delivered, traffic growth had typically fallen off, leaving too many planes for too few passengers. And because an empty seat is worthless to the airlines, they would start bruising fare wars -- to the cheers of travelers -- to fill their seats. 
 The most recent such bonanza occurred in the summer of 1992, when airlines cut fares as much as 50 percent on many routes.
That fare sale and the effects of the Persian Gulf war on oil prices and travel were some of the many problems that contributed to the American airline industry's cumulative losses of more than $13 billion between 1990 and 1994.
These losses apparently taught the industry a lesson about overexpansion: Profits are more important than market share. It was an obvious lesson in hindsight, but required the airlines to discard a long-cherished notion that size and market share were the paths to profits.
After a couple of years with a good economy and the tight control maintained by airlines over the number of seats in the market, the industry is expected to report record profits for 1996. This discipline has given the airlines a rare ability to set fares at profitable levels.
This means that fares have been going up. Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares magazine, keeps a running tally of fare increases, and said that the industry had raised fares more than 35 times since 1992. Now, those same round-trip tickets for flights between New York and the West Coast that sold for less than $200 in 1992 cost at least twice that much, even at sale prices.
Mr. Parsons said that fare increases could be attributed to more than tighter airline capacity and a healthy economy. Airlines now have a more sophisticated understanding of traffic patterns on their routes, and know more precisely what travelers are willing to pay.
"When the airlines are doing well, consumers are going to have to work harder to get the big savings," Mr. Parsons said.
However, consumers still hoping for the industry to return to its self-defeating ways were given new reasons to be optimistic about fares recently. Shortly after the industry appeared to be on its way to an unusual run of sustained profitability, it resumed the old habits that had led to excess capacity and had exaggerated the effects of the broader economic cycles.
The USAir Group, for example, placed an order in early November for up to 400 aircraft from Airbus Industrie. That order, however, is contingent upon USAir management's getting an agreement from its labor groups to lower its costs, currently the highest in the industry.
Two weeks later, American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, placed a firm order for 103 new jets from the Boeing Company, and said that it might order several hundred more planes from Boeing as part of a deal in which it committed itself to making Boeing its sole supplier of aircraft for the next 20 years.
But the new planes do not necessarily mean more capacity. Because of tough Federal noise standards that go into effect in 2000, many of the new planes will simply replace older models that will be sold outside the United States because the cost of modifying them to meet the tougher standards is too great. And despite the large orders from American and USAir, aircraft orders and scheduled deliveries for the industry last year still remain below earlier peaks.
Even so, the new orders are prompting many industry analysts on Wall Street to re-evaluate their estimates of capacity growth.
Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst at Paine Webber, said that his estimate for the airlines' total capacity growth for 1997 is 4.3 percent. Two years ago, he had projected 3.5 percent. The capacity growth, he said, suggests that airline executives are losing some sense of self-discipline. "There is no question they are losing their religion," Mr. Buttrick said.
Will that mean a return to the kind of fare wars that prompted so many spontaneous trips in 1992? With the airline industry's notorious unpredictability, no one is willing to guess. But for now, the industry is enjoying the rare thrill of profitability.
"There is nothing more exciting," David A. Swierenga, chief economist at the Air Transport Association, said, "than making money."

Conditions Are Right for a Takeover Frenzy

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Growth is steady, but slow. Suppliers are not raising their prices, but nobody else can either. Costs have been cut deeply in a decade of downsizing, leaving few easy options for improving the bottom line.
What is a chief executive hungry for greater earnings to do?
In 1996, the answer was to eat somebody else's company. 
 Mergers and acquisitions soared to more than $647 billion in value, almost three times the 1993 level. Looking ahead, analysts say the biggest obstacle to the wave's continuation is the number of big targets that have already been bought.
But the forces behind the surge that has helped to reshape corporate America remain: frustration over anemic growth, global competition and a soaring stock market that put money in the pockets of those looking to buy.
And over the last two years one big deal has served to spur another. Last fall, the Rite Aid Corporation of Camp Hill, Pa., reached across the country to acquire Thrifty Payless Inc., the largest drugstore chain in the West, and create a bicoastal giant with 3,800 stores.
At the same time, Martin Grass, chairman of Rite Aid, announced he was pulling out of Florida and Alabama, selling 190 stores to a competitor, Thrift Drug Inc., a division of J. C. Penney, that promptly announced its own bid for greatness: a $2.5 billion merger with the Eckerd Corporation, a drugstore chain spread across the South.
Mr. Grass said this "strategic realignment" would result in $65 million in savings and more influence with suppliers as Rite Aid sought to dominate 21 of the top 50 metropolitan markets in the country. Although the numbers change, the strategic reasoning has driven reshufflings in transportation, health care, banking, broadcasting and aerospace as well.
"Companies can no longer rely on raising prices to increase their earnings," said Stanley A. Nabi, chief investment officer for DLJ Investment Management. "They have to find other ways of improving their profit margins, expanding their unit growth and controlling costs. They can buy market share or enter related businesses. All of that spells M.& A."
Such consolidations accounted for nearly two-thirds of last year's merger and acquisition activity.
But Wall Street analysts are clearly of two minds about whether this rapid pace can be sustained. The television broadcasting industry, like the hospital industry, has gone through a round of combinations and may have finally exhausted itself. But takeover specialists expect that the consolidation of commercial banks and electric utilities will continue unabated and that competition in the telecommunications and pharmaceutical industries will increasingly be played out on a worldwide stage.
"Companies and industries will be more global and that will require a great deal more M.& A.," Mr. Nabi said. "You're going to have industries consolidating, where the No. 4 or No. 5 company will disappear. They'll either be absorbed, or they'll give up the ghost."
The stock market is near an all-time high, the economy is growing slowly and inflation and interest rates are low, so all the factors contributing to the merger boom remain in place, said Brian Finn, co-head of the mergers and acquisitions department at CS First Boston. But he was more cautious in looking forward.
"The level of activity is so enormous that it's hard to forecast that it will stay this high," Mr. Finn said.
In the meantime, combinations abound. The number of takeovers jumped to more than 10,150 in 1996, from 6,307 in 1993.
As the number of commercial banks slowly shrinks, the Nationsbank Corporation has announced a $9 billion-plus agreement to buy Boatmen's Bancshares Inc.
The military and aerospace industry, pushed by the Pentagon, is also undergoing a huge consolidation. The Lockheed Martin Corporation's $8.7 billion agreement to acquire the Loral Corporation last summer was followed by the Rockwell International Corporation's announcement that it would sell its aerospace and weapons divisions to the Boeing Company for $860 million.
Those deals were dwarfed by Boeing's agreement to buy the McDonnell Douglas Corporation for $14 billion, bringing the total value for military industry mergers to more than $40 billion the last four years.
Deregulation and the dissolution of international trade barriers are fueling a white-hot level of activity in telecommunications, broadcasting and utilities, which together accounted for 27 percent of all the deals. The largest deal of all in 1996 was the proposed $21.3 billion merger of the Bell Atlantic Corporation and the Nynex Corporation. But no industry was immune, be it used-car sales operations or insurance.
The Microsoft Corporation, the Oracle Corporation and other companies have developed a new appetite for acquisitions, yet the information technology industry continues to grow by about 15 percent a year. "In 1996, there were more than 1,500 transactions in information technology, 4 or 5 a day," said Charles Federman, chairman of Broadview Associates, a merger adviser. "There's a realization that the information technology market is global and respects no geographic boundaries, coupled with technological innovations."
With shares trading at 20 times earnings and better, many chief executives are flush with a currency for transactions: company stock. According to figures compiled by J. P. Morgan, three-quarters of the takeovers of public companies involved stock swaps, or a combination of stock and cash.
Whether stock prices stay at record levels or not, is, of course, the great unknowable. But analysts say that even if a correction makes it harder to support stock swaps, there is money on the sidelines, in the hands of the financial buyers waiting for prices to come down.
But much of the reasoning behind the deals stands in sharp contrast to the last merger boom -- in the late 1980's. Conglomerates were all the rage then on Wall Street. In pursuit of a higher rate of return, chief executives collected widely disparate companies under one corporate umbrella, culminating in the $24.6 billion leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.
That approach was "pure financial engineering, and it has not proved to be very successful," Mr. Nabi said.
Now, by contrast, the focus has gone from conglomerates to "core" businesses. Investors are rewarding companies that buy with an eye to expanding activities that they are already successful in and that offer greater potential for savings and economies of scale. Mergers to build core businesses are being accompanied by brisk activity in selloffs of divisions once valued for diversity but now viewed as diversions.
After peaking in 1988 at $353 billion, merger activity declined sharply with the recession. Companies instead hacked at administrative and operating costs to improve the bottom line. Then the stock market came back with a vengeance.
"We went through a long period where companies squeezed efficiencies out of their own companies," said Rick Escherich, head of the policy analysis group in the M.& A. department at J. P. Morgan. "The next logical thing is to squeeze it out of a combination."

The ups and steep downs of the gambling industry in 1996 -- and the prospect of tough sledding ahead -- were perhaps best captured by two large casinos in Las Vegas, Nev., that opened last year, the Stratosphere and the Monte Carlo.
The Stratosphere, an intensively promoted $550 million 1,149-foot tower built by the small Stratosphere Corporation, opened, only partly completed, at a poor location, and it bombed. The company is flirting with bankruptcy. The Monte Carlo, on the other hand, is on the Strip, is well managed by its two owners, the giant Mirage Resorts Inc. and Circus Circus Inc., and its 3,000 rooms have remained largely full since the spring opening. 
 "I think the lessons are that this is going to be a year fraught with very high levels of competition," Jason Ader, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, said. "I don't have high hopes over all for the market. The big must-see properties in Las Vegas, like the Mirage, Circus Circus and the operations of MGM Grand Inc., they'll do O.K. But it takes a very solid business to do that in this environment."
W. Bruce Turner of Salomon Brothers, added, "It's been the march of the giants pretty much, and that is likely to continue."
That message is proving true across the country. Atlantic City, which appeared early in 1996 to be on a trajectory of sizzling growth, has been stalled by a promotional war among the casinos and delays in the development of some huge new resorts in the Marina District.
The casinos in Atlantic City are giving away rolls of quarters to lure in slot players at the rate of $1.5 million a day, David Wolfe of Oppenheimer & Company estimated.
One of the victims of the weak environment has been Donald J. Trump's gambling concern, Trump Hotel and Casino Resorts Inc. The company has seen its stock plummet from a high of $35.50 in June to $12.
In addition, riverboat gambling, which swept the Midwestern states several years ago, was hit with greater competition and far greater selectivity among both gamblers and investors. The Bear, Stearns index of riverboat company stocks has fallen 46 percent from its peak in early June.
"I'm very concerned about the riverboats in the year ahead," Mr. Wolfe of Oppenheimer said. "It takes something really special and very good management to beat the competition out there."
And even in Las Vegas, a continuing supply of new hotel rooms and casinos is likely to maintain pressure on smaller companies. A total of 6,400 hotel rooms and 7,700 gaming positions were added in Las Vegas in 1996. In 1997, another 5,000 hotel rooms and nearly 10,000 gaming positions will be added, according to Salomon Brothers.
Over all, America's recently acquired ardor for gambling remains fairly strong; gambling concerns are believed to have taken in more than $45 billion in revenue in 1996.
But investors' fascination with the industry has dropped from the giddy heights of early 1996. The Bear, Stearns gambling stock index has tumbled from its peak in June despite the rise of the broader market indexes.
The wave of mergers that some analysts had predicted would shore up stock prices never materialized, aside from a few big transactions, like the Hilton Hotels Corporation's $3 billion purchase of Bally Entertainment.
"Massive consolidation is not going to happen," Mr. Wolfe said. "The better players can borrow from the banks and build without paying a premium for an existing property."
Lee Isgur, the gambling analyst at Jefferies & Company, said: "The rich are getting richer, and the poor in the industry are getting poorer. Don't expect the magic of consolidation to change that."
Brian D. Egger, the gambling stock analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said his favorite stocks for the year were three of the largest companies: Circus Circus, Mirage and Primadonna Resorts Inc.
Mr. Isgur predicted that Hilton Hotels might surprise the industry by making another big acquisition in 1997, perhaps even making a run at Circus Circus.
His picks for 1997 include Station Casinos Inc., which is completing a big new riverboat in Kansas City, Mo.; Rio Hotel and Casino Inc., which is working on a renovation of its Las Vegas operation; Mirage, and Circus Circus.
"I look at it as a transitional year," Mr. Isgur said. "I think 1998 is going to be more exciting, and toward the end of 1997 that will start to get through to people and help these stocks."
Mr. Ader's principal picks for 1997 are Circus Circus and Mirage. Hilton, he said, will benefit somewhat from the cost savings as it absorbs Bally. The ITT Corporation, which owns Caesars Palace, is in a transition year because it is pouring more than $2 billion into renovating and expanding its casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, and thus would be unlikely to improve before the latter part of the year.
Mr. Wolfe picked Circus Circus, MGM Grand and Sun International Hotels Ltd., which is managing the Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut and which owns Paradise Island in the Bahamas.

The Link Grows Cloudy Between Jobs and Prices

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The current economic recovery is nearly six years old, and the annual inflation rate is a meager 3.2 percent -- the lowest level since World War II for an expansion this old. Economists are coming up with all sorts of explanations for the unusual milestone. And gradually many are concluding that inflation has become harder to explain.
The most striking aspect of this milestone is the scramble it is provoking among economists to repair the theory that they use to link unemployment and inflation. The theory, a keystone of economic policy, says that when the unemployment rate falls below a certain flash point, inflation soon accelerates. But the flash point foreseen in theory, 6 percent, was breached months ago, and nothing happened. The unemployment rate went as low as 5.1 percent, and still nothing happened. 
 "What we have had is a magical belief that we can arrive at an unemployment number that will tell us about inflation," said Richard Rogerson, a University of Minnesota economist, at a conference convened to figure out what had gone wrong with the theory. "We can't."
The theoretical concept, known as the natural rate of unemployment, holds that at a certain level, the unemployment rate is just high enough to avoid labor shortages that would push up wages, prompting companies to raise prices to cover the additional labor costs. This equilibrium level, at which the inflation rate neither rises nor falls, has varied from decade to decade, but when the unemployment rate moves below what the Federal Reserve and the economists consider the natural rate, a series of responses develops that usually end in recession.
The Federal Reserve raises interest rates to discourage business activity. The unemployment rate then rises as people lose jobs, and the inflation rate falls. But instead of stopping at the natural rate, restoring an equilibrium, the unemployment rate often keeps rising as the economy slows. This sequence in the 1960's and the 1980's, the two other periods since World War II when a recovery has lasted as long as the current one, culminated in recessions. But with the natural rate theory so much in doubt today, the odds of a repeat performance are less.
"This is a time to leave everything alone," said Edward S. Hyman, president and chief economist at ISI Group Inc., a Wall Street firm.
The trade-offs were much clearer in December 1966, when the 1960's recovery was also three months short of being six years old. The unemployment rate had fallen to 3.8 percent on average for that year, from 4.5 percent in 1965, and as it fell, the annual inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, rose to 3.5 percent from less than 2 percent in 1965.
The Vietnam War was a big factor, of course, pushing down the civilian unemployment rate and raising wages as working-age people entered the armed forces, leaving labor shortages at home. But with interest rates rising, the economy slowed and recession came in late 1969. Two years later, the unemployment rate, having reversed direction, was 5.9 percent, while the inflation rate had been cut almost in half.
The 1980's recovery reached 69 months, the age of the current expansion, in August 1988. Just about then the inflation rate began to edge up from 4.4 percent, while the unemployment rate, true to theory, fell from 6.2 percent on average in 1987 to 5.5 percent in 1988 and 5.3 percent in 1989. In response, the Fed pushed up interest rates and the unemployment rate changed direction, reaching nearly 7 percent during the recession that started in 1990.
This 1980's experience brought many economists to the conclusion that 6 percent was the natural rate of unemployment, or equilibrium level. So when it fell below 6 percent in the summer of 1994, the great expectation was that prices would rise, in response to the rising cost of wages and benefits. That did not happen. Indeed, as the unemployment rate inched steadily downward to less than 5.5 percent (it is now 5.4 percent), neither labor costs nor the inflation rate changed much.
Still, many forecasters and economists, particularly on Wall Street, where nervousness about inflation is part of the landscape, insist that the natural rate thesis remains valid and will show itself in 1997 in rising prices. "It is as important as ever," said Albert M. Wojnilower, senior economic adviser for Clipper Asset Management, "but no one is so sure anymore where the natural rate is."
That uncertainty is very evident among economists in academia, where the natural rate theory originated in the 1960's. One problem is that theoretical work on the natural rate is too often divorced from gathering concrete evidence in the field, some economists argue. So they are listing numerous possible reasons for the breakdown in what once seemed a predictable relationship linking unemployment, wages and inflation. Steep declines in computer prices and health care costs, for example, help slow inflation, says Robert Gordon of Northwestern University. To offset this drag, the natural rate of unemployment must fall. Until recently, Mr. Gordon had put the natural rate at 6 percent; he now puts it at 5.5 percent or less.
Others argue that because Europe and Japan are suffering from weak economic growth, they are quick to use their idle industrial capacity to produce merchandise inexpensively for export to the United States. That undercuts corporate America's efforts to raise prices in response to low unemployment and wage pressures.
Downsizing, weaker unions, new technology that makes old skills obsolete, reduced expectations about wages and a growing reluctance to quit a secure job when raises are not forthcoming -- all weaken workers' bargaining power, even when the unemployment rate is low, economists say. So does the huge contingent of temporary workers who often take slots once held by higher-paid regular employees.
The caveats have grown so numerous that a few economists, including James K. Galbraith of the University of Texas at Austin, have concluded that the natural rate of unemployment is a useless concept. "This may mean reconstructing one's thinking from the ground up," he said.
Most economists and policy makers, however, say they still believe in the natural rate as "a useful theory to understand inflation," as Joseph Stiglitz, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, has put it. But they cannot quite figure out what the current level is. That has made many economists more willing to experiment, to let the unemployment rate fall, even at the risk of a slightly higher inflation rate for a while.
"You would get an additional expansion of the economy," said Dean Baker of the Economic Policy Institute, "and you might create an additional 800,000 jobs."

 Unlike previous steady expansions, in the 1990's the "core" inflation rate -- changes in consumer price index excluding food and energy -- has not increased even after more than five year growth. Graph tracks the core rate after the recessions in the 1960's, 1980's, and 1990's. The 1970's are not shown because inflation fluctuated at much higher levels. (Source: Merrill Lynch & Company)

Debate Over Taxes in '97 Is Likely to Stress 'Relief'

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Goodbye, tax reform. Hello, tax relief.
A year ago, scrapping the income tax system and replacing it with a flat tax, a national sales tax or just about any other tax was a leading topic in Washington. This year, the focus is on handing out tax goodies. 
 The dividing line between the White House and Congressional Republicans is whether to tie tax breaks to specific conduct, such as earning B's in college, or to make across-the-board rate cuts and let taxpayers decide how to use the money.
The change can be seen in the statement that Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, issued right after President Clinton's re-election. It said nothing about tax reform.
Mr. Archer, in an interview, said he still wanted to "tear the income tax out by its roots." But for the time being, he added, he will focus on more practical aspects.
"Tax reform was in style last year," observed Donald C. Alexander, an Internal Revenue Commissioner in the 1970's and now a tax lawyer at Aiken, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. "But what's in style for 1997 is, regrettably, ideas that will louse up the tax code even more than it is and make things more complicated."
Max B. Sawicky, an economist at the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute, said that in terms of tax law changes in 1997, "We're back to small potatoes."
Here are some of the tax favors being proposed for the coming year:
CAPITAL GAINS Congressional Republicans want a broad cut in capital gains taxes, under which the current 28 percent maximum rate would be reduced to perhaps 20 percent and as little as 7.5 percent for people in the lowest tax bracket.
Some kind of capital gains tax cut has good prospects for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it might help cool down the stock market, where many people are holding on to stocks they regard as overvalued just to avoid paying capital gains taxes that would be owed if they sold.
President Clinton, who during the campaign, said, "I'm not philosophically opposed to all capital gains cuts," said last month that he would consider the issue "only in the context of balanced-budget negotiations." He said he would judge any proposed capital gains tax change by a simple standard: "Does it give you jobs and incomes?"
Reducing capital gains rates temporarily, say for three years, should bring more money into Government coffers in the first two years, as people cash in appreciated investments, especially stocks that they had not sold to avoid a big tax bill. If investors believe, however, that any temporary reduction in capital gains rates might become permanent, then the effect of a tax "sale" on Government revenues -- encouraging people to cash in and pay the taxes before rates go back up -- could be much less significant.
"I think the President has already signaled that he is willing to consider reductions in the capital gains tax rate," Mr. Archer said. "The question is simply, how will it be done?"
HOMEOWNER CAPITAL GAINS President Clinton has proposed exempting up to $250,000 in capital gains on home sales ($500,000 for married couples), which would cost the Treasury perhaps $600 million annually. Current law grants a one-time $125,000 exemption for those aged 55 or older. Capital losses on homes are, and would continue to be, nondeductible under the President's proposal.
"The last thing we need is more tax subsidy for residential real estate," said Lee A. Sheppard, a tax attorney who critiques methods of avoiding taxes for Tax Notes, a weekly magazine about taxes.
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and an adviser to Speaker Newt Gingrich, said House Republicans would oppose treating homeowners separately in a capital gains tax rate bill. "Bill Clinton said he was for a capital gains cut on people who own houses," Mr. Norquist said. "So why discriminate against farmers and small-business owners?"
AIRLINE TICKETS In a bit of tax deja vu, the 10 percent tax on airline tickets expired at the end of 1996, just as it did a year earlier. The tax was reinstated for most of 1996, but only temporarily, because of a quirk in Federal budget rules. A special bill to reimpose the airline tax is unlikely.
Lapse of the tax is a boon for airlines, but the tax is almost certain to come back in some form eventually, because it finances the air traffic control system.
EDUCATION President Clinton won applause on the campaign trail when he proposed letting parents or students deduct up to $10,000 in annual college expenses and when he offered a tax credit of up to $1,500 for community college students who earn B's or better and stay off drugs. Critics warn that the plans could drive up tuition without significantly helping bright, but poor, students get a college education.
NONPROFITS Hearings into political activities by tax-exempt organizations appear likely, although Mr. Archer warned that this is a "very delicate area."
Representatives John R. Kasich of Ohio, the House Budget Committee chairman, and Dan Coats of Indiana are promoting a tax credit to cut income taxes dollar-for-dollar on donations to charities that spend 75 percent of their funds to help the poor.
ESTATE TAX House Republicans still favor raising the exemption from estate tax to $750,000 from $600,000, although to fully adjust for inflation since 1987, when the exemption was last changed, would require raising the exemption to more than $800,000. Mr. Clinton has indicated he supports some modest estate tax breaks.

Hong Kong Isn't on Edge Despite China Takeover

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG

 BODY:
With scarcely six months remaining before Britain relinquishes Hong Kong to China after 150 years of colonial sovereignty, the anxiety among the general public seems to have missed much of the territory's business community.
Even though China is dismissing Hong Kong's elected legislature, promising harsh new laws on subversion and treason, and challenging the status of hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents who have British citizenship, Hong Kong's economy, at least for the moment, seems unperturbed. 
 "I think from where we stand the way it looks is moderately positive," Miron Mushkat, the chief economist for Asia at Lehman Brothers, said. "We are arguing that the recovery from the slowdown of '94, '95 and into '96 is returning to trend, and the recovery is coming from the domestic arena."
Since midsummer, Hong Kong's stock market has been on an uphill run, slowing only in recent weeks. And Hong Kong's economic growth, while slower than in the last two years, is continuing at a rate of 4.7 percent a year.
"When we look at the trends of G.D.P. growth, we can see it is rising all the time," Tang Kwong-yiu, a Government economist, said. "It reached the bottom in the first quarter of this year," when the growth rate was only 3.3 percent annually.
But despite the surge in economic growth, worries do remain for the future. Exports, according to the Government's quarterly report, are likely to remain weak, and imports, battered by a strong United States dollar and weakening demand in China, have continued to shrink. Chinese demand for imports has a big impact on Hong Kong, which is a conduit for much of that trade.
Even so, one of the pillars of Hong Kong's economy, the property market, has bounced back significantly, with housing prices shooting up 30 to 50 percent the last year. One component in the sharp rise in office and apartment prices, according to David Faulkner, a partner at the property consulting firm Brooke Hillier Parker, is the influx of Chinese companies to Hong Kong.
"They're all looking to position themselves here after 1997," he said, referring to July 1, 1997, when the Chinese flag is to be raised here.
"The consequences of the Chinese coming," Mr. Faulkner continued, "is that it will create a lot more demand for office property here, and I'm not sure there's enough on the supply side of the equation. On the residential side, Chinese companies are buying quarters for staff, and at the moment, the supply side of residential is not sufficient. The only real alternative is inside China."
At the moment, the Government's parsimonious doling out of land -- a practice that has created the giant real estate conglomerates headed by many of the territory's well-known tycoons -- has produced an economy that many see as disproportionately driven by unrealistic real estate prices. The stock market, which is now 30 to 35 percent property stocks, must inevitably shift and is certain to do so under Chinese rule, according to Peter Churchouse, the managing director of Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd.
But Mr. Churchouse sees an even more fundamental shock awaiting Hong Kong as it slides into the grasp of Beijing. "In 15 years, Shanghai will be the financial capital of this country," he said. "The climate and nature of what Hong Kong does will change. It will become the capital of a subregion of China of 100 million people."
While that may be true, foreign investors are generally bullish on Hong Kong's prospects, at least near term. Mark Michelson, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce here, said that 95 percent of American businesses are either "favorable or very favorable" toward Hong Kong in the years leading up to the new millennium.
"I think there's fairly good confidence in the Hong Kong economy," Mr. Michelson said. "Coupled with this is the fact that politically things look a bit better" both within China and in its relations to the United States and Taiwan.
At the same time, Mr. Michelson said, "there are some issues of concern." He went on: "To no one's surprise, the rule of law is seen as very important. Another thing is the unrestricted flow of information, which is an issue for business people as well as for those in the media. People here have to make business decisions based on a variety of information about the region and Hong Kong and need to be able to continue to do that. The other concern is corruption, the implication is that it could move in this direction."
Despite the confidence of investors, a recent Government report found that the number of companies planning to leave Hong Kong in the next year had risen to 7 percent from 3.8 percent a year ago. Still, the Government was careful to point out that soaring rents, not concern over political changes, are pushing companies out.
Yet, many economists say they believe the transfer of sovereignty will be relatively uneventful. "The economy will go through largely unscathed." Mr. Mushkat of Lehman Brothers said. "Generally, I'm positive, but I would not go overboard."

Do Computers Lift Productivity? It's Unclear, but Business Is Sold

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Dell Computer Corporation has designed its newest factory without room for inventory storage. The Chrysler Corporation can increase vehicle production without building new factories. And the General Electric Company expects to save millions of dollars by buying spare parts for its plants over the Internet.
On the surface, these are manufacturing stories. At heart, they are among the thousands of new business practices made possible by technology. 
 But the question remains: Just how have the changes wrought by computers and software affected the overall economy? Have they helped to smooth the bumps in the business cycle by enabling companies to be more efficient? Or is technology's principal contribution to be found in the hardware and software those companies buy and sell?
That America is deep in a love affair with the computer is not in doubt. As of last year's third quarter, the annual rate of spending on information technology in the United States was $251 billion, or 3.6 percent of the nation's total output of goods and services. That compares with an annual rate of $47 billion, or 1 percent of gross domestic product, in the third quarter of 1980.
Louis V. Gerstner, chief executive of the International Business Machines Corporation, recently predicted that the global information technology industry would grow to $1.2 trillion in annual revenue by 2000 from $800 billion today.
"The fact is that corporate America's appetite for technology now shows no bounds," said Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley.
Which is odd, because what statistical evidence there is suggests that computers have had a relatively small impact on improving productivity, particularly in services.
Mr. Roach and other economists say the lack of statistical evidence does not much matter. What is important, they argue, is that the corporations that are buying the technology are convinced it is helping them.
"Because that perception is real, irrespective of what the verdict is, it is safe to say that technology has played an increasingly powerful role in driving capital spending and in reshaping the overall business cycle contour in the United States," Mr. Roach said.
There is no doubt that the vast amounts of money being spent on technology have helped the economy maintain its steady growth rate, and have made up for the relative weakness in some areas of the economy, like personal consumption, during the current expansion.
"There is always something that is growing fast, and it happens to be high technology right now," said Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board who is now an economics professor at Princeton University.
But technology boosters insist the economists are failing to grasp the important changes that computers and software are bringing to thousands of companies.
"To say that the results aren't there asserts a level of unsophistication about the economy," said Michael Hammer, the management guru and co-author of "Re-engineering the Corporation," the 1993 best seller that became required reading for many chief executives. "The payoffs have been enormous."
 Information technology has allowed businesses to streamline their operations in revolutionary new ways, Mr. Hammer added. Retailers can monitor sales at the checkout counter and restock their shelves even before a popular product is sold out. And when demand surges, heavy manufacturers can squeeze additional output from existing plants more quickly and less expensively than by adding new factories.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the country's largest retailer, 16 months ago began recording every sale in every one of its 2,268 stores in a giant "data warehouse." The company uses the data to fashion targeted marketing strategies while distributing products to the stores where the most people are likely to buy them.
The German software company SAP A.G. has grown rapidly by selling sophisticated programs that automate and seamlessly link all aspects of a company's operations. The system processes orders; schedules and tracks manufacturing; dispatches and tracks goods, and makes sure they are invoiced properly so that the bills sent to customers match the orders.
"It is difficult to overstate the amount of unproductive work that was going on in large organizations until the 90's," Mr. Hammer said. "It would be common for 90 percent of the time it took for something to happen to be wasted time."
Dell Computer, which has doubled in size to $8 billion in annual revenue in the last two years, is perhaps the purest example of the efficiencies made possible by information technology. Unlike the rival Compaq Computer Corporation, which uses a vast network of resellers, Dell sells all its systems directly to its customers. The company waits until it has received an order before it begins to build a machine.
"We don't have to guess what our customers are going to buy," said Michael S. Dell, the company's 31-year-old founder and chairman. "They tell us every day."
Dell recently redesigned its computers so that each model incorporates as many of the same component parts as possible. The company minimizes the number of parts it holds at any one time by relying on its suppliers to stock its factories in much the same way as packaged goods companies stock their products on supermarket shelves.
At the end of September, the company had 12 days of inventory, Mr. Dell said, meaning that it replenishes its parts stocks some 30 times a year. That allows Dell to respond quickly to new technology, shifts in customer demand and changing prices.
But Mr. Dell wants to go further. In a bold experiment, the company's new factory in Austin, Tex., is designed to drive inventory levels even lower. The new plant will have no storage space. "We believe that if you don't have any place for inventory, then you won't have any inventory," Mr. Dell said.
Such efficiency, Mr. Hammer and others say, has helped insulate the national economy from the waxing and waning of the business cycle. If businesses no longer overproduce during booms, they won't be forced to cut production and lay off workers when demand slackens.
On the other side of the equation, information technology has also allowed companies to produce more with less. When Chrysler decided to increase car production, it used computers and overtime to squeeze more cars out of its existing operations rather than build a new plant.
"I do share the hunch that information technology has improved inventory management and hence muted one of the important short-term movers in the business cycles," Mr. Blinder acknowledged. But he said it was a hunch rather than a conviction because hard evidence of a connection did not yet exist.
Indeed, even high-technology companies have not managed to immunize themselves from traditional inventory bloat. Another computer maker, the Digital Equipment Corporation, stumbled badly in early 1996, when it was caught with thousands of unsold personal computers that were built before a plunge in memory chip prices. When PC prices followed chip prices lower, Digital sustained heavy losses, forcing a revamping that cost 7,000 jobs.
Nevertheless, technology proponents say that world is in the beginning of a process that will accelerate with the rapid adoption of the Internet as the primary means of commercial communication.
General Electric, the diversified industrial and financial giant, is converting its entire supply chain from paper to the Internet, a shift executives say will save hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
G.E.'s lighting division has already begun using the Internet to solicit bids for spare parts for its factories overnight instead of over two weeks. The solicitations go out over the global network to a selected group of suppliers, who reply with their bids the next day.
Orville A. Bailey, a G.E. executive involved in the Internet project, said he was aware of the so-called productivity paradox, according to which little gain has been seen from the widespread use of personal computers. But he added that he believed that the Internet would change that dramatically. "For the first time, we are able to leverage the investment that has been made in computer technology, because for the first time, everyone can talk to everyone else," he said.
And that should fuel continued steady growth, right?
"It could be true," Mr. Blinder observed skeptically. "But the only thing I know about seers is that they are always wrong."

In Mexico, an Uneven Recovery

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
A few of the Mexicans who will help determine how the economy performs this year were milling one holiday afternoon outside the display windows of a famous department store in Mexico City's central square.
Some, like Humberto Navarro, a 38-year-old lawyer, studied the store's offerings and came out with arms brimming with packages. 
 "My personal economy allowed me some room to maneuver," Mr. Navarro said, describing how the revival of his law practice in 1996 convinced him that Mexico was on its way back to sustained growth after the disastrous slump that followed the 1994 devaluation of the peso.
Others admired the windows but left the store empty handed.
"Things are just going from bad to worse. Wages aren't going up but everything else is. We hardly can afford to put dinner on the holiday table," said Maria Ceja Zambrano, a 60-year-old homemaker, with the melancholy of one whose holiday is dampened by want.
One test of success for Mexico this year will be whether consumers resume sustained spending. Economists generally agree that President Ernesto Zedillo's tight-money policies, bolstered by the $28 billion used from a bailout program led by the United States, achieved an unexpectedly rapid turnaround for Mexico's overall economy.
But the recovery remains limited and fragile. Driven by a surge in exports, it has been felt mostly in the exporting industries of the north and among the middle class. Wage workers from Mexico City to the south are still wavering on the edge.
And as citizens like Mr. Navarro and Mrs. Ceja consider their own economic realities, they will vote in midyear elections that could change the course of Mexican politics for the first time in more than 60 years. Voters angry with the governing party could hand the opposition a majority in the Congress, which controls the nation's budget and the influential Mexico City mayor's office. In 1997, the economy depends more than ever on the political transition, analysts said.
The elections "will be the prime source of the news events that will control expectations about the future of Mexico," said Abel Beltran del Rio, the top Mexico analyst at Ciemex-WEFA, an economic consulting group. The expectations will govern the foreign capital flows, the stability of the peso and interest rates.
Mexico finished 1996 with healthy gross domestic product growth of about 4.5 percent and 29 percent inflation, numbers that vindicated official projections which were widely scoffed at when Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz made them in November 1995. The peso defied the pessimists by slipping gently over the year and finishing at about 7.88 to the dollar, staying below the psychological watershed rate of 8.
For 1997, most economists expect the Government's projection of a 4 percent increase in gross domestic product to prove conservative and inflation to continue declining to below 20 percent.
Wall Street investors who were furious at the Banco de Mexico, the central bank, for setting off the devaluation in 1994 by letting foreign currency reserves dip so low, ended last year with grudging praise for light-handed moves by Miguel Mancera, the bank president, that helped ease interest rates downward.
"My biggest concern is the Mexican consumer," Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan Stanley, said. "There has been a lot of unemployment, a lot of shifting of workers from higher-paying to lower-paying jobs. Now that we've got recovery started, where are the new rings on Mexico's tree going to come from?"
There are signs that Mexicans are becoming more confident about opening their wallets. In the auto industry, which all but died in 1995, production for the domestic market was up 71 percent in November compared with the November a year earlier. Official third-quarter figures showed overall consumer demand up 5.1 percent, the first sign of life in this indicator since the crisis began.
Although the Government has pledged billions of dollars to save the banking system from implosion, many Mexicans are still overwhelmed by old debts and are crying out for new credit. Only solid-gold corporate customers are getting loans.
In 1996 direct foreign investment dipped by about $1 billion from a record high of $7 billion the year before. Still, Mexico is riding a wave of long-term investment set in motion by the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.
What the midyear elections hold is hard to predict. Recent electoral seasons have been agitated, marked by intrigue and even, in 1994, two high-level political assassinations. Although the confidence of portfolio investors has been somewhat restored, in part by the healthy performance of the Mexican stock market last year, they could remain skittish if political unrest appears again.
Mr. Zedillo staked his presidency on moving Mexico toward a more open political system. But in recent weeks he has moved closer to the old guard in his Institutional Revolutionary Party, giving the impression that insuring victory may have become more important than leveling the field for the opposition.
The main legal opposition group is the National Action Party, which draws its strength from the business in northern Mexico and is committed to conservative economic policies. The election's effect will depend on whether any big players, in Mexico or abroad, lose their nerve.
"Mexicans are not used to how noisy democracy is," Mr. Brown said. "In all likelihood, once people get used to it, they will realize it doesn't have much to do with the course of the economy."

U.S. Sales Of Autos Expected to Keep Pace

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
For decades, few industries have been as cyclical as the automobile business, with sales soaring in good times and plunging so deeply in bad times that the very survival of some auto makers has been threatened.
But for the last three years, sales have been on a somewhat strong and remarkably steady plateau, with buyers snapping up sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and pickup trucks in particular. Auto executives concur that 1997 will turn out much like 1996. 
 In December, Alex Trotman, the chairman, chief executive and president of the Ford Motor Company, issued precisely the same sales forecast for 1997 that he had given a year earlier for 1996: overall industry sales of 15 million to 15.5 million passenger cars, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and heavier trucks. Sales totaled 15.1 million in 1995 and 15.4 million in 1994 -- both figures well up from 1993, when auto makers sold just 14.2 million vehicles in the United States.
"We expect it will be more of the same for the auto industry, which would be great," Mr. Trotman said. He added that his optimism for continued strong sales in 1997 was based on an assumption that unemployment and inflation would remain low and the American economy would continue to produce jobs at a brisk pace, because the auto market often tracks closely the performance of the overall economy.
The General Motors Corporation echoed his forecast, while the Chrysler Corporation said it expected industry sales to hit 15.2 million.
Japanese auto makers were slightly more cautious. "We hope it would get to 15 million to 15.5 million vehicles next year, but that is very optimistic," William C. Duncan, general director of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said.
This unprecedented stability in sales is saving the industry billions of dollars, mostly by avoiding the kind of inventory gluts that come with downturns. "Cycles are very, very costly," Van Bussmann, Chrysler's top economist, said, because "you get whipsawed in this kind of high-fixed-cost industry." He added that over a decade the steadier path would increase Chrysler's profits by 25 percent.
But getting off the roller coaster has created a few problems for the industry. Low inflation has left customers more resistant than ever to auto makers' efforts to raise prices. Ford, in particular, has been hurt by that sentiment. A year ago, Ford created an expensive new design for the Taurus, only to watch customers choose less expensive, if less sophisticated, midsize cars made by its rivals.
Low inflation has also made the United States a much more attractive place to invest. The result has been a torrent of investment that has helped push up the value of the dollar and made Asian and European cars less expensive here.
In the first two months of the 1997 model year, which began on Oct. 1, the Big Three lost 2.1 percentage points of market share to Japanese and European auto makers. G.M. lost the biggest share. While 2.1 percentage points might not sound like much, if that pace persists for a full year, it would amount to 315,000 cars and trucks and about $5.7 billion in lost sales.
"Exports from Japan have picked up already," said Jaime D. Seguino, a research economist at Ford. "Certainly, it is something we're concerned about."
Together, the rising dollar and the reluctance of American consumers to pay higher prices have put pressure on auto makers to cut costs to increase their profits.
Despite fairly strong profits, Ford is eliminating 6,000 jobs in its car development division. G.M., Chrysler and Honda are helping their bottom lines by leaning heavily on their suppliers to reduce costs.
To the extent that there are concerns about whether auto sales will stay strong, the worries are focused overseas. Auto executives and economists for the Big Three said they did not see a downturn on the horizon, though they expect that one will come eventually. When it does, it will most likely be caused by something unexpected, like the outbreak of a war or a shock to oil markets, they said.
"Business cycles are created not just by policy management, but by external shocks to the economy," said G.M.'s chief economist, G. Mustafa Mohatarem.
Economists and executives said the threat of economic turbulence caused by unpredictable events remained. "I expect there will be, in the next five years, a downturn," Mr. Trotman said.
All three have been stuffing cash into their reserves against such a rainy day. Chrysler, which is seen as most vulnerable to an oil shock because of its heavy sales of mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, has an $8.7 billion cushion. Ford has set aside $13 billion, below its reserve target, and G.M. $14.5 billion, more than its target.

Merger-Hungry Banks Find the Pickings Slim

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Like children whose summer vacation dreams turn to snow, some of America's leading bankers occasionally will confess that nothing would make them happier than a good recession.
"I can hardly wait for problems to come," said Richard M. Kovacevich, chief executive of the Norwest Corporation, the Minneapolis banking giant. 
 That may sound shocking, six years after a recession sounded a death knell for hundreds of banks. In the slow-growing and rapidly consolidating banking business, however, many bankers see artful mergers as the best source of growth.
But all bankers look like geniuses when the economy is good, and the soaring stock market is inflating the prices of even the most undistinguished banks. Bad times expose bad loans, and bankers like Mr. Kovacevich long for the days when losers were clearly separated from winners and an ailing fixer-upper bank could be bought for a song.
"A lot of our best acquisitions were made when the industry had problems," he said wistfully.
Bankers, moreover, cautiously hope that another recession will show the many skeptics that they, at least, have learned something from their past follies and will not be drowning in bad loans the next time the economy hits a bump.
"If we get a cycle where banks don't have big declines in earnings, the companies will be viewed as less cyclical and will get overall higher valuations," said Moshe A. Orenbuch, a bank stock analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Bank stocks currently sell for about 12 times their earnings, far less than the 18 times earnings the average company fetches.
"I would like to see the industry manage through a cycle better than we had in the past," said David A. Daberko, chief executive of the National City Corporation of Cleveland. Even so, he is not so mean spirited as to call for the bears. "From a mergers and acquisitions standpoint, a down market would be better, but you never hope for that," he said.
Indeed, as best as bankers can tell, there is no economic or lending crisis brewing. Lending standards are slipping, experts say, as bankers provide more money to companies at ever lower rates, for longer terms, on looser conditions. But these loans are widely dispersed geographically and by industry. No one can see a particular buildup -- like oil-patch loans in the mid-1980's -- that might set off a disaster.
Consumer loans, especially on credit cards, do show all the classic signs of a bubble, with rapid growth in the face of rising delinquencies and losses from personal bankruptcies. But while the pain could well increase this year, it will not lead to a crisis in the absence of a serious economic downturn.
"The scary thing is we have low unemployment now; God help us when it goes up," Mr. Kovacevich said, somewhat hopefully.
Yet, in the face of what promises to be a steady time for banks and with stock prices rising, some bankers think they cannot wait for the next down cycle before looking for other banks to buy.
The $9.1 billion deal to buy Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. of St. Louis by the Nationsbank Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., last year is considered a turning point.
Hugh L. McColl Jr., Nationsbank's chief executive, is seen as the banking industry's ultimate power shopper, having built the North Carolina National Bank into what is now the country's fourth-largest bank by buying big, ailing banks that other bankers were too scared to touch. By last year, Mr. McColl decided he could not afford to wait any longer for more bargains and agreed to buy Boatmen's at full retail price.
That deal, however, was the anomaly in a year that saw far fewer mega-mergers than 1995, when giants including the Chase Manhattan Bank, the First Chicago NBD Corporation and the First Fidelity Bancorporation were absorbed by rivals. In 1996, bankers either turned up their noses at bank prices, as Mr. Kovacevich did, or they were busy dismissing people, closing branches and doing the other dirty work necessary to make the previous year's deals pay off.
And some big banks started to wonder whether those deals were worth the bother.
"I don't think that most of the acquisitions that have been done made sense for the acquirer," said David A. Coulter, chief executive of the BankAmerica Corporation.
Nonetheless, merger experts predict that even without a recession to cut prices, the volume of bank mergers will pick up in 1997.
"A lot of people who are on the sidelines looking at their prospects are not going to be content to sit out another round of consolidation," said Edward D. Herlihy, a merger lawyer at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
One reason is that the buoyant equities market has affected buyers as well as sellers. Most bank acquisitions are paid for with stock, rather than cash; thus, the rising market effectively has put more money in buyers' pockets.
Salomon Brothers recently analyzed potential suitors for 42 banks. The study found that at current stock prices, there was at least one buyer for most of the targets studied that could afford to buy the bank at a premium to its current market price.
"A year ago, there were very few possible deals," said Carole S. Berger, a bank analyst at Salomon. "Now, there are a lot."
Meanwhile, many medium-sized banks are more willing to sell because the business is becoming more difficult. The profits of recent years have come from cost-cutting and mergers, but many bankers realize that unless they can increase revenue, the party is over.
"Our objective is earnings growth of 10 percent a year," Mr. Daberko of National City said. "Our traditional corporate and consumer banking business is only generating 6 or 7 percent increases."
To make up the difference, his bank is pushing into new areas, from asset-based lending to riskier auto loans. "We have 15 initiatives to increase revenues," he said. "In 1997, they have to work."

Rising Dollar Has U.S. Executives a Bit Concerned

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The dollar's rally last year against its two main rivals -- the Japanese yen and the German mark -- pushed the American currency up far enough that American executives have begun to worry anew about its impact on competitiveness, sales and profits.
The dollar was bolstered in 1996 by lower interest rates in Europe and Japan and better economic performance in the United States than abroad, both of which attracted foreign capital here. The outlook for this year is mixed. But even forecasters who see the dollar treading water this year think factors already in place could well move it higher toward the end of the century. 
 And that raises a question: Are American companies ready to deal with a stronger dollar?
Van Bussmann, chief economist at the Chrysler Corporation, thinks American auto makers have become quicker on their feet, a change seen throughout the country as American companies revived their competitiveness over the last decade.
But Mr. Bussmann is not sure that Americans are as nimble as the Japanese, who have made an art of surviving a strong yen by cutting costs and holding back price increases. "Maybe on average we cannot change as rapidly as the Japanese," he said, adding that most American companies would have a hard time matching the Toyota Motor Corporation's recent cost-cutting turnaround with its Camry model.
And he is worried that a weaker yen will augment Japan's cost-cutting advantage, adding to profits from sales in the United States and making it even easier for Japanese auto makers to avoid raising prices.
"If that nimbleness to reduce costs is supplemented by a depressed currency, that is a double whammy," Mr. Bussmann said.
Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, is also worried, both that American companies may have trouble with a stronger dollar and that despite the association's own forecast the dollar still might move higher in the year ahead.
"I think that despite the revolutionary changes American manufacturers have made to put them in a low-cost position, they are not adequately prepared to deal with a yen of 115 and higher," he said.
The dollar hit 116.18 yen on Monday, its highest since March 1993, and some forecasts for this year have it continuing to rise. It finished 1996 at 115.93 yen, up 12 percent for the year.
While Mr. Jasinowski is less concerned about the dollar's rise against the mark, which finished the year up 7.2 percent at 1.5415, he said a further strengthening would pressure American companies.
And the Clinton Administration should pay close attention to exchange rates, Mr. Jasinowski added. "Both Japan and Europe are looking to export their problems to the United States by manipulating their exchange rates," he warned. He said Japan, Germany and other European countries, especially France, were trying to bolster the dollar to kick-start their own economies by making their exports cheaper.
These concerns and jawboning by the Clinton Administration come at a time when the dollar has rallied 13.9 percent against the mark since its all-time low of 1.3534 and 43.8 percent against the yen from its all-time low of 80.63, clearly reducing a competitive advantage that helped earnings at many American companies.
If the dollar moves higher this year, American companies could try to press the Clinton Administration to help them out.
The National Association of Manufacturers is forecasting a decline in the value of the dollar, but Mr. Jasinowski said he saw "considerable risk on the upside."
Many Wall Street forecasters expect the dollar to rise at the beginning of 1997 but fall enough later to finish the year lower, easing the pressure on American companies.
That is the case at Goldman, Sachs & Company, where economists forecast rates of 105 yen and 1.45 marks to the dollar at the end of this year. The move down, according to the Goldman forecasters, will be propelled by a rising United States trade deficit and an expected increase in the outflow of United States capital as other countries' economies begin to pick up in 1997.
But Jim O'Neill, Goldman's chief currency economist, said he now expected the current strength of the dollar "will remain longer," taking the currency to 1.60 marks and 116 yen early this year.
The chief economist at Salomon Brothers, John Lipsky, said the dollar may not move much this year but is poised to go higher over the next several years.
"There are two good arguments to think that the dollar is in a period of longer-term recovery," Mr. Lipsky said.
Foreign investors, he said, still have higher inflation expectations for the United States than they do for Germany and Japan, and those expectations depress the value of the dollar. But this perception is likely to change if the current moderate rate of inflation here continues.
The second force is the expected buildup in the national savings rate as individuals invest more for retirement and the Clinton Administration and Congress move to cut the budget deficit.
Michael Rosenberg, head of international fixed-income research at Merrill Lynch & Company, forecasts that the dollar will shoot higher this year against both the yen and the mark and continue to rise thereafter. By the end of 1997, he forecasts rates of 120 yen and 1.70 marks to the dollar.
Similar forces are driving the dollar against both currencies, Mr. Rosenberg said. In Japan and Germany -- as well as most of the rest of Europe -- central bankers will keep interest rates low while governments cut spending (in Europe) and raise taxes (in Japan) to bring down their deficits. Such a policy mix, he said, is a prescription for a weaker currency, which means the dollar moves higher. Citing one example, Mr. Rosenberg said economic growth in Germany remained weak enough to prompt the Bundesbank, the German central bank, to cut key interest rates one more time, a move that could strengthen the dollar.
But Mr. Rosenberg, whose view is one of the most bullish on Wall Street, is less worried than others about the impact of a stronger dollar. "One reason the U.S. is so strong is that the dollar has been undervalued," he said, arguing that at 1.70 marks to the dollar, the American currency is still "undervalued by our calculations."
The strong dollar does not necessarily mean United States companies will lose market share, he said. "But the profits won't be so good," he added.

Even if Times Get Tough, the Technology Industry Is Expected to Shine

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
With the United States seemingly mired in a cycle of steady but slow growth and hundreds of companies struggling to eke out even small profit increases, the technology industry is a standout.
And at the companies that make computers, software and high-tech drugs, rising demand and increasing exports suggest strong growth will continue, largely independent of the overall economy. 
 The information science industry is currently benefiting from a convergence of technological advances: the release of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows NT, the operating system awaited by business customers; ever more powerful Pentium and Pentium Pro processors from the Intel Corporation; the shift to Intranets, which model internal computer networks on the technology of the global Internet, and compelling new software applications that need all that power and connectivity.
At the same time, the customer base has become far more global, while the United States has remained the dominant supplier. Even the poorest countries see a need to invest, while stronger economies in Asia and Latin America can help balance swings in demand at home.
Medical technology moves at a different pace from information science; product development times and product life cycles are measured in years rather than months. Nevertheless, growth is still driven by product innovation, which continues at a rapid pace. A handful of biotechnology companies became profitable in 1996 as their first drugs gained regulatory approval, and this exclusive club could grow rapidly in 1997, with as many as 30 new drugs nearing the market.
Innovative drugs and devices also drive double-digit growth at established companies like Pfizer Inc., Merck & Company and Johnson & Johnson. These concerns in effect have become large biotech companies, working in partnership with researchers in smaller companies and academia. Since one new drug for a major disease can rapidly generate $1 billion or more in revenue, the growth potential here is enormous.
"We really do have a profound change in our economic model, from a mass-produced, consumer-based economy to a global, technology-based economy," said Michael Murphy, publisher of the California Technology Stock Letter.
Analysts say that if growth slows in 1997, there would inevitably be some reduction in capital outlays, but history shows that most companies continue to invest in new technology, because it is a strategic asset. Suppliers with hot new products can thus maintain growth even in a recession.
"The deployment of information technology infrastructure is a solution to becoming more efficient," said Thomas A. Thornhill, director of technology research at Montgomery Securities. "Not doing it becomes a competitive issue; companies that fail to invest through the down cycle will emerge in a relatively weaker position on the other side."
A new breed of corporate software applications that can help increase sales has proved especially compelling, according to Mr. Thornhill. These applications in turn have driven sales of larger computers as well as new operating system software and networking equipment. These programs, like a sales management application from Siebel Systems Inc. called Sales Enterprise, do more than just reduce costs. "Because it's a revenue-generating product, there's a substantial willingness to pay for it," Mr. Thornhill said.
In addition to product cycles, economic, political and demographic shifts are driving growth for technology companies. The transition to an economy based on information and communications from one based on manufacturing means even small companies can address a global market. Meanwhile, the fall of Communism has opened new countries to American goods.
Roger McNamee, a principal in Integral Capital Partners, said the United States now faced an opportunity unmatched since 1946, when its powerful manufacturing base supplied the rebuilding of Western Europe.
"For a long time, the politics prevented you from selling to a lot of countries, even if they wanted to buy," Mr. McNamee said. "Now every country is on a market economy, and they need infrastructure to attract capital. You find third world countries putting in wireless telecom systems often before they put in running water and roads.
"We've gone from being able to sell to one-third of the world to selling to everybody." Mr. McNamee said, adding, "I believe technology will rise to about 15 percent of gross national product from about 8 or 9 percent now."
Young customers just entering the marketplace will also lift technology sales, according to Mr. McNamee. "Everyone in college today was born after the Apple II shipped; they don't know a world without computers," he said.
At the same time, their aging baby-boomer parents are ever more voracious consumers of health care. But with the continuing drive to push health care costs lower, the products that create sales growth must meet previously unmet needs, improve outcomes and lower costs -- and possibly produce phenomenal growth.
"When you have a breakthrough therapeutic agent in an underserved disease, most of the time people underestimate the impact," said Viren Mehta, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly. He notes that before the introduction of SmithKline Beecham P.L.C.'s Tagamet, the first modern ulcer drug, in 1979, the worldwide market for the previous therapy, mostly antacids, was just $150 million. Today, the market for Tagamet and other drugs like it is about $9 billion, with an additional $9 billion worldwide for a later generation of ulcer medications. "New classes of drugs quickly transform the way things are done," he said.
Mr. Mehta said the Warner-Lambert Company's new drug for diabetes, Rezulin, could rapidly become a multibillion-dollar product, and he pointed to as many as 30 new drugs in the late stages of clinical trials that could enter the market in 1997. These include cancer therapies from British Biotech P.L.C., the Idec Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Biocryst Pharmaceuticals Inc.; a platelet-cell generating drug from Genetics Institute Inc.; a new drug for CMV retinitis in AIDS patients from Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., and a new drug for Lou Gehrig's disease developed jointly by the Chiron Corporation and Cephalon Inc.
"Compared to 16 companies that were cash-flow positive in 1995, we expect 50 in 2000," Mr. Mehta said.

Payoff Still Elusive In Internet Gold Rush

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Before corporate America's recent dash into cyberspace, the last time so many people went so far and spent so much to get so little was perhaps the gold rushes of the 19th century. In 1996, Internet lucre proved as elusive as the mother lode.
At least for the prospectors. Just as the stampedes to Sutter's Mill and the Yukon yielded far more broken hearts than bonanzas, the quest to make money on the Internet has been, for many entrepreneurs, as frustrating as navigating the World Wide Web. 
 And while the digital miners are meeting with spotty success, the real winners are those who sell axes, sluice pans and mules.
Ever optimistic, the companies betting on the Internet sales are sure success is just around the corner.
"The people who thought '96 was the gold rush were chasing fool's gold," said Kate Delhagen, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company in Cambridge, Mass., which estimated the Internet economy at $14.8 billion in 1996.
"Ninety-seven will be the first real year of action on line," she added.
Analysts, of course, were saying the same thing about 1996 a year ago. But at least a few more of the thousands of companies that have opened doors in the electronic shopping mall seem likely to turn the corner this year, if only because the heavy start-up costs required to become serious Internet merchants will recede farther behind them.
There are three main ways that companies (and individuals) are trying to make money on the Internet. The first is to develop content so compelling that people will pay to see it, a strategy that has succeeded mostly in the pornography market, but is also being followed by Encyclopaedia Britannica (http:// www.eb.com/) among others.
The second, and far easier, path is to sell advertising, generally consisting of little banners at the top of popular Web pages that with one click will take the user away to a Web site for, say, a taco. Many observers question the effectiveness of banner ads, and many users complain about finding sales pitches everywhere. But a few companies are attracting solid, if not spectacular, revenue from advertising.
Take the Starwave Corporation. A creation of Paul Allen, the other Microsoft billionaire, Starwave developed ESPNET Sportszone (http:// espnet.sportszone.com/), one of the most popular sites on the World Wide Web, as well as official sites for the National Basketball Association and the National Football League.
On an average day, Sportszone alone attracts about 400,000 people, who make almost 3 million visits to pages within the service, according to Michael B. Slade, Starwave's chief executive.
Starwave charges Sportszone advertisers $22.50 per thousand page visits, and so the company takes in at least $65,000 a day in advertising from Sportszone alone. Another 25 percent of company revenue comes from subscriptions from serious fans who are willing to pay for even more services, including sports news, statistics and fantasy leagues.
But even that is not enough. As a private company, Starwave is not required to release financial information, but Mr. Slade gave no indication that the enterprise is in the black. "I would be very surprised if any company in our realm is profitable," he said.
"It's probably reasonable to assume a business like ours, if it doubled, would be looking pretty good. And that will probably happen in the next year."
Advertisers seeking heavily used trails have clustered on the sites of the big World Wide Web search engines. Excite Inc., the Infoseek Corporation, Lycos Inc. and Yahoo Inc. all sell advertising. They all went public last year, though none has yet reported a profitable quarter.
The third road to Internet riches is taking orders on line for real-life products, a $518 million market in 1996, Forrester Research estimated. When experts talk about on-line retailers, one of the first names that comes up is Virtual Vineyards (http://www.virtualvin.com/), which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., and has shipped tens of thousands of bottles of Internet-ordered wine since early 1995.
Venture capitalists have invested about $3 million in the company, said Cyndy Ainsworth, the company's director of marketing. But are they profitable? "Not yet." How about next year? "Optimistically, I hope so." One reason that profits remain only virtual is that Virtual Vineyards had to make huge investments in both hardware and software to get its system up and running, Ms. Ainsworth said. Tack on a direct-mail promotional campaign that included offers of free biscotti, and starting an Internet business can get pretty expensive, she added.
Preview Travel Inc. (http:// www.previewtravel.com/), based in San Francisco, sold more than $1 million worth of airline tickets on the Internet in the first week of December. "Profitability for companies like ours is a late '97 event," said the company's chairman, Jim Hornphal.
But Jeff P. Bezos, founder and chief executive of Seattle-based Amazon.com (http://www.amazon.com), which bills itself as "Earth's biggest bookstore" and is generally regarded as one of the big Internet success stories, with sales increasing by more than one-third each month for the last 18 months, put things in a different light.
"We are not profitable," he said. "We could be. It would be the easiest thing in the world to be profitable. It would also be the dumbest. We are taking what might be profits and reinvesting them in the future of the business. It would literally be the stupidest decision any management team could make to make Amazon.com profitable right now."
So who is making money on the digital frontier? Wilderness guides and hired guns. Data networking companies like Cisco Systems Inc. and the 3Com Corporation are flush, as are a growing number of the designers who put Web sites together. They reap the investments other companies must make to join the on-line marketplace.
"I wouldn't say '97 is the year of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow," said Starwave's Mr. Slade. "I'd say it's the year when things continue to improve.
"As a commercial medium, it is maybe 20 months old." he said. "That would be like cable TV in 1977, the magazine industry in 1800, radio at the turn of the century. Yet the pace of what's happened in 18 months is amazing."

I Remember Larry

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
One of the unheralded spies of the postwar era was Larry Wu-tai Chin. As an agent of Chinese Communist intelligence, he penetrated the C.I.A. and served as Beijing's "mole" for more than two decades.
After his arrest in 1985, the spy -- true to his training -- foiled his captors and protected his superiors by using a plastic bag to commit suicide in his cell. Spymasters from Langley to Yasenovo agreed: Larry Wu-tai Chin was one great spy. 
 Memories of Larry are triggered by an unexamined facet of Clinton's Asian money scandal.
Chinese intelligence operations are sophisticated, patient, disciplined, and underrated by a C.I.A.-F.B.I. counterintelligence culture still transfixed by Primakov's disciples in Moscow. China's primary intelligence priority is no longer to steal military or nuclear secrets, as in Larry's day, but is now politico-economic espionage.
You don't have to be a conspiracy nut to recognize that China needs not only to learn trade secrets, but also to discover -- perhaps even influence -- U.S. Government trade policy and negotiating positions that directly affect the $35 billion balance-of-trade surplus essential to the growth of China's military and economic power.
This might fit that strategy:
* An Asian financial empire named Lippo shares ownership of a Hong Kong bank with Beijing known to be used by Chinese intelligence;
* the Lippo banking family, ethnic Chinese named Riady, climbs aboard the Clinton 1992 campaign;
* the family gives its former Hong Kong bank officer a $900,000 bonus and places him in a top-secret post in the newly elected President's Commerce Department, where he is privy to the development of policy ending restrictions on trade with China;
* the Lippo banker placed in Commerce continues frequent local and international telephone contact with his previous employers;
* on Sept. 13, 1994, James Riady and his Beijing-traveling lawyer (a founder of Little Rock's Rose Law Firm) agree with the President himself, in the Oval Office, to reassign the family's man from Commerce to the job of chief Asian fund-raiser for the 1996 Clinton campaign, and
* the Chinese-American banker channels in millions, and only newspaper exposure of illegal fronts for huge donations forces a reluctant Justice Department to investigate and a triumphant campaign to return some of the money.
Other strands: A Chinese-American restaurateur in Little Rock who travels frequently to Beijing raises over $600,000 in money from fronts for the Clintons' legal defense, is then able to bring Wang Jun, the most notorious Beijing arms dealer, inside the White House to meet the President for a reason as yet unexplained. Meanwhile, another illicit contributor from Asia is given substantial Presidential face time to deliver her pitch for trade preferences for China.
Is this a pattern of aggressive fund-raising, corrupt influence peddling -- or part of an intelligence operation?
The possibility of economic intelligence penetration is beyond the depth of Mark Richard, now trying to contain the investigation within Clinton Justice. Another person who should be on this job is Paul Redmond, the C.I.A.'s counterintelligence chief.
Redmond got the Angleton mole-hunting chair at Langley because he developed a distaste for Aldrich Ames before it was popular. But because Redmond's central experience was with the Soviet East European division, his mind is not set Asiaward, and he is in danger of becoming what David Cornwell calls an "espiocrat." His bosses are loath to unearth Clinton embarrassments, especially if the White House's Tony Lake is to be their new Director.
But House and Senate Intelligence Committees should be asking: have any of our assets in Asia been tasked to learn of penetrations of the Clinton Administration? Has the National Security Agency been "walking back the cat" -- putting its computers to work on miles of stored tapes, tracing overseas telephone or E-mail conversations of White House, Commerce, D.N.C. and Ex-Im Bank aides and Arkasian middlemen with foreign officials or cutouts?
Such evidence could not be used in court. But on national security matters, as Larry Wu-tai Chin's macabre victory taught us, it is sometimes more important to learn the extent of the damage than to put possible agents in jail.

China's Demand for Control Pits Ethics Against Profits

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For China watchers, the first warning that Beijing was linking politics and trade in new ways came in 1994, when it demanded that Rupert Murdoch pull the BBC's news from Star TV, his direct broadcast venture based in Hong Kong.
Alarmed, Mr. Murdoch, who had boasted that his venture's small satellite dishes "posed an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes," immediately complied in the hopes of winning access to China's booming market. 
 More recently came Disney, which was warned in the fall that if it wanted to bring Mickey Mouse to Chinese children, it had better rethink its forthcoming film about the Dalai Lama of Tibet. Disney said it would ignore the veiled threats.
And China is still wrestling with Western news organizations, including Reuters and Dow Jones, over whether all of their products must flow through a Government-controlled spigot -- a plan that may be rooted as much in China's desire to skim a slice of the profits as to control the information that traders see on their desktop screens.
None of this should have been surprising; from Saudi Arabia to North Korea, governments around the world are trying to figure out ways to attract Western investment while still weeding out undesirable ideas.
But China has taken the balancing act to new levels. Its sheer size and rate of growth give it enormous leverage in dictating the terms under which it will open its markets to specific businesses. And Washington is uncertain whether it is willing to confront the political restrictions China is imposing -- just at a time that it has delinked trade issues from human rights concerns.
"We don't know how to tackle this one," one of President Clinton's most senior economic advisers acknowledged here recently. "It's one thing if a country insists that you build airplane parts on their territory in return for buying a bunch of Boeings. We understand the politics of how to handle that. But everything gets a lot stickier when they insist that if you want access to their market, you have to help maintain their dictatorship."
China doesn't portray the issue that baldly, of course. But more and more it is asserting a right to open its market -- especially to new investment -- only to those companies that are willing to accept China's view of itself and the world.
In fact, the politics of dealing with that problem are enormously complex. Companies are forced to make the agonizing choice of whether to bend to China's wishes, or to risk future access to a multibillon-dollar market. Should software vendors bend to China's demands for "filtering" features that would cut off access to anything in cyberspace that Beijing finds politically incorrect? Should providers of news programming tailor their offerings to Beijing's demands, or simply walk away from a huge potential market?
Critics of China on Capitol Hill point to China's effort to intimidate the likes of Disney or Star TV to bolster their argument that the Administration was foolish to draw an arbitrary distinction between trade issues and human rights. Mr. Clinton may have "delinked" China's trading rights from its human rights performance in 1994, they argue, but the Chinese themselves are relinking those issues in 1996.
If Beijing feels free to link Disney's right to build theme parks in Southern China to the kind of movies it makes about the Dalai Lama, these critics argue, why should the United States fear to link China's rights to sell goods in America to how it treats its dissidents?
"It's a tempting bit of logic," said Robert Zoellick, who was James A. Baker 3d's chief strategist at the Treasury Department and later at the State Department. "And certainly the Chinese would be wise to be careful about the kind of links they create. But we have to be careful, too. The key to credibility when you threaten to use trade sanctions is that you really have to be willing to pull the trigger in the name of human rights and other democratic concepts." Sometimes, of course, the United States is willing to pull the trigger and cut access to American markets -- but usually when the economic stakes do not amount to much. Washington has cut off nearly all trade with the repressive Government of Myanmar, but Myanmar, formerly Burma, does not exactly rank among the world's great trading nations.
But when it comes to China, the political and financial stakes are far greater, and Washington still walks on egg shells. It has quietly protested the effort to force Dow Jones & Company, Reuters and others to funnel all their news services to China through the state-run news agency, Xinhua. But American officials almost never talk about the problem on the record and try to cast it as a commercial dispute -- whether Xinhua has a right to part of the revenues for the torrent of information flowing into China's trading rooms -- rather than a free- expression issue. And it is on difficult ground protesting China's restrictions on direct-broadcast television; after all, broadcasters here are licensed by the Federal Communication Commission.
"There are some issues of enormous political sensitivity that you are better to deal with privately, quietly," Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative, said.
So can China achieve its goal: Keep the investment money pouring in, while keeping a tight rein on the investors? Its model is Singapore: one of the world's freest trading ports, but a country that filters CNN broadcasts, bans private ownership of direct-broadcast television dishes and regularly drags Western newspapers, from The Asian Wall Street Journal to The International Herald Tribune, into court.
But the battleground for this contest of wills is Hong Kong. For a century the city-state has enjoyed its status as one of the world's great commercial centers in part because it married free trade with an open society. And it is there, this year, that China will truly test its thesis that you can enjoy the benefits of the first without enduring the discomfort of the second.

Some Big Rewards and Some Letdowns Overseas

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
A year ago, many stock market pundits were urging American investors to plumb foreign markets for returns that they said were unlikely to be matched at home.
The sharp run-up in American stock prices during the 1990's was due to peter out, the argument went, and lagging overseas markets were overdue for a strong rally. 
 The logic may have been impeccable, but the timing was wrong.
"In general, it was a pretty good year for people investing in overseas markets, which, with the exception of Japan, posted returns in the mid-teens," said M. David Testa, chairman of Rowe Price-Fleming International, a unit of T. Rowe Price that manages more than $25 billion in foreign equities. "That would look very nice were it not for the fact that the United States did better."
Indeed. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 20.3 percent in 1996. By comparison, investors who put their money into an international fund weighted along the lines of Morgan Stanley's broad Europe, Australia and Far East (EAFE) index would have posted returns of just 3.8 percent.
But the EAFE index, which includes the major global markets and is weighted by market size, tells only one piece of the story.
"When you compare the U.S. market to the international benchmark, the American market wins hands down," said Jeffrey Russell, a managing director at Smith Barney and manager of the firm's $1.3 billion International Equity Portfolio.
"But that benchmark is heavily weighted to Japan, which has been the poorest market of all for a dollar-based investor," Mr. Russell said. "A number of not insignificant markets, like Hong Kong, Ireland, Sweden and the Netherlands, were all up more than 20 percent for a dollar-based investor."
A rise in the value of the dollar against a number of major currencies also cut into returns. But portfolio managers note that a rising currency is not always an unmitigated disaster, especially for funds that hedge their investments.
Further, since a slew of major foreign corporations earn big chunks of their revenues and profits in the United States, a stronger dollar generates bigger numbers when the money is repatriated. That, in turn, tends to increase local equity values, especially in the stocks that are most likely to attract foreign investors.
"It may sound perverse, but you make a little bit more money in a slightly firmer dollar environment," Mr. Russell said.
Strategists argued further that while all major markets, including the United States, benefited from favorable fundamentals like falling interest rates and low inflation, two additional factors were uniquely American: huge inflows of capital and the pressure on corporations from investors that led to the corporate mergers and reorganizations that played a leading role in the big earnings of recent years.
Similar pressures began to reach a number of European markets last year, with positive results.
In Germany, for example, companies like Daimler-Benz and BASF saw their stock prices move sharply higher as they set out to cut costs. Analysts said the theme of corporate restructuring was a big reason the German DAX index of 30 stocks rose 19.7 percent last year, in dollar terms. "German companies who are enhancing shareholder value are being rewarded," said Nicholas Horsley, co-manager of the $6 billion International Equity Fund at Warburg Pincus.
The wave of revamping barely lapped at France last year, but prices on the Paris Bourse nevertheless advanced 16.2 percent.
While corporate reorganization was a dominant theme in European markets, political concerns were paramount in Asia.
That was perhaps most true in Japan, where a lack of political will to address longstanding problems in the country's economy and financial system pushed stock prices down yet again, continuing a precipitous decline that began in 1989.
For the year, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 12.9 percent in dollar terms, even though the Bank of Japan pushed down interest rates to rock bottom levels.
And the value of the yen, which fell against the dollar throughout most of 1996, did not do much to restore a positive attitude among international portfolio managers about Japanese equities.
Despite its steep descent over the last seven years, that market is still far from cheap, many investors say.
"The stock market is off 50 percent, and it is still more expensive than the United States," said Mark G. Holowesko, manager of the Templeton Foreign Fund, which has $9.6 billion under management. "And if the market dropped another 30 percent to 50 percent, it would still not be abnormally cheap."
Hong Kong, even in the face of China's coming takeover, performed well last year.
"Hong Kong has been a good steady up market all year long," Mr. Testa of Rowe Price Fleming said. "People are quite optimistic about how the China takeover will play out."
For the year, the Hang Seng index was up 33.5 percent in dollar terms.
Political instability in countries like South Korea and Thailand hit those markets hard, and both posted significant declines. But in Taiwan, where stock prices took a nose dive early last year in response to saber-rattling by the Chinese, the market rebounded sharply once that crisis evaporated. As measured by the Taiwan weighted index, Taiwanese stocks rose by more than 33.4 percent in dollar terms.
"It has been a great year in Taiwan," Mr. Horsley of Warburg Pincus said. "It is no longer a cheap market."
Markets in Latin America continued to climb out of the deep hole created by the Mexican peso devaluation in late 1994, a crisis that plunged Mexico into a deep recession and cast a pall over the entire region for much of 1995.
Of the major Latin markets, Brazil did the best by far last year, rising about 50 percent in dollar terms. Mexican stock prices also improved, but less than stock prices in Brazil. For the year, Mexican stocks rose 18 percent.
"Mexico has been more volatile, because people are still nervous about the peso," Mr. Testa said. "But the economy seems to have bottomed, stocks appear cheap and money is going in."
The region's most spectacular performer was Venezuela. Stock prices in this small, highly volatile and generally illiquid market skyrocketed by nearly 100 percent, in dollar terms, as fears that the country might go into default receded.
"A large part of the equity revaluation is about the elimination of credit risk, not prospects for earnings growth," Mr. Horsley said.
Looking ahead to 1997, analysts said they were confident that their broad predictions would finally come true and foreign markets would outperform America's.
With the exception of France, which has high unemployment and an apparent unwillingness to cut government spending, the analysts are almost uniformly optimistic about Europe. And while Latin America holds promise, selected Asian markets like South Korea are a far better comparative value, they said.
"The market is fairly valued in Europe right now, assuming the Europeans do nothing," said Albert D. Richards, the head of European equity research at Salomon Brothers in London. "That gives you a free option on the benefits from restructuring, and I kind of like free options. The potential of unlocking value in some of these companies is enormous."

Those Vicious Business Cycles: Tamed but Not Quite Slain

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE stock market was booming. Companies were fighting their way into fast-growing foreign markets. Technology was transforming many industries.
A blue-chip panel of business leaders, economists and government officials hailed "the dynamic equilibrium of recent years," and the "organic balance of economic forces." Their report on the nation's economic outlook concluded: "Our situation is fortunate, our momentum remarkable." 
 The time was mid-1929.
Economists have never displayed much skill in predicting recessions. But one thing is common, historians have found, to most periods just before a downturn -- the emergence of a widespread belief that this time we have found the magic elixir to produce an extended period of prosperity.
So it may be tempting fate now that so many economists, policy makers and business executives, looking out over an economic landscape defined by years of moderate growth and low inflation, are willing to judge the business cycle tempered if not tamed. But for all the risk of incurring the wrath of the economic gods -- and with the important caveat that recessions can never be completely ruled out -- it is clear that the economy has undergone such sweeping changes that it is arguably better equipped to maintain its long-run equilibrium.
"I have felt for a long time that the business cycle was diminishing in its severity, but it has not by any means been vanquished," Geoffrey H. Moore, the director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York, said.
"The length of expansions has tended to increase, and we're certainly having another exhibition of that in this case," he said. "The severity of the contractions or recessions that happen during the next phase of the cycle has been diminishing."
The National Association of Business Economists recently surveyed its members, and found few who saw anything but sustainable growth and low inflation ahead.
"While all business cycles eventually end, almost all of the 44 economists who responded to the survey expect economic expansion to continue for the foreseeable future," the association said. "That conclusion may not be precisely what Ludwig van Beethoven had in mind in his cantata 'Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage,' but the approximation appears to be close."
In March, the current expansion will be six years old. It is the third-longest recovery on record, and if a recession does not strike in the next three years, it will become the longest peacetime expansion, overtaking the 92-month recovery in the 1980's.
Just after the turn of the century, if growth continued apace, the expansion would break the 106-month record set in the 1960's when the Vietnam War gave the economy a boost. And if that is still a bit far off to contemplate seriously, there is still little to suggest that the economy will deviate any time soon from its path of moderate growth and low inflation.
The Federal Reserve seems to have hit on just the right monetary policy formula, with unemployment low but wage and price increases showing no acceleration. Congress and the Clinton Administration are pledging fiscal responsibility.
By continuing to invest in new equipment and squeezing more efficiencies from their work forces, companies have managed to maintain profit growth. Despite a veiled warning about the dangers of a speculative bubble from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, the stock market has so far held on to nearly all of its huge gains the last few years. And there is an increasing consensus that faulty statistics have led us to overstate inflation and understate improvements in growth, productivity and other indicators of economic well-being.
Still, to the extent that bumps along the economic road have been smoothed over, stability has come at a substantial cost. Improvements in productivity in recent years have come in part from wide-scale layoffs, creating a new level of anxiety in the work force. And among business and political leaders, there are those who argue that stability has been bought at the price of forgone growth and opportunity.
"We're taking a low-risk approach to policy," said Tracy O'Rourke, chairman of Varian Associates, a health care and semiconductor equipment company in Palo Alto, Calif. "I can increase my production significantly faster than I can sell units."
Moreover, a more moderate business cycle does not necessarily foster progress in dealing with other deep-rooted problems, like income inequality. Most emphatically, it does not mean that individual companies or entire industries will escape upheaval.
Indeed, some of the same forces that are dampening the economy's ups and downs, most notably the globalization of competition, are speeding the life cycles of products and technology in other industries. That puts more pressure on companies and their employees and creates an environment in which political pressure to "do something," such as erecting trade barriers or providing a special tax break, erupts regularly.
Still, to the degree that it averted painful downturns and created an environment in which businesses could make plans with some degree of certainty about future conditions, a long-term moderation of the business cycle would be one of the great economic achievements of this half century.
Of course, the economy's true resilience will be determined only as it is tested by imbalances of one kind or another. But a recent study by the National Association of Manufacturers, a leading proponent of the idea that the economy can grow faster, sought to calculate what would happen if any one of several big problems afflicted the economy in coming years. In no case did the group's study show the economy going into recession, or anywhere near it.
If consumer spending fell by $40 billion over six months, or less than 2 percent, the growth rate of the overall economy this year would be trimmed to 2 percent from the association's current projection of 2.4 percent, the group said. If Congress and the Clinton Administration fail to agree this year on a plan to balance the budget and long-term interest rates rise by half a percentage point as a result, the economy would grow about half a point more slowly than expected.
Similarly, the group found that a half-point increase in inflation would knock less than half a point off the growth rate.
Even a rise in oil prices, which have been highly volatile in the last year, would barely budge the economy. The manufacturers association said that a $5-a-barrel increase in oil prices would cut growth by half a point.
Economists generally agree that expansions do not die of old age. They end because of a policy mistake -- allowing inflation to get out of hand or stepping too hard on inflation and extinguishing growth -- or because of an external shock, like a surge in oil prices or a war, that is too powerful for even good policy to contain.
The chances of being thrown off track by an external shock are by definition unknowable, and in that sense, a downturn is always a possibility. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve has brought the nation closer to price stability than would have been imaginable 20 years ago. And the Federal Government, after a spasm of fiscal irresponsibility 15 years ago, is no longer debating whether austerity is necessary and achievable, but how much the nation should sacrifice to achieve it. As a result, the likelihood of a whopping policy blunder seems relatively low.
Moreover, many economists said, policy stability is only the beginning.
"Are we guaranteed that forever and in all ways the Fed will continue to get it right in the future?" asked Mark Dadd, the president of the National Association of Business Economists and the chief economist at the AT&T Corporation. "Certainly not. But there is reason to believe that there are other things going on that could reduce the severity of any downturn."
On the most sweeping level, inflation is arguably less of a threat than it has been in decades. The reasons go beyond just tight monetary and fiscal policy. Some economists -- and many business executives -- contend that ever-increasing global competition and the changing nature of the relationship between employer and worker has constrained if not broken the old pattern of wage-price spirals.
Executives in many industries report being caught in a pricing stasis. They cannot raise prices for their products, so they refuse to pay higher prices for raw materials and supplies.
"We've been resisting any price increases from our suppliers because it's very difficult for us to pass those along to our customers," said Ronald D. Bullock, the chief executive of the Bison Gear and Engineering Company, a maker of electric gear motors in St. Charles, Ill.
At the same time, the declining power of unions, the willingness of workers to accept pay raises at or below the inflation rate, slower growth in health insurance costs, layoffs and the fear of them and new wrinkles in employment, such as using contract workers, have conspired to keep compensation costs down.
On a more mundane but no less important level, companies have achieved better control of a nuts-and-bolts business issue -- managing inventories -- that has always played a critical role in the economy's stability, or lack thereof.
In the past, the economy often tipped into recession when companies had built up inventories of products or supplies when demand had slowed, forcing them to cut back production or new orders, thereby reinforcing the slowing or the contraction of the economy.
But now, all along the supply chain, companies are ordering only as much as they can use or sell immediately. In the personal computer industry, for example, companies like Dell and Compaq manufacture a machine only when they have an order in hand, and they buy components accordingly. Taking advantage of technology to give them up-to-date information about stock levels and consumer demand, retailers are keeping minimal inventory on hand, and are demanding quick turnaround times from suppliers when they do make an order.
"Our customers are not placing orders with us except on an immediate-ship basis," said Warren Batts, chairman of Premark International, which makes small appliances. "They're not overstocking at all, not taking any chances of overstocking. This is new."
For all the positive structural changes, however, economists warned that the economy's apparent equilibrium should not be taken for granted.
"There is nothing structural that eliminates the possibility of business accumulating inventories too rapidly, then having to disgorge them," Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities, said.
More broadly, he said, there is no assurance that wage increases and commodity prices will remain level and that financial markets will continue their upward march.
"The picture right now looks very good," Mr. Rippe said, "but the notion that it couldn't turn for the worse is too optimistic a view."

GRAPHIC: Chronology: "An Easier Economic Climb"
 Historically, economic growth, as measured by changes in the gross domestic product, generally moved from one extreme to another. But recently, the peaks and valleys in the business cycle have diminished. A number of experts, while warning that recessions will still occur, argue that broad economic changes should help ease the ups and downs of the path ahead.

HEADLINE: There's Little Hope in Sight For Treasures of St. Louis

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
The Ambassador Theater. The Arcade/Wright Building. The Statler Hotel. The Fur Exchange.
St. Louis's rich trove of mid-19th-century office buildings is crumbling, the victim of a downtown economy that has seen better days. Intricate brickwork is falling apart, copper cornices are deteriorating, and fine terra cotta details are eroding from many facades. Some of the most neglected buildings have been demolished. 
 But preservationists here say many remaining buildings, some of which have city or national landmark status, could be saved if city officials helped developers interested in transforming them into apartments and stores.
"The architecture represents St. Louis, its history and its heritage," said Doris Danna, president of the Landmarks Association of St. Louis. "If we care about our history and our roots, we have to have the physical manifestation. Otherwise, we look like any other place on earth."
Mrs. Danna and others argue for preservation out of more than just a respect for the past. They say restoring old buildings in the city's downtown would draw people to work, shop and even live there. In short, they say, renovation will help eliminate the reason for the buildings' deterioration.
But while other cities, including Denver, Baltimore and Cleveland, have restored older buildings as part of downtown revitalization projects, officials here say St. Louis is choked with too many unusable old structures. They contend that revitalization here depends on quickly getting rid of buildings that do not have an immediate use and developing the new structures that will make the downtown thrive.
"To have real progress, some of this stuff has to come down," Mayor Freeman R. Bosley said in an interview. "We do not have the people for all this infrastructure."
Mayor Bosley said the city's revitalization plans did not include preserving all of its older buildings, no matter how beautiful or historically important, because the St. Louis of the 1990's was so different from the St. Louis of the 19th century.
Many older buildings date from an era when employment in downtown St. Louis was 300,000, at least three times as much as now, he said.
Indeed, large swatches of downtown are dominated by boarded-up retail stores; a shopping mall that opened in 1985, the St. Louis Centre, still has vacancies. On some streets, it seems as though little more than parking lots are open. There are few pedestrians, except office workers at lunchtime, and the area is nearly empty at night. Less than 1 percent of the city's population of 360,000 lives in the downtown area.
"People don't realize this region went through a terrible time economically from 1970 to 1985," said Richard C. Ward, a local economic consultant. "We were one of the few metropolitan areas that actually lost population from the metropolitan area, not just from the city to the suburbs."
A few architectural treasures have been renovated, including Union Station, now a shopping mall; the Wainwright Building, by the architects Adler and Sullivan, which is now a state office building, and the domed courthouse where Dred Scott sued for his freedom from slavery in 1847, a suit that he lost 10 years later. The city also has a glistening, newly restored riverfront section, Laclede's Landing.
But most of these projects date from the 1970's and early 80's, when there was abundant Federal support, through tax credits and urban development money, for renovation. That money dried up in the mid-1980's.
Richard Baron, a St. Louis developer who is president of McCormack, Baron & Associates, said that in recent years local business leaders had generously supported big-ticket items like new athletic stadiums, a convention center and museums.
But business executives neglected the city's infrastructure, Mr. Baron said, neither making commitments to put offices in historic buildings nor investing in downtown housing.
"The kind of things that have happened in places like Cleveland just haven't happened here," he said. "Executives have basically said, 'Give me a glass box and I'll be happy.' "
In the preservationists' view, glass boxes do not help rejuvenate an area.
"Look at Union Station," Mrs. Danna said. "People come to visit those kinds of things in cities. They don't come to see generic office buildings they can see anywhere."
Richard C. D. Fleming, president and chief executive officer of the St. Louis Regional Commerce and Growth Association, who was formerly involved with revitalization efforts in Denver and Baltimore, said St. Louis had all the ingredients for the same kind of invigorated downtowns as those cities.
What St. Louis has lacked, Mr. Fleming said, is a partnership between government and business.
"We need a common game plan," he added. "In Denver, we would have killed for the architectural character we have to work with in St. Louis. But you can't turn around 50 to 75 years of disinvestment overnight."
Mr. Ward faults both the preservationists and the business community.
"We've been stalemated," he said. "Historic preservationists have been unwilling to participate in a compromise strategy. The business interests haven't had the stomach to take it on, because they get painted as scoundrels if they raise the issue, so nothing happens."
Preservationists tried to strike a compromise with city and business interests in a two-year planning initiative that ended in 1994, said Carolyn H. Toft, executive director of the Landmarks Association of St. Louis.
But Ms. Toft said city officials had ignored that plan, which called for a mix of old and new architecture.
Mayor Bosley said that without more businesses moving downtown, renovation projects were useless. Noting that two office buildings renovated in the late 1980's are now sitting vacant, with no takers for their office space, he said that it made no sense to invest limited city money in such projects.
And as much as a revitalized downtown is desirable, the Mayor added, the city's prosperity depends at least as much on other initiatives: the expansion of Lambert International Airport, a search to attract 100,000 jobs to the region by the end of the year 2000, and a $127 million public-private partnership to build homes on the site of a former high-rise public housing development.
"There is a lot to be said about the historic buildings," Mr. Bosley said. "Let us identify those that need to be saved. And let us agree to make room for other buildings and get on with it."

Year of Intense Activity Looms for Phone Industry, Experts Say

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
After a year of historic legislation, heated litigation and no fewer than four multibillion-dollar mergers, even the most confident are reluctant to venture an opinion about what changes 1997 will bring to the roiling telecommunications industry.
"It's hard to predict 100-year floods," said Pierce J. Roberts Jr., an investment banker at Bear, Stearns & Company who has advised the Nynex Corporation on its planned $22 billion merger with the Bell Atlantic Corporation, last April. 
 With deregulation now the law of the land, most experts believe that the telephone business can only become more competitive this year. The tougher economic realities that competition will bring also suggest that more phone companies will pursue mergers or takeovers.
But the onset of competition will be a messy, hard-fought process -- with the long-distance and local carriers haggling over every nuance of the rules of engagement. And those detours into court could further delay the free-market free-for-all that the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was meant to uncork.
"Our early experience is that it takes a long time to get even a modest, controlled rollout of competition," John D. Zeglis, general counsel of the AT&T Corporation, said. Already, the GTE Corporation and other local phone companies have persuaded a Federal appeals court to suspend new Government regulations on how the local phone companies must open up their local networks to AT&T and other rivals. GTE contends that the Federal Communications Commission has no jurisdiction to set these so-called interconnection rules.
The next phase of rule-making -- in which the F.C.C. will revamp the web of subsidies that guarantee universal telephone service -- could ignite fresh legal challenges.
"This could be as contentious, or even more contentious, than the interconnection rules, since universal service is about real money," said Scott Cleland, managing director of the Schwab Washington Research Group, a consulting firm.
Among other things, the Clinton Administration is pushing for the phone companies to pledge to wire the nation's schools and hospitals for high-speed access to the Internet -- an ambitious program that could add $2.25 billion to the cost of providing universal phone service.
The trouble is that under the new rules the 50 states will be responsible for collecting the subsidies that guarantee universal service. So if the F.C.C. were to make such a provision part of the new universal service regulations, Mr. Cleland predicted that at least one state government would immediately challenge the rules in court.
New kinds of competition will not necessarily wait for all these court cases to be settled. AT&T is already offering local phone service to a small number of customers in Sacramento, Calif., Mr. Zeglis said. And the Ameritech Corporation, which offers local service in five Midwestern states, plans to file for permission to offer long distance next week.
"We can start competing in spite of the court case," said Richard C. Notebaert, chairman of Ameritech, which has signed interconnection agreements with about a dozen would-be competitors, including the MFS Communications Company and Time Warner Inc.
As the long-distance and local carriers invade each other's markets, they will probably continue to seek partners -- extending a wave of consolidation that began last year with the back-to-back mergers of Bell Atlantic with Nynex and SBC Communications Inc. with Pacific Telesis Group.
"You'll see more mergers because you've still got several companies hanging out there," said Alex J. Mandl, the former president of AT&T, who stunned the industry last August when he left to take over an obscure wireless company, Associated Communications.
Some of the most obvious pairings, like the two Bell deals, were done in 1996. Even the takeover of the MCI Communications Corporation by British Telecommunications P.L.C. was not completely unexpected, since British Telecommunications has owned 20 percent of MCI since 1994.
Still, investment bankers sketched out several other deals that would put together long-distance and local carriers. GTE, which explored an alliance with MCI before the British Telecommunications merger was announced, is still eager to join forces with another major carrier, according to people familiar with the company. AT&T looms as the most obvious candidate, since its long-distance network would mesh well with GTE's sprawling local presence.
Companies that provide alternative local phone service could also prove alluring to long-distance carriers seeking to expand into the $90 billion local phone business. The largest of these companies, Teleport Communications Group, has been rumored to be a takeover target for months.
And while the British Telecommunications-MCI combination may raise thorny regulatory issues, analysts predict it will not be the last cross-border alliance. They suggest that Sprint could eventually be acquired by its European partners, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, each of which currently owns 10 percent of Sprint.
What does all this activity portend for consumers? Experts said the rise of competition -- and even the spate of deals -- could reduce certain phone rates. Indeed, there are signs that the creation of a trans-Atlantic telephone company in British Telecommunications-MCI could erode the system of artificially inflated calling rates between the United States and Europe.
Yet in the domestic local phone business, where the most revolutionary changes were supposed to occur, the outlook for consumers is murky. The regional Bell companies are zealously defending their local franchises. And long-distance carriers like AT&T and MCI are focusing on business customers ahead of the less profitable residential market.
"The real disappointment of the telecom act is that there is going to be very little residential competition," Mr. Cleland said.
That may be overly pessimistic. But given the raft of lawsuits that seems likely to tie up the process in the courts through this year, it is possible that this new era of telecommunications will be known for now less for its cheaper monthly bills than for its expensive wheeling and dealing.


GRAPHIC: The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 spurred a flurry of mergers in the radio, television and telecommunications industries. In 1996 deals worth $140.7 billion were announced, compared with $78.6 billion in 1995.

Sellers in Search of Buyers in a Global Marketplace

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Just try to find a news release or an earnings report from a major United States consumer-products company that does not cite international growth as the panacea for future profits.
 
 There are compelling reasons for companies to seek happiness "offshore," as American chief executives like to say, mainly that revenues and profits are modest at home and in much of the industrialized world, while spending on consumer goods is rising significantly in many other parts of the globe.
 In the United States, intense competition in many product categories and a rise in private-label and store brands are taking their toll on profits.
 And in a time of low inflation and consumer fickleness, American companies can no longer raise profits by routinely raising prices. After years of restructuring to raise the bottom line, some companies are in danger of "cutting into muscle instead of flab, if they're not careful," said Terry Bivens, an analyst at Donald & Company Securities.
 To help fuel their profit engines, United States companies are aiming for double-digit growth in developing markets. But these days, going global is really the "duh" strategy: everybody is there already. And trying to Americanize the world is not such an easy layup.
 For starters, foreign competitors are becoming leaner and meaner as they imitate American companies' compulsion to downsize, said Nomi Ghez, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs.
 "The trend that started in the United States is now expanding into European companies," Ms. Ghez said. "They are becoming more shareholder oriented as they learn the new language of shareholder value."
 Moving into foreign markets can prove difficult for newcomers from the United States. For example, distribution can offer daunting logistical challenges in places where mom-and-pop stores, not Wal-Marts, are the norm. The optimum delivery vehicle may have two wheels rather than 18, as in China.
 Then there are the cultural differences. The Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation had to conduct expensive market testing before introducing its Pink Panther cartoon mascot in Europe. The worry was that Hollywood's bumbling French detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau, protagonist of the "Pink Panther" movies, might be perceived as insulting to Europeans. They did not take offense.
 And local taste preferences dictated to Pepsico Inc. that it remove the cheese from its Cheetos in China: the snack-food equivalent of removing, says, the cola from Pepsi-Cola. And so, the Chinese were given a choice between cheeseless Cheetos with a teriyaki taste and Cheetos with a butter popcorn flavor.
 Finally, as always in foreign ventures, a company could use a little luck. Upon arriving in China, Pepsico's Cheetos team happily discovered that the Chinese characters "qi duo" (pronounced CHEE dwaugh) meant "new surprise" instead of - well, some phrase "that might offend people," a Pepsico spokesman said.

HEADLINE: New '97 Laws On Drinking, And Driving And Divorce

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Florida lawmakers who take gifts in the form of food and drinks from lobbyists in 1997 had better report them. In Michigan, should parents divorce and neglect child support payments, their driver's licenses may be revoked.
Across the country, thousands of ideas that made their way from committee to governor's desk became law yesterday. 
 Chemical castration, race track card games and mandatory bicycle helmets are in. Drunken hunting and children's driving high-powered boats are out.
Florida, Indiana and Kansas are among those getting tough on underage drinking and driving. Those states now label any young driver with a blood-alcohol content of 0.02 -- about one drink -- legally drunk and subject to a license suspension.
"This no-nonsense, anti-D.U.I. law will meet its potential as the most powerful preventative measure possible against teen drinking and driving," said State Representative Bob Casey, a Gainesville Republican who sponsored the measure in Florida.
New mothers, who had been hustled out the hospital doors at the behest of insurance companies, now have the option of longer hospital stays in New York and New Hampshire. New York guarantees a two-day maternity stay for mothers who want it and a four-day stay after Caesarean sections. A similar Federal law takes effect in 1998. New Hampshire's new law lets mother and doctor decide when to go home.
Other notable laws included these:
*North Carolina, by way of a constitutional amendment, became the last state to give veto power to its governor.
*Florida now requires children under 16 to wear helmets while bicycling and to allow race tracks and jai alai frontons to set up low-stakes card rooms. The state also added food and drink to the list of gifts that lawmakers must report.
*Michigan and Wisconsin may strip fathers of their driver's or occupational licenses if the men are 90 days late in paying child support.
*Arizona eased its ban on fireworks to allow the sale of sparklers, poppers and other non-explosive devices. Also, the state now requires divorcing parents to take a course on the impact of divorce on children.
*New Hampshire will now subject anyone convicted of boating while intoxicated to the same penalties imposed for driving drunk, including license revocation. It also mandated up to seven years in prison for hunters who hurt someone while drunk.
*Minnesota will bar children under 12 from operating motorboats of more than 75 horsepower. They can still drive less powerful boats, as long as an adult is near the controls.
In California, Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law 1,171 bills that, among other things, require some child molesters to undergo chemical castration with injections of the drug Depo-Provera, which dampens sexual desire.
California also increased prison terms for vehicular manslaughter from 4-to-10 years to 15 years to life under "Courtney's Law," named for a Roseville teen-ager who was killed by a drunken driver who had four previous convictions.
On the Federal level, too, the turn of the new year activated a variety of laws, from the arcane to the widely felt. They included these:
*A tax credit of up to $5,000 for most adoptions, $6,000 for adoption of a hard-to-place child, available to families with incomes below $115,000.
*Higher fees at many national parks, as part of a plan to raise fees at 100 parks in stages.
*A 2.9 percent cost-of-living increase in Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits.
*A 3 percent raise for the military.
*The lapsing of a 10 percent Federal tax on commercial airline tickets. Airlines are planning to pocket the savings, however, rather than pass them on to travelers.
*Allowing people ages 65 to 69 to earn $13,500 a year without losing any Social Security benefits, up from $12,500.
*Allowing small-business owners to deduct 40 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums, up from 30 percent.
*Allowing penalty-free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts to cover health insurance premiums, available to the unemployed. Penalty-free withdrawals to cover medical expenses for certain workers with high health bills.
The tax breaks are for 1997 and will be claimed in the next tax season, but many people who adopt, for example, can have the amount of tax money deducted from their paychecks lowered sooner in anticipation of the credit.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 4, 1997, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article by The Associated Press on Thursday about new state laws that took effect on Jan. 1 referred incorrectly to legislation in Arizona that would have eased the state's ban on fireworks to allow the sale of sparklers, poppers and other nonexplosive devices. Although such a change was approved by the Arizona Legislature, it was vetoed in April by Gov. Fife Symington.

HEADLINE: Think Again Before Slicing Social Security Pie

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Trying to Slice the National Pie and Mend Social Security, Too" (Business Day, Dec. 27), you cite the idea that individual Social Security accounts would make the goal of increasing national savings "far more palatable."
What you really mean is that individual Social Security accounts would make it easier to raise taxes. There is no economic connection, however, between individual Social Security accounts and raising taxes to increase national savings. 
 National savings can be increased by raising the payroll tax and maintaining a larger Social Security Trust Fund, as you advocated in a Dec. 10 editorial. Since a single large trust fund has lower administrative costs than millions of individual accounts, the trust fund would earn about 1 percent more per year than individual accounts would.
Your Business Day article also cites the argument that individual accounts may exacerbate tensions over redistribution and further increase our growing income inequality. You do not mention that some proposals for individual accounts would make it far more expensive for individuals to buy annuities.
This would lead to more poverty for those who live a long time after retirement. The poverty rate for this group, primarily widows, is already very high.

HEADLINE: Dividends Rise, but Not as Fast as Stocks

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
American companies raised dividends at a rapid rate last year, but the increases did not come quickly enough to keep up with share prices.
Data released by Standard & Poor's yesterday showed that 2,171 American companies increased their dividend payouts in 1996, up 13.8 percent from the prior year and the most for any year since 1980. 
 At the same time, the dividend payout on the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 8 percent. That was the largest increase in the dividend payout since 1990, when it rose 11.5 percent, but the increase did not even come close to the 20.3 percent price rise shown by the S.& P. 500 during 1996.
As a result, the dividend yield on the index -- once watched by many as a barometer of market valuation -- fell to a record low of 1.97 percent in November, though it has since risen a bit, as some companies raised payouts and share prices slipped a bit. At the end of 1996, it was 2.02 percent. Before the current bull market, that figure had never gone below 2.5 percent. Historically, when the yield has been low, the value of stocks has often been considered too high.
Dividend changes historically are a lagging indication of corporate profitability and at the same time a sign that corporate boards have confidence in the future. Because dividend reductions are seen as a very bad sign, companies hate to raise payouts to an unsustainable level.
There was a slight, and statistically irrelevant, increase in the number of companies that provided bad news for shareholders by either reducing or eliminating their dividends. There were 130 such announcements last year, up from 128 the year before. But that was still the second-lowest total since S.& P. began collecting the data in 1955, and it was less than one-third the number recorded in 1991, after the most recent recession.
The generally good economy no doubt is one reason why few dividends are being cut these days, but another one is that dividends are simply not being raised as they used to be. In this buoyant stock market, companies have seen relatively little demand for higher payouts from shareholders who, after all, have been seeking and getting capital gains. And many companies argue that they are effectively returning money to shareholders by repurchasing their own shares.
Arnold Kaufman, the editor of The Outlook, the S.& P. newsletter that reports on dividends, said he thought that if price gains were harder to come by this year, investors might push for dividend increases.
There would seem to be plenty of room for such increases. The payout ratio -- the percentage of corporate profits returned to shareholders through dividends -- is likely to be around 40 percent when final earnings figures for the year are recorded, Mr. Kaufman said. That is down from 41 percent in 1995 and not far above the record low of 38 percent, set in 1979.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Eases vs. Mark and Yen But Is Up Some Against Pound

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly lower against the yen and mark yesterday after unexpectedly strong economic data rattled the American stock and bond markets on the first trading day of 1997.
But the dollar was mixed in other foreign-exchange dealings and retraced its Tuesday decline against the British pound, which fell broadly on profit taking after rising to a four-year high. 
 Light trading distorted price movements, with many currency dealers still out for an extended New Year's break. Many financial markets around the world were closed on Wednesday and Japanese markets do not reopen until Monday, which made it hard to discern any hints of change in the dollar's upward movement in 1996. The dollar ended the year with a 12.1 percent gain against the yen and a 7.3 percent gain against the German mark.
Nonetheless, some traders said the losses in United States stock and bond markets were a sign of vulnerability for the dollar.
Although stocks recovered somewhat in the afternoon, bond prices fell sharply. "The bullish psychology for the dollar has definitely taken a major dent," said Stephen Flanagan, senior foreign-exchange trader at Credit Agricole in New York. "People are reassessing where the dollar is and where it's going."
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 115.52 yen, down from 115.93 on Tuesday and at 1.5410 marks, down from 1.5415 marks. The pound fell to $1.6929 from $1.7125.
The dollar initially weakened with stocks and bonds after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported an unforeseen acceleration in manufacturing in December. The report, pointing to stronger growth and a possible need for higher interest rates, scared bond traders and in turn depressed stocks.
The pound's weakness reflected big sell orders aimed at locking in profit from its strength last week, when speculation about a new rise in British interest rates increased demand for sterling. Traders, back from the holidays, used the opportunity to sell pounds they had bought more cheaply. "A good part of the market walked back in after several days and said it really doesn't belong there, so they sold," Mr. Flanagan of Credit Agricole said.

HEADLINE: GRADING THE SCHOOLS: THE BACKGROUND;
Prerequisite for Better Education: Accurate Report Cards on Schools

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

 BODY:
In the often-contentious world of educational politics, almost everyone seems to agree on one thing: American education has done a poor job of assessing the performance of students and schools.
So when New York State's Education Commissioner, Richard P. Mills, unveiled a new report card for all the public schools in the state yesterday, his action reflected the growing recognition nationwide that improving education and schools almost has to begin with finding better ways to determine and convey how schools are performing. 
 One reflection of that is the rush by districts and states across the country to come up with report cards and other measurements of how individual schools and entire districts are doing.
In New Jersey, where school financing is a major issue, the report cards have played into local debates about how best to spend available funds.
According to the Council of Chief State School Officers, as of August 1995, 46 states had at least one annual report on school performance. Of those, 42 published at least one report providing statistics at the district level, and 35 reported statistics at the school level.
"This is a long-term trend that's here to stay," Mr. Mills said. "Parents insist on it, particularly because it's what they expect in every other area of life. If you buy a pair of snow tires, you go to a consumer guide expecting to find all kinds of comparative data. When we look at schools, we've been going by anecdotal evidence alone. That doesn't make sense, and it has to change."
As far back as 1969, the school district in Columbus, Ohio, started issuing report cards on school performance.
In the late 1980's, Illinois became the first state to offer report cards systematically on individual schools.
But three things have turned report cards and other assessments into a major growth field.
The first is the anxiety over student achievement dating to the 1983 report, "Nation at Risk," which painted an alarming -- some now say too alarming -- picture of educational decline as a major economic and social worry for the nation. The Federal report began a movement for school improvement whose main thrust now is a focus on new ways to set achievement standards and to assess how schools and students are performing.
The second is the rise of computer technology and data bases that make it much easier than in years past to compile and distribute information on everything from attendance to test scores to demographics to financing.
The third factor is the growth of the Internet. Mr. Mills said that information was now so easy to spread over the Internet that, if states and school districts did not find a way to provide assessments of school performance, the information would probably be distributed willy-nilly over the Internet anyway.
Still, coming up with the right report card and making it a source for positive change rather than mere hand wringing is no easy task. When report cards began, many in education worried that they would do more to stigmatize poor-performing schools than to improve them.
"The skepticism was based on the idea that report cards could cause someone -- a newspaper writer, a parent or some group -- to make a decision on information that doesn't tell you everything you need to know," said Chris Pipho, a spokesman for the Education Commission of the States in Denver.
To compensate, most states are adjusting and readjusting their reports to add information, expand comparisons and, in general, provide richer, more balanced, more useful assessments.
Mr. Mills, for example, said one of the things he wanted to do in New York was to be sure that performance at individual schools was measured over a three-year period so that the school performance could be determined more clearly. Similarly, New York compares schools with similar socioeconomic backgrounds.
On the other hand, Connecticut this year scaled back the information provided on the 1,003 schools in its Strategic School Profiles begun in 1994 to 4 pages from 11 in the belief that the smaller form was more manageable.
New Jersey schools have been providing annual reports since 1989, but they were standardized in 1995 in a program that provides annual report cards on the state's 2,200 schools.
New Jersey has the nation's highest per-pupil spending. And although the report cards play somewhat into the debate about school financing, Leo F. Klagholz, the New Jersey Commissioner of Education, said they had most often played into the local debates about where to spend available dollars rather than the statewide debates about the general level of education financing.
One major issue that has not been addressed is how to provide information to parents and officials that compares schools in different states. Right now, there are only the periodic state comparisons that show up on standardized tests like the National Assessment of Educational Progress.
The idea of a national test remains politically volatile, caught between forces pulling, on the one hand, for better assessments, and on the other, against efforts to shift any power in education to the national from the local level.
"I think it would be immensely valuable to be able to compare performances across the nation," Mr. Mills said.

HEADLINE: Gen. Winston P. Wilson, 85, National Guard Leader, Dies

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Maj. Gen. Winston Peabody Wilson, the architect of the United States' modern Ready Reserve -- ready to join the regular forces swiftly on overseas missions -- died on Tuesday at Baptist East Hospital in Memphis, where he was taken after a stroke. He was 85 and lived in Forrest City, Ark.
General Wilson, a combat pilot, came to the Pentagon's attention in the 1950's when he took charge of the Air National Guard as a deputy chief of the National Guard Bureau. Within years he whipped what insider critics after World War II debunked as a glorified collection of tax-supported clubs into disciplined tactical and transport squadrons. 
 Under his leadership, the wings of the National Guard proved themselves during the 1961 Berlin crisis, when their units bolstered American airborne might.
After that mobilization, General Wilson steadily built the muscle of the force and became known as Mr. Air National Guard around the Pentagon. In recognition of his performance, he was appointed in 1963 as chief of the National Guard Bureau, the Pentagon liaison office to army and air guard units nationwide. He was the first air officer in that job, was reappointed four years later and retired in 1971.
The bureau he headed was unusual in the military establishment in that it dealt with militias that were legally autonomous and under state command -- barring a national emergency. The Pentagon's sway over such far-flung command structures came with the Federal tax dollars that provided over 90 percent of their upkeep.
Among General Wilson's first concerns were efficiency, economy and preparedness for national contingencies. He began by ordering the guards to upgrade their accustomed weekly drills to monthly weekend training with field exercises.
In the end the reserves, including members of the guards, trained side-by-side with regular troops. The reservists are also regularly used for humanitarian and rescue missions as well as some combat, airlift and air-refueling assignments.
Orders from Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson removed vestiges of racial discrimination in the military, which had officially been integrated under President Harry Truman. General Wilson issued the directives to make the Guard finally follow suit.
He used his friendship and considerable influence with recalcitrant governors, adjutants general and other guard officials in the South and elsewhere where guard units routinely barred blacks. Where persuasion failed, he bluntly told those concerned that they had to accept all standards set by the Pentagon, which held the purse strings.
Winston Wilson was born in Arkadelphia, Ark., but grew up in Little Rock, where his high-school mates shortened his name to Win. A coach's yell for "Win P. Wilson" to take to the field prompted them to corrupt that into Wimpy, which stuck for life.
He began his military career as an airplane mechanic with the Arkansas National Guard in 1929 and received his pilot's license in 1936. In World War II he served in the Far East and on mapping missions in South America and Alaska.
He re-enlisted in the Arkansas Air National Guard immediately after the war and made his mark with innovative training programs for its flying outfits, now amply equipped with P-51 fighters. He was recalled to active duty in the Korean War, from which he emerged as a full colonel.
In the Korean War, the Air Guard units had little say over how they were used by the regular Air Force. The experience gave General Wilson and an old friend, Brigadier Earl T. Ricks, head of the Arkansas National Guard, the conceptual underpinnings for overhauling that state unit the moment it was demobilized.
General Wilson's wife, Margaret, died in 1994 after 52 years of marriage; they had no children. He is survived by a brother, Robert M., and a sister, Jean Wilson Anthony, both of Little Rock.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Slide, Pushing Yield Up to 6.73%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
A stronger-than-expected increase in manufacturing activity sent bond prices down sharply yesterday and confirmed that investors remain nervous about the economy, inflation and the Federal Reserve.
The market was reacting to the report by the National Association of Purchasing Management that its index of manufacturing activity rose to a reading of 54 in December from 52.7 in November. Economists had expected a modest decline in the index and the news pushed the yield on the long bond up to its highest level since Oct. 4. 
 The benchmark 30-year bond fell 19/32 to a price of 9631/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, jumped to 6.73 percent, from 6.64 percent on Tuesday, the last trading session of 1996. For bondholders, the day's loss came to about $12.81 for a bond with a face value of $1,000.
The market's slide was the second in two trading days. On Tuesday, a report of unexpectedly strong home sales helped spur a selloff. In the last two sessions, a bond with a face value of $1,000 has lost nearly $26.
Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said that while the manufacturing index did indeed defy expectations, what disturbed the bond market even more was the prices-paid component, which rose to the highest level since July 1995.
"Coupled with the sharp jump in both consumer confidence and the new-home sales released on Tuesday, market participants are beginning to develop a sense of unease about the potential inflationary consequences," Mr. Fine said.
The market was particularly nervous, Mr. Fine said, "in light of the fact that the December-over-December Consumer Price Index for 1996, when released on Jan. 14, is likely to show a rise of approximately 3.3 percent, a noticeable increase over 1995's 2.6 percent."
The market also reacted to a Labor Department report that showed the number of initial weekly jobless claims last week rose by 22,000, to 366,000. The increase suggested that the labor market could be softening and that economic activity could be slowing. Prices rose on the news as traders decided the Fed was less likely to raise interest rates soon.
But the rally ended when the manufacturing report was released. Light post-holiday volume seemed to exaggerate market movements.
A manufacturing activity index of more than 50 suggests that manufacturing is expanding, prompting concerns about inflation, and raising the chances that the Fed could raise interest rates at the February meeting of its policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.
"The payroll and unemployment rate figures, of course, will be primary determinants of the direction of interest rates during the month of January," Mr. Fine said. "But having just made a significant adjustment, bond-yield movements are likely to be considerably less pronounced going forward."
Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, believes that the economy continues to give off mixed signals. "Remember, the Christmas selling season was not especially strong," he said. "But mixed data provide something for the optimist and something for the pessimist. We expect the bond yields to continue in a roughly 6.25 percent to 6.75 percent trading range during the next few months."
While he does not expect the Fed to raise interest rates next month, Mr. Straszheim said, January wage rate and employment data will be key.
Yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills saw the average discount rate come in at 5.31 percent, up from 5.16 percent last month and the highest discount rate since Oct. 10, when it was 5.34 percent. Analysts said that the results were as expected, with little retail interest.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new one-year bills:

HEADLINE: The Nuclear Power Puzzle;
Who Will Pay for a Generation of Expensive Plants?

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 2

 BODY:
The nation's nuclear power plants are delivering record quantities of electricity and doing it more efficiently and safely than ever before, according to industry statistics. But the never-ending debate about nuclear power's future is once again heating up, this time fanned by fears that many nuclear plants could become financial albatrosses as deregulation gives business and residential consumers choices about where they buy power.
The issue: How will investors, taxpayers and consumers share in paying for the $70 billion or so in debts piled up to build the plants and the billions more that will eventually be needed to retire them? 
 While the issue is far from settled, the new economics of competition is already driving the most basic strategic decisions at many utilities, ranging from the giant Commonwealth Edison Company, which supplies 70 percent of this region's power from 12 nuclear plants, to the Long Island Lighting Company, which never sold a kilowatt of power from its Shoreham nuclear plant but is struggling with the $4.5 billion debt left over from that abandoned project. The high rates that Lilco charges to pay off that debt helped push it into a merger with the Brooklyn Union Gas Company.
Most nuclear utilities want a transition to free markets that could take as long as a decade. In that time, they want to be allowed to recoup their investment in nuclear plants from rate payers, even from those who switch to lower-cost competitors. Those who leave would be dunned in the form of so-called exit fees or surcharges on their new bills.
Some nuclear utilities say they could be bankrupted or, at the least, badly punished on Wall Street if the transition comes too quickly and shareholders are asked to pick up more of the tab, in the form of reduced profits and dividends. The pressures to close marginal plants years before their licenses expire are already intense, as demonstrated by the decision in November of Northeast Utilities in Hartford to shut its troubled Connecticut Yankee plant 14 years ahead of schedule.
The fallout from early closings, nuclear supporters say, often includes layoffs, huge tax losses in some communities, more air pollution from increased reliance on fossil fuels and less overall capacity to meet energy demand.
Consumer groups and some nonnuclear utilities pushing for a much quicker transition say that forcing consumers to continue paying for plants they are not using will give electricity users choices but no real savings.
Taxpayers may well be nicked in the crossfire; utilities are pushing for tax breaks to give them more financial flexibility in cutting rates.
With more than 100 nuclear plants from Maine to California generating nearly a quarter of the nation's electricity, every region has a stake in the outcome. Vermont got almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants in 1995, Connecticut just under 70 percent and New Jersey and South Carolina almost two-thirds.
So far, legislatures and regulators seem disinclined to let electricity consumers off the hook for nuclear investments that look wastefully expensive in hindsight. A handful of states, including California and Pennsylvania, have already adopted a variety of rules that give utilities several years to recoup their investments from consumers. Typically, they have softened the sting with related measures that result in freezes or even reductions in overall rates.
What happens in most of the nation, though, is a question this year in state legislatures and public utility commissions. Those decisions may in turn hinge on whether Congress and Federal agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission weigh in with rules of their own affecting how fast the $220 billion industry is opened to competition.
The spotlight in the debate may soon shift here to northern Illinois, home of Commonwealth Edison, a subsidiary of the Unicom Corporation and the industry's largest and most experienced nuclear power generator. Com Ed charges customers up to 60 percent more than utilities in neighboring states, making it an obvious target for competitors.
Com Ed's nuclear portfolio is efficient enough that the excess energy it produces on weekends is easily sold on the open market. But some of Com Ed's plants are among the worst performers in the industry, others face huge renovation expenses and rates must cover accumulated debts of more than $10 billion. Com Ed says it welcomes competition but deserves time and financial breaks from regulators to prepare for it.
"If we can't figure out a way to make nuclear power a competitive advantage, no one can," Thomas J. Maiman, Com Ed's senior vice president for nuclear operations, said.
Com Ed, which has been a pivotal power in the state's politics for more than a century, has plenty of influence to make its case.
"There isn't a reservoir of good will, but everyone understands that putting them out of business won't do anyone any good," said Al Musur, energy manager at Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories, who warily backs a deregulation proposal by a coalition of users and utilities that includes Com Ed. "I'm more afraid we are going to take the 800-pound gorilla and make it a 2,000-pound one."
In the Com Ed-backed proposal, like many around the nation supported by high-cost utilities, the transition period to open competition stretches into the next century. Some of the arguments for moving cautiously are technical -- new billing systems need to be developed and tested, for example. Moreover, it is still unclear how parts of the system that will remain regulated, like long-distance transmission lines, will be managed.
But the utilities also argue that customers should not be allowed to duck paying for the existing plants and other assets like huge transmission systems built to provide reliable power.
In the traditional regulatory system. those investments were made only after regulators had agreed they were necessary to meet anticipated growth. The utilities were then guaranteed that users would shoulder all design and construction costs the regulators found to be "prudent" over the lifetime of the plant. Customers have been forced to pay for such investments even if it turned out that another type of power plant -- or purchases of power from other utilities -- could have met their needs much more cheaply.
Here, as elsewhere, the debate about nuclear power is part of a larger battle over what are widely called "stranded costs," which include a broad range of utility expenses that might make it hard for them to compete in a free market.
Com Ed, for example, has programs to subsidize electricity for low-income customers that would be "stranded" costs in a competitive market unless regulators ordered all electricity consumers to pay for them.
Another significant family of stranded costs, common in California and the Northeast, is known as "purchase power" agreements. These agreements force utilities like the Consolidated Edison Company of New York to buy energy from independent power generators, even if it is more expensive than power being sold by other utilities or power the utility can generate itself. Many such programs were created to support the development of solar energy and other "alternative" energy programs. Purchase power contracts are threatening to bankrupt the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, an upstate New York utility.
Nationwide, utilities face somewhere between $45 billion and $400 billion in stranded costs as they try to gear up for competition, according to various studies. Investments in big power plants, mostly nuclear, account for 40 percent of the total, taxes and other regulated subsidy programs another 40 percent and uneconomic "purchase power" from independent producers about 20 percent, according to David K. Owens, senior vice president for finance, regulation and power supply policy at the Edison Electric Institute, the industry's Washington-based trade group.
The controversial history of nuclear power, though, makes it the most visible stranded cost. A number of nuclear plants were built before costs soared, enabling those operated by better-managed utilities to provide some of the least expensive power around. But many of the nuclear plants that have come on line the last decade or so, even those that operate efficiently, are likely to become white elephants in the age of competition if investors in Com Ed's parent and other utilities have to pick up too much of the tab.
More than profits for investors are at stake: the N.R.C. has already served notice that it wants to make sure that deregulated nuclear utilities are financially healthy enough to sustain spending on safety. And some environmental groups want to make sure that utilities in the Northeast are not given any incentive to close down nuclear plants and rely more on electricity bought from Midwest coal plants, which cause acid rain and other forms of pollution.
Com Ed's proposed transition program includes a five-year freeze on rate increases that began in 1996, annual rate cuts of 1.5 percent starting in 2000 and a completely open market for residential users by 2005.
By that time, Com Ed estimates, its rates will have been cut 35 percent, after adjusting for inflation. That will put huge pressure on the company to become more efficient to avoid an earnings collapse, Leo Mullin, Com Ed's vice chairman, said.
"It's coming at the same time we have to build up," added Samuel K. Skinner, the company's president and a former chief of staff under President George Bush, citing a number of big development projects.
Shareholders will help bear the load under Com Ed's proposal for accelerated depreciation of the nuclear plants -- an accounting measure that will not affect cash flow but will reduce net profits.
"Our shareholders have already paid dearly," Mr. Skinner said, noting that the dividend had been slashed from $3 to $1.60 four years ago after repeated delays in getting regulatory approval to charge consumers for nuclear plants that began supplying power in 1987 and 1988.
But they have not paid enough, according to critics like Howard A. Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center. The Chicago-based research and advocacy group has battled Com Ed over rate increases for years and expects to campaign to shift more of the transition burden to investors. According to Mr. Learner, "The public and the political leaders of the state have to say, 'Get real,' to Com Ed to force a reasonable deal."

Chart: "The State's Answers"
As states move to allow competition among utilities, some must face dealing with costly nuclear plants, many as yet unpaid for. Here are some proposals being considered or in effect around the country.
 
CALIFIRNIA -- A law allowing deregulation was passed in September. A special charge of about one-third of an average monthly bill will be levied to pay for $29 billion in power plant debt.
 
CONNECTICUT -- Three state reports have urged deregulation. To pay for existing power plants, a charge on monthly bills has been recommended for consumer who switch providers.
 
MASSACHUSETTES -- Most of the state's utilities have agreed to accept competition by 1998. Utilities will add a surcharge of 3 to 3.5 cents per kilowatt hour to pay for $12.5 billion in debt for existing plants.
 
NEW JERSEY -- The utility control board wants competition in the wholesale market. It has not addressed how to pay for power plant debt.
 
NEW YORK -- The Public Service Commission wants to deregulate by 1998. Last October, it asked utilities to submit recommendations.
 
PENNSYLVANIA -- A new law allows deregulation to be phased in by 2001. Utilities can add a surcharge to consumers' bills for existing power plant debt, but the amount will be decided case by case.
 
RHODE ISLAND -- The law passed in June deregulates utilities starting July 1997. Full deregulation will occur by July 1998. To pay for existing plant debt, a surcharge of 2.8 cents per kilowatt hour will be levied the first three years, dropping gradually to 0.5 cents after 12 years and ending in 25 years.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Pace Shows Unexpected Increase

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The nation's manufacturing economy accelerated in December, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported yesterday, surprising financial analysts. Most economists had expected the index of the manufacturing pace to drop slightly last month after its unexpectedly strong November.
In another sign of economic strength yesterday, the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research organization, said help-wanted advertising rose in November. 
 "I think everyone had discounted too much all the good news about the economy," Kevin Flanagan, money market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said. "Growth will come in stronger than expected, though not runaway growth or inflation."
Like many other economists, Mr. Flanagan is predicting that the current economic expansion -- which began in March 1991 and is already the third longest in the country's history -- will continue through 1997.
Yesterday's purchasing managers' index rose to 54 percent last month, from 52.7 percent in November. Economists had been expecting a reading of about 51.5 percent. A reading above 50 often signals an expanding economy and one below 50 can be a sign of a contraction. This sign of a jump in industrial supplies could raise prices in stores. A pickup in manufacturing activity could also lead to higher wages, pushing up prices further.
Some economists took the report as a sign that the Federal Reserve might have to raise interest rates slightly by next spring to keep inflation in check.
"The incoming data does support my view that the economy is, after a summer slowdown, gathering renewed momentum again and will remain fairly strong the first half of 1997," Richard Berner, chief economist of Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh, said. "That renewed steam runs counter to most expectations in the marketplace."
Yet there also were signs of moderation in the economy. The Government reported yesterday that first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly by 22,000 to the highest level since last summer, suggesting a moderating labor market.
The Labor Department said new applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 366,000, up from a revised 344,000 during the week ended Dec. 21, when claims fell by 6,000. The figure was the highest since the week ended July 13, when it was 367,000.
The less volatile four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims rose by 9,000, to 352,500, the highest since 360,500 on July 13.

HEADLINE: Drift to Dictatorship Clouds Armenia's Happiness

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: YEREVAN, Armenia

 BODY:
This should have been a glorious winter for the troubled people of Armenia. For the first time in years peace has taken root. It is no longer necessary for anyone to burn furniture or park benches to keep warm. The longest lines at stores are of shoppers clamoring to buy microwave ovens to use in kitchens that last year had no electricity and little food.
Suddenly there are cafes, restaurants, banks and a currency worth holding for more than an hour. Inflation is plummeting and real incomes, while still low, are slowly on the rise. Boutiques sell French shoes and Italian suits. After years of decline, the birth rate -- a raw indicator of hope and determination -- has started to edge up. 
 But there are no celebrations here this season. Once regarded as an oasis of civility and democracy among former Soviet republics, Armenia has drifted toward dictatorship.
Presidential elections this fall were found to be so deeply flawed that the United States, which provides more foreign aid to Armenia per person than to any country except Israel, declined to offer routine congratulations to the winner, Levon Ter-Petrossian. It has been a year of diminishing press freedom and rising human-rights violations. Most of all, it has been a year in which Mr. Ter-Petrossian, once revered as the man who brought democracy to Armenia, appears to have completed a journey from liberal intellectual to stony autocrat.
Mr. Ter-Petrossian rarely speaks in public. He has no tolerance for opposition. His meetings are few and many of his decisions are made in secret. Despite the large and influential Armenian diaspora in the United States, he has not given an interview to a Western reporter for at least two years because, Gerard J. Libaridian, his senior adviser, said, "They only use a short quote and they take him out of context." (Mr. Ter-Petrossian, a philologist who was jailed by the Soviets as a dissident and speaks 10 languages with relative fluency, initially agreed to be interviewed for this article. He then said through an aide that he was too busy.)
"We had a marvelous dream of freedom a few years ago," said Berj Zeytountsian, a prominent writer who was the independent country's first Culture Minister. "And here we believe in our dreams. But now they are gone and we are left wondering what we have in their place. Peace is nice; we all love it. But peace of mind, that is even better."
Long animated by a sense of justice and idealism that Armenians say set it apart from its neighbors, the country today is fighting simply to keep a grasp on the unique sense of solidarity it once held dear.
Not everyone cares, of course: working people want food on their table and this year, for the first time in recent memory, most Armenians are able to buy it. But politically and emotionally, a country that had been remarkably unified is now split.
Leading opposition members of Parliament usually do not even bother to attend sessions. Opposition politicians and members of the news media were beaten and jailed after the disputed elections that Mr. Ter-Petrossian won by a few percentage points. And the man he so narrowly defeated, the former Prime Minister Vazgen Manoukian, has only recently emerged from hiding.
Armenia may be more open and accessible than Azerbaijan, the oil-producing neighbor that Armenia has been fighting since the Soviet Union started to crumble. But people here do not want to be compared with their neighbors. They want to be compared with the West. And even at the highest levels, there is anger and fear that this has become a country where the Defense Minister could state on national television that he would never have accepted Mr. Manoukian's victory, "even if he won 100 percent of the vote."
Armen V. Sarkisyan, the new Prime Minister, who openly and with regret acknowledges the frailty of his country's democracy, said, "We cannot tolerate people like that."
"We must now move back from the precipice," he continued in an interview. "Somebody has to speak to the opposition rather than blaming them for everything that is wrong with Armenia. Somebody has to say that the press is truly free and then stand by to guarantee it. Somebody has to convince our enormous diaspora that they are welcome and needed here, not just once for a visit but as often as they can come. Somebody has to make it clear that we will not just tolerate dissent, we will welcome it."
They are noble words and by all accounts he means them. But only one man rules Armenia today, and while he insists in speeches and statements that democracy is sacred to him, Mr. Ter-Petrossian does not act as if it is.
The President's turn away from democracy began in 1994, when he banned a major opposition party and imposed restrictions on the press. Even now, with many of those restrictions lifted, there is a combined daily press run of only 31,000 copies for all newspapers in the country, which has a population of 3 million. The fairness of Parliamentary elections last year was questioned sharply by international observers, and a new Constitution gives the President unusually sweeping powers.
"The situation in our country has become better," said Nagor Avedikian, editor of Azg, which means The Nation, an independent daily paper. "The economy is not as desperate as it once was. There is no war. But as that has happened, our President has become more remote and autocratic. The truth is that he is a democrat only in the most Platonic sense."
For more than six years, Armenia has been unofficially at war with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan is much bigger, far richer and backed by its Muslim ally, Turkey. Yet the tenacious Armenians won in a rout. While a fragile peace holds, the political questions have never been settled, and most countries officially oppose Armenia's position.
"Many countries think we are being unreasonable about Karabakh," said Mr. Libaridian, who has taken an energetic lead in trying to negotiate a settlement. "But I would rather have a problem of perception, and even of being isolated than the problem of 1915. We had one genocide in this century. It was enough for us. It will never happen again."
He was referring to the event that still defines the nation: in 1915 vast numbers of Armenians, perhaps more than a million, died at the hands of the Ottoman Turks, through forced resettlement, starvation and massacres. It is the fundamental fact of modern Armenia and it still governs the people's complex political and psychological world views. Many are defensive, combative and convinced that the moment they relax, they will again be annihilated.
Today, Turkey and Azerbaijan have imposed a total import blockade on Armenia. That leaves Iran and Georgia as neighboring trading partners. Iran is an ally but it is not an ideal one. Its economy is not that strong and any relationship with Iran angers Armenia's most powerful patron, the United States.
Not that any of that matters to average people. Many are beginning to have what they care about: food, energy (after the recent reopening of a nuclear power station that sits on a geological fault line) and the sense that maybe their children will not die in a war for their survival.
"I don't really care what the President does," said Armina Nagosian, 28, a saleswoman in the Samsung electronics store in downtown Yerevan. "Look at this place. People are buying things they never even thought they would see in this country."
All around her men and women were choosing among color televisions, microwaves and fancy new vacuum cleaners.
"This store didn't even have electricity until a few months ago," she said. "And that is what people care about. Not who sits in Parliament."
Although the economy has improved in the last two years -- real annual growth was up 7 percent in 1995 and has been growing at almost the same rate this year, the International Monetary Fund says -- trade accounts for the improvement. There is no robust banking system, so nobody earns interest, few people pay taxes and nobody has money to invest in long-term projects like factories and communications systems.
Despite an official monthly average income of about $20 and few natural resources, Armenia has one of the highest literacy rates in the world. It is a society of talkative, independent people.
"When we were part of the Soviet Union, we had no voice or vote," said Vahan Barseghian, 47, a shepherd who lives outside of the capital but often comes to the bustling central market to sell his meat. "The point of independence was really to give us the right to live the way we want. Now we have an Armenian leader who treats us like the Russians did. I don't really know if that is better or worse than before."

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Proposal Would Ban Using Animal Tissue in Feed

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 2

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration today proposed a ban on the use of any tissue from a wide variety of animals in feed to prevent the spread of mad cow disease if it ever occurred in this country.
No case of mad cow disease has been detected in the United States in 10 years of monitoring. But the agency's precautionary step is being proposed because of strong evidence that the disease can be spread through animal feed contaminated with rogue proteins known as prions. 
 Mad cow disease has created havoc with the economy in Britain, where it has affected more than 165,000 cattle since the neurologic ailment was first detected in England in 1986. The source of the bovine disease is thought to be animal feed from processed offal and other parts of slaughtered sheep.
Panic followed the British Government's announcement last year of a tentative link between mad cow disease and an untreatable and incurable human version of an ailment known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which occurs in about one in a million people in the world. British experts have reported 14 confirmed cases of a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and French doctors have reported 1 case.
There has been no proof that mad cow disease can jump species, from cattle to humans, and there has been no evidence of an explosive outbreak of the new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Federal health officials have found no evidence of the variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the United States.
The proposal, to be published in The Federal Register on Friday, would prohibit using protein from any ruminant animal in the manufacture of ruminant feeds. Ruminants are animals that chew their cuds and among them are cattle, sheep, goats, deer and elk. Mink are included in the ban because they can be affected by an ailment similar to mad cow disease.
The public will have 45 days to comment on the proposal, and then the agency expects to put the ban into effect this year, Dr. David A. Kessler, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, said in an interview.
Mad cow disease is also known as B.S.E., for bovine spongiform encephalopathy. It is so named because it produces holes in various areas of the brain, giving it a pitted appearance like Swiss cheese. Similar spongiform diseases affect a variety of animals. The diseases generally takes years to develop silently. But then it progresses from initial symptoms to almost certain death in a relatively short time.
Because such diseases have not been transmitted through reprocessed feed to poultry, swine and pets, such feed would be exempted from the proposed American ban, Dr. Kessler said.
Other exemptions include blood from cattle and ruminant-derived milk and gelatin, he said, because the agency has no information suggesting that milk proteins, gelatin or bovine blood proteins can potentially transmit mad cow-like disease.
The proposed ban, he said, "will make sure that cattle and similar animals will not get fed any products that could cause this disease."
"We are creating a fire wall, a barrier," he said. "If a case occurred in this country, the steps would confine the disease to the individual animal and prevent secondary spread. We know the strategy works because it did bring down the number of cases in England dramatically."
The proposed rules create a flexible system of controls to insure that ruminant feed does not contain prohibited tissues from any animal parts. Agency inspectors will be able to trace all records of shipment of meat and bone meal at the 150 rendering plants in this country, Dr. Kessler said.
The agency estimates the annual costs at $21 million to $48 million, compared with some industry estimates as high as $1 billion a year.
The National Cattlemen's and Beef Association said in a statement that it applauded the proposed ban as "appropriate" and that "we would expect it to have little effect on the cost of producing beef and milk."
Today's action is consistent with a similar but voluntary ban established 10 days after the British Government's announcement last March. That ban was established by American livestock industry and veterinary medical groups and with recommendations issued by the World Health Organization last spring, Dr. Kessler said. The action also follows his agency's analysis of comments from 600 individuals and organizations requested last May when it signaled its intention to act.
Dr. Kessler said the proposed ban also reflected new scientific information that a team headed by Dr. John Collinge, a British expert on Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, reported in the journal Nature in October. Using laboratory methods to "fingerprint" the prions involved in bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease reported by British officials last March, Dr. Collinge found that the new variant of the human disease resembles B.S.E. more than other forms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
The agency also reiterated requirement for drug manufacturers to document that animal tissues used in making drugs did not originate in a country where native cattle have been found to be infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The animals must be inspected by the source country's veterinary authorities, before and after slaughter. And the animals must be suitable as food for human.

Stocks Fall Sharply, Then Regain Most of Loss
Before a late rebound, the stock market almost opened 1997 the same way it ended 1996 -- with a big drop. The Dow Jones industrial average, down more than 88 points at 3:29 P.M., regained nearly all of that by the end of trading. The index ended the day down 5.78 points, at 6,442.49. That followed a 101-point drop on Tuesday.
There was no obvious cause for the turnaround, but traders said it came with strong program buying that helped to push up large stocks across the board. [Page D6.]

Dividends rose rapidly last year, but not enough to keep up with share gains. [D4.]

Bank of New York Stake in Rival
Bank of New York said that it would seek to raise its stake to 9.9 percent in State Street Boston, a rival in the business of processing securities. Analysts speculated whether it was the start of a takeover bid. [D2.]
 
Morgan Stanley Names Fund Chief
Philip N. Duff, Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, has been tapped to be chief executive and president of Van Kampen American Capital, the big mutual fund company that Morgan Stanley acquired last fall, company executives said. [D3.]

Purchasing Management Index Up
Manufacturing picked up strength in December, the National Association of Purchasing Management reported. Its index rose to 54 points from 52.7 in November, surprising economists. [D3.]
 
That report sent bond prices down sharply. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to 6.73 percent from 6.64. [D15.]

De Beers to End Russian Pact
De Beers Consolidated Mines of South Africa, which sells about 75 percent of the world's diamond production, confirmed that it would end a marketing agreement with Russia, the largest diamond producer. [D2.]
 
Malone's Move to Control Liberty
Watchers of John C. Malone, left, say the king of convoluted cable deals is at it again. He wants to obtain control of Liberty Media by gaining access to shares owned by the estate of Bob J. Magness, Liberty's largest shareholder, without putting up cash. To that end, the board at his behest has authorized a stock dividend.

In a new ad campaign for printers, Hewlett-Packard gently pokes fun at its own engineers in an effort to make its technology seem more accessible.

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
ROSINA K. ABRAMSON, a lawyer who has been president and chief executive of the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation and executive director of the City Planning Department, began the new year with a new job yesterday, but it is one to which she has very old ties.
She is the national executive director of Women's American ORT, a fund-raising arm of ORT. ORT, which stands for Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training, provides vocational and technical training in more than 60 countries. 
 "My father was educated by ORT in Kovno, Lithuania, in the 1930's," Ms. Abramson said yesterday. "He learned to be a textile mechanic, and when all the Jews were herded into the ghetto in Kovno, he created a work crew there. The Lithuanians needed to keep textile mills running, so dozens of Jews who would have been sent to concentration camps were kept alive. He and the people who worked for him smuggled food and guns into the ghetto."
As a result, Ms. Abramson, who came to the United States with her family in 1950, said, "I grew up hearing that ORT was what gave my father the ability to stay alive and make a living."
In October, a headhunter called her about the position. "They said it was with an organization I had probably never heard of," she recalled. "It was 'beshert,' " she said, using the Yiddish word meaning "It was meant to be."

To the Editor:
A footnote on the self-help efforts of residents of West Windsor, N.J., who voted for a 2-cent property tax increase to buy threatened open space (news article, Dec. 29):
West Windsor's initiative, while commendable, is not so unusual. Last Election Day saw voters around the country approve more than $4 billion of state and local funds for parks, farmland protection and environmental enhancements to improve water quality, restore the natural functions of lakes and rivers and revitalize urban brownfields. The measures range from New York State's $1.75 billion bond, which targets $150 million for open space protection, to a $500,000 bond for Mashpee, Mass. 
 In a survey for Greensense, a national newsletter on state and local land conservation finance, I identified more than 130 environmental financing measures. More than two-thirds of these were approved, even though they typically called for a small property tax, a sales tax increase or varied other taxes.
Although these communities are, as you report, in the minority, their numbers are growing as people seek ways to revitalize local economies and enhance the quality of neighborhoods and town and city centers. Voters are tax-averse, but they are rebelling against environmental degradation and saying yes to well-written measures that will pay for visible improvements to the places where they live and work.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gets Powerful Help From a Surge in U.S. Stocks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
A rally in the United States stock market lifted the dollar yesterday, as currency traders bet that Asian and European investors would continue to buy American securities and the dollars needed to buy them.
"The gains are being fueled by the surge in the stock market, with some help from what's going on in bonds," said John Duffy, a currency trader at Bayerische Vereinsbank A.G. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average surged 101.60 points, to 6,544.09 yesterday, just shy of a record. On Thursday, it rebounded from a loss of as much as 95 points to close down just 5.78 points.
"The fact that the stock market only closed down 5 points after being down nearly 100 points made people feel a lot better" about the dollar's prospects, said Thomas Benfer, director of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal/Harris Bank.
The dollar rose as high 116.75 Japanese yen, before settling in late trading in New York at 116.43 yen, up from 115.52 yen Thursday and the highest level since March 1993. The dollar traded at 1.5644 German marks, up from 1.5410 marks and the highest since late December 1994.
The dollar also rose to a two-and-a-half-year high against the Swiss franc, settling in New York 1.3576 Swiss francs, up from 1.3454 Swiss francs on Thursday. It rose sharply against the French franc, settling at 5.2845 French francs, up from 5.1920 francs.
The strength in stocks prompted speculation that Japanese investors would step up investment in the American market after they return from a weeklong New Year's break on Monday.
Traders said investors in Japan had little incentive to put their money into yen-denominated assets, with the country's economy still sputtering, interest rates at record lows and the stock market looking shaky.
"There aren't very high expectations for any of the Japanese markets," said Lizbeth Goldberg, a currency trader at Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank.
A rebound in the British pound against the mark also bolstered the dollar, as traders sold marks for dollars and used those dollars to buy pounds, traders said. The pound rose to 2.6417 marks from 2.6161 marks. Against the dollar, the pound slipped to $1.6901 from $1.6929.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Gold Drops to a 3-Year Low; Natural Gas Prices Recover

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The price of gold fell more than 1 percent yesterday, to a three-year low, leading other precious metals prices lower.
On other markets, natural gas prices surged. 
 Traders said gold prices, which have slumped in recent weeks, have been hurt by a strong dollar and by speculation about gold sales by European central banks. "The rise of U.S. bond yields in recent days, which reduces the attractiveness of holding physical assets, and the surge in the dollar, which weakens demand for gold in other currencies, are the latest factors to weigh on precious metals prices this week," said Tim Porter, an analyst with Refco New York.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for February delivery tumbled $4.60 -- its largest one-day drop since March -- to close at $362 an ounce.
"With the U.S. stock market still strong, there's just no investment demand for gold," said Edward Kempf of the industry consultants CPM Group.
In addition, uncertainty about the role of gold in the planned single European currency system, and the potential for more European central bank gold sales in 1997, continued to weigh down gold prices, analysts said.
European central banks hold about 460 million ounces of gold, more than 40 percent of all official holdings worldwide. But they have not decided what to do with their reserves when they surrender their monetary policy powers to the planned European central bank.
The decline in gold dragged other precious metals lower.
The March silver contract fell 4.7 cents, to $4.685 an ounce, while on the New York Mercantile Exchange, April platinum closed down $3.20 at $367.90 an ounce.
Natural gas prices recovered somewhat from a recent selloff, bolstered by forecasts for colder weather in the Eastern United States.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, February natural gas settled at $3.106 for 1,000 cubic feet, a gain of 21.6 cents. The contract, which stood at $3.595 on Dec. 26, was as low as $2.612 as recently as Tuesday.

HEADLINE: The Brash Prince of Wine Country;
Californian Wins Middle Market and Ruffles His Rivals

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL 

DATELINE: SONOMA, Calif.

 BODY:
A rooster tail of dust billowing out behind it, the gold Lexus climbed into the rugged Mayacamas Mountains. "Don't be nervous," said Jess Jackson, pulling deftly through another hairpin turn. "I know this country."
He should; it's the Gauer Ranch, some 75 miles north of San Francisco, one of the last great land holdings in Sonoma County, more than 5,000 acres of mountains, meadows and, yes, vineyards. And Jess Jackson owns it all. 
 "I often read about the Gallos," he said as he drove along, ignoring a 3,000-foot drop just inches from the car. "Everyone talks about how much land they own up here. Well, we own a lot more than they do."
What Mr. Jackson owns is nothing less than the fastest-growing and arguably most successful wine-making business to appear in California in 20 years. From a few acres of grapes in the early 1970's, he now controls more than a dozen wineries -- including his flagship, Kendall-Jackson -- stretching from all the choice growing regions of California to Europe and South America. Though still dwarfed by the E.& J. Gallo Company, the industry giant, Mr. Jackson's empire is now among the top 10 wine businesses in the country, with sales of about $200 million in 1996 from Kendall-Jackson alone, according to Jon Fredrikson, an industry economist. The smaller wineries produced another $30 million, Mr. Jackson said.
In the process, he has managed to change the way fine wine is made and marketed in the United States, leaving many in the business to marvel at his highly lean, efficient and integrated operation, which includes a barrel-making business and a distribution company. At the same time, the pugnacious Mr. Jackson, an experienced lawyer, has become the object of envy as well as admiration, and has generated a bumper crop of speculation and controversy.
Mr. Jackson's story combines the good fortune of a novice who has stumbled onto something new with the calculating eye of a master marketer who has found his magic niche.
An early mistake in the fermentation process of his Vintner's Reserve chardonnay created a surprise hit whose slight sweetness has inspired others to offer similar products. The competition also followed in his footsteps when Mr. Jackson carved out a new middle market for fine wines after carefully analyzing the existing price structure.
He has been largely alone, however, in bringing a lawyer's hardball style to the traditionally genteel wine business. Mr. Jackson took advantage of an industry downturn in the late 80's to snap up unprofitable vineyards and hire away well-regarded wine makers. And he has been involved in several high-profile legal battles, even taking on Gallo.
Now, as his business is poised for still more growth, the 66-year-old Mr. Jackson is clearly a major force to be reckoned with, even though, as he proudly says, he is still not part of "the old boy system."
"Jess came into the business as a real estate lawyer, and he still thinks like a lawyer," said one winery owner who has known Mr. Jackson for 20 years. "That's why wine people can't figure him out; they're not lawyers."
Rodney Strong, the founder of another Sonoma winery, Rodney Strong Vineyards, added, "He's not an insider in the wine business, but he's taught the insiders some valuable lessons about making and selling wine."
The original Jackson vineyard was a weekend hobby. By the late 1970's, Mr. Jackson, then a San Francisco lawyer, was selling grapes to several wineries.
"I never planned to get into the wine business," he said recently, "but there was a grape glut around 1978 and I couldn't sell what I had grown. So I had it made into wine."
His first vintages were called Chateau du Lac. By 1982, the name had been changed to Kendall-Jackson -- Kendall is the surname of Mr. Jackson's first wife -- and a winery was under construction.
While making his 1982 chardonnay, Mr. Jackson ran into a problem. At a crucial point, the fermentation stopped before all the sugar in the grapes was converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.
Efforts to restart the process failed, and the wine was bottled with the unfermented sugar -- just a touch -- still in it. Vintner's Reserve was an instant success, and it has stayed that way. The reason, experts say, is that the new product legitimized the sweet taste of jug wine, attracting an army of drinkers willing to pay a few dollars more for the status of a better label.
From 18,000 cases that year, total Kendall-Jackson shipments rose to an estimated 2.6 million cases in 1996, with Vintner's Reserve accounting for 64 percent. No threat to Gallo, which produced an estimated 55 million cases in 1996, but impressive for a 14-year-old upstart.
"Jess is a genius at calculating price points," one of his competitors said. "In his early days, wineries like Sebastiani were going for the low end; $3, $4 a bottle. Others, like Chateau St. Jean, were developing the $9 category. Jess saw a space between the two and filled it."
Mr. Jackson concurred. "We sold out the '82 vintage in six months and price was certainly part of it. We started just under $5, then we raised it 12 times in 12 years." Vintner's Reserve now retails for around $12.
Besides Kendall-Jackson, now based in Santa Rosa here in Sonoma County, Mr. Jackson's holdings include 11 wineries in California, a winery and vineyards in Italy, a leased winery in Chile and two square miles of vines in Argentina. The wineries other than Kendall-Jackson are grouped under the name Artisans and Estates and produce small batches of higher-priced wines. [Mr. Jackson's operations were not affected by this week's flooding in some parts of California's wine country.]
Still to come are five new wineries in California.
"We are always looking for good properties," Mr. Jackson said.
Tall and rangy, with a shock of silver-white hair tumbling into his eyes, Jess Jackson bears a resemblance to Charlton Heston. Invariably dressed in jeans and boots, his face tanned from long exposure to the California sun, he looks every inch a man of the soil.
In fact, he is a city person, born in Los Angeles and raised in San Francisco. As a boy, wine was a part of his life. "San Francisco had a rich wine culture," he said. "I had an Italian uncle who made wine, and we drank it regularly. During the war, when they needed people in the vineyards, I picked grapes."
Mr. Jackson went to law school at the University of California at Berkeley, paying his way by working on the San Francisco docks and as a Berkeley policeman. While still a student, he did research for the late Pat Brown, then California's Attorney General and later Governor.
As a young lawyer, Mr. Jackson worked for the state, specializing in real estate law, invaluable training for a man who would become the state's busiest vineyard buyer.
Indeed, in California's wine business, which nurtures its laid-back image, Jess Jackson's drive and combativeness stand out.
He garnered considerable attention five years ago, for example, in a legal battle with Jedidiah T. Steele, his longtime wine maker.
At the heart of the dispute was the accusation by Mr. Jackson that Mr. Steele had revealed "trade secrets" about the process for making Vintner's Reserve shortly after leaving to start his own business. When Mr. Jackson stopped making severance payments to him, Mr. Steele sued, and Mr. Jackson countersued.
The fracas further separated Mr. Jackson from the wine establishment. Robert Mondavi and other prominent wine makers testified on Mr. Steele's behalf, saying that there was nothing really secret about the process. A ruling against Mr. Steele, they said, could stifle the cooperation that they maintained had enabled the California wine industry to make great strides in a relatively short time. The court ordered Mr. Jackson to pay Mr. Steele the balance of the severance agreement, but also found that Mr. Jackson's winery was entitled to keep the process to itself.
As his business expanded, Mr. Jackson roiled the industry's seemingly placid surface here by hiring away some of the competition's best people, then roiled it again when he announced that the Federal Government's labeling regulations, accepted by the rest of the industry, needed to be tightened -- a grandstanding move, critics said. (The Government is still reviewing his petition.)
Currently, Mr. Jackson is locked in a legal battle with Gallo over trademark infringement, accusing Gallo of copying a Kendall-Jackson label for its Turning Leaf line.
This is his second courtroom tussle with the Gallos. In 1986, in his previous life as a lawyer, Mr. Jackson represented Joseph Gallo Jr. in his unsuccessful attempt to wrest a share of the company from his older brothers, Ernest and the late Julio.
Kendall-Jackson's dramatic expansion at a time when other wineries were experiencing serious economic problems gave rise to some equally dramatic talk about the company's financial circumstances.
Mr. Jackson brushed off his critics with an impatient wave of the hand. "We are in excellent financial condition," he said, "and it gets better all the time. Why, we are the Bank of America's favorite winery."
In recent months, Mr. Jackson's hiring of a Los Angeles financial public relations firm gave rise to talk that he was about to take the company public.
"We reserve that option," Mr. Jackson said, "but we have absolutely no plans to do it now."
Jean-Michel Vallette, who watches the wine industry as a partner in Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco investment bank, agrees with the upbeat assessment.
"In the early days, Jess clearly needed outside help and was certainly highly leveraged," Mr. Vallette said. "But today he can attract the highest-quality lenders and get the most attractive financing terms. People have always underestimated just how profitable Kendall-Jackson is."
Mr. Jackson releases no precise figures but doesn't argue with an industry estimate that Kendall-Jackson has profits of about $40 million a year just from Vintner's Reserve.
At last count, at least 14 members of Mr. Jackson's family were working in the business. His second wife, Barbara Banke, also a lawyer, is president of one of the wineries.
The Jacksons live in a small frame house that stands in stark contrast to the palaces owned by some of his competitors. The house is just across the road from the winery where he keeps his office. His Lexus is six years old.
"I prefer to put my money in the business," Mr. Jackson said, sounding something like a man on a mission.
"I want to broaden the consumption base" of wine, he said, "and that means educating people. Wine is made out to be foreign, as opposed to beer, which is made to be American. We've got to make it more American. It's not going to blossom in American culture until we take the mystique out of it."

HEADLINE: Barnes & Noble to Move Into Yale Co-op Store

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
The 111-year-old Yale Co-op has been left homeless after the university announced yesterday that Barnes & Noble would take over the Eero Saarinen-designed store that has been the co-op's home for 35 years.
The university announced that it had chosen Barnes & Noble College Bookstores, a sister company of the company that runs the nationwide book superstores, to occupy the co-op's current home at 65-77 Broadway on the edge of the Yale campus in New Haven when its lease expires on June 30. 
 Harry W. Berkowitz, the president of the co-op, said: "Let's say we're terribly disappointed. We have been looking at possible other sites for a number of months. We absolutely intend to continue in operation. I think the thing that's important is that we will be in business when the semester opens in the fall."
For the last few years, Yale and the city of New Haven have been revitalizing and renovating the Broadway area, and some students have joked that the university was hoping to remake the site in the image of trendy, bustling Harvard Square in Cambridge, Mass.
"The lease for the property was going to expire," said Tom Conroy, the deputy director of public affairs for the university. "And the university would have been remiss not to explore whether another business could better serve its students and faculty and New Haven neighbors."
In announcing its decision to replace the Co-op with Barnes & Noble on the Broadway site, the university also said that it was attracted by the company's willingness to keep its store open six nights a week, until 9 P.M., for the first two years of the agreement. The university said the night hours would give it an opportunity to build a base of shoppers and diners in the area in the evening. The new store will include a cafe.
The Co-op is now open until 5:30 P.M. Monday through Saturday and until 5 P.M. on Sunday.
The university also said that Barnes & Noble had committed $1.5 million to renovations and that Yale would realize an increased economic return from the property.
Yale owns 97,000 square feet of retailing space in the Broadway area. Mr. Berkowitz said the Co-op occupied 42,000 square feet in its four-level, flagstone building adjacent to Ezra Stiles College on the Yale campus.
He said the store had annual sales of almost $15 million and added, "We are the largest retailer in the city of New Haven." The Co-op, he said, carries everything from 130,000 books to Calvin Klein accessories, Timberland shoes and Crane stationery.
According to the university, the Broadway site is the seventh to be occupied by the Co-op since it was established by a group of students and professors in 1885 to provide goods and services to Yale students and faculty.
Mr. Berkowitz said the Co-op was the second-oldest university store in the country, behind Harvard's.
The Yale Co-op, essentially a nonprofit organization, has 15,000 members, Mr. Berkowitz said. Membership, at $5 a year or $15 for life, is open to Yale undergraduate and graduate students, Yale faculty and staff and employees of any school in Connecticut.

HEADLINE: Harried Shoppers Turned to Gift Certificates

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
During this past Christmas shopping season, a miracle did occur. Retailers offered something at full price, and customers bought it in droves. It was gift certificates, and they sold in record numbers, retailers and those who follow them said yesterday.
Sales of gift certificates -- those plain pieces of paper that guarantee a recipient will spend at least 10 fewer moments on the return line this month -- were up at least 5 percent in 1996 among dozens of retailers, and the trend was likely to continue, experts said. 
 Last year was particularly strong, they added, because of the five fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, which left many shoppers short on time and frantic for gifts. This was good news for retailers, many of which did not have a stellar season, because gift certificates offer them at least a few days with extra cash on their books to spend as they wish.
In a poll of 1,000 shoppers taken by the National Retail Federation before the holiday season, 34 percent said they intended to give gift certificates for Christmas, the highest number since the trade group began its survey 10 years ago.
Yesterday, retailers from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Barneys New York and the Sharper Image said that sales of gift certificates enjoyed a healthy increase this season, as harried shoppers chose to let loved ones select their own Kathie Lee Gifford sweater, lipstick or odd household gadget.
"Gift certificate sales have been growing every year," said Dan Horne, a professor of marketing at Providence College, who has been studying them for five years. "People are becoming geographically dispersed and they just don't understand the needs and wants of people far away, yet, they are required to give the gifts."
While many retailers are not releasing their Christmas sales figures yet, several said yesterday that sales of their gift certificates rose anywhere from 4 percent to 65 percent this holiday season. Barneys New York executives said their gift certificate sales increased 15 percent this year over last, and the Sharper Image reported a 10 percent gain. At the Kmart Corporation, gift certificate sales for all of 1996 were up in the "mid-single digits," a spokeswoman said. At Guess Inc. sales of certificates increased 21 percent.
Professor Horne said he expected that $8 billion to $10 billion worth of gift certificates changed hands in 1996.
That amount was likely to increase, he said, as people in a time-pressed culture stop thinking of gift certificates as the easy way out of shopping. "Gifts are sacred and money is profane," Professor Horne said. "But a gift certificate moves money into a domain that is more personal."
Also contributing to the increase, is a rise in corporations giving gift certificates as gifts. For example, Quality Food Centers Inc., a grocery store chain based in Bellevue, Wash., said that its gift certificate sales during the 1996 holiday season increased 65 percent over the previous year, principally as a result of corporate clients.
"Companies like to put them in employee gift baskets," Mike Barnhart, the vice president for marketing at Quality Food, said. "It is more or less the convenience factor. A company can call us up, we can turn them around in a day and their gift for their employees is done." Indeed, a survey of 300 malls by the International Council of Shopping Centers found that 60 percent of their gift certificates sales came from corporations.
Gift certificates benefit both consumers and retailers. The giver does not have to worry about things like color and style, and will not have to live through that shameful moment when the size 4 recipient unwraps the size 12 pants and learns how the giver really sees her.
For the recipient, there are equal perks. No return lines. No need to freeze a smile on the face and belt out, "Oh gee, a snowflake sweater!" Better still, gift certificates are money in hand to hit the sales racks with this month.
For retailers, gift certificates represent cash that can be spent freely, perhaps without having to give away a stick of merchandise. About 6 percent of gift certificates sold at major retail outlets are never redeemed, Professor Horne said, while at small retailers, that percentage climbs to as high as 30 or 40. Further, about 25 percent of shoppers buy more than their gift certificate is worth once they get into the store, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers survey.
"Gift certificates are a very good thing for a retailer," Arnold H. Aronson, a former chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, said. "Because they get their share of the profits up front. Certainly, a lot of people forget them. But if they are in your wallet, you always have a top-of-mind reason to go into the store. It is almost like a shopping bag in your wallet that you always see."
This is how the accounting part works: Retailers book a sale of a gift certificate as cash with a liability of the same amount. Once the gift certificate is redeemed, the liability is washed off the books and added to the revenue line. This means that in December, a retailer is walking around with extra cash that it can use, interest free, until the certificate is redeemed. Unredeemed certificates eventually fall off the liability line, and become a nice chunk of miscellaneous change.
"Retailers are getting the float," said Norman Strauss, the national director of the accounting firm of Ernst & Young. "So economically, they benefit."
Some stores made a special effort to turn shoppers toward the certificates this year. Barneys, for example, sold little black cards that resemble credit cards as chic-looking gift certificates. At Wal-Mart, extra tables were set up to sell gift certificates in $5 increments. The company said yesterday that 45 percent of their 1996 gift certificates were purchased in December, many by military personnel over the Internet.
"There was an extra surge at the end because of the shortened shopping time," Cathy Callegari, a spokeswoman for the International Mass Retail Association, said. "Merchandise is gone at the last minute, and people got desperate."

HEADLINE: Serbia Rejects European Call To Honor Vote

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Jan. 3

 BODY:
The Government of President Slobodan Milosevic today rejected calls by an international organization to reinstate opposition victories in Serbia's key cities.
The Government's decision, which was strongly condemned by the United States, indicated that Mr. Milosevic was stiffening his resolve against the tens of thousands of demonstrators who have taken to the streets for six weeks. 
 It also dashed recent speculation that Mr. Milosevic might be willing to allow his opponents to take power in Belgrade and other large cities, and suggested that the crisis here was deepening.
"This will fuel the conflict between Milosevic and the international community," Zoran Djindjic, an opposition leader, said tonight. "We will continue our protests until the unconditional recognition of the Nov. 17 results. Milosevic will eventually have to yield."
Serbia's refusal to relent came in response to a report by a team sent by the 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a group that among other things, monitors elections and human rights abuses. Its members include European nations, Canada, the United States, Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
As the protests gathered strength last month, Serbia invited the group to review the Government's decision invalidating opposition victories in 14 of Serbia's 19 largest cities. The mission, led by former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, issued a report last month concluding that the opposition's claims were justified. A senior Belgrade official initially welcomed the findings and termed them constructive.
But today, that same official, Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic, declined to accept most of the report's findings. He said the opposition coalition, called Zajedno, had prevailed only in the smaller cities of Uzice, Kragujevac and Zrenjanin.
But in Belgrade, the pivotal capital city of Serbia, Mr. Milutinovic said the governing Socialist Party had retained control over most of the seats in the city assembly. He did say the opposition had won 9 of the 16 wards in the race for the less powerful Belgrade local council, which is elected separately.
In Nis, the city were the protests began, Mr. Milutinovic said, it remained uncertain who had won. He called on the Organization for Security and Cooperation to provide more data on six other municipalties that the opposition says it won, and he insisted that no party won a majority in Pirot, Pancevo and Jagodina, the three remaining contested cities.
Meeting today in Vienna, the European organization called for "prompt and complete implementation" of the report, said its chairman, Lars Vissing of Denmark.
In Washington, Administration officials said American efforts to strengthen the group's stance against Mr. Milosevic had been blocked by Russia, which has traditional ly supported the Serbs.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher wrote a letter to Mr. Milosevic warning that his refusal to recognize the opposition's victories would lead to Serbia's further isolation.
Administration officials said Mr. Milosevic appeared willing to recognize opposition victories in some provincial cities, but was unwilling to give up political control over Belgrade, where the local authorities issue newspaper and radio licenses, for instance.
Mr. Burns said Mr. Milutinovic's response "does not go nearly far enough," contained "hollow assurances" of Serbia's commitment to democracy and "fails to address seriously the recommendations" in the European organization's report that could help resolve Serbia's political crisis.
It remains unclear what the organization can do to enforce its recommendations. It suspended Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, from its ranks in 1992 because of what it said was Belgrade's role in fomenting the war in Bosnia.
The State Department has raised the possibility of renewing sanctions against Yugoslavia, lifted after Mr. Milosevic's decision to support the Dayton peace agreement. But most Western diplomats say sanctions will be considered only if Mr. Milosevic uses violence to end the protests.
The protests, which mark the first sustained opposition to the Serbian leader in five years, have broadened in recent weeks, with the opposition now demanding Mr. Milosevic's ouster.
Mr. Milosevic, who presides over an economy that has virtually collapsed, is trying to rejoin European organizations and gain admittance to bodies like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. He is also seeking to get international credits, blocked by the United States and other Western nations. But he has no hope of achieving these goals as long as he refuses to honor the original vote count, Western diplomats said.
The rejection of the organization's recommendations appears to have fueled the resolve of the opposition, now blocked by the police from demonstrating in Belgrade streets and confined to a square in the city center.
"One of the measures we will begin to take now will be a peaceful and legal removal of these police forces from the streets of Belgrade," said Vuk Draskovic, an opposition leader. "This city has become a camp. It is the only city in Europe where people can not walk freely."

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Rises In Sign of Economic Strength

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Construction spending rose unexpectedly in November at the fastest rate since March of last year, the Government said today, in yet another sign the economy was heading into the new year on a firm footing.
Spending increased 1.9 percent in November, to $592 billion at an annual rate, the Commerce Department reported. In October, spending rose a revised 1.5 percent, initially reported as a 1.8 percent gain, reflecting growth in nearly all major categories. Analysts had expected a drop of four-tenths of 1 percent in construction spending. 
 Even though the data suggested that the economy grew at a faster pace in the last three months of the year than the 2.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter, analysts said they did not expect the report would help persuade the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates.
The Commerce Department report showed that outlays for public projects -- from schools to roads -- rose 2.5 percent, to a $150.3 billion pace. Spending on private, nonresidential projects surged 1.6 percent, to $152.3 billion. And residential construction outlays rose 1.2 percent, to $247.6 billion in November, as mortgage rates fell.
Single-family home construction fell three-tenths of 1 percent, while spending on multifamily homes rose 5.6 percent in the month.
Still, individual builders expect to see strong demand for houses throughout the new year.
"I am more optimistic today than I was earlier last year," said Robert J. Strudler, chairman and chief executive of the U.S. Home Corporation of Houston. "Stability of interest rates will provide reasons to be optimistic about '97. Demand numbers may not be stronger than in 1996, but it is still an attractive market."
Other recent indicators show continued strength in housing. Earlier this week, the Commerce Department reported that new-home sales rose unexpectedly in November, by 14.2 percent, as all regions of the country reported increases. The gain in November new-home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 772,000 represented a rebound from a revised 13.3 percent decline in October sales.
The jump in new-home sales also corresponded with a 1.8 percent rise in sales of existing homes in November, the first increase in six months and the result of a steady decline in mortgage rates since early September, industry analysts said.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices End Mixed After Strong Building Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities finished mixed yesterday, as a stronger-than-expected construction report led to concerns of a Fed tightening. However, market talk about the possibility that the Japanese would be heavy buyers of Treasury debt next week kept prices up.
The 30-year bond rose 1/32 , to a price of 971/32 to yield 6.73 percent, unchanged from Thursday, with trading volume down 20 percent from the average for a Friday in the first quarter of last year. 
 In currency trading, the dollar rose against the yen, trading near a 45-month high versus that currency. Its strength helped underpin prices in the bond market.
Traders often note that a strong dollar makes United States-denominated investments like Treasury securities attractive to foreign investors, thereby raising prices and, in turn, lowering yields. Also, after two sharp declines in market prices, yields may have reached levels that were too attractive to pass up.
The unexpected rise in November construction spending that was reported yesterday pared some of the early market gains. Investors feared that a spurt in the building sector could force the Fed to raise short-term interest rates to contain inflation; consequently, they sold holdings. According to the Commerce Department, spending in November increased 1.9 percent, to $592 billion at an annual rate. In October spending rose a revised 1.5 percent; the initial report was a 1.8 percent gain. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had expected a drop of four-tenths of a percent.
Jack Regan, chief derivative strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said the bond market's rally from early losses and subsequent failure to maintain those gains had to be considered disappointing and troublesome going into next week, when the December Producer Price Index and December payroll number are released.
"These two statistics have historically given the market fits," he said. "And the uncertainty of these numbers will most certainly be gnawing at traders and dealers as they try to position themselves accordingly.
"You probably won't see any significant move upward in bond prices next week because traders and dealers price in some insurance against surprising data."
That is especially true after signs of economic strength this week that ranged from consumer confidence at a seven-year high to a 14.2 percent surge in sales of new single-family homes in November, he added.
Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, Mexico is to sell a $1 billion 10-year global bond issue through Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers as joint lead managers. The securities will pay a fixed rate of return to be determined next week. The bonds will be denominated in dollars, with delivery a week after the sale.

HEADLINE: Pataki and Silver: Political Rift Becomes Personal Antipathy

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 2

 BODY:
Deals affecting the life of every New Yorker are struck here in the back rooms of the State Capitol as New York's three main power brokers hash out their differences in delicate, often protracted negotiations.
But when two of those three men bear such hostility toward each other that they do not even like to sit in the same back room, it can become excruciatingly difficult for the state government to accomplish much of anything. 
 Many officials here fear that this is exactly what is happening between Gov. George E. Pataki and his main rival in the Legislature, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, on the eve of the 1997 legislative session -- a session facing issues that would be trying under the best conditions, like rent control, welfare, a projected $3 billion budget shortfall and tougher criminal penalties.
The tensions between them, which spilled into the open in recent days with Mr. Silver leveling a barrage of attacks against Mr. Pataki, have been mounting since the two men clashed during closed-door discussions last month, when the Legislature met for a daylong special session.
With suspicions running high, the nature of negotiating major bills in Albany seems to be changing. More than in the past, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Silver have begun linking fistfuls of bills to each other, refusing to agree to any one until agreement is reached on all. That style of hostage taking was particularly in evidence during the special session when late-morning agreements on half a dozen bills collapsed by late afternoon because of a fight between Mr. Silver and Mr. Pataki over legislative pay, aides to both men say.
The tension has persuaded many legislators, Republicans and Democrats alike, that the 1997 session will be at least as contentious and drawn out as the 1996 session, which produced the latest state budget in the nation's history and saw an array of important pieces of legislation used as bargaining chips by both sides.
In fact, Mr. Silver strongly suggested in a recent interview that he would follow suit if the Governor held issues hostage in next year's budget talks. "Next year, we may live by his rules," he said, referring to Mr. Pataki. "Two can play the same game."
Of course, it is no surprise that Mr. Pataki, a Republican, and Mr. Silver, a Democrat, would tangle on partisan grounds. But the hostilities between them appear to run so deep that many lawmakers say they have engaged in tactics that have gone beyond the bounds of the routine give-and-take of the legislative process.
The bad blood has resulted in more distrust and fewer meetings between the two men, aides to Mr. Silver say. They say the Speaker believes the Governor is genuinely uncomfortable being in the same room with him and therefore leaves critical issues to be negotiated by staff members.
In the process, Mr. Silver has become less guarded in his criticism of Mr. Pataki, saying after the special session that the Governor has not shown leadership and that he speaks out of both sides of his mouth, criticizing New York City to upstate residents, then telling city residents he is their ally.
Beyond the personality clash, the Governor's and the Speaker's attitudes toward Albany-style politics contrast sharply, reflecting their different experiences in Albany. Mr. Silver has been a diligent student of the Legislature's byzantine ways, rising through the ranks of the Assembly to a variety of leadership roles. By contrast, Mr. Pataki has long cast himself as an outsider, even when he was an Assemblyman and a State Senator.
Mr. Pataki says legislative leaders like Mr. Silver simply have too much power. "Even as a legislator," he said, "I was frustrated by the top-down system because I had ideas and principles that would have helped make this a better state."
The rift has even begun to worry the third member of the Albany triumvirate, Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate. "I am concerned," he said. "I hope that it gets behind us and we start anew."
The latest round of hostilities began a few weeks ago, when the Legislature convened for the one-day special session. Mr. Pataki and Mr. Silver ended the day by publicly accusing each other of refusing to act on several important pieces of legislation as a means of extracting concessions from each other.
Mr. Silver was particularly outraged that the Governor refused to consider a pay raise for lawmakers because the Speaker would not acquiesce on other issues, including a plan to build a maximum-security prison, according to Mr. Silver's aides and legislators with knowledge of the negotiations. Mr. Pataki also refused to consider a bill that would extend existing stipends for members who hold leadership positions in the Assembly, a move that the Speaker's aides denounced as a breach of professional courtesy.
All this left Mr. Silver empty-handed when he returned to his members, many of whom have been quietly pressing him to strike a deal for a pay raise. Mr. Silver said he regarded it as extortion for the Governor to link the question of pay raises to complicated pieces of legislation. Pataki aides denied this ever happened.
More important, many Democrats say they believe that the episode was orchestrated by Mr. Pataki to create dissent among Assembly members and thus undermine Mr. Silver as leader.
"I think they have done a number of things to drive a wedge in the Assembly conference," said Deborah J. Glick, a Democratic Assemblywoman from Manhattan. "I think it was a matter of trying to aggravate individual members."
Privately, there are people close to the Governor who acknowledge that they would like to weaken Mr. Silver's control over the 95 Democrats in the Assembly. That, they reason, might strengthen their ability to build coalitions in the Assembly between conservative Democrats and Republicans.
But others in the Pataki administration contend that the Governor would be best served by trying to reach agreement with the Speaker, not antagonizing him. In fact, many Democrats say that the skirmishes with the Governor may end up strengthening Mr. Silver's hand in the next session.
They say they feel compelled to rally behind him, as they did last year, when Republicans ran television ads aimed at pressuring conservative Democratic Assembly members to break ranks with Mr. Silver, a more liberal Democrat from Manhattan.
"I think the Governor's tactics will backfire," said Martin A. Luster, a Democratic Assemblyman from Ithaca. "I think the conference is solidifying under Shelly, and we will remain united on major issues."
For his part, Mr. Pataki has sought to play down the tensions. "I've read the Speaker's characterizations, and from my standpoint, I will continue to do everything I can to work with the Speaker," he said at a news conference on Monday.
But Mr. Silver's aides say he is disturbed by the disdain he believes Mr. Pataki has shown toward the Legislature during his first two years as Governor. They cite Mr. Pataki's threat last year to withhold the pay of lawmakers if they failed to enact a budget by the April 15 deadline.
"George feels no relationship with his former colleagues," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat. "He has complete contempt for the Legislature's values and needs."
Aides to Mr. Pataki, however, say he has done what is necessary to change longstanding legislative practices that he believes have hurt New York's economy, among other things.
"The Governor was not elected to protect the status quo," said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the Governor. "Sometimes, it takes a little convincing to bring people along."

HEADLINE: A Born Revolutionary's Path To a Living 'Tomb' in Peru

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Victor Polay Campos, the jailed founder of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, is the son of leftist political reformers whose roots go back to the labor struggles of the 1930's. Mr. Polay's tale of taking up arms is part of a political struggle that meanders through the history of Peru in this century -- a tale whose chapters would look hauntingly like the family's photo album.
The release of the 45-year-old leader and some 400 others of their imprisoned comrades is the core demand of Tupac Amaru guerrillas who continue to hold 74 hostages inside the Japanese Ambassador's residence, which they seized on Dec. 17. 
 Mr. Polay, his vision faltering, his spirits reported nearly broken, lives in a dark concrete box measuring 6.5 feet along each wall. His mother, Otilia Campos de Polay, who owns a hardware store in the working-class neighborhood of El Callao, calls it his "tomb." He has been held in solitary confinement at a maximum security prison at a naval base not far from her store for three years.
Mrs. Polay said in an interview that Victor Polay founded Tupac Amaru in 1983, a year after he returned from university studies in Madrid and Paris. In Paris, he had been a roommate of Alan Garcia, a future President who hailed from the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance, known as APRA.
That left-wing, anti-imperialist party, which started in the 1930's, counted among its founders Mr. Polay's father, Victor Polay Risco. Mrs. Polay said her husband, who died four years ago, was imprisoned from 1930 to 1945 for his political activities. Her own parents, Alfredo Campos and Maria Barcena, were founders of APRA in Cuzco, she said.
After the election of Mr. Garcia in 1985, the first time APRA had won the presidency, Victor Polay said he would give his former roommate a year to fulfill the promises to the poor of the party. By the late 1980's, Mr. Polay had carried out his threat to turn to violence.
Mr. Garcia, whose boyish charm made him the darling of Peruvians for the first two years of his administration, did fulfill many of his campaign pledges, with measures like paying only 10 percent of the foreign debt, instituting price controls and eventually nationalizing banks. The effects were disastrous -- hyperinflation, rampant unemployment and a shrinking economy -- and guerrillas of Shining Path and Tupac Amaru gained ground during his administration.
Mr. Garcia ended his presidency lonely and discredited.
Mrs. Polay said her son's decision to create a guerrilla movement to back his Marxist ideas frightened her. At 68, she is old enough to have childhood memories of APRA's early years of struggle.
"I always thought it was dangerous," she said in an interview. "Like any mother, I was very worried, because I didn't agree with this exaggerated idealism of my son. I had lived through the 1930's, the whole sad story of the APRA party, which had been persecuted and tortured, and so I knew I didn't want the same path for my son but something better.
"We had already suffered so much for the country, because at every moment, we, Apristas, were being locked up, assassinated."
"We had a mountain of dead," she said. "We had 6,000 dead."
The group her son founded, while considered less indiscriminate in its use of violence than the Maoists of Shining Path, is accused of assassinations and bombings. In 1989 it killed the Defense Minister, Gen. Enrique Lopez Albuhar, and it later kidnapped David Ballon Vera, a mining executive who was found starved to death, his body scarred and showing signs of torture.
Tupac Amaru remains one of the last holdovers of the Battalion America, an umbrella group that included the M-19 guerrilla group in Colombia, which laid down its weapons and became a legal party in 1991.
The Peruvians also had close links with other Latin American guerrilla movements that have left off violent confrontations since the fall of Communism in the Soviet Union, including the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front in El Salvador.
Exposed to the political process, those movements fizzled out or proved minor draws at the ballot box. But here, after the killing of more than 30,000 people by the military and guerrillas, Peruvians insist upon the rule of law as the starting point for any discussions.
According to figures supplied by the Andean Commission of Jurists, a human rights organization, of the roughly 4,500 people killed in guerrilla conflict in Peru in 1991, the most violent year, 3,145 were killed by the military, 1,314 by Shining Path and 139 by Tupac Amaru.
President Alberto K. Fujimori has built his political life on an unyielding, avowedly pitiless stand against guerrillas for the violence they promote.
"Nobody can believe that destroying factories, roads, bridges, threatening investors and tourists, and committing bloody crimes will reduce poverty," Mr. Fujimori said in a speech Thursday at the Palace of Justice.
In his cell, Victor Polay's political education has come to an end. Though he is allowed to read novels, prison officials turn away any writing that is remotely political, his mother said. Most recently, the memoirs of Winston Churchill were rejected.
Perhaps because Mr. Polay and other members of Tupac Amaru tunneled their way out of another jail in the final days of Mr. Garcia's presidency, his cell now is a box of reinforced concrete, with just a six-inch hole in the ground for a toilet and a six-inch hole in the ceiling for light and air. With the siege of the Japanese Ambassador's residence, his visiting privileges -- 30 minutes with two people once a month -- have been suspended.
Mrs. Polay, while not defending the Marxism that Tupac Amaru advances, said socialist ideals were not unworkable simply because Communism had failed throughout Eastern Europe.
She said she had been three times to Europe, where Mr. Polay's wife, Rosa, and their three children live, and had also visited Asia, and nowhere had she found the kind of poverty that is endemic in much of South America.
"How can you compare Russia or Germany, one of the countries that have always been so advanced in terms of workers' rights, countries of great men, of great chemical discoveries, to Latin America," she said. "I don't mean Marxism. Please don't put down that I'm talking about Marxism. I mean socialism adapted to the Peruvian reality."
And she believes there is precedent for change, for APRA had been outlawed four times before being legalized for the last time and winning the presidency in 1985. Others say the comparison is disingenuous.
"It ignores history," said Congresswoman Lourdes Flores Nano of the Popular Christian Party. "APRA has always been a political party in terms of fighting democratically."
"The M.R.T.A. are terrorists," she said, using the Spanish initials of Tupac Amaru.
The Tupac Amaru guerrillas in the Japanese Ambassador's residence have not raised the prospect of a peace agreement, and an above-ground political role for them, since the siege began.
Though the group had seemed to be moving in that direction, it is a subject many Peruvians say cannot be addressed as long as they are holding hostages.

Texaco Settles With U.S. To Avoid Discrimination Suit
Texaco, avoiding a discrimination lawsuit by the Government, agreed to a settlement under which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will directly monitor the company's compliance with employment laws, lawyers involved in the case said. 
 The unusually broad settlement will allow the Federal agency to scrutinize Texaco's hiring and promotion practices for the next five years to insure there is no discrimination against minority employees. Texaco must report annually to the commission on every job opening and promotion, as well as the race of every candidate. [Page 36.]
 
Apple Expects Quarterly Loss
Apple Computer said it expected to report a loss of $100 million to $150 million for its most recent quarter, a much sharper loss than analysts had expected. [37.]
 
Construction Spending Gains 1.9%
Construction spending increased 1.9 percent in November, to $592 billion at an annual rate, the Commerce Department reported. Analysts had expected a drop of four-tenths of 1 percent. The rise was the fastest rate since March of last year. Following Thursday's report of increased manufacturing activity, it suggested that the economy is moving ahead on a firm footing. [36.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed. The stronger-than-expected construction report led to concerns of a Fed tightening. The 30-year bond rose 1/32 , to a price of 971/32 to yield 6.73 percent, unchanged from Thursday. [48.]
 
U.S. Gives In to Trading Partners
Hoping to quell the anger of some of the nation's strongest trading partners -- Canada, Mexico and some European nations -- President Clinton announced that he intended to waive indefinitely the most disputed part of the Helms-Burton law, which punishes foreign companies using American property confiscated in Cuba nearly 40 years ago. [1.]
 
Airbus Partners Reach an Accord
The four partners in Airbus Industrie reached an accord on how to restructure the airplane builder to make it more competitive. Ending months of squabbling were: Daimler-Benz Aerospace, of Germany, Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain. [48.]
 
Railroads Win Rate-Setting Right
The nation's railroads have won a fight with their customers over whether the carriers have the right to set the rates on routes they serve exclusively. The Surface Transportation Board ruled that a railroad that exclusively served a short line to a power plant could not be forced to offer a shipper lower prices, even if the shipper used another railway for the long-haul portion of the same coal shipment. [36.]
 
Fraud Charge Expected in Germany
The Frankfurt prosecutor's office is expected to announce on Monday that it has charged the real estate investor Jurgen Schneider with fraud in a spectacular corporate collapse. [48.]
 
Dollar Lifted by Stocks' Rally
The dollar was lifted by the rally in American stocks, settling at 116.43 yen, the highest level since March 1993, and at 1.5644 German marks, the highest since December 1994. [38.]
 
Gold futures fell more than 1 percent to a three-year low of $362 an ounce on the Comex, pressed by a strong dollar and by speculation about gold sales by European central banks. Other precious metals futures also slid. [38.]
 
Italian Financier Flees the U.S.
Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier, has fled the U.S. Sentencing was scheduled for Monday for perjury and evidence tampering in the case that cost him control of MGM studios. His lawyer said he had received a fax from Mr. Parretti saying he was in Italy. [36.]
 
The Barnes & Noble Bulldogs?
The 111-year-old Yale Co-op was left homeless after Yale announced that Barnes & Noble would take over the Eero Saarinen-designed store on the edge of its campus in New Haven on June 30.

HEADLINE: ONE KEY ELEMENT IN ANTI-CUBA LAW POSTPONED AGAIN

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
Hoping to quell the anger of some of America's strongest trading partners, President Clinton said today that he intended to waive indefinitely part of a law that punishes foreign companies that use American property confiscated in Cuba nearly 40 years ago.
The President said he did not want the furor that the law has set off in Canada, Mexico and Europe to jeopardize what he described as an emerging international effort to isolate Fidel Castro and his Communist Government. 
 "We must sustain our efforts to hasten the arrival of democracy in Cuba," Mr. Clinton said in a statement issued by the White House as he vacationed in the Virgin Islands. "As a result of increasing international pressure, we have never been closer to that day."
The decision today suspends for another six months the provision of the law that would allow United States citizens or corporations to sue any foreign company using confiscated American property in Cuba. Mr. Clinton first suspended that provision in July after America's trading partners threatened to retaliate.
And Mr. Clinton indicated that he would continue to suspend the provision every six months "so long as America's friends and allies continue their stepped-up efforts" to advocate democratic changes in Cuba.
Although none have joined Washington's 34-year economic embargo of Cuba, the President and his aides here pointed to several steps taken by those allies in recent months, including a vote by the European Union last month urging Mr. Castro's Government to improve its record on human rights and political freedom.
With his decision, Mr. Clinton appeared to be trying to strike a balance between the conflicting demands of Republicans in Congress and of trading partners abroad. Judging by today's reactions, he did not succeed.
Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who sponsored the law with Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, condemned the President's action, saying Mr. Clinton had decided "once again to pass up a perfect opportunity to send a strong message to the Castro dictatorship and to those who prop it up financially."
At the same time, officials in Canada, Mexico and Europe remain critical of the Helms-Burton law. The European Union's envoy to the United States, Hugo Paemen of Belgium, welcomed the decision to suspend the law's most onerous provision, but said that did not resolve the underlying problem with the law itself, which Europeans say attempts to impose American foreign policy on other nations.
Canada's International Trade Minister, Arthur Eggleton, accused the United States of "continuing to hold this sword over the heads of other countries."
Mexico was cautiously upbeat. "The Mexican Government recognizes that the decision of President Clinton marks an effort to take into account the opinion of the international community," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement reported by Reuters.
But the ministry added, "The Mexican Government reaffirms the need to resolve any international differences via open and respectful dialogue, not via unilateral and confrontational methods."
For now, the President's decision appears to avert a trade showdown, including the possibility of tit-for-tat legal retaliation from abroad. Canada and Mexico have each passed legislation that would allow anyone punished by the American law to seek damages in their courts.
Nor did the President's decision resolve legal challenges to the law still being pressed in the World Trade Organization and under the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico.
The Helms-Burton Act was passed by Congress last March to discourage foreign investments in Cuba and to promote democratic changes.
In addition to allowing the lawsuits, the law requires the State Department to deny visas to the executives of foreign companies that use offices, factories or other properties once owned by Americans but seized after the Communist revolution that swept Mr. Castro to power in 1959.
Mr. Clinton originally opposed the law, but he signed it after the outrage that erupted when Cuban fighter jets shot down two small planes piloted by Cuban-Americans off Cuba's coast last February. He later suspended the provision allowing the lawsuits after America's allies warned of retaliation and officials within the Administration began to fear a trade war.
In the middle of an election year, the President's maneuvering led to accusations that he was putting off a decision while trying to cultivate support of Cuban-American voters in Florida and New Jersey, states with important electoral votes.
In August the President appointed Stuart E. Eizenstat, the Undersecretary for International Trade at the Commerce Department, as a special envoy to try to find common ground with the allies on other political and economic steps to isolate Cuba.
At a news conference today, Mr. Eizenstat said the controversy over the Helms-Burton Act had focused the attention of European and other nations on democracy in Cuba. He noted that the European Union's resolution last month for the first time linked economic relations with Cuba to improvements in Mr. Castro's policies on human rights.
While such efforts appear to have had little effect on Mr. Castro's grip on power, Mr. Eizenstat and other officials said they have had a punitive impact by isolating Cuba politically and by discouraging foreign investors.
Senator Helms denounced Mr. Clinton's decision as "a terrible mistake." In singling out Mexico and Canada for what he called "shameful Cuba policies," Senator Helms said: "I cannot understand why, just as we are beginning to make progress, the President has decided to give up the very leverage that brought such progress about."
Mr. Clinton said the Administration would continue to enforce other provisions of the Helms-Burton Act, including the one denying visas to executives of foreign companies.
The State Department has already imposed that punishment on a Mexican telecommunications company, Grupo Domos, and a Canadian mining concern, Sherritt International. Mr. Eizenstat said today that 12 other companies were under investigation for violating the law. On Monday, he said, the United States notified BM Group, an Israeli company involved in sugar and citrus production in Cuba, that its executives could face visa restrictions.

HEADLINE: Stamford Reinvents Its Downtown Once Again

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
SOMETHING remarkable is happening these days in downtown Stamford, something that has not been seen in years: An office building is under construction.
A decade ago, of course, there would have been nothing at all remarkable about such an event. Stamford was at the crest of an extraordinary construction boom led by the F. D. Rich Company, which held the development contract for the 130-acre urban-renewal district at Stamford's core. Building after building had transformed this industrial town on the Connecticut coast into a corporate center with few rivals. 
 But then shadows swallowed the gleaming cityscape. Among the numerous milestones of decline: In 1988, the Singer Company, which occupied a tower in Rich's Stamford Forum complex, was reorganized and moved to Florida. In 1990, Bloomingdale's closed its 36-year-old store. In 1992, after protracted flirtation, the Morgan Stanley Group gave up its option to build at the critical "gateway" site across Interstate 95 from the train station.
By that time, one quarter of the office space in Stamford stood empty. And F. D. Rich itself, badly overextended in the boom years, gave back most of its properties to its lenders, one after the other, losing even its signature structure (and headquarters), the swooping Brasilia-like Landmark Tower.
The turnaround was subtle at first, as smaller office tenants -- boutique investment banking concerns, venture capitalists, publishers and software developers, reinsurance companies, shippers -- began taking chunks of the vast space left behind by corporate giants.
More dramatic was the announcement in 1994 by the Swiss Bank Corporation that it would build on the "gateway" site. And today, as its vast trading floor and granite-clad office tower take shape next to I-95, the gloom over downtown Stamford seems to have lifted.
"We hit bottom and had the resources to rebound," said Mayor Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat entering his second year in office. For a mayor, the equation is simple. "I need taxes," Mr. Malloy said, "so I like to see building."
The office vacancy rate is around 12 percent, the lowest rate in 10 years, said Kip Bergstrom, Stamford's director of economic development. And, he added, it's still falling.
"What happened to pull Stamford around was not only the resurgence of New York but frankly a lot of movement out of New York," said Anthony E. Malkin, whose family owns properties in both cities, including Metro Center, the bow-fronted building near Stamford's train station.
Local leaders now envision the city center as a 24-hour-a-day hub, luring more financial giants like Swiss Bank, providing hundreds of new apartments and offering ever livelier choices in dining, shopping and entertainment. They believe Stamford can cultivate a vibrant pedestrian environment, too, having learned from the urbanistic mistake in the last boom of setting new buildings atop parking garages, which created a barren, fortress-like streetscape.
"The community is maturing and seeing itself as a city," Mayor Malloy said. "I'd defy you to find a city of 100,000 that's built 1,000 units of housing in 20 years -- and we've done it in three."
After 37 years of redevelopment, the Rich family takes an even longer view. "What's happening fits in with our plan," said Robert N. Rich, president of the Rich Company. "I always said that the major housing thrust couldn't occur until we changed the character of downtown."
Today, that transformation continues, on the very site that Morgan Stanley abandoned. There, SBC Warburg, the investment-banking division of Swiss Bank, is building a $150 million, 570,000-square-foot North American corporate center that will include what its architects, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, believe will be the largest clear-span trading floor in North America.
On the Swiss Bank campus, an intricately landscaped park called Gateway Commons will be laid out along Washington Boulevard after the demolition next year of an office building at No. 655. The park is intended as a welcoming pedestrian link to the Stewart B. McKinney Transportation Center, which includes the Metro-North Railroad station. The station will be extended toward the commons next year after the construction of a new concourse, also designed by Skidmore, under the elevated highway.
Drivers will find the garage at Swiss Bank tucked as far out of sight as a 1,400-space structure can be: behind a 13-story office tower and under the 60,000-square-foot trading floor, with its distinctive roof, reminiscent of a giant airfoil. In future phases, one or two more office buildings may be added to the 12-acre campus and the trading floor may also grow in size.
JUST up Washington Boulevard, at Broad Street, the vacant Bloomingdale's has been stripped to a structural skeleton that looks for the moment like the hypostyle hall of an Egyptian temple. After a $40 million transformation, to be completed next year, this will be the Stamford branch of the University of Connecticut.
The 225,000-square-foot academic center, designed by Perkins Eastman Architects, is intended to be the heart of a new UConn campus, which may eventually be linked by parkland to the nearby Rippowam River. The reconstructed Bloomie's will have a three-story, glass-walled concourse along its Broad Street facade, off of which will be entrances to the library and conference center, computer labs, dining areas, book store and art gallery.
Four blocks west on Broad Street, construction is nearing completion on a 402-apartment complex, Avalon Grove, which is being developed by Avalon Properties of Wilton, Conn., and designed by Becker & Becker Associates of New Canaan, Conn. The gable-roofed units are arranged around two courtyards straddling a private center street, reached through an arch at the foot of Suburban Avenue. Rents range from $1,300 for the least expensive one-bedroom unit to $2,900 for the top of the three-bedroom line. About half the apartments are already leased.
South of the UConn site, on Summer Street, Crown Theaters has broken ground for the Majestic, a six-screen, 1,632-seat cinema. "We really feel the area is coming into its own again," said Daniel M. Crown, president and chief executive of the theater chain, based in Norwalk, Conn.
A block away, at the Palace Theater, the stage is being doubled in depth to 40 feet so that the Stamford Center for the Arts can present full-fledged Broadway musicals in the 70-year-old, 1,600-seat house.
"The Palace auditorium is fantastic but the stage is very limiting," said F. D. (Frank) Rich Jr., president of the arts center and chairman of the Rich Company. "It was built for vaudeville and movies, not for 'Phantom of the Opera.' " The second phase of the Palace renovation calls for an expansion into an adjacent site on Atlantic Street once occupied by Il Forno restaurant.
As it is, backstage is now so cramped, said John Hiddlestone, development director for the center, that non-principal dancers in "The Nutcracker" have to get dressed at a ballet school across the street and walk to the Palace in costume.
On a smaller scale, the stately, neoclassical Citizens Savings Bank building reopened four months ago as the Bank Street Brewing Company restaurant. A fermentation tank, brew kettle and mash tun have been added -- giving new meaning to "bank draft" -- but the stained-glass skylight dome, coffered ceilings and angel reliefs remain.
Beyond these visible signs of recovery are any number of ambitious plans for the future. The city has received seven proposals for the residential redevelopment of the 3.4-acre site of the former Burdick School, on Forest Street.
AN $80 million proposal called Park Square West has been chosen by the city for a large swath of two downtown blocks north of Columbus Park, known by their official designation as Blocks 8 and 9.
To be developed by the Corcoran, Jennison Companies and Berkeley Investments of Boston, the first phase of the project would have 140 apartments in a 7-story building on Summer Street and up to 40,000 square feet of retail space. Eventually, there are to be 260 more apartments in a 14-story building on Washington Boulevard, and a total of 75,000 square feet of retail space, including a 35,000-square-foot upscale greengrocer. The architects are Arrowstreet Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
The Rich family and the United Development Corporation, controlled by the Kahn family, have their own plans for a large parcel they control along Broad Street, adjacent to the Park Square West site. They propose a three-story, 150,000-square-foot Sears store, with a 450-space underground parking garage to be financed by a municipal bond issue.
For the moment, there is a dispute over the extent to which Park Square West departs from previously established development criteria. "Where will people park?" asked Thomas L. Rich, senior vice president of the Rich Company. "Not only did they under-design the parking but they increased the retail with a parking-intensive use."
The project manager for the Park Square West joint venture, Stephanie S. Wasser, said she was hopeful that the city would resolve its differences with the Riches and that construction of the project could begin next summer. For his part, Mr. Rich said the dispute should not impede Corcoran, Jennison's progress.
Another strategically vital site is at Tresser Boulevard and Atlantic Street, a crossroads occupied by the silvery headquarters of Champion International Corporation, the glass-fronted Rich Forum and the curving 300 Atlantic Street office building. On the southwest corner is a one-story "taxpayer" structure.
Here, the Hines Interests envisions a 450,000-square-foot financial center not unlike that being built by Swiss Bank, which Hines served as development and construction consultant. Subject to city approval -- and a tenant's needs -- the project might have a large trading floor atop a parking garage in midblock, connected to an office tower at the corner, with street-level uses at its base to enliven the intersection.
The Hines development would preserve the 82-year-old original Post Office building immediately to the south and generate income for the St. Johns Towers housing project immediately to the west, which is needed for rehabilitation.
"We're very committed to participation in the ongoing revitalization of downtown Stamford," said Thomas M. Craig Jr., senior vice president at Hines. "We think now is a propitious time to be active in that market. We're confident that Swiss Bank will present a compelling case for a relocation by a major securities firm or another firm in the financial services industry."
BEFORE settling on Stamford, Swiss Bank looked closely at White Plains and four buildings in Manhattan: 222 Broadway, at Fulton Street, which the bank owns; 1 Liberty Plaza, at Broadway and Liberty Street; the former Mobil Building, 150 East 42d Street, and Park Avenue Plaza, 55 East 52d Street.
Stamford had several things in its favor, said Markus U. Buergler, director of corporate real estate for the SBC Warburg division. One of them was the opportunity to control a 12-acre site. "For us, it was important to create a campus environment," he said. "Not 200 acres in the back woods but an urban campus. And Stamford allowed us to do that."
Swiss Bank executives liked the fact that the site was so close to public transportation that it afforded the chance to build an enormous trading floor and that it offered the ability to develop in phases, accounting for the corporation's changing needs over time.
There were other inducements. The market value of the site, based on its development potential, was more than $22 million. But the city owned about 30 percent of the acreage, including Beehler Street and Guernsey Avenue, and sold it to Swiss Bank for $1. "That's a good land cost," Mr. Buergler allowed. The city cobbled together the rest of the parcel through its powers of condemnation and closed Beehler and Guernsey.
Swiss Bank benefited further from a state credit that will reduce its corporate tax bill up to 50 percent over 10 years for creating at least 2,000 jobs. The value of the credit is about $120 million. If Swiss Bank has at least 3,000 employees at the end of the 10th year, the credit would be extended five more years at a lesser percentage, with a value of $25 million.
Mr. Bergstrom said the government benefited in its dealings with Swiss Bank from the loss of Morgan Stanley. "It was a blow psychologically," he said, "but the state really learned about the investment banking industry. It was a crash course in what makes them tick."
Construction of the Swiss Bank center is to be completed in July, Mr. Buergler said, and employees will move there from September through December, coming out of 222 Broadway, 277 Park Avenue and the Swiss Bank Tower at 10 East 50th Street.
The heart of the new complex will be the trading floor pavilion. Some 600 traders will sit, without a single column between them, under one roof. And what a roof: a bow-shaped truss tilted to create an expansive clerestory window along the north wall, lined with wave-like baffles to provide indirect lighting and acoustic control.
Dramatic as this space will be, Mustafa K. Abadan, the Skidmore partner in charge of the Swiss Bank project, said, "Ultimately, the landscaping of Washington Boulevard will be the biggest impact of the site."
Mr. Bergstrom agreed. "As important as it is getting 2,000 jobs, biting off a piece of Wall Street and getting it to Stamford, the real value of the project is that it connects downtown to the train station," he said.
Indeed, pedestrians generally are finally getting their due in Stamford.
"I don't think a new building that didn't have a very active street-level presence would be approved in Stamford today," Mr. Bergstrom said. "Stamford has learned from its past, from the old buildings with entrances floating five levels above the street."
Even an old building can be taught the new trick, as the GTE Corporation has demonstrated at its headquarters. The building is a familiar sight to motorists on I-95 and passengers on Metro-North, looking as it does like a glass-skinned, upside-down ziggurat. But along Tresser Boulevard, GTE presented only the formidably stark concrete wall of a parking garage.
In a recent renovation, to designs by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, the building has been given a more inviting entrance on Tresser Boulevard, clad in blue-gray ceramic tiles, with a lobby, canopy, colonnade and small garden.
CATER-CORNER from GTE is one of the most impressive and critically situated vacant lots of all: a 3.8-acre expanse of virtual marshland, where tall swamp grasses roll like the ocean's surface under winter winds, circumscribed by a long-abandoned concrete foundation.
Known as Parcel 38, it sits across Greyrock Place from the Stamford Town Center Mall and across Tresser Boulevard from the Stamford Marriott. As such, it is a painfully visible reminder of the city's recent economic woes.
It is understood that Citicorp, which controls Parcel 38, has entered into a contract with W. Scott Toombs of the Toombs Development Company in New Canaan, Conn., which has built projects in Baltimore and Philadelphia but is perhaps best known for the Princeton Forrestal Village in Plainsboro, N.J. Citing a confidentiality agreement, Mr. Toombs said he could not discuss the Stamford transaction or any plans he might have for the site.
Mayor Malloy has his own thoughts. "Parcel 38 is large enough that you could have a good mixed-use project," he said. "My best-case scenario would be a company that was prepared to make the kind of commitment that Swiss Bank has, a company in financial services looking for a premiere location."
Faded signs around the perimeter of the site -- "Rich Development Construction" -- still attest to its past. Parcel 38 was to have been a capstone in the Rich Company's redevelopment effort but wound up as more of a last straw.
The company was founded in 1921 by F. D. Rich Sr., a stonemason, and was for many years primarily a construction contractor. But under the leadership of his sons, Robert and Frank, and their close associate and chief counsel, Lawrence Gochberg, the Rich Company won the contract to redevelop the downtown urban renewal district in 1960.
Construction began in 1968 with St. Johns Towers, three silo-like apartment buildings designed by Victor Bisharat. The first commercial project was Landmark Tower, designed by Mr. Bisharat, which was completed in 1972. Five smaller buildings, designed by Moshe Safdie, were built around the tower to form Landmark Square.
Also in the 1970's, the Riches built the GTE building and the Stamford Marriott, both by Mr. Bisharat, and 10 Stamford Forum, by Mitchell/Giurgola. In the 1980's came 4 Stamford Forum, by Cesar Pelli; 6 Stamford Forum, by Arthur Erickson and 8 Stamford Forum, by Hugh Stubbins, which served as Singer headquarters. The company also built the Town Center and expanded the Marriott.
It was in the mid-80's that the Rich Company began to feel squeezed. Like every office owner in that period, its tenant rolls shrank as corporations merged, moved and shed workers.
As a downtown landlord, Rich also found itself competing with office buildings elsewhere in Stamford. "For 15 years, we weren't able to get the land-use boards to limit development outside downtown," Robert Rich said. "They didn't tighten it up until it was too late."
And the Rich Company was compelled to build structures by certain dates or else sacrifice development rights. "The Urban Redevelopment Commission pushed us into building 300 Atlantic Street and 177 Broad Street," Mr. Rich said, "which we did -- unfortunately -- in a declining market."
Parcel 38 was to have been the site of an 800,000-square foot office and residential project called the Stamford Atrium, designed by Mr. Safdie. This would have been linked to other Rich properties by pedestrian bridges, creating a continuous walkway from the Forum, through the Atrium, to the Town Center and Landmark Square beyond -- more than half a mile without crossing a street.
By 1987, however, it was clear that the declining market could not possibly absorb the Stamford Atrium and the project was stopped, leaving nothing but its foundation walls.
EVENTUALLY, lenders took back most of the Rich properties. Parcel 38, 4 and 6 Stamford Forum and 300 Atlantic Street went to Citicorp; 8 Stamford Forum to the Bank of New York; 10 Stamford Forum to the Prudential Insurance Company of America; 177 Broad Street and the Biltmore apartments to Bankers Trust and Landmark Square to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
Three of the Stamford Forum buildings were acquired in 1993 by Zell/Merrill Lynch of Chicago, which renamed them Stamford Plaza and renumbered them. Landmark Square was eventually acquired by Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, which is planning an $11 million upgrade of the complex, including the facade, garage, roof, plaza and heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems.
The Rich Company kept its half interest in the Town Center, together with the Taubman Company, and remains an owner and the managing partner in High Ridge Park, an office complex north of downtown.
Members of the third generation are also active in real estate and community affairs. Frank Rich's son, F. D. (Rick) Rich 3d, is senior vice president and managing director of Reckson's southern Connecticut office, and vice chairman of Stamford's downtown business-improvement district. Frank Rich's daughter, Susan M. Rich, is a senior vice president of Reckson for leasing in southern Connectictut and Westchester County and the first chairwoman of Stamford's Rotary Club.
Robert Rich's son, Thomas, is pressing the case for Sears and was also instrumental in the Crown Majestic Theater deal. His company, T. R. Hardy L.L.C., acquired the Summer Street parcel at auction from Citicorp and leased it in turn to Crown.
Besides enjoying the fact that the cinema will lure more people downtown at night, Mr. Rich derives some familial satisfaction from the project, given who used to own the property before Citicorp foreclosed.
It was the F. D. Rich Company.

How a Plane Crash Changed the Trip To Buy Groceries

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: PORT NORRIS

 BODY:
There are vast spaces between buildings along Main Street where houses and shops used to stand, ghosts of the prosperous past of this tiny Cumberland County town. So, what is most noticeable now is not what's here, but what isn't.
Mostly gone is the oyster industry that boomed in the first half of the century and then was devastated by marine parasites. With it went the doctors, auto dealerships, restaurants, clothing shops, ice cream parlors, the barbershop and the movie theater. The storefront pool hall, which somehow escaped demolition, is boarded up and covered with vines. 
 And now the only food market for miles around is gone too, closed by a problem that literally fell from the sky on Dec. 8, when a single-engine plane crashed through the roof of Newcomb's Supermarket on Main Street.
The accident -- which tore apart the only place that people with cars could buy a quart of milk or a loaf of bread -- has also served to bring the community together.
Two Methodist congregations, one white and one black, have joined forces to produce a short-term solution, a bus to carry shoppers to a supermarket in Millville 18 miles away, and a long-term campaign to bring public transportation to the town of 2,000 people in the sparsely settled southern part of the state.
SUSIE LOPEZ was working at the computer in the back of her store, writing up grocery orders for the coming week, when the small plane came through the roof.
The building, a long hangar-like structure of concrete block that once housed a Chevrolet dealership, shook at the impact. Her two employees were safe, but the pilot, she later learned, was dead.
Mrs. Lopez, who bought the store seven years ago with her husband, Joe, has yet to hear from a contractor about what it will cost to repair damage to one of the trusses that support the store's roof. She cannot say when the store will reopen.
"We don't want to delay anything," she said. "This is my life; this is our income. Besides, a lot of people depend on us."
On Friday, five days after the crash, Chris Miller, the pastor of the First United Methodist Church on Main Street, got a call from Alice Reed, a former resident of Port Norris who had moved to Millville.
"I think you should do something," she said. "There are people in town who don't have transportation. And they don't have any food and no way of getting it."
The pastor was scheduled to speak the next morning to the men's group of the John Wesley United Methodist Church, an African-American congregation, several blocks away. He used the occasion to tell its pastor, the Rev. Joseph L. Scott, about the call.
And the pastors, who had been looking for a project that could involve both congregations, come up with the bus plan.
On Sunday, the two church's councils gave the plan their enthusiastic support and on Monday night about 10 members from the two churches met to work out details.
Neither church has an office staff so David Ennis, assistant minister of Shiloh Baptist, another church in town, volunteered his.
A few days later, Barney Hollinger, a township committeeman, heard about the plan.
"When I went that night to the township committee meeting, I asked what the township could do," recalled Mr. Hollinger, a marina owner and part-time oysterman whose roots in Port Norris go back two generations.
The commitee allocated emergency funding to cover the cost of bus rental: $30 a trip.
SO far the turnout has been low. Since Dec. 20, only nine people have availed themselves of two trips; another was cancelled for lack of riders. The trips will continue until at least mid-January.
"The need is greater than the response so far," said Mr. Miller. "I'm a little disappointed but I don't think we made a mistake."
Neither does Roberta Horton, a woman on welfare who took advantage of the service twice.
"It's really good to have," she said. "If you run out of food or have no milk, there's no little store to run to. Unless you want to live on pizza " she added referring to the lone pizzeria on Main Street.
Mrs. Horton was interviewed on the bus returning from the Pathmark in Millville on Dec. 27. With her was her son, Mark, 21; her 19-year-old daughter, Laura, 19; Laura's 16-month-old son, Jeremy, and Mrs. Horton's friend, Daniel Evans.
"There's a lot of people around who need it," she said. "A lot of people who can't walk and old people who can't shop for themselves."
Mr. Miller, who has a commercial driver's license and was driving the schoolbus, said, "Well, if you know of anyone like that, let us know and we'll shop for them."
Mrs. Horton said a taxi to Millville costs about $20 to $25. Some people with cars make money ferrying people to shop, she said, and she pays one man $15 for a round trip.
Mark Horton said he used to bicycle to work in Millville where he worked in a box factory until he was laid off. The trip took from half an hour to 45 minutes.
"Casinos hire people," Mark Horton said. "But you need a car to get to Millville to get the bus to Atlantic City."
CUMBERLAND COUNTY is economically depressed, compared to much of the rest of New Jersey. And Port Norris is poor, compared to the rest of the county.
The county's unemployment rate is 8.7 percent compared with the state's 5.9, said Glenn Nickerson, public information officer for Cumberland County.
Per capita income in Port Norris is only $10,401 annually, compared to $12,560 in the county as a whole.
The county, which provides buses for seniors, would like to persuade NJ Transit to start a spur service for Port Norris.
But Alan Maiman, NJ Transit's manager of bus service planning for the southern region of the state, said it's difficult to serve rural areas like Port Norris.
"The mass in mass transit," Mr. Maiman said, "means you need a concentration of people who are making similiar trips at similar times for similar purposes in significant numbers to justify a large vehicle like a bus to efficiently operate."
He said he and county officials are meeting early this month to brainstorm solutions, and on Thursday the two churches are holding a public meeting to see what can be done to bring public transportation to Port Norris.
"My hope is that out of the tragedy of the loss of the pilot's life," said Pastor Scott, "that some long-term change can be made."
As the Hortons got off the bus carrying three plastic bags of groceries, Roberta Horton called back cheerily to Pastor Miller, "I'll see you next trip Friday then."
"All right," he replied. "We'll be here."

HEADLINE: THE GREAT OUTDOORS;
Developer, Spare That Tree

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: EMERSON

 BODY:
THE Fairways here seems like a classic example of Housing Development 101, New Jersey style. The single-family houses, which began appearing in the early 90's, are expensive, modern and uniform, all standing in neat, almost clinical, rows, all forming a bare, almost treeless gantlet through which cars must pass.
"They just came in, plowed and took down every single tree," said Louis Lamatina, an Emerson councilman. "It just didn't look right; it didn't look real pretty." 
 So Mr. Lamatina and other Emerson officials decided one Fairways would be enough. In 1995, they did what about 10 percent of the state's municipalities have done: they passed a tree preservation law prohibiting developers from removing trees indiscriminately.
Now, a proposed 17-unit development called Lake Hollow Estates, to be built on 6.3 acres near Oradell Reservoir, is providing a first test of the law. After a survey of the site two weeks ago, the developer, Rodan Builders of Montvale, said it wanted to remove all but 370 of the site's 1,890 pines, birches, maples and other trees, prompting concerns from environmentalists who say that the area would be a denuded cousin of the Fairways and that trees might be cleared without regard to age or significance.
But Mr. Lamatina is confident the town can work with the developer, thanks to the preservation law.
"Emerson is a suburban town, and people like to look at trees," he said. "So this is definitely a great tool which allows us to shape the developer, as opposed to allowing the developer to do whatever he wants."
Under the ordinance, the developer must conduct a detailed survey and draw a map of trees on the property to be developed. The survey is be reviewed by a tree preservation committee and sent to the local planning board for approval.
Laws like Emerson's illustrate the growing recognition of trees as a means of absorbing pollutants and lowering energy bills by providing cooling shade and wind protection and prevent erosion.
"The laws are getting more stringent because the awareness is definitely building that trees have been neglected in the past," said David L. Johnson, assistant regional forester for the New Jersey Forest Service.
Each year, the state is losing about one-tenth of its undeveloped land, much of it wooded, according to the New Jersey Forest Service. Yet trees have traditionally garnered little attention or money from local government. True, about one-third of New Jersey's municipalities have local shade tree commissions, but they normally determine which trees to plant or prune -- not which to protect from development, said William J. Porter, executive secretary of the New Jersey Shade Tree Federation.
By the early 1990's, though, as concern about trees mounted, several municipalities, including South Brunswick, Sayreville and Hillsdale, drafted tree-preservation laws. Under some of the laws, if trees are to be cleared, they must be replaced in accordance with a formula based on the number and width of trees removed and other factors. (For example, removing a 41-inch-diameter tree might require planting 15 replacement trees at least 2 1/2 inches in diameter.) Or the developer could choose not to replace the trees, instead contributing $100 to $200 a tree to a fund for the planting and maintenance of trees elsewhere in the town.
Such laws are usually limited to new housing developments and do not apply to individual homeowners. Developers who violate the law are subject to fines of up to $1,000 and jail sentences of up to 90 days.
Tree preservation laws have elicited mixed reactions from developers, so long as a law is not excessive, said Joanne Harkins, director of land use planning for the New Jersey Builders Association. Clear-cutting is much more economical than weaving around a thicket of trees, and conducting a tree survey can can cost a few thousand dollars.
Most towns have reported good experiences. Edison's 1995 law has netted $43,000 for the town's tree fund, said Louis Rainone, the township attorney. But now, Edison's law faces a legal challenge from Anda Inc., a developer that wants to build 109 single-family houses on 35 acres. Under the law, the developer would have to plant 2,800 new trees (2,300 more than planned) or pay $230,000 to the tree fund -- conditions the developer says are unreasonable.
"Those kinds of controls to make sure the developer acts in a reasonable fashion -- I can relate to that," said Stephen E. Barcan, an attorney with Wilentz, Goldman and Spitzer in Woodbridge, who represents Anda. "But this goes way beyond that."

HEADLINE: Families Don't End When Marriages Do

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thank you for your very important article about the legal system of divorce in New Jersey and for your focus on mediation ("The State of Disunion," Dec. 1). 
 Increased public awareness of the mediation alternative, as well as the imprimatur of the legislature, are devoutly to be wished for. In addition to promoting costly and corrosive court battles, the adversarial system advances the myth that divorce is a final event.
In fact, couples with children are forever tied to each other. Divorce ends a legal marriage, but it does not end a family. Ideally, an agreement, especially a mediated agreement, should provide a blueprint for the restructuring of a family, and the process of mediation should be a forum for civilized, respectful problem solving.
However, mediators need to be trained to understand the emotional conflicts that are often the underlying source of conflict, for example, the rage one spouse may feel at being abandoned by the other, or the terror at the prospect of being economically bereft. Another necessity is a sound grounding in matrimonial law, which provides the boundaries within which negotiation takes place.
Ultimately, the success of mediation will depend on the skills of the mediators, their substantive knowledge, their problem-solving skills and conflict-managing skills. Particular attention needs to be paid to the qualifications and training of mediators as this becomes an alternative for more and more people.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLORAL PARK;
Greedy Heir or 'Rush to Judgment'?

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
Two and a half years ago. Amalia Fortuna drew up a will that named her two grandsons as heirs to her half-million-dollar estate. Three months later, the 81-year-old widow was stabbed to death while sleeping in her home in Floral Park.
According to prosecutors, it was a classic case of a shiftless relative who grew tired of criticism and, lured by the prospect of inheritance and fueled by alcohol, resorted to murder. But to the defense, it was a case of law-enforcement authorities' jumping to a hasty conclusion based on flimsy evidence and a questionable statement. 
 Tomorrow, after two years of pretrial maneuvering, jury selection is scheduled to begin in State Supreme Court in Jamaica, Queens, in the trial of Peter De Cianni, 38, who is charged with two counts of second-degree murder. Mrs. Fortuna, said law-enforcement officials and neighbors, often argued with Mr. De Cianni over his slovenliness and alcohol abuse, and the prosecution says he killed her in a fit of rage after a night of heavy drinking.
Mr. De Cianni's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, says his client merely found his slain grandmother after a night out and called into question police accounts of statements Mr. De Cianni made after his arrest. If convicted, Mr. De Cianni faces life in prison. If found innocent, he stands to collect his share of his grandmother's estate. He has been held at Rikers Island for two years without bail.
According to the police, Mr. De Cianni admitted that he had spent the afternoon of Sept. 13, 1994, drinking at the Bellerose Bar on Hillside Avenue. He told the police he returned to Mrs. Fortuna's home twice to ask for money for more drinking; both times, he said, they argued, but Mrs. Fortuna relented.
In a signed statement, Mr. De Cianni said he returned to the bar, drank until 3:30 A.M. and spent the rest of the night at a friend's house. When he went home that morning, he found her dead and called the police.
The police, however, said Mr. De Cianni told investigators that he accidentally stabbed Mrs. Fortuna repeatedly with a steak knife and then threw the weapon in a Dumpster, but did not sign a confession. Last June, a judge ruled that the police account was admissible as evidence.
There is also the matter of a $5 bill that was recovered at the Bellerose Bar. The bill, which had Mr. De Cianni's fingerprints on it, carried small traces of blood. Mr. Kornberg described the amount of blood as too small for a definitive match. "The whole thing's an outrage," he said. "First they lock him up for two years on the basis of a made-up confession. Then they try to tag him on some bogus DNA match. Apparently, they got the whole idea from the O. J. case."
Neighbors said Mrs. Fortuna, an Italian immigrant who spoke little English, kept mostly to herself. Often, they said, she would chastise her grandson, complaining of his drinking and unemployment. "She was a rich lady," said Siegrid Muenznek, a hairdresser, who said Mrs. Fortuna was among her clients. "She had just returned from her home in Italy before she was killed. Poor thing."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Pessimism, Yes, but No Retreat

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
MUTUAL fund investors were big winners in the stock market last year, and they no doubt toasted in the new year hoping for more of the same. But professional money managers running hypothetical portfolios for The New York Times caution investors against being too confident.
"I'm not very optimistic entering 1997," said John Rekenthaler, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds, in Chicago. "An enormous amount of good news has been priced into the stock market, and the recent volatility, with the Dow rising or dropping 100 points in an hour or less, suggests a lot of emotion out there." 
 In the fourth quarter of 1996, Mr. Rekenthaler was the top performer among the five investment advisers managing the hypothetical retirement portfolios. Despite being handicapped by its relatively light holdings in domestic blue chips, his portfolio rose 8.40 percent in the last three months of 1996. Part of that gain came from a lack of exposure to emerging markets, whose performance pulled down several other advisers' returns. He was also helped by strong showings in Vanguard Specialized Energy, which benefited from rising oil and natural gas prices, and in Third Avenue Value, a quirky fund focusing on bankruptcy and takeover plays and the like.
Notwithstanding his pessimism, Mr. Rekenthaler is not retreating to cash or bonds. "My portfolio is pretty well diversified," he said, "and while I harbor no illusions that it will hold up that much better than the S.& P. 500 during a decline -- the big blue chips usually fare relatively well during such periods -- neither do I wish to gamble by becoming more conservative."
SIMILARLY, Harold Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., is basically sitting tight, changing just one fund, despite the fact that his portfolio's broad market diversification only seemed to reduce returns in a roaring large-cap domestic bull market. In particular, his investments in small-company and international funds all significantly underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, giving him a 5.79 percent gain in the fourth quarter.
"Of course, that's like blaming an orange for not tasting like an apple," he said, "but in bull markets investors tend to forget the lessons of history."
Foremost among those lessons, Mr. Evensky said, is that the primary factor in successful long-term investing is adequate diversification of assets. Focusing on just one part of the market is a gamble. "It's tough to convince lottery winners that they were lucky and made money on a bad investment," he said.
For the current quarter, Mr. Evensky is merely replacing Pimco Emerging Markets with Matthews Pacific Tiger, thus slightly increasing exposure to the Pacific Rim.
Since the contest began on July 7, 1993, Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y., has held the lead among the five managers and retains that position with an overall gain of 75.81 percent through 1996. In that time, the portfolios have risen an average of 59.36 percent, compared with an 82.20 percent total return for the Vanguard Index 500 fund, which mimics the S.& P. 500, and 68.64 percent for all equity funds.
ALL the portfolios made money in the quarter. Even given the strength of large-capitalization stocksand the broad diversification of the managers' portfolios, only one lagged behind the average gain of 4.99 percent for domestic diversified stock funds.
The portfolio performance, tracked quarterly by Lipper Analytical Services of Summit, N.J., excludes sales charges, transaction costs and tax considerations because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five experts can choose any funds open to new investors and can shift money quarterly, although the portfolios are intended to grow for 20 years.
In second place for the last quarter was Eric M. Kobren, president of Insight Management, in Wellesley, Mass. Mr. Kobren, whose portfolio includes only Fidelity funds, posted a return of 7.55 percent. This quarter he is adding two funds and selling Fidelity Value, Fidelity Growth Company and the Fidelity Fund.
"Over the years, it is easy to simply add more and more funds," he said. "But we believe simplicity is also an important benefit of investing in funds, and therefore prefer to reduce the number of fund holdings to a more manageable level."
Mr. Kobren is investing part of the sale proceeds in Fidelity Contrafund, which has "wide investment flexibility," he said. "It can -- and does -- buy stocks found in all three of the funds we are selling," he said. He is also adding Fidelity Dividend Growth, which focuses on companies that were spun off big conglomerates or are undergoing significant structural changes.
Anticipating a market break next year, Mr. Jacobs is reducing risk in his portfolio, which gained 7.41 percent last quarter. "When you have two great years in a row, the next one can be a downer," he said.
He is deleting Strong Growth and Janus Olympus and dividing the proceeds among Fidelity Real Estate, Heartland: Value Plus and the Yacktman Fund.
The portfolio of Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser specializing in "socially responsible investing," rose 4.06 percent for the quarter. Mr. Brill, who is making no changes in his portfolio, said he believes the large-cap run-up will not continue into next year. His Citizens Emerging Growth fund suffered as the large-capitalization stocks rose, but he said he was retaining it because long-term growth portfolios need to have a small-cap component.
The top-performing diversified fund in the fourth quarter was a socially responsible one, Parnassus, which Mr. Brill had held until earlier this year. Disappointed with its performance, he sold it in the spring. The fund's manager had announced a change in investment philosophy and a portfolio restructuring, but Mr. Brill had had enough. Was he ready to step back in, given the fund's terrific rebound? Not yet. "I want to see if the manager's re-look and change in philosophy will continue to produce good results."
A reader recently asked: How would the five managers be performing if they had stuck to their original portfolios from more than three years ago?
Well, Mr. Evensky would be in first place with a gain of 64.47 percent, compared with 52.84 percent with his quarterly changes, followed by Mr. Jacobs, up 50.74 percent (actual gain: 75.81 percent); Mr. Kobren, up 50.81 percent (actual gain: 65.63 percent), and Mr. Rekenthaler, up 42.39 percent (actual gain: 56.88 percent). Mr. Brill's comparable portfolio performance could not be calculated accurately because one of his original funds was merged out of existence and a second has been liquidated.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Supermarket Stocks: The Sale May Be Over

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
AFTER a big run-up last year, the stocks of supermarket companies are starting to look like the week-old melons in the produce section -- a bit overripe.
"The industry, stocks as well as businesses, had a very nice rebound in 1996, so there is not a ton of value left," said Jay Abramson, executive vice president of Cramer, Rosenthal, McGlynn, an investment firm. 
 Stocks of food retailers rose 22 percent on average in 1996. And they are now trading at 18 to 25 times 1996 earnings, roughly comparable to the 21 multiple of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Even looking ahead, grocery stocks are trading at about 14 to 18 times this year's earnings, according to analysts' estimates. While they don't look so pricey by that measure, many still seem to have gotten ahead of themselves.
Earnings growth for the entire industry has been about 12 to 15 percent a year, and will probably not go much higher, the analysts add.
"I'm not sure the growth rates are sustainable," said Jonathan H. Ziegler, a supermarket stock analyst with Salomon Brothers. "There is not a lot of easy money out there."
Among the stronger supermarket chains are the two biggest, the Kroger Company of Cincinnati and Safeway Inc. of Pleasanton, Calif.
Kroger, the nation's leading grocer with more than 1,300 stores and estimated sales this year of about $25 billion, faces increased competition in its core markets in the Southeast, Midwest and Rocky Mountain states.
But its sales and earnings growth have picked up in the last two years. Sales are expected to come in about 10 percent higher in 1996 than in the previous year, according to Salomon Brothers. This year, Salomon expects earnings to rise to $430 million, up 22 percent from the $352 million expected for 1996.
Salomon rates the stock a hold, and few others are willing to call it an outright buy at its current price of $47.375 a share even though they like the company's long-term prospects.
"I like Kroger because they are a good executer," said Lauren Allan Smith, a stock analyst with Loomis Sayles, which owns a large number of Kroger shares. The company has automated its ordering and shipping departments, invested heavily to refurbish stores and paid down debt incurred several years ago to stave off a takeover attempt.
"They've been spending a lot of money to put assets and procedures in place and need to make a return on that in the next few years," Ms. AllanSmith said.
Kroger's strategy has been to develop lucrative "shops within shops," like floral departments and fish markets, she said. Those high-margin boutiques offset the small profits generated from selling paper towels and soap in bulk at low prices.
Kroger may also be attractive because its stock, at 14 times estimated 1997 earnings, has risen less sharply than its rivals'.
When it comes to pricey stocks, Kroger pales next to Safeway, whose shares soared last year. Largely because of acquisitions, the company has been growing rapidly, attracting so many fans that it is now trading at about 24 times 1996 earnings.
Safeway, which has a strong presence in California and the Northwest, just signed an agreement to acquire the Vons Companies for $1.57 billion. The combined company will be the second-biggest grocery chain, with more than 1,300 stores and annual sales of more than $22 billion.
Like Kroger, Safeway has paid down debt. It has also reduced operating expenses and bolstered sales at stores open at least a year.
But investing in Safeway requires a belief that the company can continue to grow at its phenomenal clip of recent years. "The stock is up 70 percent over the last 12 months," said Ms. AllanSmith, whose company owns a stake in Safeway. "It's been a rocket ship."
Douglas Christopher, a stock analyst with Crowell, Weedon & Company in Los Angeles, expects Safeway's earnings to climb 21 percent this year, to $490 million, from $405 million for 1996. While that would be impressive growth, it would represent a slowdown from the early 90's.
Even though Safeway and many other supermarkets have become leaner, more efficient operators in recent years, Mr. Christopher encourages investors to be patient. "We prefer to buy supermarkets with multiples in the low teens," he said. "We'd rather wait for the market to maybe correct a little bit."
Perhaps no grocery store company has experienced more of a roller-coaster ride than Food Lion Inc., based in Salisbury, N.C., and concentrated in the Southeast.
The company suffered from a scandal involving tainted meat in 1992. After it became the subject of an ABC News expose on "Prime Time Live," it sued the network for fraud for sending reporters undercover to work at the store. Food Lion recently won in a Federal court in Greensboro, N.C., and the court is expected to reconvene on Monday to determine if punitive damages should be paid, and if so, how much.
Last year was generally one of recovery for the company, whose stock rose nearly 80 percent. Like Safeway, it is trading at 24 times last year's estimated earnings, and more than 18 times this year's estimate.
Some innovative marketing strategies have helped Food Lion bolster revenues and improve its tarnished image. For example, it created a frequent-shopper card that provides deep discounts on purchases to people who spend a certain amount in any of its more than 1,000 stores.
Mr. Ziegler of Salomon estimates that Food Lion will earn $265 million this year, up 26 percent from $211 million in 1996.
Kroger, Safeway and Food Lion all win plaudits for their managements. That is not true for some other grocery chains. Winn-Dixie of Jacksonville, Fla., has been cutting prices to counter increased competition. It elicits negative comments from some analysts.
For investors keen on the superstore concept, two companies that are hybrid food stores and general merchandisers might be worth considering at the right price: Fred Meyer Inc. of Portland, Ore., and Price/Costco Inc. of Issaquah, Wash. Fred Meyer, whose stores sell everything from jewelry to Jell-O, generates about 41 percent of revenues from food sales. Price/Costco, operator of 250 membership warehouses, has had consistent growth in sales at stores open at least a year and gets about 35 percent of its revenues from food, analysts say.
Because of their merchandise mix, Fred Meyer and Price/Costco are considered more vulnerable to economic downturns than are their pure grocery counterparts.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REPORT;
Move the Feast to Europe, Some Advise

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
THE New World was a good place to invest money last year, but the Old World was a better one. The average mutual fund invested in European stocks outperformed the average American fund, 23.49 percent to 18.40 percent, according to figures from Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers in Chicago.
Given the economic cycles, some money managers think Europe will remain a good place to be. European economies were more sluggish for most of the last few years but are starting to grow. They could be expanding vigorously just as activity -- and especially corporate profits -- may flatten or ebb in the United States. 
 "We think Europe is in the early stages of earnings-growth expansion that may last for many years," said Denise Downey, a portfolio manager for Bank Julius Baer in New York, which runs several international funds. "We continue to be quite positive on the European markets."
And while some strategists don't share such general enthusiasm, they find no shortage of appealing individual stocks that Europeans themselves may be overlooking because of their traditional "top down," or macroeconomic, approach to investing and an emphasis on the very biggest companies, money managers say. This leaves many niches where value-oriented investors can find bargains.
"The opportunities for small companies there are terrific," said Michael Gerding, portfolio manager for three international funds sponsored by Founders Asset Management in Denver.
Specialists point to several trends -- apart from Europe's potentially more favorable position in the business cycle and lower share valuations -- to support a bullish investment case. Indeed, last year the number of funds focused on this area swelled by nearly 25 percent, according to Morningstar. These trends include corporate revamping and outsourcing, friendlier attitudes toward investors, performance-tied executive pay, rising demand for goods from the former Soviet-bloc countries, improved accounting standards and moves to more fully finance corporate pension plans. Some also take as a favorable sign the arrival in Europe of discount stockbrokers and, in Germany, of tax legislation that should lead to more companies' buying back shares.
Indeed, the general loosening of restrictions and dependence on the state has even reached Scandinavia, contributing substantially to big stock-market gains there last year. Two Scandinavian funds, Fidelity Nordic and Wright Equifund-Nordic, were among the top European performers for both the latest quarter and all of 1996.
These countries "tend to be the most Socialist-oriented of all," said William F. Wendler 2d, vice president of Rowe Price-Fleming International in Baltimore. But they have been forced, he said, to "come to grips with the fact that putting social policy ahead of economic policy was killing them." Now, Mr. Wendler added, less pressure on wages "is keeping the cost side of the equation very subdued."
Then there is the issue of European integration, with planned monetary union at the beginning of 1999. Most managers say they think this will eventually prove a moderate plus for stock markets -- and a welcome step toward simpler hedging of currency.
Mr. Wendler and other managers said that monetary union would require American investors to rethink their exposure to currency fluctuation, which can significantly affect a portfolio's stock-market performance. Germany's Bundesbank, by tying its powerful mark to a constellation of lesser currencies, will be forced to become less hawkish against inflation, Mr. Wendler said. This implies more stability for American investors in Europe and thus somewhat less need to hedge stock positions.
BUT money managers fret that in the short run the need to meet qualifying standards for monetary union has meant policies of deficit reduction and of reluctance to cut interest rates to spur growth.
"It could be a fairly austere year from a government-spending point of view," Mr. Gerding said. He added that he saw only "a decent environment" in 1997, with most European economies "not robust at all."
Still, Mr. Gerding and portfolio managers who are more generally encouraged about prospects for investing in Europe find plenty of interesting corporate situations, especially in France and Germany.
Mr. Gerding is particularly fond these days of Volkswagen, which shows strong revenue growth and expanding operating margins, and Guilbert, a large French distributor of office products whose earnings he expects to climb 25 percent annually for the next few years. He also likes Baan, a Dutch software company.
Carol Franklin, lead manager of the $2.5 billion Scudder International fund, praises the way Hoechst, the German pharmaceutical company, has embraced the idea of spinoffs and job cuts in an effort to please stockholders, whom she called "a new life form" to many hidebound European managements.
"Shareholders have not been the highest priority" in much of Europe, where governments and unions play major roles in business decision making, Ms. Franklin said. But now "this is changing -- because it has to," she said.
Ms. Franklin also likes the way Europeans have begun to outsource various corporate functions, like computer services; one of her favorite companies in this area is Getronics, a Dutch concern. This trend is related to the aggressive selloff of state enterprises that reached a record $43 billion last year and that J. P. Morgan predicts will jump 23 percent in 1997.
To be sure, some of the favorable trends may prove glacially slow, or shy on substance. And perhaps, as Mr. Gerding contends, much of the most appealing privatization has already occurred.
But this has not discouraged stock-pickers like Robert Q. Wyckoff Jr. and his colleagues at Tweedy, Browne in New York. They are adept at finding opportunity regardless of larger trends that might be ominous for the market, like the rising interest rates that some see for Europe in 1997 or the likelihood of a Labor Party victory in British elections.
"We've found more bargains in second-tier stocks in Western Europe than probably anywhere else around the world," Mr. Wyckoff said, noting that he has also been encouraged by more accounting standardization there and a new-found activism among institutional stockholders. About 60 percent of the Tweedy Browne Global Value Fund, not counting the 9 percent in cash, is invested in Western Europe, with particular emphasis on Switzerland.
TWO favorites of Tweedy, Browne are Edipresse, a Swiss newspaper chain selling at eight times earnings and less than half the firm's estimate of its worth, and Franco Tosi, an Italian water distribution and packaging company with a huge bundle of cash equal to more than twice its selling price. Tweedy also has long had a big stake in Nestle, the Swiss giant.
While there are now more than five dozen open-end European funds, one of the more intriguing ways to "play" Western Europe may be the $118 million European Warrant Fund.
This is a closed-end investment company listed on the New York Stock Exchange that soared nearly 50 percent last year but still trades at a 22 percent discount to net asset value. It mainly buys European warrants, either publicly traded ones or those that are custom-designed with the issuer. However, Ms. Downey of Bank Julius Baer, whose affiliate is the investment manager, cautions that European Warrant is speculative and should be considered only by "higher-risk investors."

HEADLINE: Social Security, As We Knew It

BYLINE: By Daniel Patrick Moynihan; Daniel Patrick Moynihan is the Democratic Senator from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Tomorrow, one year late, the Advisory Council on Social Security is scheduled to report on the finances of our national retirement system. More to the point, there will likely be three reports, with the 13 members divided every which way, and no majority for anything.
In one mode or another, such expert councils have convened regularly since Social Security was enacted in 1935. There have been occasional dissents but nothing like the disarray we now witness. 
 Or do we? Looked at sidewise, as you might say, there is, in fact, a striking accord among the three factions. Each claims that if Social Security is to survive it must be radically changed. Henceforth, if the council has its way, all of the reserves, or much of the reserves, would be invested in the stock market.
It would appear the dream of universal Federal retirement insurance is over. I don't suppose we needed an advisory council to tell us this. For some while now opinion polls have reported that a majority of nonretired adults do not believe they will receive Social Security when the time comes for them to retire.
And this is not a matter of simple misinformation. In August 1994, I introduced a bill that re-established the Social Security Administration as a freestanding agency: The Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994. I was virtually alone on the Senate floor when it was called up, and so took my time to explain that over the years the agency had been shuffled from one big department to another and had gradually lost its visibility and much of its energy. Citizens had begun to doubt whether the system would be there for them, when in fact it would be.
As I went on in my comments, I began to sense something strange, unusual. The clerks at the desk were listening. In the Senate, we call them clerks; they are mostly graduates of Georgetown University Law School. They never listen to speeches, having other things to do and having heard it all before.
I put in a quorum call and summoned them to my desk.
"I saw you," I hectored. "You were listening! Because you have never before heard anyone tell you you would get your Social Security retirement?"
Guilty, they concurred.
The problem with Social Security goes back to the decision in the 1930's to finance the system on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the result that there are no "real" assets in the trust fund. But now there is another problem. As a people, we are simply turning away from government.
Bear in mind that we began to dismantle the Social Security Act last year. The welfare legislation repealed Title IV-A of the Social Security Act of 1935, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. This in a sense was the oldest feature of the 1935 bill; the Federal Government simply took over the widows' pensions established by the states at the turn of the century.
Last year, when the Senate was debating "welfare reform," I argued, again on the floor, that to abolish our commitment to children would be the first step in dismantling the social contract of the 1930's, in which we undertook the care of the elderly, the unemployed, the children.
"Drop the last, watch the others fall," I pleaded. "Do not doubt that Social Security itself will be next."
The Senate went ahead anyway. Nor was it a matter of newly unreconstructed Republicans forcing change upon us. On the final vote to repeal A.F.D.C., only 21 Democrats voted against the measure.
Now it seems that all three factions of the Advisory Council on Social Security have effectively agreed to privatize the system in all or part.
One faction, supported by the former Commissioner of Social Security, Robert M. Ball, would permit 40 percent of the Social Security trust funds -- which under current law may be invested only in government securities -- to be invested in the stock market. An independent government body would make investment decisions.
A second plan would create "personal security accounts" into which 40 percent of payroll taxes would be deposited, with investment decisions left to individuals.
The third plan would add a new "pension benefit" for individuals, financed by a 1.6 percent increase in the payroll tax. As under the Ball plan, a government board would decide how accounts would be invested in the private sector.
It would appear to me that once the great majority of citizens found that they would do better in the private investment part of this new system, support for the redistributive aspects of Social Security would quickly erode. It would become a residual relief program for the poor elderly, possibly turned over to the states as is done with welfare.
Pity is this needn't happen. Last month, the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index concluded that the index overstates the cost of living by 1.1 percentage points. If we were to make that small adjustment in the annual increase in retirement benefits, the system would be in actuarial balance until 2052. And we could go on to other things.
I don't expect to persuade anyone, but we have known about the problems with the Consumer Price Index for a very long while. Thirty-five years ago, I arrived in Washington with the Kennedy Administration; I became an Assistant Secretary of Labor, with nominal oversight of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We had just received a report on price indexes from a committee led by a Nobel laureate, George Stigler.
The report read: "If a poll were taken of professional economists and statisticians, in all probability they would designate (and by a wide majority) the failure of the price indexes to take full account of quality changes as the most important defect in these indexes. And by almost as large a majority, they would believe that this failure introduces a systematic upward bias in the price indexes."
No one at the Bureau of Labor Statistics disagreed. The C.P.I. is not a cost-of-living index. The Department of Labor asserts this over and again. But the Government uses it as one and there you are. (A 1.1 percentage point adjustment would bring in $1 trillion in 12 years to the Federal Government.)
Privatizing Social Security would have problems, not least of which would be having the Government pick and choose stocks. (Quick, sell tobacco!)
But a New York Times editorial recently observed that "a good plan can be stitched together from the best parts of two of the three plans" -- those calling for partial privatization. Possibly. But keep in mind the risks.
And could we not fix the cost-of-living adjustment first? That would drain the panic from the system before making big and potentially destabilizing changes.

 BODY:

UTILITIES
Lilco? No, Try a New Name
The name "Lilco" is a red flag to many Long Island residents. Just say the word, and they steam with rage -- at, mainly, the nation's highest utility rates, a legacy of the failed Shoreham plant. So with Lilco saying it would merge with Brooklyn Union Gas, it comes as no surprise that whatever the new giant is named, "it's not going to be called Lilco." Here's a surprise, though: the man who spoke those words is William J. Catacosinos, Lilco's chairman and, as a tireless defender of Shoreham, nearly the devil himself in the eyes of some of the utility's critics. And who will be chairman of the grand new wiping-the-slate-clean utility? Dr. Catacosinos, of course.
 
UTILITIES AGAIN
Nuclear Economics
Utilities can't wipe the whole slate clean, though -- not after the mess left by the national decision to turn to nuclear power. The most terrifying mess, of course: the risk of a devastating accident, every single day. But there's a financial mess, too. Yes, nuclear plants can churn out electricity at a competitive cost, but to look at that pussycat of a statistic ignores the twin monsters lurking just out of sight. Utilities piled up $70 billion in debts to build these plants, and the high rates at utilities like Lilco reflect that. Consumers have had it with the nuclear surcharge, but if they are allowed to shop freely, some utilities could go under. And there's that other monster cost: the billions needed to clean up the plants when they're inevitably mothballed. Where will that come from?
 
THE STOCK MARKET
While You Were Out
There's nothing like having Christmas and New Year's on Wednesdays. Presto! Two weeks wiped out. A two-week breather does wonders for the psyche, you say? What breather? The shopping frenzy segues right into returning what doesn't fit either taste or waist, then into back-to-back overdoses of champagne and football. In case you didn't notice, though, the stock market didn't play by the rules. A week practically guaranteed to be sleepy turned instead into a wild ride, with the Dow industrials ringing out the old with a 101-point drop -- the worst year-end performance ever -- and ringing in the new by plunging 88 more on Thursday before recovering at the closing bell. It was a skeleton crew raising all this fuss, though, for trading volume showed that a lot of people did indeed tune out.
 
CHRISTMAS MOVIES
Hollywood Attacks!
The rest of the business world may have gone into a coma the last two weeks, but the film industry went on a manic fling. For some unfathomable reason, executives all over Hollywood looked at their latest "product," scratched their well-tanned heads, and decreed, "It's a Christmas movie!" As a result, scanning the movie ads these days is a lot like overdosing on chocolate. "Michael." "Jerry Maguire." "Mars Attacks!" "Daylight." "101 Dalmatians." "Space Jam." "The English Patient." "The Crucible." And that's not the half of it. A newspaper's movie section "looks like the Yellow Pages," said one film executive. And guess what? Even if all those had been masterpieces -- sorry, an outlandish supposition -- Hollywood discovered the amazing truth that even at Christmas, human beings can see only one movie at a time. Some big-budget failures are piling up.
 
GIFT MONSTERS
Cabbage Patch Metaphysics
What would John Donne have thought? When he wrote of love as a devouring monster chomping on its helpless prey, he was safely in the land of abstraction, of metaphor. And when people today -- far less poetically, to be sure -- call the Christmas gift orgy another devouring monster, they too are in the land of metaphor. But metaphor has suddenly transformed itself into reality, as one popular gift, the Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids doll, began literally devouring its human playmates. The dolls, you see, are supposed to crave a diet of plastic carrots and french fries, but they have proved indiscriminate diners indeed, instead chomping on children's hair and not letting go. At least 35 cases have been reported, but no serious injuries. It's so metaphysical.
 
NATIONAL PARKS
Grand Canyon, Sweeter
Quiet is such a rare and fragile commodity these days. Boom boxes and sirens abound. The voices at your elbow seem louder by the day. Even hikers atop glorious mountains have been known to flip out cell phones and bellow, "It's so quiet up here!" Is there no relief? One blow was struck for serenity last week, as the Interior Department put new limits on flights in the Grand Canyon. The clear message: there's only one Grand Canyon, and its mythic spell can be shattered in an instant by a swooping helicopter. Operators of air tours have understandably fought any restrictions, for they fly about 800,000 people a year over the canyon, and they will now be limited to smaller areas and shorter hours.
 
PROMOTIONS
A New Look at Denny's
The Denny's restaurant chain does not, you will recall, have a stellar record on race relations. After being accused of refusing to seat blacks or of forcing them to pay in advance, it paid millions of dollars a few years ago to settle lawsuits by black customers. So it was interesting, to say the least, to hear that Denny's is now a major sponsor of the Harlem Globetrotters. And it's a full-blown promotion, with Denny's giving away 100 tickets to each of 60 games to "deserving children" and selling official Globetrotters mini-basketballs. Has Denny's truly shed its old ways? Is this just good business? It's certainly the latter, and perhaps it's both.
 
ICE CREAM
Six-Gun Garcia, Anyone?
Ben & Jerry's is different. It is the ultimate socially responsible company, with, for the most part, a highly egalitarian approach to salaries. When it needed a new top executive two years ago, it told aspiring corporate chieftains to submit 100-word essays making their case -- and received more than 20,000 responses. But when it finally got its chief, Robert Holland, he stayed less than two years, resigning in September. Still, Ben & Jerry's was still Ben & Jerry's -- sinful only in the high-fat temptation it dangles before a weak-willed populace. This one-of-a-kind company would never, say, hire a rifle-company executive to be its new boss. Or would it? The new year brought a new start indeed, as Ben & Jerry's named Perry D. Odak, a former chief operating officer at U.S. Repeating Arms.
 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE
The Lexus of House Seats
Fed up with out-of-sight campaign spending? Well, if you'd baked your own cookies, you might have stopped some of it. A man named Michael Coles, you see, founded the Great American Cookie Company and became so rich he was able to spend millions in a doomed effort to unseat Newt Gingrich. And political one-upmanship being what it is, Mr. Gingrich -- with no real fear of losing -- felt he had to spend more. In fact, he spent $5.4 million, far more than any other House candidate (Mr. Coles was No. 2, at $3.3 million) and nearly 10 times the average spent on House races. Mr. Gingrich easily raised even more, though -- "he knows how to play the money game," said one campaign finance specialist. The surplus will come in handy -- the Speaker has some legal bills piling up.

'Asian Money,' American Fears

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the 1980's, the Asian money that fueled scores of conspiracy theories in America was all Japanese. The sale of giant American icons -- Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures, the Seattle Mariners and much of downtown Los Angeles -- gave rise to dark warnings that decisions about the country's economic future would be made in Tokyo, not New York or Washington.
Exactly how this power would be exercised was always left a bit vague. Would executives at Sony kill movie scripts about the Emperor's role in World War II or about the dark side of corporate life in Japan? And would Nintendo, the new owner of the Mariners, ship home-run hitters back to Osaka, where power-hitting is in scarce supply? 
 In the short retrospect of seven years, the questions now sound even more paranoid than they did then. The Japanese took a multibillion-dollar bath on most of their investments. If anything, they exerted too little control over their acquisitions, especially in Hollywood, and it cost them dearly.
It seems almost laughable these days to think of the United States as an imminent "techno-colony" of Tokyo, a phrase slung around with great abandon in Silicon Valley until Japan plunged into recession.
 
 
 
The New Bogeyman
 Yet the underlying fear that struck such a chord in late 80's, a fear that Asian economic powerhouses were using their great wealth to buy power and influence in America, has cropped up anew. Now, the money is largely from ethnic Chinese, but -- and the distinction is important -- not from China itself.
The conduit for most of the money was John Huang, a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser who helped conceive and execute a carefully drawn plan to tap a rich vein: the Asian-American community. Mr. Huang appealed to the aspirations of a group eager to have a political voice equal to its accomplishments in American society, and he focused his efforts on those he knew best: the prosperous Chinese-Americans living in the suburbs of Los Angeles and New York.
As long as the donors were citizens or legal residents, those contributions were perfectly legal. But in racing to reach an ambitious $7 million fund-raising goal, he quickly raked in more than $1 million in clearly illegal donations from the wealthy precincts of Taipei, Bangkok, Jakarta and other outposts of the Chinese diaspora.
Now, in the public mind, the legal and the illegal have melded under the imprecise rubric of "Asian money." Just as Japan's investments touched a nerve about American economic impotence, the ethnic Chinese money has fed into today's anxiety that Greater China poses the next great challenge to America, economically and militarily.
This shift in fear from Japan to China is nothing new -- that pendulum has swung many times in the American mind, back to the late 19th century. John W. Dower, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted that "as a nation we can handle only one Asian bogeyman at a time, and these days Japan is down and China is up as the country with the greatest potential and the greatest potential menace."
 
 
 
Murky Motives
 But sometimes the smoke can mask some real fire, and the Democrats' problems clearly have elements of both. "In one sense, we've seen this cycle before," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, who was 6 months old when he and his parents were placed in a World War II detention camp for Japanese-Americans, during an era when many Asians on the West Coast wore signs that said "I'm Chinese" for fear of being caught on the wrong side of the pendulum. "But this is a particularly difficult case, because there are legitimate issues to be debated here and a lot of questions no one has answered. And still, you'd be deaf if you didn't also hear the tone of racism that's running through a lot of this."
The key question, of course, is what kind of return on investment Mr. Clinton's biggest campaign donors -- who were usually the foreign contributors whose money has since been returned -- were expecting. So far, there is no evidence of a single policy or trade dispute that changed course after one of Mr. Clinton's now-famous kaffeeklatsches with Asia's rich and famous, though every new disclosure of a meeting sends investigators and journalists scurrying to figure out what Mr. Clinton's visitors really wanted.
For example, no one yet understands the real motives of the Riady family, the ethnic Chinese owners of the Indonesia-based Lippo Group, who gave Mr. Huang a $700,000 goodbye present when he left Lippo in 1994 to take a mid-level job in the Clinton Commerce Department. Did they seek intelligence about American Asian policy? Influence from a bureaucrat with regular access to the President? Or, as many suspect, were they simply using their many pictures with the President and their connections in Washington to create an image back home that could be exploited to profitable advantage?
 
 
 
Double Standards
 There are also a host of subsidiary mysteries, including whether it was greed or ignorance that led the White House, on the recommendation of a Chinese-American restaurateur-turned-entrepreneur from Little Rock, Ark., named Charles Yah Lin Trie, to allow the head of China's state-owned arms manufacturer into a campaign-organized meeting with Mr. Clinton about Asia policy. The White House says it had no idea then that the businessman ran the arms operation, or that he held a senior political post in the Chinese Government (a denial that does not instill great confidence in the vetting of Presidential visitors).
There is little doubt that some of the frenzy surrounding Mr. Clinton's meetings with big donors and their Asian business-leader friends has been fueled by the fact that many of the White House visitors have hard-to-pronounce names and run conglomerates few in America have heard about. It's hard to imagine the Washington press corps getting too excited about a White House dinner invitation to the chief of Airbus Industrie, even though the European consortium's profitability -- like the Lippo Group's -- hinges on major issues of trade policy (including China policy) that are decided in the Oval Office. But bring in the Thai-Chinese chief of Ban Chang, the huge Thai conglomerate and one of the largest investors in China, and suddenly accusations fly.
In the last few weeks, though, even some Asian-American business leaders admit to wondering whether they -- with the Democratic National Committee's direct encouragement -- raised the flag of "Asia bashing" too quickly. "No one in the Asian-American community can say this publicly, but in private a lot of the talk you hear is that there are some real problems with the way access was being sold," said one Asian-American banker, who insisted, of course, that he couldn't talk publicly.
But questions of prejudice aside, Americans and Asians clearly hold radically different views about where global power lies. American suspicions of "Asian money" these days are partly rooted in the sense that American jobs are still flowing across the Pacific. Very few people in America may have heard of the rich entrepreneurs whom the President was entertaining at election time, but many share a gut sense that somehow these Asians are pulling the strings of the world economy, building plants in Southern China using family connections (and bribery) that American firms could never match.
The soaring American trade deficit with China, which is quickly overtaking that with Japan, is often cited as proof that this is a battle the United States is losing. In this view, the Asian money flowing into the nation's political system is intended to spread that web of influence -- much like the Japanese investment in the 80's.
But Asian executives at the summit meeting President Clinton attended in Manila last November hardly flaunted their power. They worry about the future of Hong Kong when it reverts to China on July 1, wonder if China and Indonesia will descend into political chaos after their current leaders die, and maintain that America is in command of the world economic system. They talk about the hidden goals of Washington's trade policies in the same tones that some in Washington talk about Lippo's hidden goals in China. And if Washington gets into a prolonged spat with Beijing over human rights, arms proliferation or the pirating of American movies and videos, China's unfettered access to its biggest market, the United States, could be cut off. And that would crush ereryone's plans to export from their new base in China.
So if it costs an Asian company a few hundred thousand dollars to keep lines of communication to Washington open, well, that's fine. After all, that's a fraction of what is regularly paid to keep a provincial governor happy in southern China, or to keep friendly politicians in office in South Korea.
In America, however, it is unclear whether they are getting their money's worth. Perhaps, like the Japanese in the 80's, they will soon decide this is a bad investment. The reality of life in Washington is that many of the policies sought by Asian business executives -- including separating China's human-rights record from trade -- are generally also sought by American global giants like Boeing, I.B.M. and Bechtel.
Of course, American and Asian corporate interests often diverge. But for now, it's still hard to figure out exactly what the Asian executives are buying, beyond intelligence, some nice pictures for the office wall and a lot of publicity they now wish they didn't have.

HEADLINE: Popularity Brings a Huge Canadian Park to Crisis

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: BANFF NATIONAL PARK, Alberta

 BODY:
For the better part of a century, the majestic peaks and rugged valleys of this park in the Rocky Mountains have defined the romance of the Canadian West and the rigors of carving a modern nation out of the wilderness.
But times have changed. Now there is a Hard Rock Cafe in the park, on the corner of Banff Avenue and Caribou Street, and a few doors down from a restaurant that serves buffalo fondue is a Ralph Lauren shop. 
 In fact, the crowds of visitors are so thick that their meeting up with elk, moose and grizzly bears has become commonplace -- with danger for the tourists and the animals alike.
With three major ski areas, two communities, 5,600 hotel rooms, 1,300 businesses, the Canadian Pacific Railway, the four-lane Trans-Canada Highway, 27 holes of golf and over five million visitors a year, Banff National Park is more popular than ever. And more endangered.
An extensive study of Canada's oldest national park and best-known World Heritage Site concludes that there is a crisis at Banff so severe that unless something is done soon, it will cease to be a park.
That finding has set off alarm bells in Canada, where the park's bountiful natural beauty and unique place in history make it a touchstone of this country's national identity.
The study, conducted by a team of academics and independent scientists, found:
*Banff's back country is crisscrossed by eroding and heavily used trails.
*Native species of fish are being overwhelmed by stocked trout.
*The growing number of cars and other vehicles in the park is claiming the lives of an increasing number of elk, bears and other animals.
*Road building and other development has artificially divided the herds of animals, raising the problem of inbreeding.
When the study was released in October, its conclusions so alarmed Heritage Minister Sheila Copps that she ordered that no new land be made available for development in the park.
Ms. Copps is expected to take further action in late January and has left the door open for additional restrictions, possibly including limits on access to back-country areas.
"If we don't get our act together today, this park may not exist in 50 years," Ms. Copps said when the study was made public.
The lines have been drawn for a classic battle between use and conservation in one of Canada's most beloved icons. Like Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks in the United States, Banff stirs strong emotions, and like the natural grandeur that the parks contain, almost everything about the conflict is larger than life.
"What's happening at Banff is that we are losing a fundamental aspect of the Canadian soul," said Harvey Locke, past president of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, a citizens' organization. "It's being sold off to make money."
Brad J. Pierce, president of the Association for Mountain Parks, Protection and Enjoyment, also a citizens' group, countered: "This study was prepared by academics who live in an ivory tower. They have created a doomsday scenario for the park that is totally unjustified."
In the United States, the Interior Department recently restricted flights by helicopters and small planes over the Grand Canyon, harbingers of a long-contemplated strategy that would eventually all but eliminate cars from the Grand Canyon and other popular American parks.
From its inception, Banff was linked to tourism and to Canada's sense of nationhood as well.
A century ago, engineers pushing the Canadian Pacific Railway westward, completing a rail link that the province of British Columbia had made a condition for joining the new Canadian federation, decided to route the new line through the verdant Bow Valley.
When they discovered hot springs and inspired vistas in the valley, the railroad officials immediately recognized the area's potential for tourist development.
The railroaders pushed the Government to declare the hot springs a national park, like the new Yellowstone Park that had been set aside in the United States in 1871. In 1885, 10 square miles around the spring was designated as Canada's first national park, and the railroad built the Banff Springs Hotel to offer comfort in the midst of the wild.
The rest of the town of Banff, and to a lesser extent the nearby hamlet of Lake Louise, grew up around railroad hotels.
Completion of the Trans-Canada Highway in the mid-1960's, and the opening of an international airport in Calgary, about 75 miles to the east, made Banff easily accessible to global tourism.
Although Canada's National Parks Act provided for areas of outstanding natural beauty to be preserved for future generations, tourism took precedence under Prime Ministers Brian Mulroney and Jean Chretien.
To accommodate the boom in downhill skiing, the Banff Springs Hotel was renovated for year-round use. To keep the hotel full, its managers advertised heavily in Japan. The park now brings in $4.4 billion a year to the province of Alberta.
All this marketing success only sharpened the conflict between environment and economy. In 1994 a temporary ban on all new development was imposed while the independent study was conducted.
The study faulted Canada's national parks service, Parks Canada, for allowing too much development. Among its recommendations was one for fencing off the entire town of Banff and another suggesting tearing down several hotels.
Robert Page, dean of the faculty of environmental design at the University of Calgary and leader of the study, said runaway development on Banff Avenue and mile-long lines of recreational vehicles during the summer were only the most visible symptoms of distress.
"We're basically concerned with the character of the park," Mr. Page said. "If levels of development continue to expand at current rates, then characteristics expected in a national park, including the protection of wildlife, will no longer be there in a decade or two."
Although the town sites occupy less than 1 percent of the park's 2,564 square miles, they are in the warmer valley bottoms that wildlife also favor. Besides splitting the Bow Valley in two, the railroad and highway are creating genetically isolated groups of the moose and grizzly bears that avoid crossing the road and rarely use existing underpasses.
Suppressing natural fires, which is necessary to protect human visitors, has made existing forests grow older than they would have naturally, eliminating some species like the trembling aspen.
Rivers have been dammed to form a recreational lake, and an airstrip, an army cadet camp and a penned-in buffalo exhibition all disrupt the normal cycles of wildlife.
Mr. Locke said that by the time that Banff was officially incorporated as a town in 1990, more development had been proposed for Banff National Park, primarily in the town, then existed in all of Yellowstone National Park, which is 900 square miles larger than Banff.
But Banff's current Mayor, Ted Hart, said the community was surprised at the report's conclusions. "There is not a crisis here, in my opinion," he said. "Rather, there's a growing recognition by the people who have an interest here that we cannot let development get out of hand."
Mayor Hart said that before 1990, Parks Canada had approved some projects that the new town council would have blocked, including a three-story mall on the corner of Banff Avenue and Wolf Street.
The federal Government rejected the study's call to shut down hotels, though it limited the population of the town -- which now stands at 7,600 -- to 10,000. Mayor Hart said he doubted that the Government would order the town to be fenced, and he called the proposed back-country limits "ludicrous."
The town is developing its own growth plan, which will become part of the new management plan that Parks Canada must submit to Parliament in the spring.
Professor Page said Banff was so important now because the very nature of Canada as a nation was being threatened by continued separatist agitation in Quebec.
"After the flag and the national anthem, parks are the most important symbol of Canadian identity," he said. "They are part of what ties Canadians together."

HEADLINE: A Disney Cartoon Becomes a Morality Play for Paris

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 4

 BODY:
The French, who managed to find philosophy in the films of Jerry Lewis, are finding a powerful moral lesson in the animated film "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," one that even makes some of them willing to forgive Walt Disney Studios for taking such huge liberties with the Victor Hugo novel that inspired it.
The movie opened in France just as the Christmas shopping season began, months after its release in the United States, and remains the No. 2 box office draw in Paris. 
 Acres of advertising billboards and the marketing hoopla that flooded French department stores with dolls of the film's hero, Quasimodo, and miniatures of Notre Dame Cathedral no doubt helped make it so popular.
But it was an event from last August that gave a mere cartoon moral resonance here -- the dawn raid in which the police beat down the doors of the Roman Catholic Church of St.-Bernard de la Chapelle in Paris and hauled out more than 200 illegal immigrants who had sought asylum from France's tough expulsion laws.
In the Disney movie, the dark-skinned Gypsy Esmeralda seeks asylum in Notre Dame from the evil magistrate Frollo, transformed by the film from the troubled cathedral archdeacon of Hugo's "Notre Dame de Paris." In the novel she dies cruelly, but in the film she is saved by Quasimodo and the handsome Phoebus, the rebel captain of the guards. All three live happily ever after instead of dying, as both Quasimodo and Esmeralda did in the book.
Most critics here pay that no mind.
" 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' tells nothing less than the story of the illegal immigrants of Saint Bernard," wrote Sibylle Vincendon, an editor of the left-leaning daily Liberation, in a review that went on to compare Frollo's campaign against the Gypsies to the campaign promises of the far-right political leader Jean-Marie Le Pen to send all foreigners in France back to where they came from.
"It is enough to replace the word 'Gypsies' with 'immigrants,' and Frollo becomes a perfect Le Pen," Ms. Vincendon wrote, although there is a complete lack of physical resemblance between the avuncular-looking Mr. Le Pen and the sneering cartoon character.
"The theme of discrimination is explored the whole length of the film," wrote Le Monde, which found that Dumbo also suffered, in the 1941 Disney animated feature, for having ears that were too big.
As for the solidly middle-class conservative newspaper Le Figaro, it noted that while the Disney studios recast Victor Hugo's story, the storyboard was partly the work of two French cartoonists, Paul and Gaetan Brizzi. The Americans, Le Figaro said, had given a remarkably faithful rendition of Notre Dame itself, stained glass windows, statuary and all.
But it's the politics of a movie that interests the French more than anything else, and when the good captain of the guards whispers "Demand the right of asylum!" to Esmeralda, many have said that the asylum-seekers of St. Bernard spring immediately to mind.
"It is difficult not to think of the undocumented immigrants of St. Bernard when Frollo tries to sweep out the 'rabble,"' said Marie-Therese Delboulbes, another reviewer.
Asylum did not work for the immigrants, most of them Africans, in St. Bernard when riot police raided the church last Aug. 23, ending a seven-week occupation and a hunger strike by 10 of them that lasted just as long. Most of the immigrants had been living clandestinely in France for years, had families here and were demanding the right to stay on legally.
Since the raid, 101 of them have been promised legal papers, according to a spokesman for the group, Ababacar Diop, who said that only 13 had been deported until Friday, when authorities put one man and tried to force another onto a plane for Mali. A few others are being held for possible expulsion, but French courts freed the rest last summer, and many melted back into the immigrant underground.
How many illegal immigants there are in a country where more than 3.5 million foreigners live legally is a matter of dispute. But with unemployment at the highest level since World War II -- 12.7 percent in November, according to Government figures issued on Dec. 30 -- the conservative Government is under pressure to deal summarily with foreigners here illegally.
The Interior Ministry has thrown out nearly 12,000 foreigners without proper papers since the beginning of the year, and before its Christmas recess, the national legislature tightened up already strict immigration laws to allow the deportation of legal immigrants if they commit violent crimes.

HEADLINE: Still Missing: Arafat's Nod

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 4

 BODY:
It is three months now since the word went out from Jerusalem and Washington that an agreement on an Israeli withdrawal from most of Hebron was "imminent."
That, paradoxically, may be the reason it has taken so long. Because for Yasir Arafat, a signal that the other side was ready to deal was a signal to get to work. 
 Within weeks of the October summit meeting in Washington, at which the "intensive and urgent" new talks were begun on Hebron, the last West Bank city under Israeli occupation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went from haughtily predicting a quick deal on his own terms to the humiliating position of waiting day after day for a nod from the Palestinian leader to seal a deal that a growing number of his conservative Government regarded as a sellout.
In the end, Mr. Netanyahu's terms for withdrawal were almost the same as those proposed by the former Labor Government he succeeded in May. But now it was Mr. Arafat -- backed by the Palestinians, the Arabs and much of the world -- who took the haughty tone, telling the American mediator, Dennis Ross, "There are more burning issues than signing the agreement."
It was a bold and dangerous ploy. The "burning issues" Mr. Arafat spoke of were nothing less than a commitment from Mr. Netayahu to comply with far more difficult provisions of the Israeli-Palestinian agreements than Hebron -- namely, those calling for the staged withdrawal of the Israelis from much of the West Bank beyond the Palestinian towns.
Mr. Arafat's demand has put the entire Hebron agreement in danger with the Israeli Cabinet, where one minister after another has declared opposition to a deal that includes further troop withdrawals. Although a pullback from Hebron does not technically require Government approval, Mr. Netanyahu has pledged to bring his first Palestinian agreement before his coalition.
In failing to sign, Mr. Arafat was also defying the Americans. Mr. Ross had returned to Israel on Dec. 21 armed with letters from President Clinton and intent on moving past Hebron. And though he maintained his tactful public silence, his expression grew grimmer after every session with Mr. Arafat.
But then brinkmanship has always a primary tool of Mr. Arafat. In the Israeli-Palstinian equation, he has never had much military or economic leverage. He has had no constant international patron, no real skill for getting his message out over the news media, not even wholehearted support from the other Arabs.
What he does have is three decades of experience in exploiting the slightest advantage, and, unlike the ideologically divided Israelis, a clear notion of his goal -- a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Mr. Arafat has also had the advantage that it is Mr. Netanyahu who has been on trial, not he. The conservative Prime Minister was elected on a platform that sharply criticized the Israeli-Palestinian agreements of 1993 and 1995, known as the Oslo accords, and at the same time pledged to comply with them. Mr. Arafat, by contrast, was a certified partner in the peace.
Thus, both in Israel and abroad, everything Mr. Netanyahu did and said was scrutinized for a sign. And in the first six months he managed to please no one: neither his conservative constituents, who did not find a solid commitment to expand what they call the "Land of Israel," nor among supporters of the peace, who viewed with anxiety the growing frustration of the Palestinians and neighboring Arabs.
Mr. Netanyahu has argued, with justice, that the former Labor Government was at least as delinquent in complying with the Oslo accords. The very first Israeli obligation, the release of female Palestinian prisoners, has never been fulfilled, nor has a "safe passage" road to connect the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
But Mr. Arafat was largely prepared to close his eyes to these oversights in the faith that Prime Minister Shimon Peres, the Labor leader, shared his commitment. Mr. Netanyahu was given no such leeway, either by Mr. Arafat or the world.
In the explosion of violence that followed the opening last September by Israel of a new tourist tunnel exit near Muslim shrines in Jerusalem, it was Mr. Netanyahu who bore the brunt of international reproach. And when a soldier with a history of mental problems opened fire on the Arab market in Hebron this past week, the Israeli clamor for greater security for the handful of Jews in the city came to sound even hollower.
The impression it left was that it was not the Jews in Hebron who needed to be protected from the Palestinians, but vice versa.
The problem for Mr. Netanyahu, and for Mr. Peres and for Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister before him, was that, unlike the Palestinians, who know their goal, the divided Israelis have never shaped a consensus on theirs.
As The Jerusalem Post wrote in an editorial on Friday, Mr. Peres lost the election last May because he failed to define the limits of the peace. But Mr. Netanyahu has fallen into even greater political trouble, the newspaper wrote, "because he has not yet succeeded on either front -- neither in convincing the world that he is committed to peace nor convincing his voters that he will enforce" those limits to Israeli concessions.
Thus Hebron became not only a step on the way to peace, but a test of the entire peace. That was what Mr. Arafat meant when he told Mr. Ross that "there are more burning issues than signing the agreement."
Contrary to the new Israeli Government's perception that Mr. Arafat would be overjoyed once it gave way on Hebron, the Palestinian leader in fact soon demonstrated that he views the city not as an end in itself, but as a way station on the road to Palestinian statehood.
In any event, most of the city is already effectively under Mr. Arafat's control, since the Palestinian Authority dispenses most services, and the Palestinian police maintain a covert control -- and an effective one, as it proved when Mr. Arafat gave the word that Wednesday's shooting not turn into rioting. The Jews of Hebron never venture beyond its heavily guarded center any more.
Moreover, both the Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere have rallied behind Mr. Arafat's refusal to take the city without exacting some guarantees for the future. Their fear has been that after once Mr. Netanyahu withdrew from Hebron, there was no guarantee that he would, or could, go beyond.
The fear was heightened by Mr. Netanyahu's declaration last year that he preferred after Hebron to go directly to "final status" talks, which are to tackle the final shape of the Palestinian autonomy and critical issues including Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
To the Palestinians and Egyptians, this sounded as if Mr. Netanyahu wanted to avoid the three further withdrawals called for in the Oslo agreements. Though the exact parameters are not included in the agreement, the pullbacks were to begin last September and end next September, and the Palestinians hoped to gain control over as much as 85 percent of the West Bank.
In the end, probably before long, Mr. Arafat will give way, as will the Israeli Cabinet. For one thing, neither side can afford to defy the Americans to the end.
But perhaps more important, the past seven months have demonstrated that the Oslo process has its own inherent pace. Mr. Netanyahu has learned the price of trying to stall it, and Mr. Arafat has learned that the Israelis can only move so fast in their tortuous search for consensus.

HEADLINE: Papal Visit Signals Cuba's Eased Stand on Church

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: ROME, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Pope John Paul II's trip to Cuba, in the works for several months now, has at last acquired its missing key element: a firm date, now set for late January 1998, a senior Vatican official confirmed today.
Although several months later than originally expected, the importance of the fixed date -- first announced late Friday in Havana by Jaime Cardinal Ortega -- goes beyond a mere planning detail. It means that the Vatican has been able to pin down President Fidel Castro on an invitation that Cuba had issued several times, but never before on terms acceptable to the Pope. 
 With agreement on the date, the stage is set for a visit that could have dramatic consequences for the Catholic Church in Cuba and the island's Communist Government.
At a meeting at the Vatican in November, Pope John Paul II, the veteran anti-Communist crusader from Poland, and Mr. Castro, one of the world's last remaining Communist leaders, put their personal seals on negotiations that have been under way for several years.
In the years since the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, relations between the church and the Cuban Government have been improving incrementally, as Mr. Castro seeks new sources of support inside and outside the country. The Cuban church, which was repressed after the Communist revolution of 1959, has been allowed greater freedom to operate, although Cardinal Ortega and Vatican diplomats hope to use the papal visit to win still more rights.
In the meantime, Mr. Castro has found an ally in the Vatican in his campaign against the American trade embargo against Cuba. The Vatican, which almost always opposes international trade sanctions on the ground that they are more likely to harm ordinary people than the governments at which they are aimed, has been particularly outspoken in the case of Cuba. It has lashed out against the Helms-Burton law passed by Congress last year that would penalize foreign companies doing business with Cuba.
On Friday President Clinton renewed his suspension of parts of the law.
For Mr. Castro, the Pope's presence in Cuba still represents a gamble, as it was for Communist authorities in Poland in 1979 when John Paul made his first papal visit to his homeland. For the church, there is still a risk that the Communist authorities will try to limit the Pope's access to the population and to the press.
The official announcement from the Vatican today gave no further details on the trip, such as how long the Pope will be in Cuba, and where he will go besides the capital city, Havana. But diplomats here assume that the Vatican has been reassured that the visit will take place with few restrictions.
In Havana on Friday, Cardinal Ortega said the Pope had hoped to make the trip in 1997, as was originally announced after his meeting with Mr. Castro in November. But having decided that Cuba should not be a stop on the way to a long-planned papal visit to Brazil in October, it was decided to slide the date into 1998, he said.
Pope John Paul has three other trips planned for 1997: to the Czech Republic, Poland and Paris.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Though Luxury Tax Looms, Marlins' Spending Keeps Pace With Yankees'

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Not surprisingly, the Yankees hold the early lead in the luxury tax race. With only 17 players signed, they have already exceeded the $51 million threshold that could trigger the new tax next season. But the Yankees were expected to be there. The Florida Marlins were not, and they are right there with the Yankees.
Following a flurry of expensive free-agent signings, the Marlins have already qualified for a visit from baseball's new tax man. Based on current payrolls, the Atlanta Braves, the Cleveland Indians and the Baltimore Orioles are the other top contenders for the maximum contingent of five teams that will pay a luxury tax in its first season. 
 With $5 million in benefits costs included, the Yankees already have a payroll of $52.8 million and are followed by the Marlins at $51.2 million, the Braves' $50.9 million, the Indians' $49.4 million and the Orioles' $49 million. Just behind that group are the Toronto Blue Jays at $46.6 million and the Chicago White Sox at $44.8 million.
Although the lawyers who are drafting the final language have not settled on all of the details of the key components of baseball's new collective bargaining agreement, the basics of the luxury tax have been established. In the first year of the new economic system, the teams with the highest payrolls -- up to a maximum of five teams -- will be assessed a 35 percent tax on the portions of their payrolls over $51 million.
Until now, payrolls were calculated based on players' salaries for that particular year. Now the tax mavens will use the average annual value of each player's contract. And instead of using the 25 players on the major league roster, plus those on the disabled list, as of Aug. 31, the payroll people will use a club's 40-man roster throughout the season.
If the new method had been in effect last year, the Marlins would have had a $36.7 million payroll, which would have been 16th among the 28 teams. But that was before Alex Fernandez, Moises Alou and Bobby Bonilla added nearly $18 million to the Marlins' mix. Their current total of $51.2 million is for only 16 players.
Fortunately for their treasury, the Marlins are not expected to have any high-priced players among the other 24. The only unsigned starters, the middle infielders Luis Castillo and Edgar Renteria and catcher Charles Johnson, are not eligible for salary arbitration.
Andy Pettitte and Derek Jeter are not eligible either, but Bernie Williams is, meaning the Yankees can figure on adding more than $5 million to their payroll for their star center fielder, through arbitration or a negotiated contract. Last year, Williams won a $3 million salary in arbitration.
The Braves, whom the Marlins are trying to catch in the National League East, have signed only 11 players and face arbitration with Mark Wohlers, Javier Lopez and Ryan Klesko. The Indians, on the other hand, have signed virtually all of their front-line players and have no one eligible for arbitration among the 24 unsigned, younger players.
Mike Mussina's yet-to-be-determined salary will send the Orioles beyond the tax-triggering threshold. One of 27 unsigned Baltimore players, Mussina earned $4 million last season when he won 19 games.
The Texas Rangers are a team with a top-10 payroll that faces the addition of several sizeable salaries. With 13 players signed, the Rangers have a $39.4 million payroll, and they still must sign Ivan Rodriguez, Dean Palmer and Roger Pavlik, whose 1996 salaries totaled $7.25 million.
The White Sox, who have 11 signed players and a $44.8 million payroll, still must sign Roberto Hernandez and Wilson Alvarez, whose eligibility for salary arbitration will enable them to raise their combined $4.93 million income significantly.
Under the new system, the Yankees would have had a $66 million payroll last year. They will break $60 million this year, but do not figure to reach $66 million unless they trade for one or two high-salaried players during the season. They could, on the other hand, reduce their payroll by trading Cecil Fielder and the $7,237,500 average annual value of his contract.
No one wants to take on Fielder's contract, but the Yankees would be ahead of the tax game if they agreed to trade him and pay some portion of his salary. That average annual value plus 35 percent, an additional $2,533,125, would cost the Yankees just under $10 million.
Toronto included $5 million in its deal with the Mets to offset John Olerud's $6.5 million salary, but they will not be charged for the amount. Instead, Olerud's $6.5 million will be borne entirely by the Mets.
In effect, that kind of deal serves as a tax shelter for richer clubs. They can afford to pay part of a traded player's salary, and they get rid of the whole salary so it does not affect their tax standing. Next they'll be using cows.
 
 
 
Abbott Comes Up Short
 This is what has happened to Jim Abbott since he rejected a four-year, $16 million contract from the California Angels four years ago:
The Angels traded him to the Yankees, who two years later made him a free agent by not offering him a contract. The Chicago White Sox signed him, then traded him to the Angels, who signed him as a free agent.
Abbott pitched a no-hitter for the Yankees in 1993. Last season, he lost 18 games (winning twice), was sent back to the minor leagues for a few weeks and compiled a 7.48 earned run average, highest in the major leagues for any pitcher who pitched 100 or more innings.
His record for the four seasons is 33-48. His income for the four seasons totaled $10.1 million. Add in the remaining two years of his three-year contract, and the total of $15.3 million still falls short of what the Angels wanted to give him in 1992 but which he and his agent, Scott Boras, declined.
 
 
 
Explaining the DeShields Deal
 Seeking a second baseman, the St. Louis Cardinals acted quickly. Delino DeShields was among the first free agents signed in November, despite having had the worst of his seven seasons last year. In his first two years with Los Angeles he had slipped from his good seasons in Montreal, but then he declined even more, batting .224 last season.
"Look at his early years with Montreal," said Tony La Russa, the Cardinals' manager, in explaining the decision to sign DeShields. "He was one of the most exciting players in the league. As far as talent, he's a plus-plus guy at that position. He can win a lot of games with his tools.
"His experience in L.A. was not a good one. He admits it; it was there for everyone to see. He had a lot of aches and pains. They kept him from being the player he could be. You get in a rut and escalate in the wrong direction. We feel a change of scenery will help him. We were looking for someone at the top of the lineup who could ignite our offense. We feel he can do that."
DeShields did not ignite the Dodgers' offense. As a leadoff batter, he had a .273 on-base percentage, which according to Stats Inc. was by far the worst leadoff on-base percentage in the majors. Next lowest was Thomas Howard's .292 for Cincinnati.
 
 
 
The Arbitration Watch
 The traditional dates for salary arbitration have been altered slightly. Instead of filing from Jan. 5 through Jan. 15, the 101 eligible players may file from Jan. 7 through Jan. 17. As has been the practice in recent years, virtually everyone will wait until the last day. Players and clubs will exchange salary figures Jan. 21.
Among the most interesting figures to watch, barring negotiated settlements, will be those coming from Bernie Williams and the Yankees, Todd Hundley and the Mets, Mike Piazza and Eric Karros and Los Angeles, Mark Wohlers and Ryan Klesko and Atlanta, Mike Mussina and Baltimore and Ivan Rodriguez and Texas.
 
 
 
The Longevity Factor
 If Phil Niekro and Don Sutton, 300-game winners both, are not elected to the Hall of Fame when the results of the voting are announced tomorrow, voters will have to think twice before automatically voting for Eddie Murray when he becomes eligible.
The primary argument against Niekro and Sutton is that they were never dominant pitchers, but won 300 games through longevity. Murray is one of only three players (Willie Mays and Hank Aaron are the others) to hit 500 home runs and get 3,000 hits, but he has never hit 35 home runs or collected 200 hits in a season. His career highs are 33 and 186.
The only time Murray led a league in either category was in 1981, the strike-shortened season, when he tied three other players for the A.L. home run lead with 22.
Of the 15 players who have hit 500 home runs, he is the only one never to hit 35 in a season or be the sole league leader. Among the 20 players who have amassed 3,000 hits, only Cap Anson, Dave Winfield and Robin Yount join Murray in having had no 200-hit seasons. Other than Murray, only Winfield, Lou Brock and Eddie Collins never led a league in hits.

HEADLINE: Learning Gap Tied to Time In the System

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
New school performance reports have exposed a confounding puzzle about the failings of the New York City schools: why do children perform worse the longer they stay in the system?
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew says that overcrowded classrooms and ill-equipped schools are part of the reason that New York City students persistently lag those in the rest of the state, with gaps in reading scores that become apparent in the third grade and grow to double digits by high school. 
 Other education experts have their own ideas.
Some say it is money: high schools in the city receive less per student than junior high and elementary schools. Some blame the anonymity and stress of urban life. Some say it is the constant disruption of students arriving or leaving in the middle of the year, especially new immigrants with big adjustments to make.
Others say that city teachers need better training or that schools are too eager to embrace instructional fads, never finding a classroom method that works and sticking with it. Others say the problem has been the Chancellor's lack of control over elementary and junior high schools, something the State Legislature recently changed.
All these things could play a part.
But most important, school officials and education experts agree, the numbers provide clear evidence that educational disadvantages have a cumulative effect as children move on to higher grades.
"Certainly a youngster who can't read at the third grade is going to get the message pretty soon that school is not working for him or her," said Richard P. Mills, the State Education Commissioner, who released the school-by-school reports last Friday.
"It's desperately important for children to become fully literate, learn to read very early. These tests that show performance declining in the third grade are late in the game. The problem needs to be resolved early, in the first grade."
Whatever the causes, the effects are strikingly clear. New York City's third graders scored 3.4 percentage points lower on reading tests than third graders elsewhere in New York State, even when students' poverty level is factored out and children of similar backgrounds are compared. Sixth graders lagged further, scoring 6 percentage points lower on reading tests. And by high school, New York City students score almost 15 points lower in English.
Other numbers show New York City children have been behind for years. While third-grade math scores in the city have gone up in the last eight years, they still fall below scores in the rest of the state. And third-grade reading scores have gone down.
"There's kind of this traditional notion that kids have learned to read in the lower grades, that reading is a set of decoding skills," said Frank L. Smith, a professor of educational administration at Columbia University's Teachers College.
"And so in junior high school, the teachers teach content. If the kid has a science teacher, very often the teacher doesn't think it's his or her obligation to teach comprehension, but just to teach biology.
"English teachers believe an eighth grader should now be learning how to use figurative language, how to make inferences, but if nobody's teaching them how to read, that won't work."
At Louis D. Brandeis High School in Manhattan, only 1 percent of graduating students met the academic standards for a Regents diploma, rating Brandeis among the 10 worst schools in the state by that measure. The principal, Marlene Lazar, said the school received so many students who were unprepared for high school work that teachers were working against tremendous obstacles.
"You have to remember," Dr. Lazar said, "a school such as Brandeis unconditionally accepts everyone. We are a zoned neighborhood high school. There are no limits on who can come in."
Dr. Lazar said that only 20 percent of incoming ninth graders read at or above the grade level and fewer than that were at or above the grade level in math.
"Considering that, in four years, we have a 30 percent graduation rate," she said. "We know that aiming for a Regents diploma is a real stretch for many of these children."
Principals at several low-performing schools said they faced similar problems. They said their students not only came in ill prepared, but many came from other countries, often in the middle of a semester, forcing them to adjust to a new education system in classes that were already well into the year's curriculum.
In addition, in schools with immigrants from many different countries, there may be only one or two teachers who speak a given native language, making the adjustment for students more difficult.
"It's clear that the composition of any student body in New York is probably more complicated than anywhere else," Dr. Smith said. "We are a port of entry and we get people who may have very little tradition of schooling."
Robert Berne, the vice president for academic development at New York University, cautioned that the high school performance numbers might not accurately reflect the achievement of every student in a high school because they sometimes took the Regents exams in different grades or not at all. He also said it was harder to factor out the effects of poverty on the high school level since fewer students chose free school lunches, the best measure of poverty in the system.
But he said that it was clear from the numbers that student performance deteriorated steadily as students got older. One factor, he said, could be that middle schools and junior high schools, already faced with students who are at a fragile age, were beset with even more difficulties in New York City.
"It's the most difficult age for kids, both in terms of maturity and just in terms of teaching and learning," Mr. Berne said. "Educationally, we've gone back and forth between K through 8, 6 through 7, 6 through 8. We never really got ourselves set."
Many experts said that better elementary schools would help mitigate some of the problems in the upper grades.
Principals of several elementary schools said it was a struggle to make sure that instruction was consistent within and among schools, so that fourth-grade classes set the stage for what is taught in fifth grade, even if a child transfers from one school to another.
"Our approach to reading is based far more on fad and fancy than it is on empirical data which really would reflect substantial approaches that work or do not work," said Lorraine Skeen, the principal of Public School 171 in East Harlem, where students performed well on the tests. Ms. Skeen said her school tried to avoid such fads but said there was too great a tendency in many schools to latch on to the latest reading or math teaching method without knowing its effectiveness.
"We develop new teaching approaches that sound very appealing but don't work," Ms. Skeen said. "Without any testing at all to see if these methodologies work, we adopt them systemwide. We lose credibility with teachers. Too many radical changes just really confuse children. Children like to know what's going on."
Sheila Hurdle, the principal of P.S. 113 in Harlem, said more consistency in curriculum and instruction could help her school. P.S. 113 ranked near the bottom in third-grade reading scores, when the scores were presented without adjusting for the low income of its students. The school performed better in third-grade math.
"We've left a lot up to individual teachers," said Ms. Hurdle, who said that the school had recently begun trying to standardize classes and curriculum by, for example, providing remedial reading programs and reading help in the lower grades.
Mr. Mills, who has made a crusade of raising student standards across the state, said the State Legislature's recent move to give the Chancellor control over who runs elementary and junior high schools would help increase consistency in the classroom.
"The system just wasn't put together right," Mr. Mills said. "To boost reading performance, for example, you need to have a chain. Where the Chancellor talks about it and expects the superintendents and local boards to do it, and expects the principals to talk about it, and expects there to be a system-wide set of standards and system-wide direction in curriculum -- all of that has to be in place. And it hasn't been."

HEADLINE: Clinton and G.O.P. Are Unlikely To seek Medicare Premium Rise

BYLINE: ByBy ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Administration officials say President Clinton has made a significant decision about budget strategy for 1997: he will not propose any increase in costs for Medicare beneficiaries, but will try to cut back payments to hospitals, doctors and others who provide health care to the elderly.
Congressional Republicans say they too are unlikely to seek any increase in premiums or other charges for beneficiaries because, in last year's elections, they were pummeled by Democrats for having supported such proposals. 
 But another battle is looming this year over Mr. Clinton's proposal to solve some of Medicare's most conspicuous financial problems by shifting the cost of home health care from one account to another. The home health benefit is the fastest growing component of Medicare.
Mr. Clinton plans to send his budget to Congress early next month. If there is no change in current law, the Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills will, by his estimate, run out of money in 2001. That is 10 years before the first baby boomers reach 65, the age of eligibility for Medicare.
A bipartisan group of experts summoned to the White House recently to advise the President's budget director, Franklin D. Raines, said Mr. Clinton's home health care proposal -- one of his main proposals to keep the trust fund afloat -- was little more than a bookkeeping gimmick.
Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, most of the cost of home health care for the elderly or disabled would be shifted from the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to a separate Medicare account with unlimited access to general revenue.
Medicare spending on home health services has exploded in recent years, exceeding $18 billion and accounting for nearly 10 percent of Medicare benefit payments in 1996. Mr. Clinton wants to exclude these costs from the computation of Medicare premiums, so beneficiaries will not have to absorb the cost.
When Mr. Clinton suggested a similar change last year, Republicans said it was not a serious proposal. After the November elections, they told him that they wanted a good-faith gesture on the budget, and that a repeat of his earlier recommendations would not do the trick.
In an interview on Thursday, Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who oversees Medicare as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: "We're looking for a signal from the President as to how real his budget will be. I want to work with him on a bipartisan basis, but this proposal on home health care is a shell game, an artificial solution. It may help the trust fund, but creates enormous problems in the general Treasury and for future generations."
Among the experts who met recently with Franklin D. Raines, the budget director for the Clinton Administration, were Charles L. Schultze, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Jimmy Carter; two former directors of the Congressional Budget Office, Rudolph G. Penner and Robert D. Reischauer, and Dan L. Crippen, a White House aide under President Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Schultze said the home health care proposal was "accounting shenanigans," and added: "It doesn't save the Government any money. It doesn't save any money for the Medicare program. It just shifts costs out of the hospital trust fund." Mr. Reischauer and Mr. Penner called it a "gimmick."
White House officials say that because many users of home health services have not been hospitalized recently, there is no reason for the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to pay for those services. Increasingly, they say, Medicare's home health benefit is used by homebound people who have chronic illnesses or need long-term care for other reasons.
Medicare finances health care for 38 million people who are elderly or disabled. Its costs grew 10 percent a year in the last decade, reaching $191 billion in 1996.
Many Republicans and health policy experts say Medicare beneficiaries should pay more for their care, through premiums, deductibles or co-insurance, because such payments would generate revenue and curb the unnecessary use of services.
Chris Jennings, a White House aide who coordinates health policy for President Clinton, summarized the conventional wisdom: "In the eyes of a lot of people, we are not real men unless we hit beneficiaries with significant increases in out-of-pocket costs." But Administration officials note that the elderly already spend 21 percent of their family income, on average, for health care.
Medicare was a central issue in the Presidential election, as Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore asserted that the Republicans' budget plan could force hundreds of hospitals to close. Now Mr. Clinton must explain why his plan to balance the budget will not have similar effects.
Bruce C. Vladeck, who heads the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, defended the decision to seek big savings from health care providers. Medicare, Mr. Vladeck said, has been less aggressive than private insurers in demanding discounts.
"There are now many markets for many services in which Medicare is paying more than the most effective private purchasers." he said. "That is very hard to defend or justify."
Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, said "it was pretty clear from last year's election campaign that most, if not all, of the savings in Medicare" would come from hospitals, doctors, nursing homes and suppliers of medical equipment. The savings sought by Congress and the President are so large, Mr. Pollack said, that hospitals and doctors may face "real cuts, not just a reduction in the rate of increase," in their Medicare payments.
He said such cuts were inevitable as long as Congress focused on Medicare's immediate fiscal problems rather than on the long-term changes needed to finance the program for the baby boom generation. The hospital association espouses the idea of "shared responsibility," meaning that beneficiaries, especially those with higher incomes, should pay more, Mr. Pollack said.
Some lawmakers have suggested that the Government increase Medicare premiums for beneficiaries with incomes above a certain level, like $75,000 a year. But Marilyn Moon, an economist at the Urban Institute who is a public trustee of the Medicare trust fund, said such proposals would not raise much revenue because they would affect relatively few people. Census Bureau data show that fewer than 7 percent of the elderly have household incomes above $75,000 a year.
President Clinton, like many Republicans, wants to encourage the use of health maintenance organizations, in the hope that they will save money for Medicare. Nearly five million Medicare beneficiaries are in H.M.O.'s, and enrollment is growing by more than 80,000 a month.
But a summary of the President's budget proposal says the use of H.M.O.'s "does not reduce Medicare costs" today because the Government's method of calculating payments is flawed. Medicare officials said they believed that their payments to H.M.O.'s were 5 percent to 7 percent too high, and they want Congress to correct the formula to eliminate such overpayments.
H.M.O.'s give comprehensive care for a fixed monthly premium. For each Medicare beneficiary in an H.M.O., the Government pays roughly 95 percent of the average cost for a patient in the traditional Medicare program. But Federal officials said that Medicare patients in H.M.O.'s tended to be healthier than the average beneficiary and therefore had lower medical expenses.
H.M.O. executives disagree. They say many of their elderly members have chronic illnesses. And, they say, if the Government cuts Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s, it will reduce their ability to offer prescription drug coverage and other benefits that attract new members.

HEADLINE: RUSSIA THWARTING U.S. BID TO REMOVE A NUCLEAR CACHE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia

 BODY:
The United States has been making a quiet effort to have a cache of nuclear material moved out of this volatile region of the former Soviet Union, according to American and Georgian officials.
But the operation to get the material out of Georgia, which is part of a broader program to stem the theft of nuclear bomb ingredients from Russia and its neighbors, has thus far been thwarted by months of diplomatic impasse between Russia and the United States. 
 The effort, which was intended to be a model of three-way cooperation, has been the subject of intense negotiations between senior American and Russian officials for much of the last year. The United States had wanted to keep the operation secret, but Georgian officials now openly discuss their predicament.
"Indeed we have several kilograms of uranium," President Eduard A. Shevardnadze of Georgia acknowledged in a recent interview. "We need to get rid of it. But we can't do it independently," he said, alluding to financial and technical constraints.
Stored in an obsolete nuclear reactor outside Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, the highly enriched uranium and spent reactor fuel would provide an aspiring nuclear power with a significant amount of the material needed to make a nuclear bomb.
The cache has been of growing concern to American officials, who fear it is vulnerable to theft by Iranian agents, terrorists from the neighboring secessionist Russian republic of Chechnya or arms traffickers.
Georgian officials disclosed here that the material was virtually unguarded in the early 1990's, when war engulfed this newly independent Caucasian nation.
Roving bands of militiamen approached the reactor during that time. But officials said the marauders were apparently more interested in stealing cars than uranium.
"During the years of civil war in Georgia," said Peter Mamradze, "the physicists at the institute had many sleepless nights. They were afraid some paramilitary group would come and take it away." Mr. Mamradze, a physicist by training, is Mr. Shevardnadze's chief of staff.
It was just such a scenario that prompted American officials to seek tighter control over the hundreds of nuclear laboratories, power plants and institutes spread throughout the former Soviet Union. During the cold war, the Soviet Union produced about 1,300 tons of highly enriched uranium, Western analysts estimate, and much of it remains scattered widely over the former Soviet republics in poorly guarded sites.
In recent years, several middlemen peddling nuclear material stolen from the former Soviet Union have been arrested in Europe. But there has been no confirmed case of countries or terrorist groups obtaining the ingredients for a bomb through theft.
The United States and Russia have publicly embraced the goal of controlling what some experts term "loose nukes." At a meeting last April in Moscow, Western leaders and President Boris N. Yeltsin pledged to work together to stem trafficking in nuclear materials.
[Such talks, in Washington's official view, have borne fruit.
[In a statement late Saturday, Lynn E. Davis, Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs, said: "The United States Government has been fully successful in its efforts to insure that the Georgian H.E.U., or highly enriched uranium, has not fallen into the wrong hands. There is still more work to do, and we will continue to engage closely with Russia and Georgia to find a long-term solution by moving this material to a secure facility in Russia." Russia refuses to accept the fuel.]
 But the Georgian reactor is a case study in how good intentions can be snarled by bureaucratic politics, foreign policy concerns and environmental regulations.

Crumbling Legacy Of an Atomic Past
 Housed in a weather-beaten building a 20-minute drive from Tbilisi, Georgia's reactor is an eerie and decrepit monument to the lost days of Soviet science, when vast state resources were channeled into nuclear research.
On its inauguration in 1959, this research reactor was the pride of Georgia's Institute of Physics. Similar ones were built in other parts of the Soviet Union, in Bulgaria and in Iraq. Dr. Shucury Abramidze, the head of the institute's Center for Applied Research, which oversees the reactor, said he led the team that established the Iraqi complex.
After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, Georgia's reactor was closed for safety improvements. The temporary shutdown became permanent after environmentalists complained and the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving Georgia with a troubling legacy.
Like other reactors of its generation, Georgia's used highly enriched uranium, a tempting target for would-be nuclear powers or terrorists hoping to build a bomb. Even the reactor's spent fuel, which was stored in a cooling pond, posed a danger, because such material can be refined into bomb ingredients.
The physics institute has never had any desire to retain the nuclear material, its director, Giorgi Kharadze, said in an interview.
But Mr. Kharadze, who greeted visitors wearing a winter coat in an office heated by a small kerosene stove, said Georgia's economic collapse had forced his country to seek outside help for disposal.
During the Soviet era, Georgia periodically sent its spent fuel to a Russian nuclear center at Chelyabinsk, in the Ural Mountains. The last trainload -- 44 rod-shaped pieces of spent fuel -- left for the center in March 1991.
Five extra rod-shaped pieces containing spent fuel could not be accommodated on the train and were left in the reactor's cooling pond, a minor complication at the time that emerged as a major headache.
A few months later, the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving the institute with the five rods, or nearly two pounds of spent fuel, and, more worrisome, an additional 22 pounds of highly enriched uraninum.
Georgia fell into civil war, and after the fighting eased by 1994, the institute began again to whittle down its supply. It sent about 11 pounds of highly enriched uranium to Uzbekistan, which has a similar reactor. The material was shipped in August 1995 at a cost of about $6,000.
That still left Georgia with about 9.5 pounds of highly enriched uranium and 2 pounds of spent fuel.
Estimates vary about how much is needed to make a nuclear bomb; it depends on the skills of the bomb maker and the intended size of the explosion. One American official said the material left in Georgia, while substantial, would not be enough to make a bomb. But some private experts said a proficient scientist could use it to do so.
"I would worry if it was in the hands of Iran or Iraq," said Thomas B. Cochran, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private research group. "They could amass a technically competent scientific team to fabricate a weapon with a yield of a kiloton." A kiloton is the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT.
 
'Bad Neighborhood' For a Nuclear Cache
Although the instability in Georgia had subsided, last year the cache of nuclear fuel began to attract the attention of American officials, who worried about its proximity to Chechnya and Iran. Washington has asserted that Iran is determined to produce nuclear weapons.
"The problem was basically one of physical security," an American official said. "The fuel was located in a bad neighborhood."
But as concerned as American experts were, arranging the removal of the uranium and spent fuel would prove a long and painful diplomatic exercise.
In January 1996, specialists at the United States Energy Department sent the White House a classified letter proposing a simple solution: Strike a deal with the Georgians and move the highly enriched uranium to the United States.
There was a precedent for such a move, and it was a successful one. In 1994, the United States had carried out "Operation Sapphire," hauling more than half a ton of bomb-grade uranium from Kazakstan to the nuclear complex at Oak Ridge, Tenn.
The American envoy to Georgia, William H. Courtney, was the perfect man to oversee such an operation. He had served as Ambassador to Kazakstan during Sapphire.
The Energy Department's proposal left unresolved the issue of what to do with Georgia's spent reactor fuel. Although the United States has the technology to handle such material, officials said the Department of Energy was afraid that accepting it would mean protests and lawsuits from environmentalists.
And there were foreign policy concerns. The State Department and the White House, with an eye on the broader relationship with the Russians, argued that Moscow should be given the chance to resolve the problem itself. By the spring of last year, American officials decided to ask Russia to accept all of the spent fuel and enriched uranium.
Under the arrangement, the United States would pay Georgia about $100,000 for the material -- its market value, American officials calculated.
 
Missed Meetings, Sluggish Progress
By all accounts, however, the diplomacy with Moscow was an exercise in frustration. In early summer, American officials received the first indications that the Russians were not so eager to tackle the problem.
A meeting was arranged in Tbilisi for American, Georgian and Russian experts, but the Russians did not show up. Moscow ascribed this to a simple mix-up.
Higher-level efforts were no more successful.
The Georgian reactor was discussed when Vice President Al Gore and other senior Administration officials visited Moscow in July for talks with the Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomydrin. Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy, Viktor N. Mikhailov, assured his American counterparts then that Russia would take the cache of Georgian fuel in August.
But August came and went, and instead of taking the nuclear material the Russians voiced new concerns.
At first, they insisted that the canisters to be used for transporting the fuel to Russia had to be approved by Russian nuclear regulators. Washington offered to supply the canisters. The Russians rejected that offer and dropped the issue. Then Moscow voiced a concern about money, expressing reluctance to advance any of the costs of moving the fuel. Eager to carry out the operation, Thomas R. Pickering spent his last week as American Ambassador to Russia in secret negotiations on a compromise.
Eventually, officials said, a deal appeared to have been reached. America would advance Russia $1 million, to be returned minus any fees paid to Georgia for packing and handling the shipment.
Once again, the operation hit a roadblock. Russian officials balked at accepting the spent fuel, saying they had their own environmental laws to worry about.
The officials said that under Russian law, spent fuel taken from foreign countries must be reprocessed and the waste returned to the nation it came from.
Even though the reactor had been built by the Soviet Union and its fuel supplied by the Soviets, the officials noted that Georgia was now a foreign country. The waste would therefore have to be returned there after reprocessing.
That proposal was doomed from the outset. As Mr. Kharadze, the director of the physics institute, pointed out, Georgia has no place to store such nuclear debris safely.
American officials said they hoped this issue would ultimately be finessed by having the Georgians sign over legal ownership of the material to Russia.
During the course of the three-way negotiations, the United States sent specialists to Georgia to improve the security of the reactors. An alarm system, television surveillance cameras and a brick barrier were installed to protect the highly enriched uranium.
Reactor guards now work in 24-hour shifts. They are armed but are not always at the highest state of vigilance. A foreign visitor who recently quizzed them about their defenses and schedules was never asked to identify himself. Instead, he was asked for matches.
American officials acknowledged that the new precautions were only a stopgap and said the only remedy was removal of the cache.
A year after Washington began to focus on the Georgia reactor, when or how that will happen remains unclear. The Clinton Adminstration, which says it has put control of nuclear proliferation at the top of its agenda, is still hoping to persuade the Russians to take the material.
"It has been a more deliberate, touch-all-the-bases approach," one frustrated American official said. "The whole thing has been very bureaucratic."

HEADLINE: A Star in His Own Right Falls From Giuliani's Universe;
Time Warner Official Breaks With the Mayor

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
In the old days, they had a relationship born of politics and mutual self-interest that grew into something resembling friendship. There were small dinners at Gracie Mansion, and one-on-one lunches in the Mayor's private dining room at City Hall. Richard D. Parsons, the schmoozy president of Time Warner, had, after all, known Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for more than two decades, from their days as ambitious young Washington lawyers -- Mr. Giuliani worked at the Justice Department, Mr. Parsons at Gerald Ford's White House -- through their years at the same New York law firm.
By 1993, Mr. Parsons had become Mr. Giuliani's most prominent black supporter, and had turned down an offer to be deputy mayor. Mr. Parsons instead chose to be an economic adviser to the friend he admired as "a lawyer's lawyer" who was "not a typical pol." 
 But now, as Mr. Giuliani's 1997 re-election campaign begins, the two old friends are not speaking. The Mayor is heading into the race without Mr. Parsons, who says he is "disappointed" in the Mayor and fed up with his staff.
"The Mayor doesn't necessarily surround himself with the creme de la creme," Mr. Parsons said in an interview in his Time Warner aerie 29 floors above midtown Manhattan. "They're well-meaning, but I'm not sure terribly long on judgment. It's kind of like if the Mayor says, 'Hey, let's all drink the Kool-Aid,' they all go 'bottoms up.' "
The source of the fight is the October war between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Parsons's employer, Time Warner, whose chieftains became enraged when Mr. Giuliani tried to force Time Warner to add the new 24-hour Fox News Channel to Time Warner's New York City cable line-up. Mr. Parsons was the conciliator in the middle who tried but failed to make peace. By Oct. 11, when the city refused to back down, Mr. Parsons quit in protest as chairman of the city's Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Giuliani had not called him once during the crisis, and sent word through his press secretary that he would not speak about him now. Neither would anyone in Mr. Giuliani's inner circle.
But Mr. Parsons is far more than the latest political exile of a Mayor well known for turning out a police commissioner and schools chancellor. He is also a Rockefeller Republican who has had one of the more unlikely routes to success, from the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn to the University of Hawaii to the legal staff of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and a home, for a time, on the Rockefellers' Pocantico Hills estate. Now he is the much-in-demand man about town, over-extended by his own admission on charity committees and corporate boards, a master of the Rolodex who says he is "still learning the ropes" at Time Warner while he oversees no less than the economic revival of Harlem as chairman of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone.
"Trying to fit everything in and not doing everything badly is an issue," he said.
Mr. Parsons, 48, has friends among the city's black financial elite -- he shoots clay pigeons with Kenneth Chenault, a vice-chairman of American Express, and John Utendahl, the founder of Utendahl Capital Partners -- but he is often the only African-American at corporate board meetings and East Side dinners. Although he says he was by choice not especially visible during Mr. Giuliani's 1993 race because "I didn't want to be positioned as the Mayor's black guy," he insists that he never feels the stresses of other high-level black professionals who work in a white corporate world.
To illustrate, he tells a story he has often told before, about a white liberal woman who asked him in the 1960's to describe himself.
"And I started by saying, 'Well, I'm a lawyer,' and she said, 'Wrong! The defining quality for you is that you're black. And you refuse to acknowledge that.' " Mr. Parsons shrugged, crediting his father, who was an electrical technician at Sperry Rand on Long Island, for his own views.
"I can remember him saying to me when we were talking about the slogan 'I'm black and I'm proud,' 'Now Richard, wouldn't it strike you as odd if somebody said, 'I'm Irish and I'm proud?' I said, 'Well, people do say that.' He said, 'Yeah, but think about that. If you're going to take pride in anything, take pride in something you've accomplished. Don't take pride in an accident of birth.' So, hey, what can I say? For a lot of people, race is a defining issue. It just isn't for me . . . It is, it is" -- he pauses -- "like air. It's like height. I have other things that I'm focused on."

A Top Position In a Complex Hierarchy
The neurocenter of Time Warner, near the top of a 51st Street building that people call 75 Rock, is a silent retreat of white orchids, photographs by Henri Cartier Bresson and a corporate bathroom well-stocked with pencils and notepads. Mr. Parsons, who made $3 million in salary and bonuses in 1995, his first year as president of the company, has a large corner office up there, with Oriental carpets, a basket of fresh fruit and a view uptown. "I have just a slice of Central Park," he said.
Mr. Parsons stands a commanding 6 feet 4 inches but turns out to be a relaxed presence, a corporate executive with the loose, regular-guy manners of the college fraternity social chairman he once was. "I was the worst college student in the history of the University of Hawaii," he said, with perverse pride.
Mr. Parsons's job description at Time Warner is to be the junior partner to Gerald M. Levin, the chairman and chief executive, helping to oversee company strategy and relations between its cable, entertainment and publishing divisions. But Time Warner's powerful division heads report to Mr. Levin, not to Mr. Parsons. Complicating the hierarchy is Ted Turner, who in the merger of CNN and Time Warner became the Time Warner vice chairman, answering to Mr. Levin but not to Mr. Parsons, and intent on playing a large role in his new job.
Mr. Parsons knows that people speculate about the reasons for his own appointment. "Some people would say Dick's there because he's the most talented guy in all of America," he said. "Some people say Dick's there because they needed a black guy. And some people would say Dick's there because he has colossal luck." Mr. Levin says he chose Mr. Parsons, the former chairman of Dime Savings Bank, and a member of the Time Warner board since 1990, because of his judgment, presence and easy style.
"I can be very aggressive," Mr. Levin said. "Dick is a good antidote to that."
Mr. Parsons was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant, of what he calls middle-class roots. "Now we would be part of the lower middle class," he said. When he was 7, he moved to the South Ozone Park section of Queens, where he went to the New York City public schools of the 1950's. He says he got a fine education, was wait-listed by Princeton, and went instead to the University of Hawaii, which he had applied to as a lark.
"I had a wonderful time," he said. It took a fellow student, Laura Bush, to focus him, and they were married in Hawaii in 1968. "I sort of settled down," Mr. Parsons said. "The old wife said, 'Enough of this foolishness.' "
Mr. Parsons went on to Albany Law School in New York, where the former party giver finished first in his class, and then first among the 3,600 lawyers taking the state bar exam in 1971. As he was graduating, Mr. Parsons presented himself at the office of Governor Rockefeller, staffed by the brightest from Harvard and Yale. He says he had no particular politics at the time -- he just wanted the job.
"I looked at his resume and saw that he'd gone to the University of Hawaii, and that was sort of bizarre," recalled Robert R. Douglass, then the Governor's counsel. "But he had superb grades, and he was very, very smart." Nelson Rockefeller's office was an important training ground for talented young blacks of the era, and Mr. Parsons soon had a job as one of Mr. Rockefeller's eight assistant counsels. Within a year, he had become what he calls a moderate Republican -- a "fiscal conservative" and "social liberal" who did not believe in the "welfare mentality" of the Democrats. "The way you deal with social inequity is not by giving people things," he said.

Off to Washington With Mr. Rockefeller
Mr. Rockefeller took Mr. Parsons to Washington when he became Vice President in 1974, then lent his protege to the White House, where Mr. Parsons became general counsel of what was then called the Domestic Council, a policymaking group. Mr. Parsons worked almost daily with Harold R. Tyler Jr., the Deputy Attorney General, whose 29-year-old assistant was a bright star from Manhattan: Rudy Giuliani, the former assistant United States Attorney whose police corruption cases yielded the book and movie "Prince of the City."
Mr. Parsons and Mr. Giuliani quickly established a good professional relationship. "At that point in time, we didn't 'hang,' as they say," Mr. Parsons recalled. But in 1977, after Jimmy Carter won the presidency, Mr. Tyler brought them both into his law firm, Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler. They worked on cases together, and became friends.
"Rudy would always work late, and then afterward he'd collect up anybody who was still at the office and we'd go out for dinner," Mr. Parsons said. "He was a party guy."
Mr. Giuliani's best friend at the firm was Michael B. Mukasey, now a Federal judge, but Mr. Parsons describes his own relationship with Mr. Giuliani as "fairly close." If the two didn't discuss personal matters -- "Guys don't talk about that stuff," Mr. Parsons said -- they did go to Yankee games.
Soon after arriving in New York, Mr. Parsons had moved to Briarcliff Manor in Westchester, where he and his wife were raising three children -- a responsibility that he says allowed him to keep pace with his friend Rudy's social schedule only "some of the time." Mr. Parsons had remained close to the Rockefellers, who had provided him with a house on the Pocantico Hills estate as he settled in New York.
"It was like living in Disneyland," Mr. Parsons said. (In a twist of fate, Mr. Parsons's grandfather had lived there too, as the estate's head groundskeeper.) Today, Mr. Parsons is still close to the family.
"He's a very respected adviser and counselor," said David Rockefeller, Nelson Rockefeller's brother. "All generations in the family feel enthusiastic about him."

A Hope to Revive A Broken Friendship
Mr. Giuliani left New York to become the associate attorney general in Ronald Reagan's Justice Department in 1981, but by 1989 he and Mr. Parsons had teamed up again for Mr. Giuliani's first run for mayor -- even though Mr. Parsons, by now the president of Dime Savings Bank, had supported Ronald Lauder, his friend and client, in the Republican primary.
"Whether he understood or not, people put things in the past behind them," Mr. Parsons said. "He may have been upset but he never said anything to me."
By late 1993, Mr. Parsons was running Mr. Giuliani's transition team, but over breakfast one morning turned down his friend's offer to be a deputy mayor in charge of fiscal affairs.
"It isn't the right time for me," he told Mr. Giuliani. At the time, Mr. Parsons was making $750,000 a year at Dime, and was just coming out of a long climb in bringing the bank to solvency.
Today, he is hopeful that his breach with Mr. Giuliani can be mended. "This is a very bright, thoughtful and interesting person, particularly one on one," Mr. Parsons said.
Mr. Parsons pointed out that there are many kinds of friendships, and that the most sacred are those with old classmates who would not necessarily be the stars of his Rolodex.
"There's nothing we want out of each other except companionship," he said. "But with most other people I know, that's not the basis of the friendship. There is a reciprocity -- I can do things for you, you can do things for me. Those are different kinds of relationships. They're easier to abandon, and they're easier to glue together."
His friend Rudy, Mr. Parsons said, "did what he thought he had to do."

HEADLINE: Flat-Tax Plan Wouldn't Let Investors Off Hook;
Still Progressive

 BODY:
To the Editor:
When compared with the base-broadening reforms of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the "expanding loopholes" cited in the Dec. 29 Week in Review article may not be worth mentioning. 
 You say that tax shelters are chipping away at the principle that the American tax system should be progressive. However, such loopholes were common planning techniques for all the years featured in your graphic showing tax progressivity as a percentage of income both before and after the 1986 reform.
As for progressivity in real terms, reference to the 1995 tax tables show that, comparing incomes of $35,000 and $350,000, the tax borne by the $35,000 income (family of four, standard deduction) is about $2,800, while that of the $350,000 income (family of four, $35,000 itemized deductions) is about $101,000 (36 times as much). (This calculation disregards Social Security and Medicare taxes, for which future benefits are received.)
As a tax lawyer for 28 years, I would be aware of any legitimate means of reducing that burden, and I am not.
Despite deferred compensation arrangements, deferred securities sales and the few remaining techniques to reduce estate taxes, the system is still progressive for incomes in the mid-six figures.
If you are looking for reasons for growing economic inequality, blaming the tax system is unjustified.

Your cartoon treatment of Peter G. Peterson's warnings about the American economy (Week in Review, Dec. 29) shows a callousness that reflects more on your newspaper than on Mr. Peterson's message.

HEADLINE: College and Money;
British Students Face Loss of Free Tuition

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL; Sarah Lyall reports for The New York Times from London.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Free tuition for all university undergraduates has long been one of the underlying assumptions of British life, as much so as free health care. But with more students attending college at the same time as Government aid per student is declining in real terms, it is becoming more likely that in the future, college students may well have to pay for at least part of their education.
 "Things have come to a head," said Ted Nield, a spokesman for the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom, which represents the top officials of 106 universities throughout Britain. "We're going through the throes of impressing on people that the Government just can't foot the bill any longer, so you're probably going to have to pay for part of your education yourself." 
 No overall change is likely to come in the next couple of school years, in part because Britain is facing a general election sometime before next May, and neither political party wants to commit itself to a particular education budget that might force the universities to charge tuition. An independent panel, led by Sir Ron Dearing, an authority on educational issues, is studying the tuition issue and is expected to make its report in late summer, but the writing already seems to be on the wall.
To Americans resigned to paying close to $30,000 for a year at an Ivy League institution, the British system seems like a throwback to an old-style socialist state. Currently, all college students who are from Britain or another European Union country are awarded free tuition at any British school for which they meet admittance requirements. The Government also pays maintenance grants directly to students for living expenses, based on need; the amount depends on such factors as where the students are enrolled and whether or not they live at home. The most any student gets is 2,340 (the equivalent of $3,740) a year. If the fees are imposed, it is unclear how much money a British student would have to pay.
About 30 to 40 percent of British university students are awarded the full maintenance grant for which they are eligible, said Iain Crawford, a member of the London School of Economics' education funding research team. But many students find that the grants, which are meant to cover room, board, books and all miscellaneous living expenses, are not enough to account for even basic costs. As a result, they're forced to do what students in the United States have long done: take out interest-free student loans, albeit for much smaller sums than their American counterparts.
"The grant has been frozen for several years," said Liz Llewellyn, a spokeswoman for the National Union of Students. "Already some students are leaving university with debts of 6,000 (nearly $10,000)."
Mr. Crawford agreed. "The package is about 25 percent lower than the absolute bare minimum of expense," he said.
At the same time, universities are increasingly hard pressed to meet all their own costs with the Government-allotted tuition money. The money is paid to the universities on a per-student basis, according to a complicated funding formula that, for example, pays out more for pre-med students and less for liberal-arts students.
According to figures provided by the vice chancellors' committee, in the last school year, the average amount paid by the Government for each student was $7,195, far less than the universities say they need.
Since the 1988-89 school year, the number of students attending universities has increased dramatically, to 1.7 million from 830,000 students. (The Government made an effort to increase the number of students by adding schools and expanding existing schools.) But at the same time, Mr. Nield said, per-student Government funding has decreased by 30 percent in real terms, in large part because Government funding -- in the current fiscal year, its entire higher-education budget is $10.3 billion -- hasn't kept pace with the increase in students.
 The financing situation, Mr. Nield said, has left universities with a cash crisis, forcing them to make choices between cutting capital programs or slashing recurring expenses. In most cases, said Mr. Nield, capital programs have been the most heavily hit.
"The reason universities haven't gone bankrupt is that they've deferred maintenance on buildings," he said. "The buildings have gotten more tatty and out of date, the universities haven't invested in infrastructure and equipment, and there's a growing obsolescence problem, particularly in the sciences."
Universities have also frozen teachers' salaries and stopped spending on things like libraries, classrooms and dormitories. "What we are seeing is a falling off in the standard of the student experience," Mr. Nield said. "The classrooms are becoming overcrowded and there are fewer books and fewer places to study in the libraries -- the number of workstations, for example, hasn't risen in line with student numbers."
The vice chancellors' group met in early December to consider whether to advise its members to consider imposing tuition fees on British and European Union students (foreign students already pay roughly between $10,000 and $24,000 a year, depending on their discipline, according to the vice chancellors' committee). In part because of the Tory Government's last-minute decision -- felt by many to be politically motivated -- to pump an extra $160 million into the system over the next two years, the group put off a decision on the issue until next fall, after the Dearing panel makes its report.
But while the universities say that the extra funds are just a stopgap measure that hardly settles future funding problems, the Government itself, understandably, argues that the money should be enough to prevent the politically damaging imposition of tuition fees.
"Our position is that we don't think the universities need to charge these fees, that they already get enough money from their own sources and from the central Government," said David Peale, a spokesman for the British Department of Education.
Still, educators estimate that at least seven British universities are seriously considering having to charge tuition within the next few years. One of these is the London School of Economics, which recently announced that it will probably charge fees for some students in the realm of $800 to $1,600 starting with new students in the 1998 school year.
Currently, about one-third of the school's 3,000 or so undergraduates are from countries other than Britain or the European Union. The school needs their tuition payments -- which can go as high as $14,055 a year per student -- to subsidize the cost of educating its British and European Union students, for whom the Government pays only about $4,100 to $5,000) a year each.
"We are concerned about the current U.K. funding situation," Mr. Crawford said. "A lot of university governing bodies are putting themselves into a position where they will be able to make contingent decisions," such as being able to charge tuition should the next budget be unfavorable.
A serious consideration for the London School of Economics and other universities, Mr. Crawford said, would be to make sure that any imposition of tuition would not deter eligible students from attending the schools. "The question that needs to be answered is to what extent do you insure that someone who is bright enough to go to L.S.E. is backed by loans or scholarships of some sort," he said.
Ms. Llewellyn of the students' union, though, warned that charging tuition would deter many poorer students from attending a university at all -- even if the Government was able to set up a favorable loan program.
"Students now have to pay to live and eat and house themselves, so the least they can expect is for their education to be paid for," she said. "If tuition fees were charged, a lot of people you would think of as middle class would be priced out of going to university."

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CLASSROOMS AND COMERCIALISM

BYLINE: By Deborah Stead; Deborah Stead writes the Off the Shelf column in the SUnday business section of The New York Times

 BODY:
To cope with its latest budget crisis, the Seattle School Board passed a new policy just before Thanksgiving: It voted to accept corporate advertising in the city's middle and secondary schools.
 "We're viewing this more as sponsorship, though we will have visual ads," said Joseph Olchefske, the school district's chief financial officer. A typical sponsorship, he speculated, might result in "the cheerleaders, brought to you by Reebok" or "the McDonald's gym." 
 If Seattle schools put the advertising policy in place this fall, as planned, they will be joining another large school system, Colorado Springs, that took a similar step three years ago. Students there have been riding in school buses adorned with corporate logos and walking in hallways dotted with advertising billboards.
 Throughout the nation, meanwhile, almost 40 percent of schools have homerooms that start the day with news and commercials transmitted by Channel One, the Christopher Whittle creation that has attracted much criticism since it began in 1989.
 And commercialism has worked its way into schools in other forms as well:
 *Classroom packets that promote Hershey's chocolate or Kellogg's Rice Krispies.
*Third graders practicing math by counting Tootsie Rolls.
 *Young children learning to read with software that uses corporate logos like Kmart, Coke, Pepsi and Cap'n Crunch.
 *Prozac representatives giving a talk at a high school assembly on National Depression Screening Day.
 Over the last decade, corporate America has dramatically increased its involvement in education, from pre-kindergarten to post-graduate research. Practically every Fortune 500 company -- and virtually every local chamber of commerce -- has a school project. In part because of "A Nation at Risk," the 1983 Federal Government report that linked declining schools with the country's economic future, many business leaders are genuinely concerned about how their future employees are being educated these days. Indeed, business-led education summits -- like the one attended by 44 governors as well as President Clinton last March at International Business Machines Corporation's conference center in Palisades, N.Y. -- are helping to set the educational agenda.
 The companies come bearing precious dollars and other resources sorely needed in the nation's public school system, now struggling -- with dwindling public funds in some regions -- to educate a near-record 45.9 million children. Businesses donate money and materials, help wire schools for the Internet and mobilize employees to volunteer as tutors.
 But along with this philanthropy, schools are also receiving increasing doses of hucksterism. And public school advocates, educators, parents and even students are concerned that commercialism in the classroom could overshadow corporate good will.
 "It's an ethical issue that people don't talk about enough, and there is a big cause for concern," said Edward Miller, an education writer and former editor of the Harvard Education Newsletter. "By and large, educators are aware of these ethical issues, but the fact is that they are incredibly squeezed when it comes to resources and materials -- and they'll take help where they can get it."
 Indeed, these days, cash-strapped school administrators seem to be less content to be mere recipients of corporate largesse -- or of marketing and advertising disguised as free educational material. Some, like the Seattle School Board, are actively looking for commercial partnerships to stay afloat -- deals that make corporations pay for the privilege of entering the schoolhouse door.
 
'THAT'S WHERE THE KIDS ARE'
 Classroom commercialism isn't new. Most Americans have memories of the world of commerce being mixed into their school days occasionally.
"It's something that's gone on in the United States for the better part of this century," said Alex Molnar, an education professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and the author of "Giving Kids the Business: The Commercialization of America's Schools," recently published by West View Press.
 In the 1920's, for instance, Ivory Soap sponsored school soap-carving competitions -- a gimmick masterminded by Edward L. Bernays, one of America's first public relations men. (The company donated the soap.) In that era of emerging consumer goods, "children were seen as ambassadors, bringing back home the idea of packaged products," said Stewart Ewen, professor of media studies at Hunter College in New York and the author of "PR! A Social History of Spin."
Bankers, who still have an active outreach program in schools, began establishing those links after their image plummeted during the Depression. And in the late 1930's, the National Association of Manufacturers distributed a weekly gazette, Young America Magazine, to 70,000 schools. Typical articles: "Your Neighborhood Bank" and "The Business of America's People Is Selling." The association sent similar messages in its filmstrip and sound-recording programs. (It provided the equipment free to the schools.) "And by the late 1940's and 1950's, Junior Achievement was well in place, to get kids interested in entrepreneurialism," Professor Ewen said.
 By 1979, Sheila Harty had published "Hucksters in the Classroom," which focused mostly on commercially sponsored teaching kits about nutrition, the environment and economics. The book was considered the first comprehensive look at the subject.
 Since then, companies have gotten bolder in their efforts to bring commercial messages into the schools. "In the past, there was maybe more of a feeling that shameless promotion in school wasn't right, that you should keep education separate," said Gene Newman, associate editor of Youth Markets Alert, a marketing industry newsletter published by EPM Communications in New York. "I think in today's business climate, that's definitely beginning to change."
 At the same time advertisers are finding it harder to determine which media are the best avenues for reaching the 6- to 19-year-old consumers whose spending power and influence add up to $485 billion a year.
 "Kid TV viewership is down a lot on the traditional Saturday morning programs and on weekday afternoons," said Julie Halpin, senior vice president of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising's Kid Connection, its youth marketing unit. From 1995 to 1996, she said, overall TV viewership in those time slots has dropped an average of 6 percent, as children watch videos or play computer games instead.
Classrooms, therefore, look more attractive than ever, Mr. Newman said, because "that's where all the kids are."
 And marketers see a green light when they contemplate the school system's troubles. "As the price of books, computers and other teaching aids outstrips school budgets, corporations and their marketing messages are more welcome in the schools," a recent article in Youth Markets Alert reported.
 The messages are proliferating, said Marianne Manilov, executive director of the Center for Commercial Free Public Education, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Oakland, Calif. "It's a flood," she said, because for corporate advertisers, "there are so many ways into the schools."

 LESSONS IN THE MAIL
The "Chocolate Dream Machine" appeared out of nowhere, not long ago, in Lisa Becerra's mailbox at the Washington Middle School in Seattle.
 "I laughed when I saw it," said Ms. Becerra, who teaches English and social studies at the school, which has 1,200 students, many from lower-income families. "It's about chocolate's place in a balanced diet, with Hershey's mixed in there."
 "The Chocolate Dream Machine" is a video and curriculum guide developed by the Mazer Corporation in Dayton, Ohio, for the Hershey Foods Corporation.
 In the video, four young people use a computer to learn how chocolate is made. Along the way there are a few vocabulary, math, geography and science lessons. (The nutritional advice -- that chocolate should be eaten only occasionally, as a treat -- seems sound.) But there is also footage featuring Hershey products, as well as a few other nuggets. A sample: "I didn't know they used real whole milk in chocolate," one teen-ager in the video says. "Mr. Hershey did," another replies. "His company still does today."
 The written guide and suggested classroom activities are also full of references to Hershey: its founder, its philanthropies, its products.
 The "Chocolate Dream Machine" was created about a year and a half ago, after the company received teacher requests to make a previous program more appropriate for students of middle-school age, said John Long, Hershey's director of corporate communications. After the kit went out, he said, "we received 400 response cards from teachers, and they've universally been positive." The lesson's "primary purpose is not marketing," he said, but "it's hard to answer the interest in Hershey and chocolate and not mention the company name."
 The "Dream Machine" is an example of what is called "sponsored education material." And many companies provide such materials to schools at no cost. Besides food companies, education material may come from Hollywood studios, trade groups, energy conglomerates and newspapers. (The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, for instance, publish special classroom versions of their newspapers for secondary schools. Distributed quarterly and monthly, respectively, they contain advertising.)
Kellogg's offers nutrition posters with pictures of Rice Krispies boxes. MCA International sends out material for young children featuring Casper the Friendly Ghost and The Little Engine That Could -- both characters from the company's current video catalogue.
 "There is a proliferation of this 'shadow curriculum,' free material related to product placement that teachers are using in the classroom," said Arnold F. Fege of the National P.T.A. in Washington, which represents 27,000 member organizations. "We still don't know the magnitude of it."
 Because the materials usually arrive unsolicited and rarely undergo curriculum reviews, it is difficult to know how many teachers use them. But the independent developers of these learning kits estimate that their products reach up to 2 million teachers from kindergarten through college at practically every school in America.
 "We get them every day," said Janice R. Nicholas, principal of the River Terrace Community School, an elementary school in Washington, which she describes as "middle class in values but not in funding."
 A few years ago, schools were receiving the "Prego Thickness Experiment," sponsored by the Campbell Soup Company. The classroom kit -- containing a slotted spoon and a Prego poster -- explained the scientific method students could use to "prove" that Prego was thicker than Ragu. Campbell has since discontinued the program.
 These days, teachers from kindergarten to third grade are finding "Tootsie Roll: The Sweet Taste of Success" in their mailboxes. "The Sweet Taste of Success" includes, among other things, lessons in simple math (counting Tootsie Rolls), geography (linking map sites where Tootsie Rolls have been produced to events in American history), a writing exercise (creating a story from a poster history of Tootsie Rolls) and a suggested follow-up activity (interviewing family members about their memories of Tootsie Rolls and Tootsie Pops).
The lesson plan was developed by Lifetime Learning Systems, a unit of K-III Communications Inc., which also owns Weekly Reader and, now, Channel One. Lifetime Learning currently has about 20 curriculum projects, said Dominic Kinsley, its editor in chief. A decade ago, there were only five or six.
 The emphasis on the candy, as an American icon, is intentional, Mr. Kinsley said. The premise "is to use the feelings people have about Tootsie Rolls and to teach a variety of skills to young children." The interviewing, he said, is "a link between parents and children."
 Ms. Becerra in Seattle, who has been thinking lately about the subject of advertising in the schools (she opposes the school's new policy), said she "definitely" planned to use "The Chocolate Dream Machine" in a food unit later this year. But she said materials like these were also excellent vehicles for teaching something else: media literacy, the art of seeing behind the image being presented.
 Ms. Becerra said she would ask students what they thought about the purpose of the Hershey's program. "I'll say: 'Why do you think Hershey's sent this to me? Why would they send this to teachers?' "
 
Tattoos and Textbook Covers
 As he was sitting down to dinner one night last fall, Christopher St. John, an accountant from Staten Island, N.Y., noticed temporary tattoos on the arms of his two daughters. The decals bore the initials "CK," for Calvin Klein.
 Where, he asked, had his girls, ages 7 and 10, picked up these corporate logos?
 School, they told him. The tattoos were included with free textbook covers that featured young models dressed in Calvin Klein clothing.
 "I was livid," Mr. St. John said. "First of all, I don't like Calvin Klein's advertising," he said. "I think it's exploitive. And the tattoos I find very, very hideous." Beyond that, he said, "my kids shouldn't have to have all this peer pressure for clothes and image. You're trying to get the kids ready in the morning, and for them to worry about their fashion -- it just goes too far. To have the school handing out this stuff, it really outraged me."
 Mr. St. John complained directly to the principal at the girls' school, Public School 23, and the covers were removed from the school. No more ad-bearing book covers will be accepted, said Diane Alvaro, president of the P.T.A. "The kids can use brown paper bags or buy covers at the store."
 The textbook covers and tattoos given to Mr. St. John's daughters are produced by Cover Concepts Marketing Services Inc. in Braintree, Mass., an eight-year-old company that distributes free book covers each semester to 31,000 schools and almost 25 million students across the country. (Cover Concepts also sends consumer product samples for some of its clients.)
 Told of Mr. St. John's complaint, Steven Shulman, the president of Cover Concepts, said that his company "listens to every concern," but he defended the Calvin Klein book cover, which he said depicted "conservatively dressed" young people. "We have schools that sent thank-you letters for the Calvin Klein cover," he said. A spokesman for Calvin Klein, Robert L. Triefus, said his understanding is that the covers are being distributed with "the permission of the relevant school authorities."
 According to Mr. Shulman, "Most of our covers have a positive message." Indeed, a number of his company's textbook covers feature discreet logos amid colorful designs and public service messages (Michael Jordan and Spike Lee, for instance, on staying in school).
 But make no mistake: this is advertising.
 Corporate clients pay $129,000 per million covers for a semester's exposure. "We do business with every major kid advertiser in the country," Mr. Shulman said. According to the company's promotional materials, students' tested "unaided recall" of the logos and brand names on their covers is 60 to 80 percent. "In traditional print media, if you get 4 or 5 percent, the client is satisfied," Mr. Shulman said.
Like all advertisers, Mr. Shulman's clients use demographics to target their markets. Nike distributes to inner-city schools, Mr. Shulman said. Lego goes to middle-income areas. Gatorade has three covers -- one for predominantly black schools, one for Hispanic students and one for predominantly white schools.
 In its pitch to advertisers, Cover Concepts points out that the target market is a "captive" one, since most schools require students to cover their textbooks. But Mr. Shulman said he did not see that as unfair leverage. "The students don't have to use our covers," he said. "And there's such a need for this program. The average textbook costs $50."
 Ms. Nicholas, the Washington elementary school principal, is one educator who says she is glad to have the textbook covers. If she finds a cover is "too commercial," she said, "we tell the teachers, turn it over on the clear side." Her school has few resources, she said, and "we make use of what comes in."
 
LEARNING HOW TO HUSTLE
These days, many schools are actively going after commercial relationships when public dollars dwindle -- deals that they hope will yield more than the usual logo-emblazoned athletic scoreboards or the media equipment supplied by Channel One.
 Florida's Hillsborough County school district -- with 145,000 students in and around Tampa -- recently signed on with Adopt-A-School Inc. in Winter Park to place logo-bearing posters in the corridors of its 160 schools within the year. Already, said Terry A. Boehm, executive director of the Hillsborough Education Foundation, the nonprofit fund-raiser for the district, "there are a lot of logos floating around on materials. If we're going to have advertising in the schools, it should be associated with revenues."
 Under the deal, brokered through the foundation, county schools will get 50 percent of the ad revenues. Jerry Coleman, Adopt-A-School's president, said the signs would carry "positive" messages as well as the logos ofnational and local advertisers that produce "mostly student-type consumer products." Such posters could eventually yield $450,000 a year for the district, he said.
 Mr. Boehm, who said that businesses accounted for 60 percent of the $3 million his group raised for the district schools last year, said he did not expect the Adopt-A-School program to produce more than 10 percent of Mr. Coleman's estimate. But he said he hoped it would "be a model for how things will be done with logos."
 As Seattle's school system begins its foray into the commercial realm, however, it may find, as some others have, that the results can be quite modest.
 *New York City's Board of Education has already signed contracts with companies that will advertise on the sides of school buses. The board hopes to bring in $53 million over nine years. That is a tiny percentage of the school system's $8 billion annual budget.
 *In 15 states, about 100 schools have signed up with Star Broadcasting in Bloomington, Minn., which beams 48 minutes of music (rock, country, oldies and "fiesta") and 12 minutes of local and national commercials every hour into school corridors, cafeterias and courtyards. Schools are encouraged to teach students how to solicit local advertising for the broadcasts. Star gives 40 percent of the resulting ad revenues to the schools. Its goal, said Pat DiPlacido, the company's president, is to make $5,000 to $10,000 a year for participating schools.
 Russell Goff, principal of Eldorado High School in Albuquerque, N.M., has been using Star broadcasts for three years in the courtyards of his 2,000-student school. In that time, he says, the school has made a total of $100. Still, he said, "overall it's been good." The music makes the students happy and calm, he said, and he hopes that maybe the advertising situation will improve.
 Colorado Springs, whose District 11 school system began in-school advertising three years ago, has learned its share of lessons, too.
 Its 33,000 students are "not enough to entice a Nike," said Tracy Cooper, a spokeswoman for the district and the manager of the advertising program. In the first two years, the school system netted a total of only $73,150. In 1996-97, as the program was expanded into elementary schools and a new ad agency was hired, the district sold $121,808 worth of ads for buses and hallways. After the agency is paid, the schools will be left with $85,265. That's less than $2.60 per student -- and a tiny percentage of the system's $155 million annual budget.
"It's a drop in the bucket," Ms. Cooper acknowledged. "It allows us -- this doesn't look big -- to buy one more violin or something for a school."
 Still, in Seattle, Mr. Olchefske, the system's chief financial officer, is optimistically projecting ad and sponsorship revenues of $1 million a year, "and frankly we hope for more than that," he said.
 
Corporate Conscience, Corporate Clout
 Critics of in-school advertising, like Professor Molnar of the University of Wisconsin and Ms. Manilov of the Center for Commercial Free Public Education, say that corporate America has contributed to the funding problems that lead schools to search for commercial solutions.
 In many areas -- particularly urban ones with overwhelmingly poor minority populations -- when businesses left or asked for special tax breaks, it meant the loss of local tax revenuesthat could have helped shore up those cities' school systems, they say. And giveaways and even intense philanthropic efforts, they add, are not adequate substitutes.
 Education-related corporate philanthropy last year added up to $1.3 billion, or 20 percent of the $6.5 billion corporate giving overall, according to Craig Smith, director of Corporate Citizen, a research group based in Seattle. A decade ago, education accounted for only 5 percent of corporate giving, Mr. Smith said. He defines the education category as "K-to-12 education plus school-related nonprofits like the P.T.A.'s or Junior Achievement."
 But that amount is still just a fraction of the estimated $293.7 billion nationwide public school budget for the 1995-96 school year.
 Many companies have chosen education as a cause for "strategic" reasons, Mr. Smith said. "There are various motives that attract companies to nonprofit places like schools. Some involve marketing, some involve research and development, some involve public relations and some involve employee relations."
But whatever its motivation, business has achieved tremendous clout in the national debate over education, Mr. Smith said, noting that "it is significant that the governors came to I.B.M.'s turf" last year for the national education summit.
Hugh Price, president of the National Urban League in New York, attended the summit, and he echoed the sentiment: "I think the business community can be a very important source in all of this, by saying, 'We expect the educational system to get the young people up to the levels,' and then looking at what's required."
K-III Communications, the owner of Channel One and Lifetime Learning Systems, was recently the prime organizer of a drive among New York City publishers to donate a million reading books to New York City school children, according to Lisa Belzberg, president of Pencil, the nonprofit group that coordinated the effort.
Last March, Sun Microsystems coordinated about 200 companies and 20,000 volunteers in California for "Net Day," wiring schools around the state for the Internet. The concept caught on state by state.
John Gage, Sun's chief science officer and Net Day's architect, said the only "strategic" interest for Sun -- whose Java programming language is used by Internet software developers -- is in getting "smart employees" in the future. Still, on the "Net Day 96" page that Mr. Gage created for the event on the World Wide Web, he listed some "self-serving" reasons other companies might want to ante up for some $500 wiring kits or devote some time to the project: everything from "good public relations" and morale-building among employees to possible "benefits later" (wiring-maintenance contracts, for example).
But there are problems with projects like Net Day, said Professor Molnar, who cautioned against its use as a model for improving education.
"Who's going to criticize a bunch of people rolling up their sleeves and wiring a school?" he said. "But why should that be a way that schools get on the Internet? It's crazy public policy to have a school system that relies on individual acts of good will."
Are students in needy schools ultimately helped by businesses that sponsor free curriculum guides or even out-and-out advertising?
Some of the sponsored teaching materials are not commercial, according to Consumers Union, the Yonkers, N.Y.-based advocacy group, but they are the exceptions.
In "Captive Kids: A Report on Commercial Pressures on Kids at School," published in 1995, Consumers Union evaluated more than 75 of these learning materials. Nearly 80 percent, it found, were biased in favor of the sponsor's product. And more than half were deemed "commercial" (with prominently displayed logos or product promotions) or "highly commercial" (defined as "basically an ad").
Some teachers avoid using sponsored educational materials altogether.
"A lot of it I look at and toss," said Dan Otter, a fifth-grade teacher at McKinley Elementary School in Corona, Calif., about 65 miles east of Los Angeles.
Others find it helpful to have other sources to consider.
"I just really appreciate having it available; it beefs up my curriculum," said Pamela Smith, who also teaches fifth grade at McKinley.
Ms. Smith said she still uses art activities she picked up from a Crayola packet more than eight years ago. And every year, she teaches a food unit using materials from the California Dairy Council. "It's not at all heavy on the dairy side," she said. "It's a balanced approach."
This year she is using a teaching unit sent by another trade group, the Mushroom Council. "It's not commercial," she said, adding that she is alert to the possibility of promotion. "If something came over my desk that was more commercial than educational I wouldn't use it, because I won't advertise in my classroom."
The sponsors and developers of these learning kits argue that their materials have real education value.
"The materials are strictly educational," said Karen Kafer, a spokeswoman for Kellogg, though they occasionally show products that "fit with the message." She added that Kellogg's materials follow nutritional guidelines recommended by the American Heart Association. Roberta Nusim, director of Youth Marketing International, which developed the Casper and Little Engine That Could materials, defends the materials' educational content as well. "Entertainment is very much part of our culture," she said. "Why not use what our children are interested in to teach them?" And Mr. Kinsley, of Lifetime Learning says that a recent kit developed for Fine Line Productions' new movie "Twelfth Night" discusses Shakespearean character development.
At the same time, the developers' own promotional materials, aimed at potential sponsors, tend to talk about "product awareness" and "consumer recall." And Ms. Halpin of Saatchi & Saatchi noted that if material has been "paid for by the marketer for the purpose of getting kids' eyeballs on it, it's marketing for kids."
(The Read-A-Logo software, developed for teachers by Tony Domenech, president of Teacher Support Software in Gainesville, Fla., was not sponsored by advertisers. Mr. Domenech defends its "rebus" reading method, which uses corporate logos instead of some words. "We can be more effective teachers if we teach from what the child knows," he said.)
The Society for Consumer Professionals in Business, whose membership comes from corporate consumer affairs departments, has issued a set of guidelines for their members' sponsored materials that say such learning guides should be accurate, objective and non-commercial -- with no logos or brand-names in the text or illustrations.
T HE National Education Association has also passed a similar, "Preserve Classroom Integrity," pledge.
But such guidelines are just recommendations.
Mr. Fege of the National P.T.A. said that his group "has a strong position that whatever material is used in the school, it should go through a public adoption process." Does that happen? "Absolutely not," he said.
Now some educators, public school advocates and even sponsored-curriculum developers say it is time for these materials to be regulated by school authorities, preferably at the district level. And such regulations should have teeth, they say.
"I don't blame businesses for putting out a business spin," said Diane Berreth, deputy executive director of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development in Washington, a group representing teachers, principals and school superintendents. "It's incumbent on educators to have policies for review."
Young students, especially, need protection, some educators say. Mr. Miller, the writer and former editor of the Harvard Education Letter, said that promotional materials and in-school advertising raise some basic developmental and psychological questions. "I think it's pretty bad when it comes to young children," he said. "It's insupportable, because the developmental truth about children is that in the early years, the elementary grades, they are simply not able to look analytically and critically at things like advertising and separate out a commercial message. A young child inherently believes in the authority of adults."
But there is also concern about older students. Parents were furious in October 1994, when two representatives of Eli Lilly, which makes Prozac, spoke at an assembly devoted to depression at Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, Md. After the scheduled speaker, a psychiatrist, failed to arrive, the Lilly duo talked, in part, about how medication (but not Prozac specifically) could help depression. They also gave out Prozac pens, pads and brochures to the students. (The two were disciplined, an Eli Lilly spokesman said, and the company subsequently apologized to the high school.)
Meanwhile, in Seattle, debate is focusing on the planned advertising contracts.
"Our financial situation is forcing us to be entrepreneurial," said John Stanford, the city's superintendent of schools, when he introduced the measure. "If we were getting what we should be getting from the state legislature, we wouldn't be looking at this kind of approach."
THE advertising initiative is sorely needed, said Mr. Olchefske, the district's chief financial officer, because Seattle's 97 schools and 47,000 students are currently losing $35 million in state funds over a three-year period -- 12 percent of the system's annual budget.
"We've already cut custodians; classrooms only get cleaned once every third day," he said. "And we've reduced funding for special-needs kids -- tutoring programs and that sort of thing. And there are more cuts to come."
For Ed Reed, a math teacher at Seattle's Washington Middle School, more cuts seem unimaginable. Already, he hustles for the most basic equipment in his classes, collecting filing cabinets from Boeing. "And some extra chairs -- we had a record number of kids this year, and I had kids standing in the classroom," he said.
Mr. Reed has also received a donation of basic arithmetic calculators from G.T.E., but he points out that "in the suburban systems, the kids are working in math with graphic calculators." He supports the new advertising policy, and is making his wish list for the funds that might come in. At the top: more math teachers, to reduce class sizes in his department.
But Brita Butler-Wall, a parent of two public school children and an official of the Seattle council of parent-teacher groups, said she completely opposed the plan.
"No matter how low-key it is, it is fundamentally wrong," said Ms. Butler-Wall, who organized a community meeting about the new policy on Dec. 6, a few weeks after it was passed. (About 120 people attended, mostly those opposed to the policy). "I'd rather have my child go to a school with very little in the way of activities -- but with integrity -- than have sports, music, whatever, with a McDonald's label on it."
Even if the school district did make $1 million each year from the ads, she said, how much impact can it have on a $35 million shortfall over the next three years? It may turn out that in the end there is not much difference in class size or teacher salaries, she said. Instead, "we may just end up with a lot of ads."
Darnell Edmon and Ahmed King, both seniors at Seattle's Middle College High School, which has many lower-income students, also oppose the initiative. "Shouldn't schools be the one place we can get away from advertisements?" Mr. Edmon asked. Mr. King added that he feared the move would have "a domino effect. First the Nike cheerleaders, next thing you know, it'll be the Nike school."

Fighting the Rankings of a College Guide

BYLINE: By Peter Applebome; Peter Applebome is the national education correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
An unlikely revolt of students against grades -- not their own, but the ones their colleges and universities get from a national magazine -- is becoming a cause celebre on a growing number of campuses.
 At its root is a simple question: Does U.S. News & World Report provide a useful consumer service each year with its closely watched numerical ranking of the nation's colleges and universities, or does it deliver a cynical, misleading product whose main contribution is to the magazine's bottom line? 
 The dispute also touches on the broader topic of how best to judge and measure the quality of a university education and how to make sure parents and prospective students get helpful, accurate information about one of the biggest financial and personal decisions they will ever make.
 At the center of the dispute is U.S. News's annual "America's Best Colleges" guide -- the best-selling one in the nation -- which gives a numerical ranking to 1,422 accredited four-year schools. Among them are 400 national universities and liberal arts colleges. The ranking has become a huge annual event, but one that is widely reviled by many educators and students, who say ranking colleges and universities like toasters or football teams does more harm than good.
 So far, student governments of the university systems of California and Oklahoma and at least 17 other colleges and universities, from Stanford to the University of Pennsylvania, have passed resolutions asking U.S. News to halt the numerical ranking. They argue that the ranking is misleading and inaccurate and that it contributes to a kind of status hysteria that is undermining the real goals of higher education in the United States. Fifty to 100 other campuses are debating the issue.
 Many university administrators credit U.S. News with being careful, diligent and flexible enough to make its rankings as fair as possible. But even so, many say it is impossible to rank universities in any meaningful way, and that the U.S. News ratings have become prime culprits in turning the choice of a college from an essentially educational issue to a high-stakes economic and social transaction.
 "We don't like to see education reduced to a horse race, which is essentially what this amounts to," said Fiona Rose, student government president at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, which recently passed a resolution condemning the rankings.
 Schools that have passed similar resolutions include the University of California, Berkeley, Smith College, Rice University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Wesleyan University.
In December U.S. News met with a group of students critical of the rankings and says it has consistently worked with university administrators to improve its system.
 "We're very forthright that the ranking should be used only as one tool to help someone make an informed decision," said Bruce Zanca, director of communications for U.S. News. "It's something we do for our readers to help put in context in a reader-friendly, digestible form this huge amount of data and information."
 Guidebooks, including ones that broadly rank universities in categories like "most selective," "very selective" and "selective," have long been part of the process in which high school students consider colleges.
 But in recent years the guidebooks have proliferated, and none have prospered more than U.S. News's. The magazine bills its rankings as the "No. 1 Selling College Guide." Its latest issue with the rankings had newsstand sales 56 percent above the norm.. In addition, the magazine sells about a million copies of its paperback book version of the college guide.
 The U.S. News rankings are based on a number of factors. The single biggest factor -- academic reputation -- is based on surveys sent to 4,200 college presidents, deans and admissions directors, who are asked to rate schools in the same category (like regional liberal arts colleges) as their own. Academic quality counts for 25 percent of the total ranking. Other categories include selectivity, faculty resources, financial resources, retention (graduation rate), alumni giving and "value added" -- the school's record of graduating students, this time taking into account their backgrounds and entering qualifications. Then the ratings are converted to a score, with 100 at the top and many schools separated by only 0.1 or 0.2 of a point.
 The magazine gets most of the information from the colleges and universities, but says it uses computer analysis and comparisons with information given to financial rating services, like Moody's and Standard & Poors, to cross-check data provided by the schools.
 The current revolt against the ranking began at Stanford University, which U.S. News this year ranks the sixth-best national university, behind Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Duke and M.I.T.
 Nick Thompson, a Stanford senior, helped form the "Forget U.S. News Coalition," or FUNC, which helped mobilize attention elsewhere. Students initially considered asking their universities to withhold data from U.S. News, but decided the approach was unrealistic because of the fear that schools would be penalized in the rankings.
 And Gerhard Casper, president of Stanford, has been among the most outspoken university administrators criticizing the magazine. In fact, the stinging memo he wrote to the new U.S. News Editor, James Fallows, in September, has made the rounds of university administrators around the country as the most succinct statement of the case against the rankings.
 "I hope I have the standing to persuade you that much about these rankings -- particularly their specious formulas and spurious precision -- is utterly misleading," Mr. Casper wrote in September to Mr. Fallows. Prior to becoming the editor of U.S. News this fall, Mr. Fallows himself emerged as a prominent media critic by lambasting the media's excessive focus on so-called "horse race" journalism.
 Critics say the ratings are arbitrary and favor private institutions over public ones. In his letter, Mr. Casper cited the lack of logic in ranking a school like Johns Hopkins University as the 22d-best national university two years ago, the 10th-best last year and the 15th-best this year. Similarly, he cited Harvard, which customarily places first in the ratings, but this year suddenly dropped to third. And he questioned why great public institutions like the University of Michigan or the University of California, Berkeley, could not crack U.S. News's top 20.
 And some students say the rankings are leading universities to adjust policies (or fudge figures) to please the rankers, and leadingstudents to pick a school based on its ranking rather than its suitablity.
 "We've had students come forward on the Internet, like one from Carnegie Mellon, who said he was miserable there, but was basically required to apply because it was the highest-ranked of the schools he could seriously consider," said Jebediah Purdy, a Harvard senior. "Any effort to quantify educational quality is going to be distortive and is going to end up leaving a lot of people less well matched and less well satisfied and less well educated than they ought to be."
 Other critics concede that they may be seen as griping about their own schools' ratings. They also acknowledge that students at the top-rated schools may see little incentive to complain.
 "It's obviously more difficult to get this passed at Yale, because the student body as a whole is not necessarily convinced that U.S. News is doing anything bad for them," said Phyllis Thompson, a senior at Yale, which placed first in this year's rankings.
 Mel Elfin, editor of the guide since its inception 10 years ago, said that the volatility in the rankings reflects the guide's willingness to listen to critics, and that the differences between the top schools are so small that focusing on the changes in numerical ranking misses the degree to which the rankings have been consistent and accurate. For instance, in the current rating of best national universities, Yale ranks first at 100.0, Princeton second at 99.8 and Harvard third at 99.6.
 "We've produced a list that puts Harvard, Yale and Princeton, in whatever order, at the top," Mr. Elfin said. "This is a nutty list? Something we pulled out of the sky?"
 Instead, he said, the changes reflect the magazine's willingness to fine-tune its ratings, while giving readers a product they obviously want.
 "When you buy a VCR for 200 bucks, you can buy Consumer Reports to find out what's out there," he said. "When you spend 100 grand on four years of college, you should have some independent method of comparing different colleges. That's what our readers want, and they've voted at the newsstand in favor of what we're doing."
 Still, while few administrators want to criticize U.S. News too publicly, and many feel the information in the report is valuable, they also say that the rankings do more harm than good.
 "I wish these rankings would go away," said an administrator at one university in the magazine's top 10, who asked not to be identified, "because in the final analysis, they generate more heat than light. Parents and students need more information, but the ratings just produce more anxiety."
 A broader concern is for the accuracy of the information in the various rating guides. Arthur J. Rothkopf of Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., has spearheaded an effort to develop standardized questions and criteria to make sure that colleges accurately report comparable data to guidebooks, including the one by U.S. News. An article in the Wall Street Journal in 1995 detailed the ways colleges manipulated the data they provided to guidebooks, often excluding large numbers of academically poor or foreign students from their statistics in order to inflate performance.
 Mr. Rothkopf, too, thinks U.S. News's rankings are too misleading to be valuable.
 "This is consumer information, and people make very important decisions based on it," he said. "They ought to have accurate information and be able to view a level playing field."
 A ranking of the rankings has also been critical of U.S. News.
Alma College in Alma, Mich.,recently released what it said was a survey of 158 college administrators, who ranked U.S. News's last in quality among college guidebooks, giving it a paltry 1.97 -- a C- -- on a 4.0 scale.
 Some 90 percent of respondents said the magazine's ranking was important, but only 7.6 percent surveyed said it was the one that most accurately described their school.
 Mr. Fallows, who notes that the rankings preceded his tenure as editor, said that he is eager to meet with critics. He declined to comment on whether the magazine was open to doing away with the numerical rankings.
 But Mr. Zanca said: "I'd never say never, but I don't see us stepping away from the numerical rankings. It's something our readers expect from us."

HEADLINE: BURNING MIDNIGHT OIL, NOT THE SAUCE

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV; Eric Asimov writes the $25 and Under restaurant reviews for The Times.

 BODY:
With perhaps the most famous surname in culinary history, you might assume that Garry Escoffier Jr. was born to be a chef. In fact, Mr. Escoffier, 25, cooks West Indian food by day at Joy's Cafe in Brooklyn. But by night, after grabbing a full two and a halfhours of sleep, Mr. Escoffier goes after something more. He travels to downtown Manhattan to attend the late-night Culinary Skills Program at the New York Restaurant School, where the philosophy is that chefs are made, not born.
"What I cook is just the bottom of the horizon," said Mr. Escoffier, who, as far he knows, is no relation to the revered French cooking god Auguste Escoffier. "I want to work in large restaurants where I can learn many different styles of cooking." 
 Of more than 1,000 students enrolled this year at the restaurant school, almost 200 are in the night program, learning how to dice onions and whisk a hollandaise from 11 P.M. to 6 A.M., four nights a week, hours once reserved for third-shift toilers and insomniacs. The figure seems even more surprising considering that the overnight classes -- possibly the only such program in the country -- began just four years ago, directed at maybe a couple dozen people a year who were already in the restaurant industry and looking for further training.
"It evolved into something different," said Stephen Tave, the school's director of admissions. "It was pretty unbelievable to see how many students could function all night in school, and some of them even hold jobs during the day."
In fact, quite a few of them do, like Melissa Gowan, 33, who works full time as a photographer and has two children, 10 and 14. She says she can squeak by on one and a half hours of sleep a day. "Sometimes I come in here like a zombie," she said. "But you do what you have to do. I really want to work in a restaurant."
A lot of people do, and the demand for restaurant workers is growing rapidly. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of people working as cooks in restaurants has risen by 59 percent in 12 years, from about 452,000 in 1983 to 714,000 in 1995.
"There is a tremendous demand for these graduates," Mr. Tave said. "Our placement rates are over 90 percent."
Those rates are in line with other such training schools. The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., for example, generally places 92 to 94 percent of its graduates. For 1,000 graduates last year, 7,000 cooking, baking and management jobs were available, said Ray Wells, the institute's director of career services.
This prospect of steady, interesting work drives the students to pay the $11,106 tuition, which is slightly less expensive than the day classes'. Most of the students take out loans or have some form of assistance.
About 60 other students joined Mr. Escoffier and Ms. Gowan in the late-night program on a recent Tuesday night. They filed into the school, situated 16 floors above Canal Street, around 11 P.M. to attend one of the night's three classes, each at a different stage of the nine-month-long curriculum.
Fueled by caffeine and ambition, they spent the next seven hours in one of the school's five teaching kitchens, trying to master skills, from the rock-bottom basic (holding a knife properly) to the sublime (the proper construction of the classic French sauces) to the ridiculous (sculpting pates and mousses into fish or a row of tumbled dominoes, garnished by flowers carved from carrots and squash).
Their first step was to change into uniform: a white double-breasted jacket, black-and-white checked pants, an apron and a white paper toque. The uniform requirement is not only practical for the kitchen, but also helps to instill reverence for the work, as does the respectful title "Chef" by which students are required to address their instructors.
Some of those in the classes are, like Mr. Escoffier, already in the food industry, but feeling stuck in their jobs. They are hoping that the certificate of completion given at the end of the course will be their ticket upward.
"There's such a hierarchy of corporate ownership that I get lost in the shuffle without any sort of certification," said Mitchell Schnee, 25, as he chopped onions and carrots in Chef Brendan Sheehan's section, which this night was focusing on sauces. Mr. Schnee is already a chef at O'Doyle's, a steakhouse with a medieval theme in Jersey City. His ambition is to own his own place in five years.
"I already know the theme, the decor and the menu, and now I have five years to get funding," he said of the restaurant he envisions, which he wants to call the Enchanted Dreams Cafe. "I enjoy mystical and magical things," he said, displaying a tattoo of a unicorn on his forearm. Mr. Schnee said he was lucky to get three hours' sleep a night, but was willing to pay the price. "I have a burning desire to excel," he said.
Though Chef Sheehan's class began in October, the students, who were divided into three- and four-person teams, moved with methodical efficiency, as if they had been in the kitchen for years. The scene was much different in a neighboring kitchen in Chef Gregory Dalton's section, which began just a few weeks before. There are no restaurant professionals in Chef Dalton's class; just restaurant ambitions.
"I always liked cooking, and I understand it's a profitable medium," said Andre Greenberg, 35, as he sat at a big table, going over his notes on recipe conversion before class began. He said that his routine of going directly from class to his job as a maintenance worker for the Park Service was rough, but that he was hoping for a payoff.
The schedule was not as difficult for his classmate Joe Aversa, 39, who said he's loved cooking his whole life. "Recently I got lucky and lost my job," said Mr. Aversa, who had been in sales. "I'm looking at this as an opportunity."
Unemployment had also given him the chance to catch up on his sleep, unlike Simon Kim, 28, who puts in time at his family's dry-cleaning establishment in the Bronx during the day. Mr. Kim, who attended the Fashion Institute of Technology, said he couldn't find a steady job in the fashion industry and was hoping to learn specific skills that he could fall back on. "I never cooked in my life before," he said. "I burn eggs."
Mr. Kim still hadn't cooked. In the few weeks since his section began, Chef Dalton had covered the subjects of professionalism, food safety, sanitation and equipment. Scattered around the table were bags of potato chips, candy bars and cans of Coca-Cola. Clearly, nutrition was a topic for future discussion. On this night the subject was knife skills, not necessarily what any sensible person wants to be experimenting with late at night with an artificially heightened attention span.
"I'm not a coffee drinker, but I'm drinking six or seven cups a day," said Mr. Kim, his knee jiggling as he sat on a stool before class. "It makes me very nervous."
But Chef Dalton was prepared. "I've got my little boo-boo bag right here," he told the class in his stentorian voice, pointing to his first-aid kit and warning them that cuts were inevitable in the kitchen. "These things happen," he said. "It's like getting on a bicycle."
As Chef Dalton segued into his discussion of knives, the students reached into sturdy black nylon equipment bags, which they'd been issued on admission, along with a full set of equipment, the chef's uniform, black steel-toed shoes and a 1,080 page textbook, "On Cooking," by Sarah R. Labensky and Alan M. Hause (Prentice Hall, 1995). There are daily homework assignments and frequent quizzes.
A student who had forgotten his apron was given a lecture on professionalism by Chef Dalton. "Remember what I said about mise en place!" he said, using the French term for the proper assembling of all equipment and ingredients. "Come to class prepared!"
He lectured the class in a voice of absolute authority, like John Wayne building a platoon of marines in basic training. In fact, like marines who must learn to operate as a team in a matter of weeks, the students must cram into nine months a base of knowledge that used to be acquired through years of apprenticeship in restaurant kitchens. "Keep your street stuff and lingo out on the street," he ordered one student, who had begun to strut with his knife. "Here we're professionals."
He dressed down another student who arrived unprepared, like the platoon cut-up. "You're gonna bring your knives from now on. Your knives, your apron, your toque. Mise en place! Or you'll be sent home."
It was easy to tell the newer students, like those in Chef Dalton's class, from the veterans: their uniforms were spotless. In Scott Keats's class on the presentation of pates, mousses, terrines and the like, the uniforms of the students who began in September were stained and creased. But their spirits were as high as the new students'.
"It's tough but I love it," said Denzel Richards, 38, a cable-television installer by day, who said he manages on four hours of sleep a night. "Ultimately, I'd like to get into catering."
Atiyah Watson, 20, of Staten Island, was not exactly clear on what she wanted out of the course, though she knew exactly why she was in it.
"I was kind of a party fanatic, so now my mother knows where I am," she said, as she teamed with Mr. Richards to make a roasted tomato coulis. Chef Keats stopped to advise her on applying olive oil to the split tomatoes on a roasting pan, and he examined Mr. Richards's vegetable pate. "Very nice, excellent job," he said.
Ms. Gowan, the photographer, said that she's tried the day classes, but prefers the night course because it draws a more dedicated brand of people. "It's a big group effort," she said, as she meticulously carved a carrot into rabbit ears to use as a garnish. "People have to work together, and they are closer."
Myra Turpin, 35, who works in the cookware department at Bloomingdale's, agreed. "You're only here if you really love it," she said as she carved a carrot into a sunflower to garnish her seafood mousseline. "Who else would be here at 1:15 in the morning?"
Another enthusiast is Karim Thornhill, 22, who had just finished the meticulous preparation work in Chef Sheehan's sauce class. "I love coming here, I think about it all the time," said Mr. Thornhill, who was unemployed. "Being a chef is the best thing in the world you could do. It's fun, you meet people, it's teamwork."
Back in Chef Dalton's class on knife skills, the platoon mentality was still building.
"I want all of you to give your knife a name," he said. "It's your best friend. If you have good knife skills, you will never be without a job."
Such motivation made some of the students a little enthusiastic. "Hey, that's not a sword!" Chef Dalton told one as he led the class through the rocking motion of basic chopping. "Now, some of you are going to develop blisters. I suggest you just let it go. It's part of life in the kitchen."
So are cuts, the class was reminded, after Chemin Terrero, 19, sliced his thumb. "It's not going to discourage me at all," he said, clutching the bandage that Mr. Dalton had applied. "I'm going to fight the good fight."
Mr. Terrero, from Brooklyn, was unemployed, but he said he sees his future clearly. "I was a confused individual, but now, I want to be a chef," he said. "I just hope I don't bleed to death."
Just a few weeks before, Sean Reed, 26, was himself learning how to use a knife. But now, in Mr. Sheehan's sauce class, he was slicing his way through a tray of roasted tomatoes with verve and elan.
Mr. Reed, a musician, said he was planning on moving to Paris after the course, where he hoped to stay with a friend and intern in a restaurant. "I'm a little nervous," he said. "The French are known for their cooking, and I don't want to make any mistakes."
Of course, mistakes are as much a part of the kitchen as they are anywhere else, a point Chef Sheehan made as he introduced the class to the pantheon of French sauces. The names -- bechamel, veloute, sauce Robert -- whizzed by as the chef demonstrated each, along with methods for recovery if the sauce is too liquid, for example. Each student took a taste before moving on to the next sauce.
In Chef Keats's class on pate displays, the students had already ingested the idea that they will make mistakes. "As Chef told us, you don't leave here as a chef, you leave ready to rise," said Rogesta Chisholm. "I can accept that."
It was 4 A.M., and the class was near its culmination as the students laid out the displays of mousses and pates on mirrored surfaces layered with gelatin. Gazing at a seafood mousseline molded into the shape of salmon, Denzel Richards could not contain his enthusiasm. "This is the reason why I come here!" he said. "This is how you make the money."
Ms. Gowan, though, could barely stifle a yawn. "You get used to it," she said. "On weekends when everybody else is sleeping, I sit up watching TV all night."

Chef Gregory Dalton, an instructor in the late-night Culinary Skills Program at the New York Restaurant School, directs a class for aspiring chefs. The classes run from 11 P.M. to 6 A.M., four days a week. Among the topics covered in the first two weeks of the nine-month course, (Chef Gregory Dalton is above left directing the class), are professionalism, food safety, sanitation and equipment. More advanced students, right, try their hand at sauces. (pg. 34); Preparing pates and mousses -- as well as the art of arrangement -- is part of the late-night coursework. The basics are covered early in the course, like how to hold and sharpen a knife, left. And the more advanced students, right, artfully design a fancy pate presentation.

QUESTIONS FOR: Sherman Alexie

 BODY:

Sherman Alexie, a 30-year-old Spokan-Coeur d'Alene Indian, was named among the "Best of the Young American Novelists" by Granta last summer. His latest book is "Indian Killer."

Q: In "Indian Killer," white men in Seattle are cut down by a murderer, possibly Indian, whose identity we never learn. One victim is stabbed repeatedly, eye-gouged and scalped. Why have you been hailed for the type of graphic violence that got Bret Easton Ellis into so much trouble?

A: Ellis took no moral stance about any of it. In my book, everybody is guilty of something. People have said I vilify whites and make Indians so heroic and sympathetic, but the Indians are screwed up, too. 

Q: True, but you're clearly pretty angry with whites, especially ones who try to "connect" by immersing themselves in Indian culture. How would you have whites treat modern Indians?

A: No. 1, recognize that we are sovereign entities, with absolute political, social and economic rights on our land. No. 2, that's all I care about. Other than that, leave our culture alone.

Q: You perform on your own blues C.D. Since blues is a black cultural form, isn't that cultural appropriation?

A: The C.D. is Indian blues. There's a difference. I am trying to be Crazy Horse with a slide guitar.

A Town That Needs Pity

 BODY:
When asked to define what ails their hometown, residents of Lefors, Tex. -- a dusty Panhandle burg of 652 people -- tend to cite the flat local economy and the flatter landscape. Whatever the cause, serious worries about Lefors's future last year prompted Norman Baxter, the local school superintendent (pictured below), to propose a public-land giveaway. The prize: 14 small city-owned lots, winners to be chosen from a national lottery. Conditions: To claim their land, victors would simply have to live on it. Outcome: Discouraging. Since the November drawing, only five of the winners have accepted ... tentatively. Can Lefors really be that bad? We sent a native Texan to find out.
The Overview Virginia Maples and Ben Watson, cheerful city officials both, provide the get-acquainted tour on a chilly Saturday, pointing out local sights like the town cemetery and the bleak, weedy giveaway lots. Lefors's "urban core" consists of a small grid of streets, a few civic buildings and a business or two, and there's not much residential scenery. Trees are eerily fixed in a brushed-back sweep thanks to punishing prairie winds; old tires dot trailer-home roofs. "As you can see, it's ... it's kind of trashy," Watson says. Maples winces. "I mean, that's just being honest about it. But you can go in and clean these old houses up." True, and the prices are hard to beat. Watson's four-bedroom home cost $12,000. "There just isn't any other place in this country," he says, "where you would pay that." 
 Shopping The fluorescent-lighted Taylor E-Z Serve, on Second Street, is a greasy spoon, gas station and convenience store all in one. It is also Lefors's only store. Inside, Carol Preston and Jo Wilemon, outfitted in the E-Z's baby-blue smocks, talk up the town. "It's a nice, quiet, peaceful place," Wilemon says. "You don't lock your door, you don't take keys out of your car." "Yes," Preston concurs, then pauses. Then they both reach the same conclusion and declare together: "And it's only 12 miles to the Wal-Mart in Pampa!"
Family Values Boyd's Garage is a Main Street fixture owned by Derl Boyd, 66, a former Texaco employee. The area's oil and gas business went away in the 80's and never came back, and the men gathered here believe that the sluggish economy is Lefors's worst plague."This damn plan they got to give away land won't work -- there's no jobs," says H. R. Cates, 72. Dennis Boyd, Derl's 42-year-old son, notes that, all the same, Lefors is a good place to raise children and offers "quiet" fun, like community barbecues. "It used to be a fun town," Cates scoffs. "We had bars, whorehouses, all that stuff. Then the town went dry because all the drinkers were drinking instead of voting!"
Night Life Over at J. C. Curley's gas station, at the corner of Second and Main, a gaggle of old-timers agree that the economy stinks, but blame "the Baptists" just as much. In 1965, religious teetotalers pushed through a city law banning the sale of liquor and beer. Discussing the nonexistent local night life, the cantankerous R. C. McPherson, 83, says, "The pool halls left and the churches stayed." Curley agrees, saying that what Lefors really needs is a good, stiff civic drink. Lots of them. "We used to have two little bars, a picture show, three pretty big grocery stores and, gosh, I don't know, I think four service stations," he says in a nasal yelp. "I'd vote a hundred times to make it 'wet' again, and I don't even drink. That would definitely help."

HEADLINE: Crime

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio 

 BODY:
Piece of cake. That's what Michael Connelly makes it look like in his terrific new police procedural, TRUNK MUSIC (Little, Brown, $23.95), when a Los Angeles loser named Tony Aliso pops up dead in the trunk of his car. Aliso was a nonplayer ("probably the last guy in Hollywood who hadn't traded in his Rolls on a Range Rover") who laundered dirty money through his soft-core movie company, and his execution-style murder has all the earmarks of a mob hit. Case closed. Finito. Yawn.
The thing is, Harry Bosch, the L.A.P.D. homicide detective who is the headstrong hero of this bruising action series, doesn't like all the loose ends in the case, especially the ones snaking back to certain law enforcement agencies. He heads for Las Vegas, where Aliso had connections, and disrupts so many criminal transactions that he makes everybody's hit list, including the F.B.I.'s. Targeted as "this year's Mark Fuhrman," Harry goes rogue. 
 Like his righteous cop, Mr. Connelly looks for God in the details. (Watch what he does with a tube of Preparation H.) Every procedure comes with a diagram, every body blow has a follow-up and every grifter on the strip is frisked for some colorful piece of personal history. Harry doesn't much go for Vegas ("Out here in the desert, he was a fish out of water, flopping on the sand"). But after the initial culture shock, he's in his element.
That notorious misogynist Sherlock Holmes speaks uncommonly well of Mary Russell in Laurie R. King's smartly researched and thoroughly enjoyable historical mystery A LETTER OF MARY (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $23.95). In the eyes of her doting mentor, this emancipated woman is "a brilliant young star on the horizon of academic theology." But then, the great man could be prejudiced. He is, after all, married to her.
After meeting in "The Beekeeper's Apprentice" and mating in "A Monstrous Regiment of Women," the oddly matched pair have settled down by 1923 to a life of dull respectability in Sussex. Here they are paid a visit by a female archeologist who leaves with them an ancient Greek papyrus supposedly written by Mary Magdalene, who calls herself "a lost apostle of Jesus of Nazareth." When someone murders the archeologist and tries to steal this extraordinary artifact, the couple take up the chase in London, where the political climate is fraught with intrigue. Between the Zionists on their soapboxes and the academic subversives in their libraries, the air is thick with spies. For all the disparity of their investigative techniques, the ultra-perceptive Holmes and the super-scholarly Russell make an engaging pair of sleuths. Their quick minds and quirky personalities insure a lively adventure in the very best of intellectual company.
Have you ever heard of "a kind of Scottish mafia at the top of some U.S. businesses, persuading people to locate in Scotland"? Me neither; but Ian Rankin makes a good case for this shadowy presence in LET IT BLEED (Simon & Schuster, $21), another top-notch procedural in a brooding series featuring his Edinburgh police inspector, John Rebus.
According to his wife, Rebus is an Old Testament moralist ("Retribution rather than rehabilitation") of classic Calvinist stock ("Let the punishment fit the crime, and then some"). Even his friends call him "the eternal pessimist." All of which makes this dour detective a charming companion on a gloomy case that opens with the messy deaths of two young punks who take a flyer off the Forth Road Bridge and develops into a complex tale of industrial conspiracy and political collusion. With all these problems, Rebus also has to deal with the pitiless climate of Edinburgh, where a freezing wind blows sideways, the better to cut your face. The bleakness is unrelenting, but it quite suits Mr. Rankin, who does his best work in the dark.
Can it be? Charles Paris, the endearingly unemployable actor who plays the "cynical old ham" in Simon Brett's acerbic theater mysteries, has an actual job. A good job, too. SICKEN AND SO DIE (Scribner, $21) finds Charles typecast as that "crafty drunkard" Sir Toby Belch in a summer festival production of "Twelfth Night." In the same spirit of reclamation, he has also sworn off the sauce and reconciled with his wife.
Happily, our hero's reformation doesn't last long. The show's director falls ill at an Indian restaurant, and his replacement, Charles's old nemesis Alexandru Radulescu, reinterprets the play's theme ("sex, sex, sex") and proceeds to swamp the production in "sheer gratuitous gimmickry." More food poisonings further deplete the company ranks. Coincidence? Criminal sabotage? Cheap melodrama? Although Charles's sleuthing skills will never get him the lead in "An Inspector Calls," his theatrical wit is sharper than a serpent's tooth.
Laurali R. Wright draws pretty views of Sechelt, the little village on Vancouver's Sunshine Coast where Sgt. Karl Alberg keeps the watch. The best scenes in STRANGERS AMONG US (Scribner, $21), however, are set against the inner landscape of troubled minds. The sun doesn't shine for anyone in this disquieting suspense thriller: not for 14-year-old Eliot Gardener, who hacked his father and mother to death with a machete; not for Jack Coutts, who is haunted by the memory of his only child, killed by her crazed mother; and certainly not for Alberg, whose soul is weighted with guilt from having failed to intervene in time to help these desperate people.
Ms. Wright works in subtle ways to connect these individual stories. She creates a sense of urgency by letting Eliot escape from a child detention center, and she escalates the tension by giving Coutts a gun and a grudge against Alberg. But the true drama is a psychological one, a tale of remorse and redemption that is played out on private stages, in those secret places where people go quietly mad.

HEADLINE: Trade You a Wedding for a Hair Transplant?

BYLINE: By GITTA MORRIS 

 BODY:
BARTERED babies? It's not the headline-screaming scandal it sounds. For John and Shari Atwater of Hartford, who had no health insurance, it was the perfect solution. Mr. Atwater swapped the services of his auto body business for his wife's obstetrical care.
"Babies cost a lot of money," he explained. "When it comes out of pocket, it hurts." The couple's second child, due in April, will also be a bartered baby, and the Atwaters hope they can barter the hospital bill as well. 
 Frederick Rau, the Hartford doctor who delivered the Atwaters' first baby, believes his group is the first medical practice in the barter books.
"We've done three deliveries on barter, and we have 10 other barter clients," he said. "It makes sense. There are a lot of people among the 37 million Americans who don't have health insurance, but who have skills they can barter."
His group has bartered its services for catering, recarpeted an office and room at a restaurant for its Christmas party.
People have bartered goods and services probably since the beginning of time, but in the past two decades, particularly through the use of computers, the practice has flourished anew.
Last year, 250,000 companies traded an estimated $1.8 billion worth of goods and services through more than 400 barter networks according to the National Association of Trade Exchanges.
Among small businesses, bartering has grown an estimated 10 percent a year since the early 1980's, and an estimated 65 percent of the Fortune 500 companies barter.
Mr. Atwater and Dr. Rau belong to Barter Business Unlimited, a Hartford-based company that acts as matchmaker, bringing together buyers and sellers on a debit and credit basis. For a $195 fee and 12 percent commission from the purchaser, it negotiates price and functions as accountant and banker, keeping track of each client's barter activity and reporting all transactions to the Internal Revenue Service for tax purposes.
That the concept has caught on big in Connecticut was obvious recently when some 1,600 members swarmed Barter Business Unlimited's sixth annual Expo.
Bicycles, skin care products, motel rooms, dance lessons, sexy lingerie, puppies, massages, legal as well as architectural and dental services were selling like proverbial hotcakes, and not a penny of cash was exchanged. In fact, the entire Expo -- caterer, brewery, space -- was done on barter.
While his wife dove into a rack of fur coats, Ron Huard stood by patiently. "I think she has at least one fur coat already," he said with a shrug. The owner of Ron's Transmission Works in New Britain, he knew he could pay for another coat with his car repair bartering credits. He admitted, however, "You do have to watch yourself to keep from getting carried away."
Leon Skolnak, who owns Albe furs of Westport and Cos Cob, had sold four coats in the first couple of hours. "While the economy was so sluggish two or three years ago, bartering got to be big time," he said, hitting on a key theme. As a supplement, not a substitute, to regular cash business, bartering increases a company's working capital and helps to sell excess, slow-moving or close-out inventory without costly markdowns and liquidations, he said.
Pauline Schenck, who runs River Farms, a riding school in Avon, has been a member of Bartering Business Unlimited only since May, but is certainly a fan. "We had a summer camp coming up, and we bartered slots that would otherwise have gone unused," she explained. Her own bartering credits have been spent on having her dogs dipped for ticks, repairing the muffler on the farm truck and getting her copier fixed. "And we've been out for dinner three times," she added.
Restaurants, indeed, are a popular cash-in. "We used to eat it all," said Susan Thomas of Bristol, who offers Creative Parties for Kids. "And then I got smart. Now I barter for my dentists, my eye doctors, and last year I took my kids for a vacation on Cape Cod."
Michael Rose, trade director for the Fairfield division of Business Exchange International, claims his is the oldest and largest bargaining company in the country. Started 36 years ago, it has 105 offices around the United States, Canada, Australia and the Caribbean.
"We are very strong in networking with other offices," Mr. Rose said. "We may not have something in Connecticut, so we pick up the phone or go to the computer and find out if we have it in San Diego. For example, pallet jacks. Or a certain fabric that only a florist would use. We even have car dealerships. I bought my car completely on barter."
"And you can be very creative with it," he added. "Some of our offices have retailers who buy things on barter and sell it to their customers for cash. That's called cash conversion."
Mr. Rose warned, however, that for businesses that have a very small profit margin -- for example, appliance retailers -- bartering is not a good choice. On the other hand, services, particularly those that are labor intensive or have a high mark-up, do well. Hotels, where a number of rooms usually go begging, are an example of ideal bartering situation, he explained.
Most members plow their bartered windfall back into their business or use it to reward their employees, but others use it for personal treats. Barter Business Unlimited arranges a lot of bartered weddings, said Debbie Lombardi, who founded the company in 1992 after working for other barter exchanges. "You're talking everything," she said. "The flowers, the limo, the caterer. When someone calls and says they're getting married, we're so excited. It's second nature to us now."
Hair transplants are popular. So are media time and space as well as building services. Ms. Lombardi said that one company in Wethersfield that is moving and adding on, is bartering almost everything in that project -- the architect, electrical work and construction services as well as the advertising, printing and phone system for the new location.
One of the most intriguing trades, Ms. Lombardi recalled, took her company in a new direction. "We had a member who got hurt last year, and he owed the hospital to the tune of $20,000," she said. "It was really making his cash flow tighten up. We actually called the hospital, and we worked it out so he paid in barter."
Her company also does collections, she noted. "Let's say you're a corporation and you have a hard time collecting your money. Sometimes we can arrange to get it paid off by barter. So for some people, we've made the difference. We've kept them in business."
For many barterers, the experience is more than simply good business. Richard Goldwasser, a psychologist in Manchester and an enthusiastic member of Barter Business, Unlimited, thinks it's the camaraderie that makes bartering so appealing.
"I've met wonderful people. When you barter with people, your backgrounds are kind of the same," he explained.
"People who barter aren't conventional business people," he said. "They barter because they want to improve their business in more interesting ways. There's also trust. You just feel the person is going to do well by you."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Pittsburgh;
For a City's Icons, a Shrinking Hometown Presence

BYLINE: By CHRISS SWANEY 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
ONE after another over the years, major national industrial companies that grew to maturity in Pittsburgh -- including Gulf Oil and Koppers Corporation -- have moved away or reorganized or changed in a way that has shifted their business from the imposing downtown headquarters buildings that had housed them. Now, such concerns are being raised about the Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
Will Westinghouse's move into the media business lead it away from its 23-story, 420,000-square-foot headquarters building on the Monongahela River, its corporate base since 1970? Already it has reduced its presence at the building to 450 employees from about 1,000 in the early 70's. 
 Westinghouse owns the building, and despite rumors to the contrary, it insists that it has no plans to sell. In the last two months, it has begun to market the six floors of vacant space created by its shrinkage. Renny Clark, executive director of corporate services and community affairs, said that Westinghouse was spending $500,000 a floor to get the space ready for new tenants.
The path that Westinghouse is taking contrasts strikingly with the approach taken by Alcoa as it has trimmed its work force during the last two years. Alcoa had fully occupied a 31-story, 442,500-square-foot tower that it built for itself in 1952 on Sixth Avenue, a prime office location off Grant Street, the main downtown commercial street.
Now it is building a new $40 million 236,200-square-foot headquarters six stories high in Pittsburgh's North Side along the Allegheny River. The building is designed for only 450 employees. It is to be occupied in 1998.
At one time Alcoa had 2,000 employees in its headquarters building. Now it has 1,500. In the last two years Alcoa has been trying to sell the building, which it won't need at all after it occupies its new headquarters next year. But all the offers it received were well below its $18 million asking price.
Paul H. O'Neill, the chief executive, has suggested to his board that the building be donated to the city, for use by the region's several economic development groups. Pittsburgh is expected to tell Alcoa in February whether the gift would be accepted. But whether it is or is not, the building will be available for occupancy by next year.
The moves by Westinghouse and Alcoa come at a time when 25 million square feet of downtown office space is already on the market. The vacancy rate amounts to 16 percent, which is above the average of 14 percent for cities nationwide, according to the Pittsburgh office of Grubb & Ellis, the national real estate firm.
"No one is panicking yet," said R. J. Vulgris, director of research of Grubb & Ellis. "Office space is moving slowly now, and it's too early to tell about the effect of Alcoa and Westinghouse space coming on line."
ONE positive sign is that there was a slight improvement last year in net absorption over the year before, when the overall vacancy rate was 17.6 percent, Mr. Vulgris said. Net absorption is the difference between the amount of space leased and the amount given up through departures. Start-up computer companies, law offices and a variety of high-tech firms are the principal new lessees, brokers and consultants say.
Among the leases that helped the city's absorption figures was the growth of Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania, which consolidated from several sites into the former Horne's department store on Penn Avenue. The old eight-story, 376,000-square-foot building was renovated by Blue Cross, which bought the property. Other major leases were the National City Bank of Pennsylvania, occupying 158,000 square feet of the former National Steel Building on Stanwix Street, and Harbison-Walker Refractories, taking 66,000 square feet at the USX Tower on Grant Street.
The changes at Westinghouse and Alcoa fall within a long tradition of real estate moves accompanying corporate shifts by blue-chip companies long identified with Pittsburgh.
The Koppers Corporation, an industrial products manufacturer, which was the target of a hostile takeover in 1988, today occupies only 15 percent of the 459,000-square-foot building on Grand Street that once was its headquarters. Koppers was taken over by Beazer P.L.C., a British construction concern, whose main operations are in Europe. Owned now by the Florida-based United Trust Fund, the structure is a general purpose office building, which is 80 percent occupied by lawyers and small service companies, according to real estate brokers.
Next door to the Koppers building is the former headquarters of the Gulf Oil Corporation, which was once among Pittsburgh's biggest employers. The Chevron Corporation, based in San Francisco, acquired Gulf in 1984. The oil company has no presence in the 44-story structure, though the building is still known in Pittsburgh as the Gulf Tower; it is now owned by A & E Stores Inc., a clothing chain owner based in New York City, It is 80 percent leased by Transarc, a computer software subsidiary of I.B.M.
WESTINGHOUSE has been identified with Pittsburgh since 1886, when George Westinghouse began manufacturing air brakes for the railroads. Over the years, the company not only built its headquarters in the city but also developed manufacturing plants for power-generation equipment, research laboratories, training centers and offices for support staff.
Westinghouse's long-term goal is to maintain its headquarters in the building, utilizing about 168,000 square feet, Mr. Clark said. At the same time, Westinghouse has been trying to dispose of many other properties.
The company's 138,000-square-foot training center about seven miles east of downtown is on the auction block, for example. The two-story brick building, along with 12.2 acres of undeveloped land, will be vacant in March 1997. In its heyday, it housed about 450 workers who worked on panel boards for nuclear power plants.
A technology center in the suburb of Churchill with a million square feet has been on the market for several months. A total of 180,000 square feet was taken by the Northrup Grumman Corporation only two months ago.
ALL these real-estate moves accompany Westinghouse's gradual withdrawal from its core business of industrial and consumer-appliance manufacturing, toward a new emphasis on media operations. Westinghouse bought the CBS last summer for $5.4 billion and is now spending $3.9 billion for the huge Infinity Broadcasting radio operation on its way to becoming primarily a media company. In the process, the company has dropped 25,000 employees worldwide since 1993, leaving about 77,800.
One advantage that the Westinghouse building will find in leasing out space is that there is a 450-car garage in the building. "Other large buildings don't have parking garages within the buildings," said Paul Horan, a broker with Grant Street Associates, which is marketing the property.
"We are marketing the Westinghouse building as a great location with easy access to major roads," Mr. Horan said. "But we may get some competition from the Alcoa building when it begins offering similar office space, too."

HEADLINE: Habitats/26 Beaver Street;
A Residential Beachhead In the Financial District

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
THEY collect things, but unlike most collectors, they do not display them. Instead, they bring them out gradually, as they grow more comfortable with their visitors, opening drawers and cupboards and closets, producing their treasures like conjurers in front of a large audience.
"You're looking for a watch band?" asked John Yardley, eagerly, already rising from the black-and-white diamond-printed love seat in the center of the huge living room of the loft he and his wife recently purchased in the Financial District. "Come. Look." 
 The group of visitors dutifully followed Mr. Yardley into the bedroom while his wife, Bernice Gordon, stayed behind; she had seen this collection. Mr. Yardley, a tall, rugged-looking Englishman, pulled out the top three drawers of an Art Deco chest and -- presto, changeo -- flung them onto the bed.
A collection of watches! Old men's watches of every different description: watches with faces shaped like fans, with the numbers distorted to embrace the weird shape; standard tank watches, watches with amber faces, with Roman numerals, with no numerals, but tiny gold dots -- everything.
"I think I may have some watchbands here," he said. But the bands are never located, primarily because the watches themselves are so fascinating.
"You should see Bernice's watches," Mr. Yardley said. "Now those are really fine."
And so it goes. Mr. Yardley explained that he and Ms. Gordon, a lawyer, have pretty much given up collecting watches. They are now actively collecting ephemera, the collector's appellation for old paper things.
He swung open one of the dozens of cupboards that came with their loft on Beaver Street, right off Broadway near the southern tip of Manhattan. The shelves are lined with black ring-binders, each neatly inscribed with the subject matter. This one contains old corporate letterheads with delicately engraved pictures of the company buildings.
THEY are wonderful looking, often with red accents, designating an award won by the company or when it was founded. Underneath the letterhead is often a bill for goods, written in the spidery black ink of the turn of the century; black ink fading to a coppery script.
"I haven't found a letterhead for this building yet," Mr. Yardley said, "But I'm looking very hard."
The building is 26 Beaver Street, an imposing stone office building that still says Norton Lilly & Company across its broad facade.
"It's a 1908 building," Ms. Gordon said. "Let's look it up in the book." Mr. Yardley jumped up again, crossed the bare maple floor and grabbed another book, this one the city's business directory for 1915. "We have these going back to 1850."
H ERE it is," she said, holding the thick directory on her lap. "Norton Lilly ampersand Company, steamship agents. Broad 5750 was their phone number." Mr. Yardley fetches another book protected by an old brown paper wrapper; it consists mainly of old black-and-white photographs of Broadway buildings from Bowling Green to Central Park. He finds a photograph of the corner of Broadway and Beaver Street, with the building he now calls home in the background.
"I've got so much information on Lower Manhattan," he said. "Boxes and boxes of ephemera."
"So if you want to know something about Lower Manhattan, ask John," his wife said.
When he is not compiling his collections, Mr. Yardley is a furniture designer and maker, with his own shop at the corner of Greene and Canal Streets. But there are traces of his designs in the loft: a tiny table by the bed, a small but complex mirror on the wall. Mr. Yardley's designs are distinctive: he glues together small pieces of boldly grained wood; the grain creates a striped pattern that, at first glance, appears to be marquetry, a craft in which patterns are created by gluing strips of veneer.
"But this is parquetry," Mr. Yardley explained. "The stripes are actually in the wood, not applied." Asked if he was the only person using this technique, he said he was the only one he knew of, "but you know, they say nothing's ever really new."
That's true, but the arrival of people like Mr. Yardley and Ms. Gordon into the Financial District is fairly new -- and for those who can find a loft to buy, the prices can be strikingly low: the couple paid $275,000 for a 2,350-square-foot loft space with a series of huge near-floor-to-ceiling wood windows facing north onto Beaver Street. (That same space, in TriBeCa or SoHo, could easily be double the price.)
The reason, as the couple know, is that the Financial District is still an area of residential pioneers; with Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani's tax incentives for developers to transform vacant office space into residential units, reconstruction is rushing ahead but there is still very little available to buy right now, according to agents. And there is still skepticism about whether the bleak canyons of commerce will ever become the hot area TriBeCa is.
Ms. Gordon and Mr. Yardley, who came to this country in 1978, have witnessed the TriBeCa transformation first hand.
"We lived in TriBeCa in the late 70's and early 80's in a shared rental at Murray and Greenwich," Ms. Gordon said.
"Yeah, we thought it was too expensive," added Mr. Yardley, with a wry laugh. "We started out paying $700 a month, and by the time we left, it was $1,000 a month -- for the whole loft."
BY then, it was the mid-80's, and they looked at more than 100 apartments, Ms. Gordon said. "The thing is -- we hadn't really narrowed our search: we looked as far north as Chelsea." They ended up not that far from where they are now: on Nassau Street, near City Hall.
They bought the apartment, a 600-square-foot one-bedroom with wonderful views, and thought they'd stay for a few years and then move on. They did not reckon on the real estate recession of the late 80's and early-to-mid 90's.
"We were stuck there for 10 years," she said ruefully. "We bought it at exactly the wrong time."
Then, about a year ago, they realized that although the sale market for the place had still not improved, the rental market was going through the roof, and they rented it out, using the income to cover their expenses. They began to look for a new place to buy.
They only looked at two other places before they saw the loft on Beaver Street.
"John wanted it the minute we walked in," Ms. Gordon recalled. "But I hesitated, and by the time we called, a few days later, we were told it was gone." She was crushed; she felt it was her fault. But the deal fell through, and they didn't hesitate. They bought it Sept. 24.
At the final inspection, the couple discovered that a leak had destroyed their kitchen counter. They tried to get the sellers, two elderly women who the new owners say had never lived in the loft, to pay for the repairs. The sellers wouldn't budge.
"Then Steve Kliegerman, the real estate agent, did something very unusual," Ms. Gordon said. "He said he'd send somebody down to fix the counter for us. The closing went through, and he actually did fix the counter. Isn't that amazing?"

THE ERROR OF OUR WAYS
By David Carkeet.
275 pp. New York:
Henry Holt & Company. $25.
A linguist by training, David Carkeet is a novelist whose work explores language as the primary instrument of human communication -- and deception. In his dark domestic comedy "The Error of Our Ways," he trains his professional ear on the intertwined fates of two men whose lives, on the surface, could not be more dissimilar. 
 Ben Hudnut, "the Nut King of St. Louis," is a Saab-driving, vanity-plated entrepreneur whose raison d'etre is to "bring a cost-effective, quality cashew to America." A paragon of upper-middle-class virtue, he is a man who can "raise good kids, run a solid business and have an affair."
At the dimmer end of the social spectrum is Jeremy Cook, the linguist hero of Mr. Carkeet's previous novels "Double Negative" and "The Full Catastrophe." Once rakish, cynical and a cutting-edge scholar, Cook is now married, cynical and unemployed. He has fetched up in St. Louis, where his ambitious wife is teaching linguistics at a jerkwater college. Cook, who can unravel knotty theoretical problems quicker than you can say "voiceless palatal fricative," is reduced to studying Hudnut's obscenity-spouting 2-year-old daughter. Quite a comedown for the author of "The Woof of Words."
But Hudnut and Cook have one underlying feature in common: the preternatural hubris that can afflict both the capitalist and the academic. And as Mr. Carkeet's astute, entertaining novel progresses, both men can only look on, helpless, as their respective worlds begin to collapse around them.
If they'd only been better listeners they might have averted calamity, for Mr. Carkeet's text abounds with dire linguistic portents. How can Hudnut, the man who put the cash in "cashew," intone the name of his own enterprise -- Crunch -- and not hear an aural harbinger of economic ruin? How can Cook learn of the existence of a man -- also named Jeremy Cook -- who underwent an involuntary orchidectomy and not worry that his own marriage has unmanned him?
Mr. Carkeet, on the other hand, has an infallible ear for the nuances of speech, and this makes him both an acute social observer and an engaging stylist. He shows us the language of class (in Hudnut's suburban milieu, all anyone talks about is "schools, real estate and grout"); the language of eros (a maidenish 42-year-old secretary discovers sex and knock-knock jokes at the same time); and, above all, language for the sheer auditory joy of it (Cook's favorite composer is Karl Ditters von Dittersdorf; Hudnut's living room is awash in "prints and flowers, doilies and tchotchkes, statues and statuettes, knickknacks and gimcracks"). And, for those of us who feel that a novel without a problem in generative phonology worked into the narrative is no novel at all, Mr. Carkeet thoughtfully supplies one, complete with underlying forms, surface forms and phonological rules.
Ultimately, Mr. Carkeet's fine book, which affectingly portrays the perils of middle-aged manhood, is a study of the subtle anthropology of everyday communication. In the author's linguistically heightened universe, even inanimate objects are invested with the power of speech: a can of spray paint utters the memorable line "gonketa gonketa" when shaken; a leather couch on which a fateful liaison took place sighs slowly back into shape. By the time a husband, conversing with his wife, says in surprise, "This doesn't sound like you," we know with some certainty that the union is doomed.
At novel's end, both heroes have undergone symbolic emasculations -- Cook at the hands of his ruthless wife, Hudnut at the hands of an embezzler who nearly costs him his nut business. The attentive reader, however, will not be surprised at this. For surely a man who uses "quality" as an adjective is bound to pay dearly for it in the final reckoning.

BYLINE: By Paul R. Krugman

 BODY:
TWICE IN THE LAST YEAR, EXPERTS ON AMERICA'S ECONOMIC statistics startled the public by suddenly declaring some well-known truths about our economy to be, in the immortal pronoucement of Ron Ziegler, Richard Nixon's press secretary during Watergate, "inoperative."
 
 This is not a technical matter, of interest only to policy wonks. Economic statistics have a direct impact on the Governmetn budget - most notably, Social Security benefits, which are linked to the Consumer Price Index.
 But perhaps even more important, statistics play a crucial role in the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves - in the portraits we paint of the state of the nation. With a sweep of their magic wand, it seemed to many commentators, statisticians had changed economic history, turning poverty into plenitude and overturning whole ideologies about where America is going and why.
 Until last year many people - but not most economists - thought that the economic datas told simple tale. On one side, productivity - the output of an average worker - was rising. And although the rate of productivity increase was very slow during the 1970's and early 1980's, the official numbers said that it had accelerated significantly in the 1990's. By 1994 an average worker was producing about 20 percent more than his or her counterpart in 1978.
 On the other hand, other statistics said that real, inflation-adjusted wages had not been rising at anything like the same rate. In fact, some of the most commonly cited numbers showed real wages actually falling over the last 25 years. Those who did their homework knew that the gloomiest numbers overstated the case - for example, because they covered only blue-collar workers, whose pay increasingly lags that of other employees, or neglected the rising share of health and retirement benefits in total compensation.
 Still, even the most optimistic measure, the total hourly compensation of the average worker, rose only 3 percent between 1978 and 1994.
 And so to many commentators, from Pat Buchanan to Robert Reich, the story seemed obvious. In an age of rapid technological progress and corporate re-engineering, they told us, the output of the average worker was rapidly rising; but because workers were cowed by downsizing and job insecurity, the bosses no longer felt any need to share these gains with their employees. Even solid pillars of the establishment, like Business Week magazine, joined the chorus with a cover story in 1995 titled "Wages: They're Stagnant While Profits Are Soaring. Are We Headed for Trouble?"
 But now the experts are telling us that the whole thing may have been a figment of our statistical imaginations.
 The first about-face came at the beginning of the year, when the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Government agency that calculates Gross Domestic Product, shifted from a "fixed-weight" to a "chain-linked" measure of economic growth. (You don't want to know.) The change had the effect of sharply reducing the estimated rate of productivity growth over the last few years. Then in December a blue-ribbon panel of economists headed by Michael Boskin of Stanford declared that the Consumer Price Index had been systematically overstating inflation, probably by more than 1 percent per year for the last two decades, mainly by failing to take account of changes in the patterns of consumption and improvements in product quality.
 Even the bureau's technical adjustment was controversial, because it seemed to deflate business boasts about a "productivity revolution" in recent years. The Boskin report, however, ignited a firestorm of criticism. Partly this was because of the link between the C.P.I. and Social Security payments, which meant that any downward revision in the index would strike directly at retirees. Many of the Boskin report's harshest critics, however, were outraged because it repudiated a view of the economy on which they had staked their reputations and built their careers. For if inflation has been exaggerated, then the growth in real wages has been understated - and so the whole story about how companies are not sharing productivity gains with their workers evaporates.
 To be fair, there are not many professional economists among those who are wailing and rending their garments. On the contrary, most economists who study the relationship between productivity and wages are relieved at the more or less official admission that some of the published numbers may have been way off, because they already knew there had to be something wrong. When you tried to put the data together into a consistent story about what has been happening to America, you discovered that the supposed facts just didn't fit together.
 As these economists pointed out, if the popular story were true - if the average worker really were producing more and being paid less - then wages must, as a simple matter of arithmetic, have declined as a share of the total economic pie. (Actually, there are some technical qualifications to that arithmetic, but they are not worth worrying about.) The Government, however, collects data on the distribution of income by type - data that are not subject to the technical problems of productivity and inflation estimates. And the implied decline in labor's overall share just hasn't happened - in fact, the share of wages and benefits in national income was just about the same (73 percent) in 1994 that it was in 1978.
 As robot used to say in old science fiction movies, "Does not compute." Like astronomers - whose current estimates inidcate that the oldest stars are older than the universe in which they reside - economists knew that at least one of their numbers had to be wrong; either productivity wasn't up that much, or wages were doing better than reported, or the share of labor in national income was being grossly overstated.
 There are still many details to settle. The Boskin report, in particular, is not an official document - it will be quite a while before the Government actually issues a revised C.P.I., and the eventual revision may be smaller than Boskin and his colleagues propose. Still, the general outline of the resolution is pretty clear. When all the revisions are taken into account, productivity growth will probably look somewhat higher than it did before, because some of the revisions being proposed to the way we measure consumer prices will also affect the way we calculate growth. But the rate of growth of real wages will look much higher - and so it will now be roughly in line with productivity and wages with data that show a roughly unchanged distribution of income between capital and labor. In other words, the whole story about workers not sharing in productivity gains will turn out to have been based on a statistical illusion.
 It is important not to go overboard on this point. There are real problems in America, and our previous concerns were by no means pure hypochondria. For one thing, it remains true that the rate of economic progress over the past 25 years has been much slower than it was in the previous 25. Even if Boskin's numbers are right, the income of the median family - which officially has experience virtually no gain since 1973 - has risen by only about 35 percent over the past 25 years, compared with 100 percent over the previous 25. Furthermore, it is quite likely that if we "Boskinized" the old data - that is, if we tried to adjust the C.P.I. for the 50's and 60's to take account of changing consumption patterns and rising product quality - we would find that official numbers understated the rate of progress just as much if not more than they did in recent decades. (Many observers would argue that the qualitative changes in the way ordinary people lived were far greater between 1945 and 1970 than between 1970 and the present.) The popular impression that the first postwar generation experienced an immense improvement in living standards, while the second did not, is still correct; the American dream may not be dead, but it is certainly not what it was.
 Moreover, while workers as a group have shared fully in national productivity gains, they have not done so equally. The overwhelming evidence of a huge increase in income inequality in America has nothing to do with price indexes and is therefore unaffected by recent statistical revelations. It is still true that families in the bottom fifth, who had 5.4 percent of total income in 1970, had only 4.2 percent in 1994; and that over the same period the share of the top 5 percent went from 15.6 to 20.1. And it is still true that corporate C.E.O.'s, who used to make about 35 times as much as their employees, now make 120 times as much or more. The living standards of most people may be up in absolute terms, but these growing disparities still make it increasingly questionable whether it makes any sense to think of ourselves as a middle-class society. And despite the revisions, there is not much question that the incidence of really severe poverty in America has increased, not fallen, over the past generation. While these are real and serious prolems, however, one thing is now clear: the truth about what is happening in America is more subtle than the simplistic morality play about greedy capitalists and oppressed workers that so many would-be sophisticates accepted only a few months ago. There was little excuse for buying into that simplistic view then; there is no excuse now.

HEADLINE: Rich, 82, and Starting Over

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
WHEN John Kluge was a sophomore at Columbia University in 1935, he flirted with the idea of moving to China to start a competitor to the British East India Company. A scholarship student, Mr. Kluge was earning extra money by working as a private secretary for a classmate, the son of the President of China, Lin Sen.
With his pluck, his classmate's contacts and China's bountiful supply of tea, the 20-year-old Mr. Kluge imagined putting the world's most powerful trading company out of business. But in 1937 the Japanese bombed Shanghai, and the ensuing war between China and Japan dashed the young man's fantasy. 
 Now, six decades older and $7 billion richer, Mr. Kluge is finally making his foray into China -- bringing wireless telephone service to a country where tea is common but talking on the telephone is not. The venture, he contends, is far more than an aging man's fantasy.
"Every country needs two things to develop economically: transportation and communications," Mr. Kluge said recently in a rare interview at the New York offices of his publicly traded telecommunications and entertainment company, Metromedia International Group. "Communications is not a luxury in emerging markets; it is a necessity."
At the age of 82, when even the most restless of tycoons are ready for a silk-lined retirement, John Werner Kluge is starting his most ambitious enterprise. Having amassed one of the world's great fortunes in television and cellular communications in the United States, Mr. Kluge is busy constructing wireless cable television and telephone networks throughout Russia, the Baltic states, Eastern Europe and China.
Metromedia is still a bantam in a world of communications heavyweights. The company has fewer than 200,000 customers for its grab bag of services, which range from wireless cable TV and telephone to paging. Frederick W. Moran, a media analyst at Furman Selz, estimates that the company's overseas wireless operations will generate just $6 million in operating cash flow this year, on $100 million in revenues.
Mr. Kluge is better known for Metromedia's other major asset, Orion Pictures, the respected Hollywood studio with a troubled financial past. His personal holdings also include the Ponderosa and Bonanza restaurant chains; two Manhattan hotels, the Barbizon and the Radisson Empire, and even a professional soccer team, the MetroStars.
Clearly, though, Metromedia's communications division is the crown jewel in Mr. Kluge's empire, and he wants to polish it to a fine luster. Its wireless networks are capable of reaching roughly 100 million people in cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg in Russia; Tbilisi, Georgia, and Riga, Latvia. Metromedia's newest joint venture -- with a Chinese phone company called Golden Cellular -- will enable Mr. Kluge to reach another 70 million potential customers in several major Chinese cities, including Tianjin and Nanning.
Mr. Kluge's strategy rests on a beguilingly simple premise: More than half the people in the world have not yet made their first telephone call. In China, only 4 people in 100 have their own phones; in the United States, 6 of every 10 do. By getting into these embryonic markets and by using wireless technology, Mr. Kluge believes he can establish a valuable beachhead -- before mightier players like AT&T or Deutsche Telekom.
"This is like the United States in the 1800's, when people were staking their claims to land," said Richard J. Sherwin, a bluff, chain-smoking cellular-telephone executive whom Mr. Kluge hired to cobble together his network. "The difference is, you don't mine under the ground," he said, "you mine the airwaves."
OF course, exporting communications to these countries is not as simple as putting up microwave towers and handing out portable phones. In addition to the usual cultural hurdles, there are significant political barriers. In Russia and Eastern Europe, the governments require foreign companies to own communications networks in partnership with local companies. In China, foreign companies must limit their involvement even further, by owning stakes in joint ventures that provide services to locally owned network operators.
Nor is it clear how many people will clamor for Metromedia's services. Signing up just 1 percent of potential customers, Mr. Sherwin acknowledged, would constitute great success. And while Mr. Kluge has sought out less competitive corners of the communications business, he still faces some hefty rivals in those markets, including France Telecom in paging and Motorola in wireless local telephone service.
So far, Wall Street has treated Mr. Kluge's venture with the skepticism it might have shown him had he taken on the British East India Company more than 60 years ago. Metromedia's stock languished in the mid-teens for most of 1996 and closed at $10.625 on Friday, giving it a market capitalization of $702 million.
Signaling how serious he is about the company, Mr. Kluge recently turned over day-to-day control to Stuart Subotnick, the 54-year-old former tax lawyer who is his partner and most trusted adviser. That prompted the resignation of Metromedia's chief executive, John D. Phillips.
"If Stuart is the chief executive, it means that this is where they want to make a public stand," said David J. Londoner, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim & Company.
But the question remains: Why would one of the world's richest men choose this forbidding business landscape for what is very likely to be the last stand of his career?
Colleagues say Mr. Kluge is perpetually driven to devise new challenges and then to surmount them. Sumner M. Redstone, a fellow billionaire who became the chief executive of Viacom last year at 72, said, "You can't measure these things chronologically."
The compact, laconic Mr. Kluge, however, offered a more prosaic explanation: he said he was merely a businessman on the prowl for a good opportunity. Speaking in his characteristically slow, soft cadences even when indulging in a bit of salesmanship, he said, "We don't want to just make progress; we want to make geometric progress."
Mr. Subotnick, who has made an estimated $500 million by investing with Mr. Kluge, puts it another way. "We've never gone where the herd goes," he said. "By the time the herd shows up, it's too expensive."
ZIGGING when the crowd zags has served Mr. Kluge well ever since he came to the United States as a poor immigrant from Germany in 1922. After serving in military intelligence in World War II and working as a salesman for a paper company, Mr. Kluge (the name means "clever" in German) bought his first media property, an AM radio station in Silver Spring, Md., for $15,000 in 1946.
At the time, many experts were predicting that radio would soon be eclipsed by television. But Mr. Kluge acquired more radio stations and used the cash they generated to diversify into TV -- not by buying glamorous affiliates of the Big Three networks, but by buying a string of independent stations.
Mr. Kluge's radio and television outlets became the core of his first publicly traded company, Metromedia Inc., and occupied his attention for more than three decades. From 1959 to 1981, the company's stock rose from 69 cents a share to $569, when adjusted for stock splits.
In the early 1980's, Mr. Kluge expanded into cellular phones. But he did it through the back door: Metromedia spent $300 million to buy radio paging companies in big markets like Boston and New York. The paging companies were then applying for cellular telephone licenses. When the companies got them, Mr. Kluge suddenly owned a fistful of the most valuable cellular licenses in the country for a fraction of what he would have paid if he had pursued the licenses directly.
But Metromedia's stockholders balked at his expansion and fled, pummeling the share price. So in 1983, he borrowed heavily to buy the entire company himself for $1.2 billion. A few years later, when the demand for TV stations and cellular franchises drove up their value, he began methodically selling them off: Rupert Murdoch acquired the stations for $2 billion to form the backbone of his Fox network, while Mr. Kluge sold the cellular franchises to a variety of companies for more than $4 billion.
By the time he finished his gargantuan garage sale, Mr. Kluge was sitting on about $6.5 billion in cash -- enough to catapult him to the top of Forbes magazine's ranking of the 400 wealthiest Americans. (He has since dropped to fourth, after the Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen at No. 1 and No. 3, and the investor Warren E. Buffett at No. 2.)
Though Mr. Kluge has the properties and perquisites of the superrich -- a 10,000-acre estate with private chapel in Charlottesville, Va., a sumptuous duplex apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a 206-foot yacht and a just-completed $30 million mansion in Palm Beach, Fla. -- colleagues say he is a notorious skinflint when it comes to business deals.
In 1988, he waged a fierce battle with Mr. Redstone in negotiating to buy Mr. Redstone's shares in the Orion film studio. People familiar with the talks said the two men had narrowed the price to within 25 cents a share, but spent a whole afternoon haggling over the last quarter. Splitting the difference, Mr. Redstone finally agreed to sell his shares to Mr. Kluge for $18 each.
Given his thrift, it is not surprising that Mr. Kluge was put off by several of the hottest new communications businesses of the early 1990's. He said that direct-broadcast satellite television and personal communications services were exciting, but the costs of entering these businesses were steep, and legions of companies had already entered the field.
Instead, Mr. Kluge focused on wireless cable, a rather unglamorous technology that got its start two decades ago as a way to bring pay TV to rural areas. The technology works by beaming signals from a central microwave tower to dishes clamped to the roofs of houses or apartment buildings. But what Mr. Kluge liked most about it was that it was much cheaper than ripping up streets to lay wires.
Rather than focusing on the crowded American market -- where the Government was auctioning off wireless licenses for billions of dollars -- Mr. Kluge zeroed in on virgin markets like Eastern Europe and China. With their pancake-flat geography and their tall apartment towers, many Eastern European cities are also particularly well suited to wireless transmission.
Using Mr. Sherwin as his advance man, Mr. Kluge scooped up licenses overseas for wireless cable, paging and international toll calling. In all, he collected licenses for 27 cities across 15 countries -- from Moscow to Almaty, Kazakhstan. Other players like U S West Inc. also went after licenses, but they focused on cellular telephone.
WINNING licenses in emerging markets is largely a matter of knowing the right politicians. As Frank Miller, a telecommunications entrepreneur with broad experience in the Russian market, puts it: "You've either got to have ties with the Kremlin or to regional strongmen."
Mr. Kluge has invested considerable time in developing those ties and has not hesitated to use his money as an extra lure. His approach to the Republic of Georgia is a case study in mixing diplomacy and financial largess.
Mr. Sherwin, who is 53, began promoting wireless communications to Georgian Government officials in 1991, when the country was in the throes of a civil war. During one early visit, he recalled, a sniper's bullet whizzed through the lobby of his hotel, narrowly missing him. To demonstrate his commitment to the country, Mr. Kluge donated $250,000 to fuel planes that were flying food and medical supplies to Georgia.
By the time the first round of fighting subsided, in 1992, the Government had awarded Metromedia national licenses for paging and international toll calling, plus a license to offer wireless cable in Tbilisi. Then last summer, Mr. Kluge traveled to Georgia for a private meeting with President Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Kluge and the Georgian Ministry of Communication signed a deal granting Metromedia a license for its nationwide cellular phone business.
"We don't want to do things through third parties," Mr. Kluge explained. "We want to see the whites of their eyes, and they want to see the whites of our eyes."
In Georgia and other markets, Metromedia's cable customers receive a mix of channels similar to a basic cable lineup in the United States: a handful of local broadcast channels, plus cable channels like CNN, BBC and the Discovery Channel. Metromedia programs a local channel in most markets, according to Mr. Sherwin, and subscribers pay an average of $15 a month.
Now, Mr. Kluge also hopes to offer a new form of local telephone service, called wireless local loop. Like wireless cable, local loop beams a signal from a tower to a rooftop dish. But unlike cellular service, in which the call signal bounces from tower to tower as the caller moves, wireless local loop signals are transmitted to a fixed site.
Wireless local loop is intended to compete with regular local phone service in markets where the wired network is not fully developed. Metromedia is testing it in two Chinese cities, Tianjin, near Beijing, and Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province.
Despite a wave of early publicity, however, the technology has not caught on among many other telecommunications companies because of concerns about voice quality, said Alexander Kabanovsky, an analyst at Pyramid Research, a telecommunications research firm in Cambridge, Mass.
Metromedia is hitting other bumps, too. The company's joint venture with Golden Cellular has been dogged by misunderstandings between the two companies. On a recent morning, Mr. Sherwin was on the phone with a Metromedia colleague, worriedly discussing the company's relationship with a senior executive at Golden Cellular.
In Russia, Metromedia must battle the perception that foreign companies make lofty promises and fail to deliver. In 1989, U S West was among several big phone companies that teamed up to build a fiber-optic cable in Russia. The project foundered because it ran afoul of laws limiting the export of technology to that country.
But Metromedia's bigger image problem is on Wall Street, where the company is regarded as a hodgepodge of businesses with little obvious connection to each other.
In addition to its telecommunications assets, Metromedia owns three film studios: Orion Pictures, the company that Mr. Kluge gained control of in 1988 for $204 million but that later filed for Chapter 11 after a string of money-losing films; the Samuel Goldwyn Company, which Mr. Kluge purchased last year for $125 million, and the Motion Picture Corporation of America, acquired in 1995 for $22 million. It is a producer of low-budget films including "Dumb and Dumber." Together, the three give Mr. Kluge the world's fourth-largest film library, with 2,200 titles.
Mr. Subotnick said the film studios provide Metromedia with a ready source of programming for its wireless cable systems. But several analysts said they contributed little to Mr. Kluge's broader strategy, and some argued that he ought to sell them. Mr. Moran of Furman Selz noted that Kirk Kerkorian paid $1.3 billion last year for MGM, a once-sickly studio with a library roughly the same size as Metromedia's.
Mr. Kluge said he acquired Samuel Goldwyn to buttress his library and to make Metromedia a more viable player in Hollywood. The studios plan to produce 12 to 14 low-budget movies this year. But after shepherding Orion through a messy bankruptcy, Mr. Kluge seems open to exiting the film business at the right price. "If someone comes up with a figure for the whole company, we'd have to look at it," he said.
Mr. Kluge said he was also anxious to sell some other odds and ends in Metromedia's portfolio, including a maker of lawn and garden equipment and a stake in a sporting goods company.
As for Metromedia's anemic stock price, Mr. Kluge professes to be unconcerned. Although he owns roughly 23 percent of the reconstituted company -- a stake worth $162 million -- Mr. Kluge's Metromedia shares represent a fraction of his total net worth. And he predicted that investors would eventually put a higher value on the company than its current premium of more than two times projected 1996 sales. "It will take time to put flesh on the dream," he said, "It will take time for people to realize that this is a business, not a plaything or a lark."
For Mr. Kluge to take the long view at 82 is testament to how much this new venture has caught his imagination. But he also allowed himself a nostalgic, and uncharacteristically personal, moment -- noting that his foray into China was something of a bookend for a career that began with a college sophomore's quixotic dream.
"If I had gone there after college, I would have undoubtedly married a Chinese woman," said Mr. Kluge, who divorced his third wife, Patricia, in 1990. "Maybe I would have been a lot happier."

 CORRECTION:
A table last Sunday with an article about the expansion plans of Metromedia International Group under its chairman, John Kluge, misstated two measurements of the company's finances. Metromedia's debt-to-capital ratio, a measure of the company's leverage, is 62.7 percent, not 3.66. The price-to-sales ratio, a measure of the market's fondness for the company's stock, is 2.3, not 5.23.

 BODY:

A Passage to Panama
Q. Can one just go back and forth through the Panama Canal and spend a few days nearby, flying there and back? -- Ethel G. Romm, Bedford, Mass.
A. You can book a complete tour from the United States, including a full or partial transit of the canal, or make your own way to Panama and arrange a canal trip there.
But if you do it on your own you will still have to arrange accommodations and a flight, so it might be cheaper and simpler to take a package after all. 
 Transits of the canal are made on ships operated by Argo Tours of Panama: the Islamorada, which holds up to 125 passengers, and the 500-passenger Fantasia del Mar.
Argo's agent in the United States is Panama Discovery Tours, which describes itself as the only exclusively Panama tour company in North America. Its most popular packages are Panama Discovery Tours, which run from three to eight days.
The three-day package consists of two nights in a hotel and either a partial transit of the canal and a guided tour of Panama City or a full canal transit. Prices for a double range from $260 a person in economy to $383 in deluxe. Prices for a single go from $326 to $530.
Meals and air fares to Panama are extra, but the company offers special air fares of $548 round trip from Kennedy International Airport and Newark International Airport. The New York flight connects through Houston; the Newark flight is direct.
The longer tours, which include a full transit of the canal, add such features as a trip through the rain-forest canopy in the Anton Valley. Visitors are lifted to the canopy and brought down again by a system of ropes and pulleys.
Prices range from $380 for a double in economy for the four-day tour to $1,318 for a deluxe double on the eight-day trip. Singles run from $488 to $1,832. At least one meal a day is included.
Tours will run next year from Jan. 23 to 30, March 27 to April 3, May 29 to June 5, July 24 to 31, Sept. 25 to Oct. 2 and Nov. 27 to Dec. 4. Starting this year, from Dec. 23 to 30, the company will offer a "Christmas on the Isthmus" tour starting at $1,015 for an economy double to $1,445 for a deluxe double. An economy single is $1,246 and the deluxe single $1,960.
More information: Panama Discovery Tours, Post Office Box 130, Clarita, Okla. 74535; (800) 813-3115, fax (405) 428-3499. The company can be reached on the Internet at http:// www.panamacanal.com.
Argo's two ships make full transits every other month from Dock 17 in Balboa, on the Pacific Ocean, to Cristobal, on the Atlantic. Passengers are taken back to Balboa, a distance of about 45 miles, on an air-conditioned bus. The trip takes from six hours to eight hours or more, depending on canal traffic, and costs $90, children 12 and under $69.
Partial transits cost $45 a person, $25 for children 12 and under. The price includes brunch.
More information: Argo Tours, Apartado 9662, Panama 4, Republic of Panama; 011 (507) 228-6069, fax 011 (507) 228-1234.
 
Staying in Mexico
Q. I would like to stay in Zihuatenejo, Mexico, this winter for a month to six weeks. Any suggestions for finding a long-term rental overlooking the beach? -- Leslie Gregg, Charlottesville, Va.
A. This type of property is still relatively rare in Zihuatenejo, a Pacific fishing village that offers a quiet beachfront alternative to the next-door glitz of Ixtapa. The best choice is among time-share houses, which in Mexico still usually refers to the rental of hotel rooms for a particular week of the year over several years.
Nonetheless, there are a few other options.
A beachfront house with three rooms, a kitchen and a patio rents for between $500 and $1,200 a week in the low season and $900 and $1,500 a week from Dec. 15 to Easter and from July 1 to Aug. 31. But if you plan to stay for a month or more, considerable discounts are available.
A typical property might have an ocean view and a five-minute walk to the beach. Many condominiums have access to a pool.
A one-bedroom condominium rents for between $300 and $1,000 a week, depending on the season, while a four-bedroom villa tends to start at $1,500 a week in the high season and $1,000 in the low season.
There are a number of brokers who can help explain the options: Elizabeth Williams, APDO 19, Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, Mexico; (52 755) 4.26.06, fax (52 755) 4.47.62.
Tim Sullivan, 229 Paseo de las Golondrinas, Colonia Campo de Golf, Guerrero 40880, Zihuatanejo, Mexico; (52 755) 3.14.18.
Condo and Villa Authority, 305 North Pontiac Trail, Walled Lake, Mich. 48390; (810) 669-7500, (800) 831-5512; fax (810) 669-7506.
Villas International, 605 Market Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94105; (415) 281-0910; fax (415) 281-0919.
Residential Condominiums International (Georgina Velasco or Marlene Marin) 1855 Homero, Colonia Los Morales Polanco, Mexico, D.F. 11510, Mexico (52 5) 283-1081.
 
Russian Medical Help
Q. I will be visiting Moscow and St. Petersburg next year. Where can I get medical help, with English-speaking doctors, if I need it? -- Paula Eisenstein Baker, Houston
A. There are at least three places in Moscow where foreign visitors can receive medical aid, and one of them has a branch in St. Petersburg.
The American Medical Center opened in Moscow in 1991 and offers full 24-hour emergency services for members of its medical plan and a full array of medical and dental care. The center, at 2d Tverskaya-Yam skaya Street, Building 10, telephone (7 095) 956-3366, fax (7 095) 956-2306, offers a $50-a-month individual plan that is open to tourists. Each visit costs from $160 to $215, depending on the service. The centers are open Monday to Friday from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. in Moscow and 8:30 A.M. to 6 P.M. in St. Petersburg. Its St. Petersburg center is at 77 Fontanka Street, (7 812) 325-6101, fax (7 812) 325-6120.
European Medical Center, 10 2d Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street, (7 095) 251-6099, offers consultations by English-speaking European doctors. A visit to a doctor is $80, a visit to a specialist $100, with no membership fee. Open Monday to Saturday from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M., with a night emergency phone at 229-6536.
International Medical Clinic, 31 Grokholsky Street, (7 095) 280-7138, fax (7 095) 280-8677, charges from $80 to $105 for a doctor's visit. A two-month membership costs $50. TERENCE NEILAN

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Making Time Fly in Preseason Sarasota

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
A HOODED black wool coat and ankle boots are anything but de rigueur in Florida. I figured this out the minute I landed at the Tampa International Airport (on a USAir flight, round trip from New York for $194) one warm, sunny afternoon in late November. At the airport office of Alamo Rent-a-Car I made a quick change into a sun dress, then stashed the coat and boots in the trunk of an economy-class gray Corsica ($22 a day), where they stayed, like a corpse in one of the paperback mysteries I always take along when I go to Florida.
I was reading John D. MacDonald mysteries on this trip, because the author lived in Sarasota, where I was headed -- about an hour-and-a-half drive south of Tampa. I took the scenic, watery route, west on Highway 275 over flat, glistening Tampa Bay, south to St. Petersburg, and then back over the bay on the 4.1 mile long Sunshine Skyway ($1 toll), a stunningly futuristic suspension bridge with two long arching piers that look like bug tentacles, probing the Gulf of Mexico. Halfway across, I tuned into a radio station playing Otis Redding's "(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay." And when I swung south onto Route 19 in Palmetto, I found the only thing my arrival in the Sunshine State lacked -- seafood, in the form of a crab burger to go (for about $10) from Lee's Crab Trap I, composed of pure white meat. 
 I could have made straight for my destination by taking Highway 41, the old Tamiami Trail, which cut a cement path across Florida from Tampa to Miami in 1928 and now serves as Sarasota's main thoroughfare. But I wanted to see the thin ribbon of barrier beach islands that lines the Gulf Coast, especially during the quiet, uncrowded and affordable off season. So I turned west in Bradenton near the spot on the Manatee River where the Spanish explorer Hernando DeSoto landed in 1539, and crossed the Intracoastal Waterway. Then I cruised down slender Anna Maria Island and Longboat and Lido Keys, which are connected by drawbridges where brown pelicans ride in the water like misshapen gondolas and snow birds drive slowly, hunting for winter rentals. Modest Beach bungalows yielded to ritzy high-rise condo complexes halfway down Longboat Key. When I rounded St. Armands Circle, a chic shopping district developed in the 1920's by the circus impresario John Ringling, I caught my first sight of the shining city on Sarasota Bay, fringed by palm trees, golf courses and the sort of grandiose Mediterranean-style mansions you rarely see on the Mediterranean.
But I still had about 10 miles to go before I reached the Crescent House Bed-and-Breakfast, where I'd booked a single with a shared bath for two nights at a bargain rate of $45 a day. Then I planned to indulge myself by spending two days in an apartment at the Banana Bay Club for $90 a day. Both places lie on Siesta Key, a six-mile-long island at the south end of Sarasota Bay, with a quirky, casual ambiance and a beach renowned for its fine white sand. I could have reserved a hotel room (for an off-season rate of about $75) on Longboat or Lido Keys, which are more centrally situated, or really economized by staying in one of the mainland motels splayed along Highway 41 (with rates as low as $50). But as I'd planned it, my accommodations came to about $68 a night, which seemed reasonable, and I liked the sound of Siesta Key.
As I crossed North Bridge from the mainland the fat red sun looked about ready to plop into the gulf, and at the white frame Crescent House on Beach Road the owner's black standard poodle licked my hand in welcome. Built in 1914, before the Mediterranean craze struck in the 20's, the place has an old Florida feeling -- a comfortable enclosed front porch with louvered windows, strategically placed space heaters and four bedrooms on two floors. Mine was a tidy chamber at the side of the house with a patchwork quilt on the double bed and an old TV, up a long set of steps from the small, dark bath. The sound of traffic on Beach Road occasionally intruded, and the buffet breakfast (of cereal, rolls and fruit) didn't really tempt me. But the price was perfect, as was the location -- just across the street from Beach Access No. 8.
The gulf water was too chilly for swimming, but in the mornings after breakfast I jogged the half mile of pillowy sand at Siesta Key Beach, among sea urchins and healthy-looking retirees. Then I'd amble into Siesta Village, about five minutes away from the B & B, to restock my MacDonald paperbacks at the Used Book Heaven (yellowing, but for half the cover price) and stop at the Broken Egg or the Patisserie Cafe Continental for a second breakfast, which along with happy hour is what village restaurants do best.
My first full day was a beautiful Saturday, which started off like a mystery novel, with me waiting on a stone bench in front of a ramshackle pink frame house on the slightly seedy north side of Sarasota. I'd read in a guidebook that Mango Walking Tours of downtown (for $4.95) start at this unprepossessing address, led by a former member of the city's Historic Preservation board. No other tour-takers arrived, however, and when the guide, Whit Rylee, appeared he wasn't the wizened old Sarasotan I'd expected -- but young and tanned, wearing sandals, a Hawaiian shirt and a straw hat.
 TOGETHER, we strolled past the handsomely restored Sarasota Opera House and boarded-up John Ringling Towers Hotel, which opened with great fanfare on New Year's Eve 1926, but closed when the Sarasota real estate boom went bust and even rich Mr. Ringling felt the pinch. All the while, Whit elucidated the city's architecture (from Dwight James Baum's Art Deco to the stark Sarasota School) and spun stories about turn-of-the-century Sarasota, when the first mayor was a Scottish golfer.
Afterward I lunched downtown on the patio at the Lemon Coast. There the peel-and-and-eat shrimp appetizer (for $4.75) comes with a moist towelette and I noticed that the label on my bottle of Tommy Bahama Bungalow Blonde (for $3.25) said, "Life is one long weekend."
So it seemed up Highway 41 near the Convention and Visitors Bureau, where I picked up brochures full of coupons. At the far side of the parking lot the Sarasota Lawn Bowling Club, established in 1927, was packed, and on a bench outside the Sarasota Visual Art Center an elderly man sat with an alligator chained to his leg. On second look, I realized that they were part of a sculpture by Jack Dowd, a Sarasota artist who is a practitioner of a style you could call Florida Absurdism.
But I didn't stay long, because I was headed to the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, which lies on the grounds of the Venetian Gothic Ringling mansion, Ca' d'Zan, constructed in 1926 by Mr. Baum, near an airplane hangar of a building that houses the Ringling Circus Museum (admission $8.50 for all three sites, but I got $1 off with a coupon). Mr. Ringling's taste in art, as evidenced by the museum's dour Dutch portraiture and lugubrious religious painting, failed to transfix me; and his eclectic winter home is in the midst of a three-year renovation, with rooms denuded of furniture and scaffolds shrouding the facade in a manner that is truly Venetian. But I adored the Circus Museum, with its vintage bandwagons, costumes, posters and displays on stars of "The Greatest Show on Earth," like the diminutive General Tom Thumb. When he met lanky Abe Lincoln in 1863, the President remarked, "Here we have the long and the short of it."
Later, the bar at Marina Jack's in Bayfront Park looked to me like a good place to watch the sun set and sip a Bombay gin martini (for $4.50). Outside a bride dressed like something out of "Gone With the Wind" was posing for her wedding pictures, while inside, the man next to me complained about his second divorce, which had left him with little more than a yacht. This was getting depressing on a number of levels, so I polished off my olives and moved on to dinner at a restaurant called Turtles on Little Sarasota Bay. It is bayside, near the south tip of Siesta Key, and specializes in "killer shrimp," which I tried in red sauce over linguine (for $10.95) and finished off with a slice of creamy Key lime pie to go (for $2.50) from Captain Curt's Crab and Oyster Bar just up Midnight Pass Road.
To sum up my last two extremely busy days in Sarasota you could borrow the caption from a 1929 poster in the Circus Museum that describes "The Human Projectile," Hugo Zacchino, as "A living person shot through space with violent velocity from the mouth of a cannon." I watched live sea horses bound across a tank in the Mote Marine Aquarium (admission $8) on Lido Key, toured the pens of disabled egrets, herons and pileated woodpeckers at the Pelican Man's Bird Sanctuary (admission free, though a donation is requested), and learned from a plaque in the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens (admission $7) that Alexander the Great's whole army camped beneath a spreading banyan tree during the India campaign in the fourth century B.C.
I also moved to the charming, immaculately kept, seven-unit Banana Bay Club, on Heron lagoon between Crescent and Turtle Beaches. There I swam in the pool, canoed on the lagoon, bicycled on Midnight Pass Road and cooked -- because I was tired of eating out and my one-bedroom apartment, decorated in Caribbean colors, had a well-equipped kitchenette. I got tomatoes and oranges from Albritton Fruit, a bottle of California chardonnay from the Crescent Market and $10 worth of precracked stone crab claws from the Siesta Fish Market -- all of which made an excellent repast.
But on my last night in Sarasota I cooked something really special for dinner -- three little gray snappers I caught myself on a six-hour fishing trip aboard the Flying Fish II (for $30), berthed at Marina Jack's. I told the captain that I was no angler, so he stationed me next to a tall retiree originally from Hoboken who called himself Lucky Duff and who took the trip several times a week. As soon as the boat reached deep water, Duff taught me how to bait my hook with chopped squid, cast out my line and wait patiently -- which I did, while others around me pulled in porgies, red and black groupers and an ugly dogfish. Meanwhile, Duff exchanged his golf hat for his lucky fishing hat, told me about his son who won a $500,000 lotto jackpot and threw back little fish saying, "Go tell your grandpa I set you free."
He never caught the big sea bass he wanted and on our way back to Sarasota Bay a gust of wind stole his fishing hat. But I still say he was lucky. And I'm thinking it could have rubbed off on me, which is why I just bet $2 on the New York Lotto.
 
The bottom line for a Florida trip
 I spent an average of $108 a day while in Sarasota. My rental car (almost always a necessity in Florida) from Alamo, (800) 327-9633, cost $111, including tax but not insurance, and gas cost $14.
To reach Tampa I flew on USAir, (800) 428-4322, from New York, with a change of planes in Washington, for $194 round trip. The Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport is much more convenient, being just a few miles north of downtown Sarasota on Highway 41; but at the time I booked my ticket, flights there were either full or too expensive.
Information about Sarasota is available from the Sarasota Convention and Visitors Bureau, 655 North Tamiami Trail, Sarasota, Fla. 34236, (800) 522-9799; for Siesta Key maps and brochures, contact the Siesta Key Chamber of Commerce, 5100B Ocean Boulevard, Sarasota, Fla. 34242; (941) 349-3800, fax (941) 349-9699). Or refer to Steve Rabow's Official Guide Book on Sarasota, Bradenton and Venice, with a coupon insert; to get a copy contact Steve Rabow's Official Guide, Post Office Box 15332, Sarasota, Fla. 34277; (941) 927-1771.

Where to Stay
The Crescent House Bed-and-Breakfast, 459 Beach Road, Sarasota 34242, (941) 346-0857, has four guest rooms, two of which share a bath; shared bath rooms cost $82 and private bath rooms $110 from Dec. 1 to May 10, but the owner is flexible about pricing in the off season.
The Banana Bay Club, 8254 Midnight Pass Road, Sarasota 34242, (941) 346-0113, has a pool, dock, canoe, bicycles, and seven units that range in price from $125 to $185 Dec. 15 to May 15, and $90 to $150 May 16 to Dec. 14; a two-night minimum stay is required, as is cash.
Also on Siesta Key, I quite liked the Sara Sea Inn at the Beach, 6760 Sara Sea Circle, Siesta Key, 34242, (941) 349-3244, fax (941) 349-4999, near Crescent Beach, with a pool, volleyball and shuffleboard courts. Rates: $79 to $179 from May 1 to Nov. 30, $69 to $199 from Dec. 1 to Jan. 31, and $129 to $249 from Feb. 1 to April 30; and the Tropical Breeze Inn, 140 Columbus Boulevard, Sarasota 34242 (941) 349-1125, fax (941) 349-0057, with a pool, Jacuzzi and cottages, suites, and town houses scattered around Siesta Village, priced from $99 to $199 from mid-December to January, and $109 to $225 from February to mid-May.

Where to Eat
Lee's Crab Trap I is on Route 19 near the Terra Ceia Bridge, (941) 722-6255; the Lemon Coast is at 35 South Lemon Avenue downtown, (941) 316-0235; Turtles on Little Sarasota Bay is at 8875 Midnight Pass Road, (941) 346-2207; and the Siesta Fish Market is at 221 Garden Lane, (941) 349-2602.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 16, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Frugal Traveler column on Jan. 5, about Sarasota, Fla., referred incorrectly to John Ringling Towers. A reader's letter received on Jan. 29 points out that the building did not close for good when Ringling felt the pinch of a sharp decline in real estate. Further research shows that the building, first opened in 1926, was known under a series of names: first El Vernona, then the John Ringling Hotel and finally John Ringling Towers; it closed permanently in 1980. It was never known as the John Ringling Towers Hotel.

HEADLINE: Russia Must Do More For Foreign Investors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While Daniel J. Arbess (letter, Dec. 31) is correct that there are a multitude of foreign investment opportunities in Russia today, consider that the primary barrier to the influx of foreign capital in the past five years has been the Russian Government's inability or unwillingness to create a more hospitable investment climate, specifically in the area of corporate tax reform, the enforcement of private property rights and currency convertibility. 
 Until recently, foreign investors have steered clear of Russia because of instability in the investment environment. Most who have ventured into the brave new world of Russian business have met with frustration at the hands of the tax, legal and regulatory institutions.
Privatized businesses and entrepreneurs have made a great contribution to reforming the Russian economy and must continue to be the agents of growth and development. But they cannot establish mechanisms for enforcing contracts, institute tax incentives for investments and insure that the ruble becomes fully convertible.
In any economy, this is government's role. You reported on Dec. 28 a sharp increase in the level of foreign investment in Russia in 1996. This is attributable to perceptible progress by the Russian Government in addressing these areas of investor concern..
Mr. Arbess is correct that Russian industry needs Western investment. But before that investment will flow freely, the Government must do more to persuade investors that Russia is a good place to put their money.

HEADLINE: Washington, D.C., Needs Money Management

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Jan. 1 editorial "Staying Afloat in D.C." makes a bow toward the real problems in the District of Columbia's government -- massive mismanagement and excessive spending -- but then falls into the usual trap of writing about how the city's woes are also very much a revenue problem. 
 You cite familiar arguments: If only the District could levy a commuter tax, or if it received the money it deserved from the Federal Government's occupancy of 41 percent of the city's land, it could right itself.
Yet, despite its economic problems, the District has higher per-capita income than any state in the nation. Because of this wealth, a reasonable tax system could finance needed services. And the problems you cite notwithstanding, from 1980 to 1990 the city's annual revenues from Federal and local sources increased by $1.3 billion.
But more important, consider the spending side of the District government equation. From 1980 to 1990, Washington saw a 54 percent increase in operating costs. In Washington's schools, while the national average for spending per pupil was $5,717 in 1990, the District spent at least $9,377 per pupil.
No, the problem is not that the District government can't get enough of the citizenry's money. It is that government has deeply violated the public trust in deciding what to do with it.

HEADLINE: For Financial Printers, It Is Adapt or Die

BYLINE: By STACY LU 

 BODY:
At first glance, the financial printing industry appears to be facing an uphill battle in surviving the digital age.
After all, the industry has received increasing warnings of the imminent demise of its traditional business: printing reams of government-mandated forms, brochures and securities prospectuses. 
 Since May, companies have been required to make electronic filings of initial public offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, the S.E.C. announced in 1995 that companies could meet Federal disclosure regulations in many cases by delivering financial information electronically.
Investors can now find plenty of information on line. And a site on the World Wide Web is becoming an increasingly important corporate brochure.
So what is the financial printing industry to do? Why, embrace the very technologies that are threatening its core business, including the electronic S.E.C. filing system known as Edgar (for electronic data gathering analysis and retrieval), Web publishing and CD-ROM's.
As a result, financial printers are surviving, even flourishing.
The three industry leaders, Bowne & Company of New York; R. R. Donnelley Financial, part of R. R. Donnelley & Sons Company of Chicago, and the Merrill Corporation of St. Paul, had combined sales exceeding $1.1 billion in their most recent year. Bowne alone reported sales of $501.4 million, an increase of 28 percent over the previous year.
Because different printing jobs require various expensive presses, the industry is specialized. As well as offering competitive ink-on-paper printing rates, financial printers must know how to handle the many particulars involved in producing S.E.C.-approved documents, including timing, paper and typeface sizes, and confidentiality requirements, as well as proofreading and other services.
This expertise, printers say, includes electronic communications. Of the 63,064 filings made in the first four months after Edgar went on line in May 1996, 12,138 of them were handled by Bowne, with the three industry leaders together filing 40 percent of all electronic submissions.
In addition, there are numerous sites dealing with initial public offerings on the Web, calling for Internet publishing expertise that printing companies are eager to offer.
"How do you think these I.P.O.'s get on the Web?" asked Tom Vos, marketing vice president for Bowne.
"People come to us and say, 'We still need those 100,000 paper copies to distribute to our clients, but we now need the electronic version,' " he said. "In the last year or so, those same clients are saying, 'We still need those 100,000 paper copies, we still need the electronic distribution, and we now need a version suitable for the Web.' "
The industry is still struggling to overcome setbacks it has faced since the mid-1980's. Commercial printing employment has declined 34 percent in New York since 1989, according to the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
The introduction of computers in the production process obliterated some segments of the industry like typesetting and photo engraving. Expensive New York real estate drove plants to Connecticut and New Jersey. And in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash, many financial printing companies disappeared.
Such warning signals encouraged companies like Bowne, founded in 1775, to begin adapting to new technology.
"We've had to set up a lot of computer applications worldwide," Mr. Vos said. "Maybe we were lucky when Edgar came in when it did, and alerted us that we needed to get ourselves more literate in some of the new technologies. The retraining has been going on almost constantly."
Of course, the big financial printers have the edge of experience in dealing with sensitive financial information. For decades, they have helped clients satisfy the painfully detailed labyrinthine Government disclosure requirements.
Investment bankers, lawyers, auditors and representatives from an issuing company may spend days sitting in a printer's offices making last-minute changes to a hefty prospectus booklet for an initial public offering, which perhaps must be forwarded to other experts worldwide for proofreading, then back to the printer, and so on.
"It's a very involved, sensitive, highly confidential and emotionally charged process," said Carol Robbins, vice president for marketing and product development at Donnelley Financial.
Financial printers are also familiar with tight deadlines and global demands. For example, Ms. Robbins said, Donnelley Financial once had to print 200,000 copies of a 600-page prospectus in 72 hours, from scratch.
Yet some of the changes from the digital age may close in on the big printers faster than they can counter them. Electronic financial publishing needs more expertise than equipment, making it easier for law firms, smaller printers and clients themselves to join the fray.
"The competition is out there quite strongly," said Ivan Obolensky, a vice president and printing industry analyst at Shields & Company in New York. "There are an awful lot of mom and pops who can do something and chip away at the margins. And there are a lot of very good hotshot high-tech companies."
Companies that routinely offer debt offerings often have their own in-house Edgar filing systems, said David Rosenstein, a Bowne spokesman.
Printers also face competition from on-line initial public offering services. For example, IPO Data Systems Inc. of Elmhurst, Queens, sells -- for $100 a year -- a subscription to one-page profiles of initial public offerings, including company descriptions, financial basics, the primary underwriting groups, filing ranges or prices, uses of offering proceeds, and more. Alert-IPO! from Ostman of Torrance, Calif., sends information and analysis via E-mail on pending offerings for $34.95 a year. The Renaissance Capital Corporation of Greenwich, Conn., which has about 1,000 visitors a day to its free Web site (www.ipo-fund.com), also provides information on some initial public offerings.
Still, printers have made inroads by acquiring or investing in similar products. Bowne has a minority interest in Cybernet Data Systems of Wilton, Conn., developers of Edgar Online, a Web site that provides real-time Edgar filings for a monthly fee of $9.95.
In November, Bowne also acquired IDOC Inc. of Los Angeles, which provides language translation services for the computer industry.
In December, Donnelley Financial started IPO Prospectus, an interactive data base with information on all initial public offerings over the last three years (except for small-business corporations), with IPO Crossroads of San Francisco, a portfolio analysis company. Donnelley Financial also teamed up in May with Prospectus Plus of New York to offer multimedia CD-ROM's, on which financial information can be presented with video, animation and sound.
But paper still remains important in initial public offerings. According to the Securities Data Corporation, companies filing initial offerings from Jan. 1 to Oct. 1, 1996 (except for small-business corporations) spent more than $100 million to print prospectuses.
Still, it is no secret where growth potential in the initial public offering market lies. "The use of print will increase as the use of electronic information does," said Dick Vinocur, editor of Dick Vinocur's Footprints, a printing industry newsletter published in Fort Lee, N.J. "But I tend to believe that printing won't grow as fast as the electronic product. If you want information on any company, it's a lot easier going on the Net than calling up the company and getting a 10-K and a prospectus sent to you."

HEADLINE: Moving From the Card Catalogue to the Internet

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY 

 BODY:
What is the gross national product of Belize? Who invented polyester? How smart is the average pig?
Five years ago, the best way to find answers to questions like these was to go to a library and ask the librarian for help in finding the appropriate books and periodicals. Today, the same information is available on the Internet, but finding it may still require the assistance of a librarian. 
 As technology has made more data available than can be bound in books or catalogued by the Dewey decimal system, the field of library science has changed drastically. While it is still a discipline dedicated to finding, filtering, organizing, evaluating and presenting information, it now requires a great deal more technical expertise with electronic information and computer networks. These new demands, in turn, have opened a raft of new career opportunities, attracting considerably more people to the profession over the last decade.
In response, many universities have converted their schools of library science into schools of information and library science or, increasingly, just schools of information.
"Information has always been the focus of library studies, but recent technological developments mean that there are now vast stores of information beyond what is contained within the walls of libraries," said C. Olivia Frost, associate dean of the University of Michigan's School of Information in Ann Arbor.
As a result, becoming a degreed librarian these days means taking courses like Implementation of Distributed Information Systems, Web Site Design and Network Management.
"A third of the titles currently on our list are about the Internet; that's up from zero six years ago," said Patricia Glass Schuman, president of Neal-Schuman Publishers Inc. in New York, a supplier of textbooks to library and information science schools.
With their technological expertise, fewer recent graduates of library and information science programs are actually becoming librarians. Take John Powell. After graduating from the University of Michigan School of Information last year, hebecame data base manager and Webmaster for the State Appellate Defenders Office in Detroit. "The field is rapidly expanding to include a wide range of career opportunities," he said. "It's not just cataloguing books anymore."
Mr. Powell's duties include maintaining a World Wide Web site linked to a data base of legal research as well as conducting Internet training seminars for defense lawyers throughout the state.
Although there are no comprehensive job placement statistics for graduates of library and information science schools, officials at the American Library Association have noticed a marked increase in the number of professionally trained librarians pursuing nontraditional, technologically oriented careers. "More and more, we're hearing titles like cybrarian, information specialist, Webmaster, knowledge navigator and data base manager," said Elizabeth Martinez, the association's executive director.
Administrators from top library and information science schools report a similar trend. "A growing percentage of our students graduate to work outside traditional library settings," said Brooke E. Sheldon, dean of the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Texas in Austin.
She estimated that nearly 25 percent of last year's graduating class went on to nontraditional library jobs like information brokers and network managers, while her counterparts at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana gave numbers of 30 percent and 40 percent. In the late 1980's, only 2 percent to 9 percent of library science graduates took such nontraditional jobs.
"There is high demand today for people who understand how to find, organize and distribute knowledge," said Lois Remeikas, who as director of knowledge and information management for Booz Allen & Hamilton, a consulting firm, has watched her department double in the last two years.
Indeed, companies like Monsanto, Ford Motor, Microsoft, Intel and CNA Insurance have begun to intensively recruit library and information science graduates to fill such positions as scientific searcher, configuration manager, records management analyst and graphic multimedia designer.
In a shift from the past, corporate representatives now show up regularly at library and information science schools to attract students and, in the case of CNA Insurance, have even set up special internship programs.
"Industry has come to realize the competitive advantage of hiring professionals who not only know how to find strategic information quickly, but how to evaluate its validity and present it coherently," said Lynn Eastabrook, dean of the University of Illinois School of Information and Library Science.
The recent increase in job opportunities for library and information science specialists has inspired more people to enter the field. The American Library Association's figures indicate that this year's total enrollment at schools of library and information science in the United States and Canada is up 47 percent from 1986. And membership in the association itself has swelled to 58,112 in 1996 from 42,361 in 1986 -- an increase of 37 percent.
The trend is even more striking at some individual institutions. For example, the University of Texas has twice as many library and information science students now as it did in 1990. And applications for admission to the University of Michigan's School of Information are up 50 percent for the latest class over the previous year's class.
Also, more men are showing interest in what was once considered a woman's career. Most library and information science schools report a 10 percent increase in male students within the last five years.
Mr. Powell, at the Appellate Defenders Office in Detroit, said the field's new emphasis on information technology, particularly related to computers, had changed the image of library science. No longer is it seen as the occupation of spectacled spinsters who delight in telling people to hush.
"Because of the important and crucial role they are able to play in this complex information age, there's new zip to the stereotypical profile of a librarian," Dean Sheldon at the University of Texas said.

HEADLINE: America's Obligation to the U.N.

 BODY:
When the Clinton Administration announced last May that it would veto Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term as United Nations Secretary General, American officials said his removal was necessary to persuade Congress to pay the billion or so dollars in dues the United States owes the U.N. Washington got its way and Mr. Boutros-Ghali was replaced by Kofi Annan, who is highly respected in Washington and elsewhere.
Yet some Congressional Republicans are unwilling to pay the debt until Mr. Annan carries out major structural reforms. The Administration rightly expects that Mr. Annan will be a more effective advocate than Mr. Boutros-Ghali for reforming an organization that is patronage-ridden, bureaucratic and still keyed to a world dominated by the cold war. But withholding the dues is counterproductive. The Administration, while continuing to press vigorously for reform, must make good on its implicit promise and persuade Congress to pay up now. 
 The man who has taken the dues hostage is Senator Jesse Helms, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Helms advocates cuts that would truly cripple the U.N., which is not surprising considering his view of the U.N. and most international agreements and treaties as dangerous infringements on American sovereignty.
Mr. Annan deserves the benefit of the doubt. He has an excellent record as an administrator and detailed knowledge of the U.N. He has repeatedly said that reform is his top priority. Clinton Administration officials say the failure to pay up undercuts their own efforts to press for an end to waste and inefficiency at the U.N. Anger over the debt cost the United States its place on the committee that oversees the organization's budget. An early retirement program for a few hundred U.N. staff members considered less productive was stalled by a lack of funds. When Administration officials try to enlist Western European allies in reform programs, they get a lecture on the American debt.
Although more needs to be done to reform the U.N., Mr. Boutros-Ghali did more than any other Secretary General. He cut the New York staff by one-third. He created the office of inspector general, which has uncovered and corrected inefficiency. He installed Joseph Connor, an American who formerly led the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, as chief financial officer. Mr. Connor has greatly improved administration of the U.N.
Mr. Annan's task is to build on these achievements. There are, for example, six different organizations working on economic development that might be consolidated. More important than simply shrinking the U.N., however, is making it more effective in a world where the end of the cold war changed many things. The U.N.'s development organizations must be reoriented toward the challenges posed by the now-widespread acceptance of market economics. The end of East-West conflict allows the U.N. to more effectively control regional arms races and threats like chemical and biological weapons.
Mr. Annan brings considerable strengths to the task of reform. The U.N. staff trusts him and member states respect him. He has spent decades acquiring an intimate knowledge of the organization in several posts, including controller.
But Mr. Annan's reach is limited. He has no power to touch independent agencies like Unesco. On big reforms he can only make suggestions that must be approved by member states. His commitment to reform is only as good as theirs, and many nations have balked at changes that threaten their use of the U.N. as a patronage pit. The United States has been as guilty of this as any other nation. The solution is for all countries to join in allowing the Secretary General to choose quality candidates for U.N. posts, rather than pushing their own nationals.
Reforming the U.N. requires the cooperation of its members. The United States, which has done more than any other nation to foster reform, can help now by paying its dues.

HEADLINE: Free Trade Goes South With or Without U.S.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Just over two years ago, President Clinton emerged from a meeting with 33 Western Hemisphere leaders and made an ambitious pledge. By 2005, he promised, a "Free Trade Area of the Americas would stretch from Alaska to Argentina" and "will be the world's largest market."
Since then, barriers to trade and investment have indeed begun to topple, thanks to the dozens of agreements that Latin American and Caribbean countries are signing with one another. 
 For its part, though, the United States has mostly been sitting on the sidelines, hobbled by what Latin American officials and trade experts describe as a lack of will, leadership and commitment.
"What we are seeing is the consequences of two years of drift," said Robert A. Pastor, director of the Latin America and Caribbean programs at the Carter Center in Atlanta. "Every previous administration was hungry for an opportunity like this, but Latin America wasn't ripe for it. Now that Latin America is genuinely interested, the United States has been out of focus."
The resulting vacuum, largely the product of American electoral politics and the Mexican financial crisis, has quickly been filled by countries like Brazil and Argentina.
Putting aside their historic rivalry, South America's two giants have aggressively taken the lead by forging a four-nation market called Mercosur -- a Spanish contraction of Common Market of the South -- with more than 240 million people, a total annual output of $1 trillion and a definition of free trade somewhat different from Washington's.
Already the world's fourth-largest unified market, Mercosur is deep in negotiations with the European Union and with neighboring groups in Latin America.
In addition, the Prime Ministers of Japan and China and the President of South Korea have all made state visits to Latin America in the last few months, looking for opportunities in an area they long viewed as a United States preserve. Taiwan's Prime Minister is scheduled to do the same soon.
"What is in fact in the making is a South American Free Trade Area," said Marcos Rodriguez Mendoza, a Venezuelan economist who is the chief trade adviser to the Organization of American States. Economic integration is becoming a "reality," he said, with or without Washington.
In Central America and the Caribbean, a similar process is under way, driven largely by the Clinton Administration's failure to keep its promise to extend to those regions the benefits enjoyed by Mexico and Canada, Washington's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
As a result of Washington's inaction, the regional groups to which those small countries belong are now seeking agreements of their own with Canada and Mexico, as well as with Mercosur, the European Union and East Asia.
"I think everybody in the hemisphere is keeping all options open," said Richard Bernal, Jamaica's Ambassador to the United States and chairman of the working group for small nations set up at the Miami meeting. "While the United States is the main trade partner, if Nafta does not look like it's going to permit accession in the foreseeable future, then countries have to keep other countries in mind, including relations outside the hemisphere."
Even a cursory glance at trade figures reveals that Washington's economic stake in Latin American and the Caribbean, the fastest-growing market for American exports, is enormous. United States trade within the Western Hemisphere is not only much larger than trade with Europe or Asia, but consistently registers a surplus that helps offset large deficits elsewhere.
An American trade official who deals with Latin America said the Clinton Administration viewed the spread of regional agreements that excluded Washington not as a challenge to American leadership but as something that "can be very helpful to the Free Trade Area of the Americas process."
When Latin American nations link up among themselves, he added, "it makes it easier for them to go the last step," when the time comes to deal with the United States.
"Frankly," the official continued, "we would be doing that ourselves if we had the authority. We are not as far along in the process as we would like to have been."
Chile, which has emerged from military dictatorship to have the fastest-growing economy in Latin America, provides perhaps the best example of United States disengagement and the resulting shifts in economic strategy.
At the 1994 Summit of the Americas meeting here in Miami, the leaders of the three Nafta countries announced plans to expand their group to include Chile through a "fast track" process, with that country's President, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, looking on.
"We have been the Three Amigos," Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada proclaimed. "Now we will be the Four Amigos."
But a week later, the Mexican peso collapsed. That forced the United States into a controversial bailout of its Nafta partner and made fast-track membership for Chile politically unpalatable. Then the American election cycle began, killing any chance for bold measures on trade.
In response to what it perceived as America's lack of interest, Chile has negotiated a free trade agreement with Mercosur and revived its ties with the five-member Andean Pact, which this fall began separate talks with Mercosur. Chile recently signed a free trade agreement with Canada to supplement a similar accord it has with Mexico, which had already reached free trade agreements with Colombia and Venezuela.
"The Chileans have been kept standing at the church, waiting for the groom to arrive," said Bernard W. Aronson, who was Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs during the Bush Administration. "After a while, to maintain your own dignity, you take off the wedding dress and go find another boyfriend."
With Mr. Clinton about to begin a second term, the next few months will be crucial to bringing the United States back into the process, government officials and economists throughout the hemisphere said. "We can no longer postpone taking decisions on certain important things," said Ambassador Bernal of Jamaica.
Latin American and Caribbean countries will be looking, their leaders make clear, for evidence of American commitment to reviving the fast-track process, either in the President's State of the Union Address or when President Frei visits the United States in late February.
"If you say no to Chile, you have said no to free trade," said the Foreign Minister of one medium-sized Latin American country. "It is a litmus test." The 2005 deadline remains attainable, the official added, "that is, if you are still interested."
At a conference in Miami on Thursday, Thomas F. McLarty, the former White House chief of staff who is Mr. Clinton's point man on Latin American issues, said the Administration remained committed to free trade and would "continue to lay the legal and economic framework for Chile's accession to Nafta, including fast-track."
If the hemisphere fails to build on the principles of the Miami conference, he said, "we may lose this moment forever."
But Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza of Chile said membership in Nafta no longer "has either the urgency or the importance it had in 1994." Over the last two years, he added, "our country's position has consolidated internationally and we have signed agreements of great scope."
As a result, government officials and trade analysts say, it is more likely that negotiations will take place between two or more blocs or regions than that Latin American countries will come hat in hand, one after another, asking permission to join Nafta.
One indication of Latin America's growing confidence came recently when President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina jokingly said before heading off for a visit to Washington that if the United States and its Nafta partners wished to join Mercosur, they would be welcome to do so.

Immune to Reason

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Why are Americans so cynical about government these days? Scholars and commentators deplore the phenomenon, but sometimes the public has reasons for its feeling. Consider what has just happened on the issue of marijuana use for medical purposes.
The voters of California and Arizona, by large margins, approved ballot initiatives to let doctors recommend marijuana for pain relief and other medical purposes. The Clinton Administration's response, announced last week, was to say that the referendums would be overriden by the Federal policy on marijuana: total prohibition of its possession or use for any purpose. 
 The reasons given by Administration officials for their decision were so thin as to evoke cynical reactions. Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug czar, said many voters in California and Arizona were "asleep at the switch" in approving "hoax referendums." In other words, voters can be disregarded as fools when they disagree with us.
The most regrettable aspect of the Administration response was its dismissive treatment of the medical issues. General McCaffrey said that marijuana had no demonstrated medical benefit that was not available from other drugs. "America has gone way beyond smoking dope to manage pain," he said.
Many doctors -- and patients -- disagree. They claim that marijuana eases the nausea that may accompany chemotherapy, and controls vomiting that may cause dangerous weight loss in AIDS patients. Another use is to treat the eye disease glaucoma.
In fact, the Federal Government has approved an anti-nausea medicine, dronabinol, that includes marijuana's active chemical ingredient. But some of the patients who have tried it say it is less effective, and far more expensive.
The medical claims and counter-claims are just that: claims. They have never been resolved by approved scientific methods. And the Administration response effectively blocked what could have been a highly useful test of the claims in Arizona and California.
"The door is open to examine any drug," General McCaffrey said, including marijuana. Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said, "The National Institutes of Health will continue to review the claims about the possible benefit of smoked marijuana for a small number of indications."
But there was cold comfort for scientists in those statements. Indeed, it is not unfair to label them hypocritical. For the Government has done all it can, over many years, to prevent any fair test of the medical claims for marijuana.
Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, who organized a quick Senate hearing last month to scorn the two state referendums, said that the Drug Enforcement Administration had looked into the claims in 1987-88 and found "no legitimate medical use for marijuana." Its inquiry, he said, had been "under the guidance of an administrative law judge."
But in a perceptive commentary in The New Yorker last week, Hendrik Hertzberg noted that Senator Hatch had left out a rather important fact. The administrative law judge, Francis L. Young, had reached the opposite conclusion.
"The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people," Judge Young found, "and doing so with safety under medical supervision." The D.E.A. overruled him.
The Clinton Administration was not alone in its reaction to the state referendums. Conservatives who usually talk about states' rights cheered the Clinton decision to override state law.
The reason is no secret. Drugs arouse paranoia in politicians. That is why, for many decades, drug policy has been immune to examination in the light of reason and experience.
"Instead of demonizing marijuana, America's Government should take the opportunity to find out if it has any medical value." That statement was made not in some radical paper but in The Economist of London. It said the issue should be approached scientifically, and the way to start was "not to crush the experiments in California and Arizona but to monitor them." For our political leaders, that is too rational.

Glimpse of the President Through a Tinted Glass

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: SMITH BAY, St. Thomas, V.I. Jan. 5

 BODY:
His woes have made Fatman almost slender, but they did not stop him from trying to brighten President Clinton's vacation here.
"Hail To The Chief Love Fatman Family," read the construction-paper sign in black marker, one of the few greetings along Mr. Clinton's motorcade route here. 
 "I was welcoming the President of the United States," Fatman said simply, as his chihuaha, Chi Chi, cautiously sniffed a stranger's toes on Saturday morning.
Fatman, a six-footer whose given name is Richard Husband, weighs about 210 pounds. "I was 300 pounds, man," he said sadly, in a gentle Caribbean accent. "Look at me. Stress."
"Fatman's," his nightclub, never recovered from Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Out back, boards from the roof of his band shell are still scattered on the ground, and the only entertainment on display before the empty wooden bleachers is an aged Chevy Nova, rusting away on cinder blocks.
Mr. Husband has been unable to get any Government help to restore his club, and has gone into default. He did not appear to expect help from Mr. Clinton, who is vacationing here. But he said he liked the President because "he means well."
"Of all the Presidents, to me, it seems like he gives everybody a chance," he said.
Mr. Husband said he had watched as Mr. Clinton's motorcade swept past his sign one day, and he was pretty sure that he glimpsed the President through tinted glass. Someone, he remembered with a smile, even tooted the horn.

A Peripatetic President
As President, Mr. Clinton, who returned to Washington today after four days here, has proved a rootless vacationer.
Unlike George Bush, he cannot escape to a beloved ancestral estate like Kennebunkport, Me. Nor has Mr. Clinton found a cherished, if borrowed, retreat, like Harry Truman's "Little White House," the commandant's residence on the Key West naval base.
Instead, Mr. Clinton and his family have roamed the land, passing through a series of borrowed and rented homes and hotel rooms.
Mr. Clinton came to St. Thomas, aides said, because the Gores recommended it. They stayed a couple of years ago in the same home that the Clintons used this time, the Sand Dollar Villa, overlooking a 30-yard stretch of private beach on Magens Bay. Mr. Clinton plans to report the value of the stay on his income taxes as a gift.
The surroundings may have been unfamiliar, but the Clintons easily made themselves at home. They spent their four days here swimming, playing cards and reading, with the President occasionally vanishing for a round of golf. Mr. Clinton, his aides said, declared that a day spent snorkling from a catamaran had been "perfect."

The Clintons' Night Out
Most efforts by merchants to tempt Mr. Clinton out of his family cocoon for a visit failed. But he caught at least one local proprietor completely off guard. At about 10 on Saturday night, Secret Service officers poured into Eunice's Terrace ("A West Indian Dining Experience").
Eunice Best, the owner, thought as they vanished into her bathrooms and kitchen that they were just protecting the President's motorcade route, which passed her door. Then a man in a tie walked up and told her the Clintons were coming.
"I just went to pieces," she said. "I started crying." While the Clintons ate, she telephoned her mother with the news.
Sitting beneath a squealing ceiling fan, the Clintons shared some conch appetizers. Mrs. Clinton had a vegetable plate, while Mr. Clinton ordered the catch of the day, a fish called the "Old Wife."
Mr. Clinton declared that he loved the Old Wife.

A Model News Program
Sorry, but culinary bulletins were the kind of details that the White House Press corps, biting its nails in paradise, had to make do with here. Guiltily responding to the tug of work amid parasailing and snorkeling expeditions, reporters scratched for news, with meager results. When one Clinton aide announced that "there's an unconfirmed report that the President saw a barracuda yesterday," Bill Plante, of CBS, interjected: "CNN has interviewed the barracuda."
But one reporter has found more than enough exciting news in the Presidential visit: the "Good News Guy," Alexander Randall 5th. Mr. Randall broadcasts Good News Headlines on WSTA, an AM radio station here. "We don't do fires, we don't do murders, and we don't do a lot of other dumb stuff that's typically news," said Mr. Randall, who described his four-minute, daily segment as "upbeat, positive, hero-oriented news."
Mr. Randall started his program after Hurricane Marilyn ripped through the islands in September 1995, because residents needed a pick-me-up, he said, and because so many heroic volunteers poured out of the woodwork.
The result is a program that any vacationer, and particularly any vacationing President, would love.
This was the opening of Mr. Randall's Jan. 2 report: "Good morning, Mr. President, here's your special report. Bosnia is O.K.; Peru is better. Israel and the Palestinians are not O.K., but you can't fix that today. The American economy is O.K., the American people are O.K., too. Weather today should be clear and sunny, with a high around 85 degrees. Take another round of golf, and go for a swim."

HEADLINE: A Hint on Rates By Fed Official

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 5

 BODY:
The economy is growing slowly enough, and with inflation sufficiently in check, to keep the Federal Reserve from raising the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans anytime soon, a Federal Reserve governor suggested today.
"We're looking at measures of core inflation which are still declining," Laurence Meyer, the governor, said. "So while there may be some danger in the forecasts, it's enough to keep us on alert, but not enough to take us off the sideline." 
 After expanding at close to a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1996, growth should slow to a rate of 2 percent to 2.5 percent this year and next, Mr. Meyer said at the American Economic Association conference here.
Forecasts by Fed officials of 2.5 percent or slower growth, unaccompanied by inflation warnings, are usually interpreted by analysts as signals that rates will not be changed.
The Fed's Open Market Committee, which sets interest-rate policy, next meets for two days beginning Feb. 4.

HEADLINE: World Helps to Rebuild Bosnia, but Work Is Slow

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
A year after the United States and other donors pledged nearly $2 billion to rebuild Bosnia, most of the country remains in tatters, international aid organizations and Clinton Administration officials say.
But as the World Bank and the European Union, which are overseeing the rebuilding effort, prepare to ask countries this week for $1.4 billion to keep the work going for another year, they say that the process so far has gone as well as can be expected and that Bosnians should see better living conditions this year. 
 The European Union, the United States, dozens of other countries and aid groups pledged $1.8 billion last year to a projected four-year, $5.1 billion plan to get Bosnia's economy working, repair the worst of the war damage and set up a government.
Two-thirds of the $1.8 billion has been spent or soon will be, and the rest is expected to be used this year.
Officials involved in the effort said that considerable progress had been made in developing programs to fix roads, bridges and housing, and that the decimated economy was twitching back to life.
But they acknowledged that the progress had only partly filtered through to most Bosnians, especially those who had been forced from their homes and now have no houses or jobs to return to.
Unemployment is estimated by the World Bank to be 50 to 60 percent. Many houses still do not have heat. Most of the biggest industries are dormant, the central bank is not yet operating and officials have limited skills in managing a market economy, since the country was part of Communist Yugoslavia.
The reconstruction work under way is only a fraction of what is needed. "Despite the first results that are now beginning to emerge, the reconstruction needs remain vast," says a report prepared by the World Bank and the European Union for a two-day meeting of donors that is to start on Thursday in Brussels.
"Industrial production is still only at 10 to 15 percent of its prewar level, unemployment is unbearably high, hundreds of thousands of people are without permanent housing and many communities continue to lack basic social services," the report says.
Since fighting ended in 1995, American and European officials have said a lasting peace would be possible in Bosnia only if economic and social stability could be restored quickly. When he announced two months ago that American troops would remain in Bosnia through the middle of next year, President Clinton cited the need to see more economic progress as a main reason for his decision.
"Quite frankly, rebuilding the fabric of Bosnia's economic and political life is taking longer than anticipated," Mr. Clinton said. "Economic activity is only just resuming. Its pace must be quickened and its reach extended."
Despite some grumbling from the United States and other countries about the pace of the rebuilding effort, American and European officials said they expected to be able to reach the target of $1.4 billion in international donations for 1997.
But they said that most countries would be less willing to contribute in future years and that it was unclear whether the formerly warring parties in Bosnia would be able to continue the process effectively on their own as international aid dried up.
International officials remain dismayed by the squabbling among the Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs, which delayed the formation of a government by several months last year and led to disagreements over specific projects.
Plans to patch up the phone system stalled because of the unwillingness of the ethnic groups to share control or even to agree on a single international dialing code for telephone calls. The rail line between Sarajevo and the Adriatic port of Ploce was repaired, but disagreements between Muslim and Croatian officials kept regular service from being resumed.
But officials said that in general the work was proceeding as fast as could be expected, given the complexities of formulating rebuilding plans, coordinating the efforts of the many donors and creating almost from scratch the institutions necessary to support a market economy.
"It's a process both of having to reform Tito's socialism and undertake the physical reconstruction of a decimated place," said one senior American official involved in the process. "It's inherently difficult, and it's all being undertaken at a time when the three parties are not cooperating."
Indeed, American and other international officials said the current four-year aid program would be only the start of a long and slow process.
The $5.1 billion that donor countries plan to spend would cover only a quarter of the estimated war damages. And officials at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund said that even if all went smoothly in the next few years, they would expect per capita income to reach only two-thirds of its prewar levels by 2000.
Although unemployment is as high as 60 percent, it is down from 90 percent at the end of the war. For those Bosnians who are working, wages have tripled, to an average of a little more than $100 a month. The Government is negotiating an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for long-term financial support, and other governments and international banks are expected to give Bosnia a break on its prewar debts this year.
The economic situation is best in Croatian-controlled areas, where the European Union and the World Bank report that industrial production is running at 85 percent of its prewar level and wages now stand at more than $200 a month. It is bleakest in the Serbian-controlled region, which has so far received little international assistance because its leaders have intermittently defied the terms of the Dayton peace accords.

HEADLINE: Leaders Meet But Can't Lift Hebron Crisis

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, met covertly in the predawn darkness today, but failed to keep the meeting secret and to overcome remaining hurdles to a Hebron deal.
The meeting at the Erez Checkpoint to the Gaza Strip reportedly lasted four hours and was attended by close aides and by Dennis Ross, the special United States envoy for the Middle East. 
 Mr. Ross was said to have arranged the extraordinary session in an attempt to crack the disagreements that have bedeviled efforts for three months now to arrange an Israeli withdrawal from most of Hebron.
Israeli and Palestinian officials say the remaining disputes are less over Hebron than over a blueprint for subsequent Israeli troop pullbacks from the West Bank outlined under existing Israeli-Palestinian agreements. The plan, known among the negotiators as the "road map," is to be drafted by the United States and appended to the Hebron agreement.
In a speech to Israeli businessmen in Tel Aviv this evening, Mr. Netanyahu acknowledged that he had hoped to keep the meeting a secret.
"I met, last night, with Yasir Afafat at the Erez Checkpoint," he said. "I had hoped that the meeting would remain confidential since it seems to me that it is paramount that there also be meetings which help build trust and working relations.
"I believe there are meetings which do not have to withstand the lightning flash of cameras, that these matters have their time and place," he said. "At the moment, we have to solve problems. It was with the attempt of solving these for which this meeting, which to my regret was leaked, was held."
Mr. Netanyahu told the businessmen that he hoped in his next meeting with them to show progress both in the economy and in the peace, adding that "perhaps there will be a few surprises in this process." He gave no further clue.
The acknowledgment of the secret meeting could well prove an embarrassment to Mr. Netanyahu, whose election campaign last spring focused heavily on accusing his opponent, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, of too close a relationship with Mr. Arafat. Mr. Netanyahu has officially met Mr. Arafat three times, all in the past four months, and they are not known to have held any previous secret meetings.
The fact that Mr. Netanyahu was prepared to meet with Mr. Arafat under cover of darkness reflected how far the conservative Israeli Prime Minister had come in accepting the Palestinian leader as an unavoidable partner in forging a peace.
Mr. Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, issued a brief statement confirming that a meeting had taken place from 2 A.M. to 6 A.M. "Both leaders discussed all disputed issues but the leaders were unable to bridge all gaps," he said. "Contacts and efforts will continue until we close a deal."
Mr. Ross continued his mediation efforts today, and there were rumors that Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat would meet again. But officials denied it, and there was no indication of a followup meeting.
The main remaining difference is said to be Mr. Arafat's insistence on firm dates for further Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank, which under the existing agreements were to take place in three stages ending next September. Mr. Netanyahu has agreed to set a date for the first stage, but not for subsequent ones.
Instead, Israeli television reported this evening, Mr. Netanyahu has offered Mr. Arafat a firm date for releasing Palestinian women prisoners, as well as a schedule to open discussion on a Palestinian airport, a seaport and a transit route between Gaza and the West Bank. The women were supposed to have been released and the "safe passage" route was to have come into being with the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement of September 1995.
In another development, the chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said that despite the delays on the Hebron redeployment, an agreement would be signed on Monday in Jericho to station 210 international observers in Hebron once Israeli troops pull back. He said the observers are to come from Denmark, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.
Observers from Norway are already stationed in Hebron, but their presence has not made a perceptible impact.
Also today, Jewish settlers removed mobile homes from a hilltop in the West Bank, peacefully concluding a demonstration to back their demands for new settlement construction. The settlers had moved the trailers onto a hilltop near their settlement, Beit El, on Friday, briefly raising the possibility of a conflict with the Israeli police.
The protest was the first direct challenge to Mr. Netanyahu by the settlers, who have been frustrated by his failure to authorize a large-scale expansion of Jewish settlements like the ones set up by previous Likud governments. The demonstration was led by Yoel Tsur, a Beit El resident whose wife and son were killed by Palestinian gunmen last month.
The protest was defused when Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, whose ministry is responsible for authorizing any settlements on occupied Palestinian lands, agreed to meet with the settlers.
"It was a very good meeting," Mr. Mordechai said. "I came to hear their essential needs, which will be discussed in a serious manner."
Mr. Tsur said Mr. Mordechai had promised an answer "tomorrow or in two days" on the question of expanding the settlement. One proposed compromise would be to allow the settlers to move into parts of an Israeli Army base near their settlement. But even that would be certain to meet strong resistance from the Palestinians, who view any expansion of the Jewish presence in the West Bank as a provocation.
Since taking office, Mr. Netanyahu has authorized some growth within existing settlements, but he has not allowed building on any additional land.

HEADLINE: Korean-American Exodus Continues in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 5

 BODY:
Business was slow on New Year's Day at Peter and Nancy Park's budget clothing stall in South-Central Los Angeles, the morning after a gang fight several stalls away left one brawler dead of a gunshot wound.
Surveying piles of $10 shirts and $15 trousers in the middle of a yellow, cinder block warehouse full of other vendors, Mr. Park described the arson that devastated his business in the 1992 riots here, and the $41,000 debt that prevents him from opening a business elsewhere. 
 "If we could, we would go, of course," Mr. Park said.
Korean-Americans are continuing to move or close their small businesses in South-Central Los Angeles nearly five years after riots destroyed hundreds of their stores in neighborhoods mainly occupied by black and some Hispanic people. Small furniture outlets, groceries and other shops are increasingly being opened by Korean-Americans in the city's relatively prosperous northern and western neighborhoods, even as similar businesses are sold or closed in the city's blighted center.
And many Korean-American business owners who have managed to rebuild riot-scarred stores still express a desire to leave the area, suggesting that the exodus may continue for years to come.
The riots broke out on April 29, 1992, after a largely white jury acquitted four white police officers of assault charges in the beating of a black man, Rodney G. King. But Korean-American business owners bore the brunt of the looting in South-Central Los Angeles. A white judge two weeks earlier had given probation to a Korean grocer convicted of manslaughter in the shooting death of a 15-year-old black girl. And Korean-Americans ran the bulk of the grocery and liquor stores in the area, making them vulnerable.
Rioters burned 700 Korean businesses, inflicting $150 million in damage to property, almost none of it insured. Of the 53 people killed in the rioting, one was Korean.
While there are few statistics on Korean-American businesses, community leaders and economic development experts say that the number of businesses owned by Korean-Americans in South-Central Los Angeles has dropped by a quarter to a half since the riots, and is still falling.
Some say that the exodus may limit future problems.
"The black-Korean controversy has dissipated because the fuel has been removed," said Ronald K. Wakabayashi, the executive director of the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations, a county government agency.
But many community leaders remain worried that relations between blacks and the remaining Korean-Americans are still poor. "There's just this kind of guarded relationship that I don't think anybody can claim has improved since 1992," said Joe R. Hicks, a former co-chairman of the Los Angeles Black-Korean Alliance, a group that broke up a few months after the 1992 riots.
Korean-American business owners and economic development experts cite several reasons for the continued exodus. Fears of renewed violence linger.
The area's population and buying power are eroding as thousands of middle-class and working-class blacks are moving out to the city's eastern suburbs or to the southeastern United States. While many Hispanic people are moving into South-Central Los Angeles, particularly the more eastern neighborhoods, they are not as numerous as the blacks who are leaving. And the new Hispanic residents have tended to patronize Hispanic merchants.
Uichin Ho, who emigrated from Seoul in 1977 and now owns four laundromats in gritty neighborhoods in South-Central Los Angeles, said that a drop in the area's population was a big problem. Pausing on New Year's Day while cleaning one of his laundries, several miles west of the Park family's clothing stall, he gestured at a row of recently installed dryers and complained that they had not increased his business at all.
"A lot of people, not only Koreans, left here," Mr. Ho said. "Before the riot, when you try to occupy an apartment, they want you to bring an application -- now they say one or three months' free rent."
Yet the riots do not appear to have hurt the long-term economic strength of the Korean-American community in Los Angeles, which holds almost 400,000 of the nation's 1.5 million people of Korean descent. The neighborhood popularly known here as Koreatown, which lies between South-Central Los Angeles and the city's more affluent northern and western neighborhoods, has recovered from looting in the riots and is now packed with two-story mini-malls.
A profusion of business signs in both English and Korean is spreading north and west from Koreatown, and Korean-Americans have been opening businesses in adjacent communities like Hollywood.
Many of the remaining Korean Americans in South-Central Los Angeles are trying to save money as quickly as possible so they can move elsewhere. Mr. Park even objected to a recent police crackdown on drug dealers in his area, saying that it had hurt his men's clothing business.
"The government starts squeezing, squeezing, squeezing, and one by one they go," he said. "Guys used to come in with bundles of $100 bills and buy everything."

HEADLINE: CONGRESS IS POISED FOR FRUITFUL YEAR AFTER SOME TESTS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 5

 BODY:
As a new Congress convenes on Tuesday vowing to cut taxes, tame Medicare spending and balance the Federal budget, many in the Capitol believe the elements of success are in alignment for the first time in years, but only if the lawmakers can first deal with explosive ethical issues involving campaign finance and Speaker Newt Gingrich.
The path of the new Congress is likely to be charted in its first weeks, when the House is expected to hold extraordinary public hearings and debate the fate of Mr. Gingrich. Perhaps a month later, in late February or early March, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee will publicly investigate possible campaign-spending abuses by the Democratic Party, the White House and, probably, by Republicans as well. 
 But if Congress can address such combustible issues without burning all bridges between the two parties, it could be extraordinarily productive, some leaders say.
"The President has now said, 'Look, I've got all my politics behind me now; I don't have to operate from a political point of view,' " Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said today on the "Fox News Sunday" program. " 'Let's get down to the legislative work.' And he's anxious to do it, and we're anxious to get back to it as well."
At the top of a legislative agenda nearly as ambitious as the one Republicans brought with them two years ago are a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, a binding plan to erase the deficit by 2002, an overhaul of the Federal health-care system, and tax cuts for families, small businesses and investors.
Democrats would add the partial restoration of welfare benefits cut by legislation that President Clinton signed into law last summer. Some in both parties demand an overhaul of campaign-spending laws.
Much in the new Congress augurs well for optimists. There are lots of new faces: 1 of every 5 members is a freshman, nearly as many as in 1994. Excepting those House members who rose to the Senate, none carries scars from the last four years of political garrotting on Capitol Hill.
The timing is also right. At the White House, President Clinton has been transformed from election-year rival to lame duck in need of Congress's help to win a place in history. In the Capitol, the populist fires that led Republicans into disastrous confrontations in 1995 and 1996 appear banked.
The politics have changed, too. The balance of legislative power has shifted to the Senate, where the Republican majority leader, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, likes to cut deals. The House, where the November elections cut deeply into the Republicans' dominance, is a chastened place where moderates of both parties may comprise the margins of victory or defeat.
"You can do one of two things with a smaller majority," said Representative David L. Hobson, an influential Republican from Ohio. "You can try to force all your people in line, which is very difficult to do. Or you can build more consensus-oriented legislation and move it through."
He added, "It'll be less confrontational this time, it appears."
That remains to be seen. In the House, many Democrats believe little can be accomplished as long as Mr. Gingrich remains Speaker.
In the Senate, Mr. Lott's bent toward bargaining may be more than offset by the November election results, which vastly widened the ideological gulf separating Republicans and Democrats.
Republicans not only increased their majority by two seats, to 55, but also replaced a throng of moderates who had retired with conservatives from Mr. Gingrich's take-no-prisoners school of politics. Several come directly from the Speaker's House ranks, including Senators Sam Brownback of Kansas, Wayne Allard of Colorado and Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas.
Democrats not only lost some moderate seats to Republicans, but also replaced some of their own moderates with more liberal members in states like Georgia, Louisiana and New Jersey.
All that suggests that the 1997 Senate will look a good deal more like the 1994 House -- more partisan, more ideological and less obliging to the dying tradition of comity.
Another open question, at least in Republican minds, is what will come of Mr. Clinton's pledge to cooperate and compromise. Republican leaders have made it clear that they will not attempt politically difficult initiatives like changes in Medicare or the cost-of-living index, unless the White House takes the lead; memories of Mr. Clinton's virulent attacks on the Republicans' Medicare plan last year are too fresh.
The budget, both sides say, will be the proving ground for many promises. Fiscal issues dominate the list of items that are likely to be addressed early.
If tradition holds, Mr. Clinton will offer his proposed budget in early February for the 1998 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1. Unlike the last two years, Republicans may not dismiss it out of hand, because both parties purport to see a chance this year for agreement on a credible plan to erase the Federal deficit, perhaps by 2002.
Republicans believe they have a hammer in the negotiations this time: a constitutional amendment ordering the Government to keep balanced books. A proposed amendment sailed through the House in 1995 and missed Senate passage by a single vote; this year the House vote may be closer, but the Senate could have a vote or two to burn.
Even if a hammer worked, it might not be needed. Mr. Clinton has already promised to submit a balanced-budget plan, as he did last year. And while Republicans spurned it then, partly because it employed an economic forecast they regarded as too rosy, much of that forecast has since come to pass. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office, the Capitol's economic seer, is expected to issue similar projections in a few weeks. That would close an $80 billion gap between the two parties' budget proposals.
"You could see us coming out with budgets much closer to each other," said Mr. Hobson, a member of the House Budget Committee. "Maybe we could even make a deal."
Still, the hardest parts of a deal -- tough choices over where to spend and how much -- remain unsettled.
Republicans argued last year that Mr. Clinton's budget relied on vague spending cuts that were unlikely to occur and "temporary" tax cuts that were sure to become permanent.
A similar dispute haunts Medicare, the single biggest source of potential savings, where the fund for paying hospital bills is nearing insolvency and costs for non-hospital care have ballooned. Last year, the White House proposed $120 billion in savings through 2002, mostly through accounting changes and reduced payments to doctors. Republicans argued for $160 billion in savings, partly by overhauling the system.
They still want an overhaul, but are not likely to get it this year. Democrats are expected to call for a financial "fix" to prop up the hospital fund while politicians -- or better still, a bipartisan commission -- devise a permanent solution. In fact, the White House and Democrats in Congress may propose to expand the Federal health-care mandate by extending the guarantee of health insurance to all children.
Many in Congress and the White House privately support another huge cost-cutter, a proposal last month to refigure the Government's Consumer Price Index to correct a supposed overstatement of the inflation rate. That would modestly slow increases in Federal benefits and pensions that are tied to the index, saving hundreds of billions of dollars in the next decade.
But Republicans will not publicly support legislation to change the index unless Mr. Clinton proposes it first, and the President is widely expected to leave any changes to the Labor Department, where the index is prepared. The chances of any legislative change are slim unless it is made part of a more sweeping agreement on spending cuts.
The same is true of Mr. Clinton's pledge to roll back some of the cuts in welfare spending that he signed into law in the campaign season. Mr. Clinton wants to restore about a fourth of the $55 billion in reductions planned in the next six years, primarily cuts in food stamp spending and benefits to legal immigrants.
But many Republicans are unsympathetic, and few give the proposal much chance unless it is part of a larger agreement.
One fiscal proposal seems almost a certainty: Congress and Mr. Clinton both want to cut taxes for families with children, probably through a $500-per-child credit that shrinks as a family's income rises.
The dark horse of legislative issues may be the overhauling of Federal campaign-finance laws.
Democrats blocked the passage of campaign legislation when they controlled Congress, and Republicans have blocked it since. The Democrats, out of power this year, plan to revive their version early this year, partly as a defense against the aura of scandal that now surrounds their party's fund-raising practices.
Senator John McCain of Arizona, the major Republican sponsor of campaign legislation, said that legislation might fail again in a normal year. But with regular disclosures of both Democratic and Republican fund-raising excesses, he said, this year might prove the exception.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "COMING UP: Issues Facing the New Congress"
 The 105th Congress convenes on Tuesday for the first of its two year-long sessions. Here is a quick look at some issues Republicans and Democrats say are likely to be addressed:
BALANCED BUDGET The signal legislative topic of the 1997 Congress. Prospects for achieving fiscal balance are the rosiest in years, and new Congressional economic projections may help. Regardless, passage of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution appears likely.
TAX CUT Probably the surest bet of the year. A modest tax credit for families with children is probable, while a higher-education tax break and cut in the capital-gains tax rate are also popular.
MEDICARE More fiscal patchwork to stave off the looming bankruptcy of the hospital-insurance trust fund is all but certain. Prospects are hazier for a full overhaul to meet the demands of baby boomers.
WELFARE President Clinton has pledged to seek more money to roll back some of the strictest provisions of the bill he signed last summer.
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX Though much talked about, neither party seems likely to push hard for a downward revision of the index.
CAMPAIGN-SPENDING OVERHAUL Political-money accusations touching Speaker Newt Gingrich and the White House will spur hearings and calls for tighter restrictions. Chances seem slim for significant change. (pg. B5)

HEADLINE: Is the Fed Too Heavy at the Switch? Or Asleep?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Those Vicious Business Cycles: Tamed but Not Quite Slain" (Business Day, Jan. 2) gives the Federal Reserve Board too much credit for taming the business cycle and inflation. Instead, the financial markets deserve that credit, for increasingly the markets are ignoring the Fed's often erroneous interest rate signals. 
 The high inflation of the 1970's and early 1980's was caused by a severe Fed "policy mistake," signaling excessively low and at times negative real or inflation-adjusted interest rates in the late 1960's and 1970's that triggered inflationary credit demand. One side effect of the Fed's subsequent efforts to squeeze that inflation out of the economy: the two worst recessions of the last 50 years.
Perhaps because of their growing internationalization, the financial markets increasingly are pursuing their own self-interest, which is to set interest rates that produce steady, noninflationary credit expansion and stable economic growth. The early 1990's evidenced this phenomenon. In 1992 and 1993, the Fed signaled excessively low short-term rates, which created a bubble in the stock and bond markets. Rising short-term rates burst that bubble in 1994. Fortunately, the financial markets ignored the Fed and held real long-term rates in the 4 percent range. This prevented a rerun of the boom-bust of the 1970's.
The threat of Fed policy mistakes will continue to diminish as the financial markets understand more clearly that they can, and should, ignore Fed rate signals.

HEADLINE: An Appointment That Draws No Fire

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Four years ago, some of America's most prestigious economists fought like cats to be chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. And when Laura D'Andrea Tyson got the job, she was openly criticized by several of her peers as unqualified and unconventional.
Now President Clinton has tapped Janet Yellen for the job, making her, in title at least, his chief economist. Like Ms. Tyson, she is an economics professor from the University of California at Berkeley. But Ms. Yellen's appointment last month barely made news and there was almost no cocktail party buzz among the 2,000 or so professional economists gathered here for the annual convention of the American Economic Association, which ended today. By contrast, Ms. Tyson had been Topic A at the 1993 convention. 
 The shift says a lot about the attitude of economists toward the Clinton Administration. Four years ago, they were agitated, divided and uncertain about the newly elected President and his entourage. Now they view his economics as rather mainstream and predictable.
"Four years ago, people did not know what 'new Democratic philosophy' meant in terms of policy," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Stanford University professor who succeeded Ms. Tyson in 1995 as the council's chairman and is scheduled to yield the job in late January to Ms. Yellen. "They knew it wasn't Reaganomics, and it wasn't Roosevelt's New Deal. But that left a wide middle ground."
That middle ground has narrowed to a rather standard set of views about the economy that most of the economists gathered here reaffirmed in their sessions and conversations. It emphasizes deficit-cutting and balanced budgets, rather than the increase in public spending that was an initial Clinton impulse. Free markets, minimally regulated, are the order of the day. So is free trade, not the experiments in managed trade that Ms. Tyson was thought to favor.
The result, no matter who is in the White House, has been rather uniform economic advice for the last 20 years from the President's chief economic advisers. "Two-thirds to three-quarters of all the advice given by the Council of Economic Advisers has turned out to be very similar in Republican and Democratic Administrations," said Roger Porter of Harvard University, an economic and domestic policy adviser in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
When President Clinton unexpectedly named Ms. Tyson as the first woman to lead the council, several of her colleagues among economists close to the Democrats publicly criticized her credentials. They had been waiting 12 years for a Democratic administration and a shot at being chairman of the council, often considered the most prestigious government job for an academic economist. Some said that she lacked expertise in economic theory.
That criticism is gone now, replaced by praise for Ms. Tyson. For Ms. Yellen, the issue is not so much her stand on the issues, but whether she can master the necessary personal relationships inside the Administration.
"You have to have allies on the team," said Martin S. Feldstein of Harvard, who led the council for a time under President Ronald Reagan.
By all accounts, Ms. Tyson, whose economic views turned out to be very much in line with the mainstream approach, had regular access to the President, and also strong support from Robert E. Rubin, who quickly emerged as the key economic player in the Clinton Administration after he was named to lead the National Economic Council that Mr. Clinton established to coordinate domestic policy advice. Mr. Rubin is now the Treasury Secretary and still Mr. Clinton's most important economic adviser.
"It is the structure of decision-making that gains authority in the White House," Ms. Tyson said in a telephone interview.
She later succeeded Mr. Rubin as chief of the N.E.C. and now has returned to Berkeley. But whether Ms. Yellen will have the same access to Mr. Clinton, or sufficient influence among his other economic advisers, is uncertain. The circumstances of her appointment raise questions.
The chairmanship of the Council of Economic Advisers was offered first to Lawrence H. Summers, now Mr. Rubin's deputy at Treasury, a senior Administration official said. Mr. Summers, on leave from Harvard, had been among those jockeying for the council chairmanship when Ms. Tyson was unexpectedly named four years ago. Now he has decided to stay on as deputy to Mr. Rubin. Mr. Summers also was given a seat on the National Economic Council, along with Ms. Yellen, Gene Sperling, who is the new N.E.C. chief, and a couple of others.
In selecting Ms. Yellen to lead the council, a key issue was how well she would get along with Mr. Summers, Administration officials said. Alan S. Blinder of Princeton had been considered for the job, but was eliminated from consideration, a senior Administration official said, because he and Mr. Summers had "personality conflicts" in the past.
Mr. Blinder returned to Princeton last year after serving as a member of the council under Ms. Tyson and as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He said recently that he was offered the council chairmanship and turned it down. But Administration officials say that a formal offer went only to Ms. Yellen, who has been a governor of the Federal Reserve for the last three years.
"The people who know Janet well say she is very analytic, very bright, and she works very well with independent-minded people," Mr. Rubin said in a telephone interview.
Ms. Yellen, who is 50 and who describes herself as a "pragmatic, mainstream economist," declined to comment on her appointment, other than to note that she taught economics to Mr. Summers when he was a student. "I have enormous respect for Larry," she said. "He is an extraordinarily fine economist and I am happy to be on the same team."
That relationship, and Ms. Yellen's influence, will be tested in policy debates in the coming months. "Given the profusion of economists in Government in recent years," Mr. Porter said, "is the Council of Economic Advisers as important or necessary as it once was? From the viewpoint of the President, it is. The C.E.A. is in the best position to give unbiased analysis and advice, while other economists argue from the special interests of the agencies or departments they represent."
That requires "face time" with the President, as Murray Weidenbaum of Washington University, President Reagan's first council chairman, put it. Ms. Tyson had a special weekly session with the President in which she laid out the pros and cons of a particular economic issue, but under Mr. Stiglitz, her successor, those meetings stopped last year.
Ms. Yellen, who has met the President only once or twice, has been assured that the weekly meetings will resume, giving her more of an opportunity to build up her influence.
"You cannot draw these things on a blackboard," said Herbert Stein, who was council chairman in the Nixon Administration, and for a time under Gerald Ford. "So much depends on personal relations."

Bond Prices Slip Ahead Of New Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
As the bond market braced for key economic reports this week, prices of Treasury securities sagged yesterday, dragged down by a weaker dollar and the higher cost of energy.
It appeared yesterday that traders and dealers had already started pricing a risk premium into the costs of Government securities, in case the economic data signal that the economy is growing at a fast enough pace to set off inflation, which would erode the value of fixed-income securities. Also, the dollar declined on world currency markets, making the value of dollar-denominated investments like Government securities less attractive to foreign investors. 
 The price of the 30-year bond fell 16/32, to 96 18/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.77 percent, from 6.73 percent on Friday.
Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of taxable fixed-income trading at Cowen & Company, noted that although trading volume yesterday was up from the recent holiday volume, it was still not back to full strength, leading some market participants to feel that price fluctuations may be exaggerated.
"The fact is that last week there was some unexpected strength in economic data," Mr. Gamba said, "and the current concern is that we will again see some strength" in this week's data. The Producer Price Index for December is due out on Thursday, and the monthly nonfarm payroll report for December will be released Friday.
Mr. Gamba said that in addition to economic data, the market was also concerned about the resumption of corporate debt issuance as the new year begins, and by the weaker dollar and a jump in crude oil and energy prices.
"The thought of supply is weighing on the market, with rumors of issuance coming from Argentina, Italy, Mexico, and corporates like U S West," he said, adding that "few market participants are going to be willing to take on any new positions in the face of important economic numbers and secondary market supply as well."
The Producer Price Index on Thursday is expected to be tame, but the fear of a stronger-than-expected increase in the nonfarm payroll numbers in December after a small 118,000 increase in November has kept buyers away. The market consensus if for a gain of 150,000 to 170,000, although some are leaning toward a number well above an increase of 200,000.
Jack Guynn, president of the Atlanta Federal Reserve, said that "it looks like another year of moderate growth." These comments may have been interpreted as indicating that the central bank was not panicked by the pace of economic growth. However, he also said that tight labor markets and consumer spending would remain a concern this year, which seemed to suggest that as a new voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee, he would vote to tighten if price pressures were evident.
Yesterday's weekly Treasury bill auction went as well as expected, with rates mixed. The average discount rate for the three-month bills was 5.02 percent, down from 5.08 percent a week ago, while the six-month bill rate averaged 5.11 percent, unchanged from the previous auction.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Remarks by Japanese Official Lead to Broad Drop in Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened broadly yesterday, hurt by a senior Japanese official's warning about its recent rise.
It was the first full day of global foreign exchange trading since a prolonged holiday break in Japan, giving dealers their first sense of the dollar's true value in nearly two weeks. 
 The thin market since Christmas had distorted currency rates and by the end of last week had helped pushed the dollar to a 45-month high against the Japanese yen, a 2-year high against the German mark and 2 1/2-year high against the Swiss franc.
"A lot of people were excited about the dollar and how it closed on Friday," John Hazelton, chief currency trader at the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, said. "But it was a Friday, and it was a holiday week, so how much credence can you put in a move of that nature?"
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to 115.68 yen from 116.43 yen on Friday and to 1.5632 marks from 1.5644. The British pound rose to $1.6941 from $1.6901.
The dollar fell sharply in early Asian dealings after Tadashi Ogawa, a Vice Minister of Finance, said, "Excessive weakening of the yen isn't desirable."
It was the first time any senior Japanese official had commented publicly about the dollar'ssurge, which began in mid-December and pushed it up nearly 2.3 percent against the yen in a few weeks.
"Mr. Ogawa threw a little bit of caution into the dollar's rise against the yen and stopped the rally in its tracks," Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager in New York for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, said.
The yen's continued weakness has contributed to an exodus of investment from Japan and played a role in a tumble in the Japanese stock market last year. Japanese officials are also worried about the weak yen's effect on on the politically sensitive Japanese trade surplus with the United States, which recently started to increase again.
Although the dollar recovered somewhat later in the day, it weakened again after a rally in the United States stock market faded in the afternoon.

HEADLINE: Dow Sets a Closing High as Stocks End Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrials and the Nasdaq market stumbled to closing highs yesterday, but a broad follow-through to Friday's rally faltered as the bond market, from which stock traders took their direction, continued to sputter.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.09 points, to 6,567.18, surpassing Dec. 27's close of 6,560.91. The new high came despite a retreat from a 75-point gain earlier in the session that had lifted the Dow to more than 6,600 points for the first time. 
 Broader measures ended mixed, falling with bonds as rising oil prices aggravated inflation concerns.
Bonds' interest rates, which move in the opposite direction of the price, jumped last week after some unexpectedly strong economic data raised concerns that the economy has not slowed enough to contain inflation and keep the Federal Reserve from raising short-term interest rates.
"We have a bond market that is continuing to give up on this slow-growth scenario," said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds, citing last week's robust readings on home sales, factory activity, consumer confidence and construction spending. "Things are obviously starting to pick up."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 16/32, to 96 18/32. Its yield rose to 6.77 percent, from 6.73 percent on Friday.
Compounding investors' inflation worries was the cold snap crossing the nation, which sent energy prices soaring in commodities trading.
Despite the concerns about an accelerating economy, the early indications on the holiday shopping season remained discouraging, with two more high-profile names reporting disappointing results.
Toys "R" Us slid 4 5/8 a share, to 26 1/8, as the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange after the retailer warned that lower-than-expected sales for the season will hurt its earnings growth for the fiscal year ending Feb. 3.
Apple Computer Inc., meanwhile, fell 3 7/8, to 17 7/8, as the Nasdaq's most active issue. Prudential Securities and Bear, Stearns downgraded the stock after Apple's announcement late on Friday that sales in the quarter ended Dec. 27 were hurt by weak demand for the company's Performa computers and shortages of new PowerBook portables.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 1,434 to 1,1139, on the Big Board, where volume was heavy at 527.3 million shares.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 0.38 point, to 747.65; the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.22 point, to 394.28, and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.39 point, to 572.06.
The technology-rich Nasdaq composite index rose 5.72 points, to 1,316.40, surpassing its Dec. 9 close of 1,316.27, even as computer-related shares succumbed to profit taking.
Intel, which jumped 8 points on Friday after an upgrade from Salomon Brothers, gave back much of a 3 3/8-point gain, rising 1/2 a share, to 138 7/8.
I.B.M. rose 2 1/8 a share, to 161 1/4, as the Dow's strongest issue, but was up as much as 4 earlier in the session.
The jump in crude oil prices also helped the Dow: Texaco rose 1 3/8 a share, to 102; Exxon rose 1 3/8, to 100; Du Pont rose 7/8, to 99, and Chevron rose 3/4, to 66 7/8.
AT&T, down 1 7/8 a share, to 39 5/8, was the Dow's weakest issue after Salomon Brothers lowered its earnings estimates for the company. General Motors rose 1 3/8, to 59 1/4, after an upgrade by Smith Barney.
Banking stocks were pressured by rising interest rates. Chase Manhattan fell 7/8 a share, to 87 3/8; Citicorp fell 3/4, to 103 3/4, and First Union eased 5/8, to 74.
 Autozone Inc., a car-parts retailer, fell 3 7/8 a share, to 20 1/8, after analysts cut their opinions on the stock.
Hilton Hotels shares fell 1 1/4, to 26, after the casino company said its earnings will fall short of analyst expectations for the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Advocacy Group Seeks to Undo School Financing Plan

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
A motion filed today by a legal advocacy group for poor children asks the State Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional the elaborate changes in school financing that the Whitman administration just pushed through the New Jersey Legislature and that the Governor expects to make a cornerstone of her re-election bid.
The group, the Education Law Center, has led the 26-year court battle to close the spending gap between the state's richest and poorest districts. It said the new law's emphasis on a standard curriculum that the law estimates should cost $7,200 per pupil would not guarantee that students in the poorest districts would get the same education as that offered in the wealthy suburbs. 
 "This law is a message to those children that all you are entitled to is a second-rate, basic skills education," said David G. Sciarra, executive director of the center, which is based in Newark.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman defended the law, which if upheld will be a major piece of her resume for re-election, while other Republicans accused the center of trying to undermine the state's best schools by taking money for urban districts. They said that pouring money into poor districts had not significantly improved test scores.
Instead of setting the amount of spending per student, the new law requires that the Department of Education develop an elaborate list of curriculum guidelines that all schools must meet.
"In past decisions, the State Supreme Court has indicated that they were asking for financial parity because no standard for educational parity existed," the Governor said in a statement. "For the first time in state history we have a public education funding law that is based on the provision of an educational program, not simply on the available dollars."
Center officials said the law would effectively ossify the poor districts at the $7,200 spending level while the richer districts could continue to spend whatever they want.
"What we have is a law that takes us back in time," Mr. Sciarra said. "It takes us back to when urban districts lacking the property taxes to afford education are frozen, while suburban districts can raise the money that they need for a quality educational program. What you wind up with is a two-tiered funding system."
There was no immediate indication as to when the court might start reviewing the motion.
Center officials estimate that the spending gap for next year will be roughly $250 million, down from $400 million in 1994, when the court ordered the state to meet the guarantee enshrined in the State Constitution that all children get a "thorough and efficient" education.
The motion asks the court to overturn the law and to determine officially by April 1 the exact gap in spending between the richest and poorest districts.
It also asks the court to order the State Legislature to pass a law by June 30 that would close the spending gap, and if the law is not enacted, for the court to step in and take whatever is required from the state's $4.3 billion education budget to guarantee parity.
New Jersey already spends more per pupil than any other state, and the new law would spend roughly $286 million for all districts.
In addition, the motion asks the court to order the legislature to fix aid for the poorer districts at $208 million, the current level adjusted for inflation, and to appoint a Superior Court judge or a special master to decide by Sept. 30, 1997, what programs were needed in the poorer districts to make them equal to the richest.

HEADLINE: Quiet Funeral Is Planned for Helmsley, as Truce Is Sought on Lawsuit

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
When Harry B. Helmsley is buried this afternoon in a small private funeral, his body will be put to rest in New York's fabled Woodlawn Cemetery inside a mausoleum whose stained-glass side windows are decorated with -- what else? -- an abbreviated skyline of the city where a one-time office boy made a name buying tall buildings.
Among those planning to attend the funeral are Irving Schneider and Alvin Schwartz, Mr. Helmsley's longtime partners and top lieutenants, who are enmeshed in a nasty lawsuit against Mr. Helmsley's widow, Leona. And yesterday, both parties in the dispute offered encouraging words about the prospects of a peaceful resolution. 
 Mr. Schneider and Mr. Schwartz contend that Mrs. Helmsley has been fraudulently stripping assets of Helmsley-Spear Inc., the real estate management firm that stands at the center of the Helmsley empire, to render it insolvent and avoid paying them millions of dollars.
The two men each called Mrs. Helmsley yesterday to express their condolences. According to Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mrs. Helmsley, she told them that she was hopeful that they could now reconcile their problems in an amicable fashion.
Mr. Helmsley died Saturday in Scottsdale, Ariz., at 87, leaving an indelible imprint on New York's real estate landscape. His wife flew back to New York with his body Sunday evening. Eschewing the grandeur of a large public funeral, she has decided to hold a short ceremony at the Woolworth Chapel at the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx before about 25 close friends and relatives. No public officials or journalists are invited.
In memory of her husband, Mrs. Helmsley has turned off for a week the colored lights that decorate the Empire State Building. The building is the best-known of the array of skyscrapers that Mr. Helmsley controlled. The flags at the six Helmsley-owned hotels have been lowered to half-staff.
In the Helmsley Building at 230 Park Avenue, a picture of Mr. Helmsley was put on display in the lobby yesterday, encircled by some of the elaborate floral arrangements that had been received.
The real estate titan's death may spur a swifter conclusion to what has been an acrimonious feud between the Helmsley-Spear partners.
"I think everyone is very shaken by his death," said Howard Squadron, a lawyer who is representing Mr. Schneider in the case. "Sometimes when these things happen, people have a different perspective on what is important and what is not important."
In 1970, Mr. Helmsley granted Mr. Schneider and Mr. Schwartz an option to buy Helmsley-Spear at a bargain price (essentially its book value) upon his death. If they choose not to, they can receive a cash payment estimated at about $10 million each. And then Mrs. Helmsley, assuming she inherits her husband's stock, would own the company.
But under the buyout agreement, Helmsley-Spear has 120 days to provide Mr. Schneider and Mr. Schwartz with a valuation of the company. After receiving that, the two men have 60 days to exercise the option.
Lawyers for the partners said that no decision has been made on the option. Reached at his office, Mr. Schneider said:
"You must understand it's a very difficult time for me. I spent 50 glorious years here. But I make no comment on your question. Please, I make no comment."
Associates of the two partners said that they would not decide on the option until there is a resolution of the lawsuit against Mrs. Helmsley.
Whatever the result, associates said, there is a real possibility that Mr. Schneider and Mr. Schwartz might decide not to buy the company. One factor is their age. Mr. Schwartz is 84 and Mr. Schneider is 76.
Much in the vast Helmsley holdings, however, is not expected to change in any material way in the wake of Mr. Helmsley's death. Mr. Helmsley, given his frail health, had been inactive in his business activities for years, and Mrs. Helmsley has assumed his role.
Helmsley Enterprises, the parent company that owns the Helmsley properties, including its hotels, is uninvolved in the sparring among the partners.
Over a prolonged buying spree, Mr. Helmsley managed to buy a vast trove of real estate properties in more than 100 partnerships with other investors. Mr. Schneider and Mr. Schwartz were his partners in dozens of these.
The partnership agreements vary in what they prescribe in the event of the death of a partner. Some permit the heir named in the will to assume the same partnership position. Others allow the heir to receive the economic interest but not the power of a partner. Still others contain buyout clauses.
Peter Malkin, a sizable landlord and partner in many Helmsley buildings, said, "I don't think any of the partnerships I'm involved with will change because of Harry's death."
It is possible that, in resolving their dispute, the partnerships involving Mr. Schwartz, Mr. Schneider and Mr. Helmsley will be reconfigured such that Mrs. Helmsley would swap the Helmsley interest in some buildings for their interest in others.
Not until Mr. Helmsley's will is probated, however, will the precise effect on all these partnerships be clear. This could be weeks or months from now.
Mr. Helmsley had no children, and expectations in the real estate community are that the bulk of the estate will go to Mrs. Helmsley and the Harry Helmsley Foundation, a charitable organization, but no one seems to have any reliable knowledge of the will's contents and of how the estate will be parceled out.
It is also not clear when Mr. Helmsley last updated the will. He has been incapacitated for several years.
Though it is known Mr. Helmsley's holdings are worth a great deal of money, the precise value of his estate has attracted a rather large range of guesses. A few months ago, Forbes magazine put his worth at $1.7 billion and ranked him 67th among Americans.
Helmsley-Spear has faded as a competitive force in recent years, though it still has a significant portfolio. A number of the buildings are in need of refurbishment, and some of the less choice ones have vacancy rates as high as 30 percent.
Re/Locate, a real estate research firm, said that of 127 buildings for which Helmsley is the leasing agent, the average vacancy as of December was 16.49 percent, compared to 18.8 percent in December 1992. For the considerable cross section of buildings involved, it said that the vacancy rate was not much different from the market in general.

Harry B. Helmsley's real estate empire was so vast and complex that its precise dimensions could take months to sort out. He was owner or part-owner of some of Manhattan's best-known buildings, managing them through his company, Helmsley-Spear Inc., and running a chain of hotels with his wife, Leona.

HEADLINE: Despite a Slow Final Month, Year's Auto Sales Were Up

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 6

 BODY:
The auto industry ended the year with a 4 percent drop in sales, figures released today showed, but even with the December slowdown, auto makers sold more cars last year than in 1995.
Auto makers sold 15.1 million cars, mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles last year in the United States. That is slightly better than many Wall Street analysts expected, and it beats 1995 sales of 14.8 million. Sales above 15 million are considered healthy. 
 "Over all, the industry had a pretty good year," Ross H. Roberts, a Ford Motor Company vice president and manager of its largest division, said. Ford reported today that its sales rose 10.6 percent last month to eke out a gain for the year of 1.1 percent. Ford was the last of the large auto makers to report December sales.
Economists said they expected sales this year to continue their steady, relatively strong pace for the fourth year in a row. The chief economists at Ford, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation predicted today at the North American International Auto Show here that auto makers would sell 14.7 million to 15.2 million light vehicles in 1997.
W. Van Bussmann, Chrysler's chief economist, noted that sales had been remarkably flat for the last three years. In fact, he said, there was no three-year period in the industry's history in which the overall level of sales had showed so little change.
In December, auto sales dropped 4 percent compared with December 1995. Car sales slid 7.4 percent while sales of mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
The industry as a whole sold light vehicles at a 14.5 million annual pace in December, slightly down from the 14.84 million annual pace in November.
"December certainly ended up being weaker than people thought," David M. Garrity, an auto analyst at Smith Barney, said. That was partly because there were five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, he said, and people were too busy shopping for holiday gifts to visit showrooms.
Ford executives said last month's sales gains gave it a push into 1997. Robert L. Rewey, group vice president of marketing and sales for Ford, said, "The market will remain fiercely competitive, but we enter the new year with momentum, prepared to meet the challenges."
Ford sold 3.84 million cars, mini-vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles last year. The company's car sales fell 3.6 percent for the year, while light-truck sales rose 19.4 percent.
The nation's largest auto maker, General Motors, reported on Friday that its sales for the year fell 2.1 percent, to 4.79 million. Its car sales dropped 5.8 percent, while its truck sales rose 3.5 percent.
G. Richard Wagoner Jr., an executive vice president of General Motors and president of its North American automotive operations, said that G.M.'s results fell below its expectations for the year because two strikes reduced the company's output by 300,000 cars and light trucks. "Once that happened, the die was basically cast," he said.
Mr. Wagoner said that with many new models now beginning to reach the market, he expected G.M. to recover at least some of the market share it lost in 1996. "I have hopes for this year," he said.
Chrysler, by contrast, had a banner year. It sold 2.45 million cars and trucks, up 13 percent from 1995. Its car sales rose 5 percent while its truck sales jumped 17 percent.

HEADLINE: Services Becoming The Goods In Industry;
Not Enough Profit In Making Things

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
It gives "post-industrial" a whole new meaning: From General Electric to Wang, from Xerox to Hewlett-Packard, companies that a few years ago got almost all their profits from selling widgets are rapidly transforming themselves into service providers.
Computer companies like Unisys and I.B.M. are designing, installing and running other companies' computer operations. Document processors like Xerox and Pitney Bowes now run mail rooms and copy centers and distribute documents electronically. 
 Honeywell redesigns refineries. Hewlett-Packard not only designs and operates data systems, but pays for the whole package and then leases it out. "Customers want to finance a solution, not a little piece of it," said Ann M. Livermore, vice president for service operations at Hewlett-Packard.
The move to services is one of the hottest strategies in business, and it is driven by changes at the very foundations of manufacturing. Intense competition has made equipment margins sliver thin, while the trend for customers to outsource many of their internal systems has put a premium on expertise. And, perhaps most important, "Services generate huge cash flows, and today's businesses are run for cash flow," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with NatWest Securities.
Enough manufacturers are switching to services these days to pose a real threat to Electronic Data Systems, Andersen Consulting and other technological consultants. And the competition is getting nasty, with the pure consultants saying that equipment makers cannot be trusted to be objective advisers.
"An awful lot of manufacturers are in services just to pull through their hardware," said John R. Harris, an E.D.S. vice president.
The technology consultants are fighting back with more than innuendo. E.D.S. has been hiring "people who understand business, not just technology," Mr. Harris said. "Our emphasis has shifted from solving technology problems, to using technology to solve business problems."
Still, the potential rewards are so rich that few manufacturers are scared away. No one has amassed statistics about all the disparate service businesses. But most experts say the largest is global information technology services, which encompasses designing, maintaining and installing information systems. According to the market research firm Data Quest, that business reached about $234 billion last year, and should top $400 billion by the end of the decade.
Although independent consulting firms still rule that market, the manufacturers are gaining. Xerox's revenue from services went to $1.5 billion from $1 billion in 1995 -- maybe not much compared with the $13 billion that E.D.S. clocked last year, but still a formidable 50 percent increase. Michael J. Critelli, the chairman of Pitney Bowes, expects his company's mail- and copier-related services to grow 15 percent a year through 2000. "We know mail better than anyone outside the post office," Mr. Critelli said.
Services are growing even faster for computer companies, which increasingly design and run a client's entire computer operations, from payroll to tracking orders. Hewlett-Packard's 1996 service revenues were $5.3 billion, 20 percent above 1995. About $20 billion of I.B.M.'s $70 billion in 1995 revenues came from services, and Lloyd G. Waterhouse, a general manager of IBM Global Services, says services are growing faster than hardware or software.
General Electric derived $7 billion of its $70 billion in 1995 revenues from such services as repairing and maintaining locomotives, aircraft engines, power plants and medical equipment, and it expects such services to top $15 billion by 2000. The company just formed a services council, where representatives from all its manufacturing businesses share tips on how to expand the services business.
For example, G.E.'s medical division, which uses its own equipment to interpret diagnostic test data that have been electronically transmitted, has taught the aircraft engines division to use the same technology to figure out what might be wrong with an airplane at an airport thousands of miles away.
"I can expand a lot faster by upgrading or maintaining the equipment I have installed than by trying to sell more units," said John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman, who says product-related services are growing at "two to three times the rate of products themselves."
For G.E., a hugely profitable company, pursuing services is just a way to grow. For many computer companies, it is a survival strategy. Competition has intensified, product life cycles have shortened and the advent of "open architectures" -- systems that allow companies to mix and match components from rival manufacturers -- is enabling customers to shop around when they want to upgrade or expand.
The situation is most dire for companies that make personal computers, mainframes and other equipment that has become so standardized that their "variations no longer matter as much as the services that need to be attached to them," said Peter J. Kolesar, a professor at the Columbia Business School.
A result is that manufacturing gross margins, which once went as high as 75 percent, now rarely exceed 30 percent. For services, gross margins can exceed 50 percent.
"Consulting margins were never as high relative to manufacturing as now," said Patrick T. Harker, a professor at the Wharton School.
That is what the most beleaguered computer companies are banking on. At Unisys, which has faced vanishing profits on mainframes and PC's, computer-related services now represent 63 percent of revenues and 100 percent of hopes. "Equipment margins are so low that services are the only way to improve our bottom line," Dewaine Osman, a Unisys senior vice president, said.
Similarly, Wang Laboratories has been bailing out of its ailing office computer businesses since emerging from bankruptcy in 1993. It now concentrates on designing and running local and wide area networks.
"Services provide a high return on assets without plants, property or equipment," Joseph M. Tucci, Wang's chairman, said.
The push into services has not, however, come solely from manufacturers' woes. It has roots in customers' needs, too.
For one thing, customers are increasingly outsourcing operations, including maintenance, that do not fit their core businesses. "If you're already providing the equipment portion of the solution, it makes sense to provide the rest of it, too," said Thomas J. Dolan, senior vice president for the business services division at Xerox.
Customers also want to deal with fewer and fewer suppliers, which means the customers want each supplier to handle multiple needs.
Honeywell, which in 1991 got less than a quarter of its revenue from services, now gets nearly a third from helping oil refiners improve profitability, say, or designing energy systems for factories or school districts. Michael R. Bonsignore, Honeywell's chief executive, readily concedes that in the past, customers might have hired a consulting firm to do a feasibility study, and then put needed equipment out for bid.
"When customers still insisted on three bids for everything, our move into services wouldn't have worked," Mr. Bonsignore said. "But now, who supplies the hardware is less important than who can handle the entire application."
The need to provide a full range of services has sent many vendors on acquisition sprees. E.D.S. recently bought A. T. Kearney, a manufacturing consultant. Wang bought I-Net, a telecommunications services firm, a move that enables Wang to supplement its computer-related services with video conferencing. Honeywell purchased companies that provide emergency shutdown procedures for oil rigs, set up integrated computer networks and fine-tune chemical processes.
Still, the most comprehensive menu of services cannot help a manufacturer refute claims that it remains partial to its own equipment.
"We are independent from the hardware and software companies, and that makes customers comfortable," Mr. Tucci of Wang said.
Stephen D. Sprinkle, a managing partner of Deloitte & Touche's Consulting Group, is more blunt. "Clients want to buy advice and services from someone they perceive as more objective than the provider of an associated product," he said.
Hogwash, countered Mr. Waterhouse of I.B.M., who said that I.B.M. manages systems that include more than 500,000 non-I.B.M. computers -- many of which, he says, I.B.M. recommended. "Everyone realizes that these days, one PC is much like another," he said. "It is more important to our customers that we know how to implement business applications because we had to adopt so much technology to solve our own financial problems."
Indeed, many manufacturers hammer home the point that they identify with their customers' problems far more than a consultant whose only product is expertise.
"Impartiality is a great big fat red herring," Ms. Livermore of Hewlett-Packard said. "Customers just care that you know enough to make the solution work."
Autodesk, a fast-growing manufacturer of animation software, recently chose Hewlett-Packard over E.D.S. and Andersen to run its data center. What tipped the scales was that Autodesk was struggling with S.A.P., a complex software system for tracking materials, orders and finished products. Although both Andersen and E.D.S. had vast experience consulting with S.A.P. users, Hewlett-Packard was in the process of installing the system for its own use. "H-P really understands firsthand what is needed to make the S.A.P. system run most efficiently," said William H. Kredel, Autodesk's chief information officer.
Still, to ward off the semblance of bias, many manufacturers, including I.B.M. and Unisys, have given autonomy to their manufacturing and services arms. But, paradoxically, such a "Chinese wall" may prove to annoy as many customers as it reassures.
"If I'm buying equipment and services from a company, I should be able to leverage that clout," said Joseph J. Campbell, executive vice president of Risk Enterprise Management Limited, an insurance services company that recently hired Unisys to run its multivendor PC network. "I don't want people telling me they can't control what another division does for us."

HEADLINE: SOCIAL SECURITY: NEWS ANALYSIS;
The Ultimate Insider

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Every week a President and Cabinet members make decisions, large and small, that move markets. Should the United States go to war against Saddam Hussein to protect Kuwait and maintain access to oil? Should it agree to a series of spending cuts that make a balanced budget within six years more likely? Should it agree to cut the capital gains tax?
Now, the recommendation that the country place a large part of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market, where it should be able to reap greater returns and avoid a revenue shortfall early in the next century, raises a host of questions about how such decisions of state might be affected. Under the most modest investment plan suggested yesterday by the Advisory Council on Social Security, a trillion dollars in Government money could be placed in the stock market by 2015. Under the most aggressive plan, the figure would exceed $4 trillion. 
 Could any President -- or a Treasury Secretary or Federal Reserve head -- ignore that fact in making decisions that could send the markets into the tank, imperiling the returns on funds in which, as the committee noted, "every American family would have a stake?"
That is only one of the many questions prompted by the conclusions of the Advisory Council, which was sharply divided on whether investing in the market was necessary to save the system -- and, if necessary, whether Social Security beneficiaries should be given broad powers to manage their individual accounts.
The most dramatic recommendation would turn the system into something akin to a national 401(k) plan, the tax-deferred retirement accounts that millions of American workers now manage for themselves, with the savviest investors reaping the biggest rewards when they reach 65.
The lobbying will be fierce. Wall Street is ecstatic at the idea that billions upon billions of dollars that today are invested only in Government securities might suddenly fuel the stock market. Its enthusiasm is hardly without self-interest. If fund managers are permitted to skim just 1 percent in management fees, it would mean new Wall Street revenues of $10 billion to $40 billion a year in 2015, and far more in the next century.
Labor unions say that it is not only risky to rely on volatile markets, but that it is also a surrender of the guarantees that the Social Security system has come to represent. And the American Association of Retired Persons declared today, "There is no need to rush to radical reform."
But what of the conflict of interest inherent in any system that places the most influential single market force, the Federal Government, in the position of being the single largest investor? Some officials say the conflict of interest is more theoretical than real. After all, billions in state pension funds, and even some Federal pension money, are already invested in the stock market.
And so is the future of any politician who can count electoral votes. Just ask President Clinton, who abandoned many of the promises of his first campaign when it became apparent that the markets were demanding fiscal discipline.
It was a risky strategy that, his aides said, paid off in November. "People dismissed Bob Dole's argument that the economy was in terrible shape," a top aide said, "because they knew that everyone was making money in the market."
But others around Mr. Clinton note that pouring Social Security money into the markets would turn what has for decades been a close interconnection between Washington and Wall Street into an iron link.
Market reactions, they say, are always a consideration in major Government decisions. But they could loom over such decisions if the President, for example, was advised that the cost of sending troops to secure the peace on the Korean Peninsula might be a selloff that every American worker would see reflected on quarterly statements that spelled out the value of their "Personal Security Account."
"If you have the national Government making decisions that will influence financial markets and if the Government is directly involved in investing in those markets," said an economist at Salomon Brothers, John Lipsky, "it will undoubtedly affect decisions."
Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers agreed today to say virtually nothing about the report.
The details of the report aside, there are some areas of broad agreement whenever Washington policymakers take up the electric issue of messing with Social Security. The first is that the system needs to be fixed. The only question is whether a small repair will do the job -- adjusting the consumer-price index, for example, to reflect the fact that inflation, and the Social Security benefits tied to inflation statistics, is overstated -- or whether a much bigger repair is needed.
The second agreement is that America needs to increase its savings and investment rates, which pale in comparison to the savings rate in Japan and many of the world's most dynamic economies. Forced investment would be a big step toward that goal.
But as soon as the subject turns to stock investment, the consensus falls apart. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the former investment banker whose opinion counts most in the Administration's internal debate on the subject, has said many times he has "substantial concerns" about putting a large chunk of the Social Security trust fund at the mercies of the stock market. White House officials say he has expressed that view in private in stronger terms.
Mr. Rubin made his considerable fortune in a long career at Goldman Sachs & Company and needs no tutorial on the arguments that make the investment strategy so appealing to those trying to repair the system. Today, the Social Security trust fund earns a rate of return of about 2.3 percent after inflation. Historically, the stock market has a rate of return of 7 percent. The difference, compounded over decades, is enormous.
But to some degree the national psychology is affected by the fact that the market has risen so dramatically, with only one major interruption, for 15 years. That psychology could be radically changed by a prolonged downturn. And if Social Security recipients were losing billions for several years, the pressure on the recipients of Government bailouts would undoubtedly mount.
Some on the commission, including Thomas W. Jones, president of T.I.A.A.-CREF, which manages $180 billion in retirement money for professors and researchers, wonder whether the Government or Social Security recipients should be put in that bind. "To me the bottom line is that half of America's workers have no other pension plan," Mr. Jones said today. "Those are the people who absolutely need Social Security, with a guarantee. How reasonable is it to take away the guarantee, but say to them, 'You can make it up with investing acumen?' It's just not appropriate to put them at risk."

HEADLINE: How U.N. Chief Discovered U.S., and Earmuffs

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Kofi Annan's discovery of America took shape in the turbulent 1960's, on a Midwestern college campus that flew a United Nations flag. It was an era of civil rights protests and passionate policy debates over a world of causes.
Now, as as Mr. Annan takes over as the seventh Secretary General of the United Nations, America seems to him a different place, estranged from the international organization, more wary of involvement in the outside world. 
 His election owed much to American antipathy toward his predecessor and skepticism over the organization's performance. One of his biggest challenges, he says, will be to help repair the relationship.
Few would dispute that Mr. Annan has the credentials to do so. No Secretary General has known the United States as intimately or for as long as this Ghanaian, the first black African elected to the job. And unlike his predecessors, Mr. Annan has not only enjoyed diplomatic society in New York, but has also nurtured a deep, decades-long fascination with African-American life across the United States.
It began, he says, in 1959, when this student from newly independent Ghana began to watch as "the African diaspora in America woke up and embraced Africa."
"It was an exciting period," he said in an interview on Friday evening, after his first two hectic days in his new office atop the Secretariat building. "I had come from Ghana, and we had just gone through our own struggle for independence. Ghana became independent in 1957, only two years earlier. People of my generation, having seen the change that took place in Ghana, grew up thinking all was possible.
"When I came to the States, the social upheaval reminded me of some things that had gone on there," he added, sitting in an office still largely undecorated except for a bowl of flowers, an African woodcarving and an abstract painting by his wife, Nane, a Swedish lawyer-turned-artist.
Mr. Annan arrived in the United States in the summer of 1959 on a scholarship from the Foreign Students Leadership Project of the Ford Foundation, which scouted the world for promising future leaders. Mr. Annan, then a student at Ghana's University of Science and Technology and vice president of the Ghana Students' Union, was spotted by a talent scout at a meeting of African student leaders in Sierra Leone.
He also remembers 1959 as the year of the earmuffs.
"I entered the United States at Boston, and did a summer program at Harvard," he said. "I then moved on to Macalester College in Minnesota. It was my first winter ever, and that was quite an experience.
"Intellectually, I knew about the seasons," he said, his elegant English softened by a lilting West African cadence. "I knew about snow. I knew about winter. But I had never experienced it until I got to Minnesota." Unwillingly, he bundled up in cumbersome clothes, he said. But he drew the line at earmuffs, which looked ridiculous.
"I resisted as long as I could, until one day, going to get something to eat, my ears nearly froze," he recalled. "So I went and bought the biggest pair I could find. But even in that I learned a very important lesson. You never walk into a situation and believe that you know better than the natives. You have to listen and look around. Otherwise you can make some very serious mistakes."
Mr. Annan got his first look at the rest of the country the following summer from a new Rambler station wagon filled with students -- Sri Lankan, Greek, British and American -- and a faculty guide.
"We stayed with families that were very comfortable," Mr. Annan said. "We stayed with sharecroppers. We even attempted to stay in jail at Dodge City just to see the conditions." Turned down by a warden who said that in his 32 years on the job nobody had ever asked to be locked up, they slept at the Salvation Army instead.
"We did get into situations in some of the Southern states where they did not want to serve us because of the mixed group," he said. "In Las Vegas, the Sri Lankan was told he couldn't use the pool. He was extremely upset. But generally people were hospitable.
"In the 60's, I saw a very generous people," he said. But now, he added, "when I see groups emerging that are so self-centered, so determined to keep out everybody, in a nation of immigrants -- this distrust of people who are different -- it is difficult to explain."
Mr. Annan is also critical of his native continent. On a visit to Ghana with his family over Christmas, he lectured the Ghanaian Parliament on the importance of the rule of law and the careful exercise of power.
"I will try very hard to solve the problems of the continent," he said. "But for assistance to be effective, these governments must get their own house in order. They should open their political systems. They should take steps to reduce if not eliminate corruption. In a way, I think that comes with the opening of the economy."
Mr. Annan, 58, who was born into a prominent family among the Fante people of Ghana's Ashanti region, has a reputation at the United Nations, where he has worked as an international civil servant for most of his career, as a level-headed and humane administrator who makes a point of wishing the children of his colleagues a happy new year.
Mr. Annan, who has a master's degree in management from M.I.T., said he would take his time in putting together a new team to guide the United Nations through his five-year term. But he intends to move quickly to open access and encourage discussion in the organization, which was run in a more hierarchical style by his predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali. "The building will breathe with information," said his spokesman, Frederic Eckhard.
Life will also change for Mr. Annan's wife, the former Nane Lagergren, 52, a cosmopolitan but shy woman whose mother was the half-sister of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who disappeared in 1945 while rescuing Jews from the Nazis in Eastern Europe. Her family continues to hope that he is alive despite reports to the contrary, and he is "a very constant presence -- and absence" in their lives, she said.
The Annans, who have three grown children from previous marriages, met in 1981 in Geneva, where she was a legal officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. They were married in 1984 at the United Nations chapel in New York. Settled here, she turned to full-time painting while her husband, most recently Under Secretary General for peacekeeping operations, undertook difficult assignments: in Iraq, where he negotiated the release of United Nations staff members in 1991 during the Persian Gulf war, and in 1995 in the Balkans, where he turned over a peacekeeping operation to NATO.
Mr. Annan describes their time together as "fascinating," even though there were some early cultural wrinkles -- none too serious, since he was well acquainted with Europe and she had lived and traveled in Africa as a child.
"At the beginning it was very difficult," he said. "We would organize a dinner. Nane being a Swede -- that's a country where if you invite them for 8 o'clock, they will get there at 5 or 10 to 8 and circle the block, and ring the bell at 8 -- was used to punctuality. The Ghanaian or the African guests would come about 30 minutes to an hour late, and she used to get furious. So I said just don't do souffles.
"I'm more punctual now," he said. "And she's more relaxed."
"I'm a quick study," she said.

HEADLINE: Will State Dept. Rights Advocate Get a Bigger Role?

BYLINE: STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 3

 BODY:
When he was elected four years ago, President Clinton promised to be a human rights President and refuse to "coddle dictators."
As a sign of that intention he named John Shattuck -- with a background as a top official at Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union -- as the State Department's point man for promotion of human rights abroad. 
 The human rights record of the first Clinton term was mixed, however. Mr. Clinton's reluctance to get tough on the abuses of big trading partners like China, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Indonesia left rights advocates frustrated, even as they applauded the Administration's encouragement of democracy in places like Haiti and Bosnia.
Many proponents of human rights agreed with Aryeh Neier, president of a private foundation called the Open Society Institute, who said Mr. Clinton had embraced a new post-cold-war double standard:
Before, Washington excused repressive anti-Communist allies while attacking the ample abuses of Communist countries. Today, Mr. Neier notes, the new dividing lines are trade and security, with Washington ready to denounce or sanction "pariah states" like Iraq or Iran and "governments of countries that are not considered politically or economically important."
Now, the prospect of a more outspoken and forceful human rights advocate in Secretary of State-designate Madeleine K. Albright -- whose confirmation hearings before the Senate begin on Wednesday -- has heartened human rights lobbyists.
It has also raised the prospects, officials say, that the often disheartened Mr. Shattuck will stay on for a second term, and play a more central part in American foreign policy.
Mr. Shattuck has spent considerable time this week helping to brief Ms. Albright for her Congressional hearings, and he worked closely with her on Bosnia, Haiti and Burma while she was permanent representative to the United Nations.
Human rights advocates expect to have a strong ally in Ms. Albright, whose confirmation is a virtual certainty. She is expected to be "more willing to excoriate dictators as dictators," said Thomas Carothers, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment. A former refugee from Nazism and Communism, she believes in the power of the American example.
By the standards of human rights advocates, Mr. Clinton had notable, if fragile, achievements in Haiti, where American troops overthrew a military dictatorship and restored an elected President; and in Bosnia, where belated but robust American intervention stopped the killing and imposed a peace that has at least given democracy a chance to grow.
But more often, Mr. Shattuck found himself forced into a sort of "human rights ghetto" in a larger State Department bureaucracy, and lost many arguments to powerful advocates for trade and jobs in the Commerce and Treasury departments or because of national security concerns in the Pentagon.
Perhaps the biggest disappointment of human rights proponents is China. The President flip-flopped on policy, first insisting that China's trade privileges be tied to its willingness to improve its human rights record, and then changing his mind. The decision undermined his credibility with Beijing, and China's rights record worsened, if anything, as it rearrested political opponents and tried to stamp out public dissent.
Critics accuse the Administration of abandoning its moral goals in the face of pressure from American businessmen and hot rhetoric from the Chinese.
In general, officials acknowledge, human rights concerns under Mr. Clinton have had a bigger effect on policy in smaller, more obscure countries like Burma than in places like China, Russia or Saudi Arabia, where moral issues were subordinated to larger security, trade and economic concerns.
But better than others before him, even critics agree, Mr. Shattuck, 53, has pushed back. He says he has had to learn to fight his corner, seeking allies and biding his time, even within the State Department itself.
He has had some institutional successes, enlarging the area in which he can operate. Countries' human rights records can now be used as criteria for granting them loans and aid.
And in the former Yugoslavia, Mr. Shattuck sees an important change in a newly re-elected Administration's willingness both to confront President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia over election fraud and to consider more seriously, officials assert, using the military to hunt down war criminals in Bosnia.
Adrian Karatnycky, president of Freedom House, which monitors democracy and human rights worldwide, said: "China is the one great counter-example and an important one. But in Haiti, Bosnia, Burma and now in Serbia, there's a decent and credible record. This is an activist Administration that looks for opportunities to press things in the right direction, when we can exert influence and lend our voice to ongoing events, like Serbia."
While acknowledging that human rights have often taken a back seat, senior Government officials say there are strong arguments that countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia may be too fragile to weaken further by making human rights an overriding priority, outweighing America's thirst for oil, regional security or, as in Russia's case, the prospects for democracy itself.
There, the Administration was slow to highlight Russian abuses in the breakaway province of Chechnya, both at the beginning of the war in December 1994 and during its resurgence last spring, while Boris N. Yeltsin was seeking re-election. In Russia, the twin aims of human rights and democracy promotion came into conflict.
It was China, however, that encapsulated the first two years of foreign-policy confusion under Mr. Clinton, and it marked the officials involved.
After Mr. Shattuck and Mr. Christopher took a hard line on human rights in Beijing and China rearrested a noted dissident, Wei Jingsheng, President Clinton backed down, succumbing to pressure from American businesses, which were eager to press forward with investments in China.
"In China, the Clinton Administration sabotaged itself, and has no one else to blame," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, formerly Helsinki Watch. "Christopher and Shattuck climbed way out to the end of the limb in China, and President Clinton chopped it off. And they learned not to climb out on that limb again."
Mr. Shattuck prefers to discuss accomplishments, not setbacks. "This Administration," he said, "has produced a dramatic change: the willingness to use combined diplomacy and military force in the defense of human rights."
The United States had other interests in Haiti and Bosnia, he admits, ranging from illegal refugees and immigration concerns to the preservation of NATO. "But underlying these crises were crises of human rights that captured attention and forced the issues," Mr. Shattuck said.
Mr. Shattuck pointed to the landmark inclusion in the Dayton Accords, signed by all the parties to the Bosnia conflict, of the War Crimes Tribunal.
"It's the first agreement in history, despite its flaws and failures of implementation, where all parties agreed in writing to respect a war crimes tribunal," said the main Bosnia negotiator, the former Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, Richard C. Holbrooke.
But the Clinton Administration was late getting into Bosnia, after many thousands died, and has not been willing to take military risks to enforce the human rights aspects of Dayton, like freedom of movement, the return of refugees and especially the capture of those indicted for war crimes. The last is again a live issue. Despite Pentagon reluctance, there is renewed talk of putting force behind the tribunal, which will otherwise wither.
Mr. Shattuck hopes the worm is turning. "Part of the job," he said, "is to draw attention, both here and abroad, to abuses, to give us leverage and often a seat at the decision-making table. You have to have a good sense of timing -- bide your time and keep the issue alive."

HEADLINE: SOCIAL SECURITY: THE OVERVIEW;
PANEL ON SOCIAL SECURITY URGES INVESTING IN STOCKS, BUT IS SPLIT OVER METHODS

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
A Federal advisory panel suggested today that the nation consider investing part of its Social Security revenues in the stock market to insure the solvency of the retirement program. But panel members disagreed on whether workers or the Government should decide how the money is invested.
Seven of the 13 panel members recommended compulsory private savings through individual investment accounts. Labor unions said they would fiercely resist the use of such accounts to replace any part of the Federal program. 
 Under current law, Social Security payroll taxes not needed for today's benefits are invested exclusively in Government securities, mainly long-term bonds. In its final report, issued after more than two years of work, the advisory panel agreed that Social Security could obtain a much higher return by investing some of the money in stocks.
"Private investment is the key to bolstering the return on workers' very substantial tax payments," said Carolyn L. Weaver, a panel member who is an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. "Our proposal could produce larger retirement incomes for workers and boost national saving and economic growth."
But panel members disagreed over what level of financial risk was acceptable to workers and retirees. And they could not agree on whether workers should be allowed to choose the stocks and mutual funds in which their money would be invested.
In view of these disagreements, no major changes in Social Security are likely any time soon. But the panel's report sets the stage for a national debate on retirement policy. [Excerpts, page A14.]
The report represents a possible turning point in the history of Social Security, which was created in 1935 and is the nation's biggest, most successful social insurance program. It could also prove a boon to Wall Street by funneling billions of dollars into stocks. [Article, page A14.]
The panel, the Advisory Council on Social Security, was appointed in June 1994 by Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. She asked the members to take a long view of Social Security's financial health. The chairman of the panel was Edward M. Gramlich, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.
As they completed their work, the 13 members of the panel found themselves agreeing in groups of 6, 5 and 2. Each faction advanced its own plan to guarantee the solvency of Social Security over the next 75 years. Seven of the 13 members favored compulsory private savings through individual accounts, but they disagreed over whether workers should have limited or complete control over them.
The six other members said that the Government itself should consider investing part of the surplus in the Social Security trust fund -- up to 40 percent -- in stocks.
This group of six included three labor union officers and was led by Robert M. Ball, who worked at the Social Security Administration for more than three decades and was Commissioner from 1962 to 1973.
The amount of money that would be injected into the stock market varied under the three plans. In 2015, for example, stock holdings would range from $1.2 trillion to $4.2 trillion. These totals, expressed in terms of today's purchasing power, range from $601 billion to $2.1 trillion.
Panel members estimated that these totals would be equivalent to 5 percent to 15 percent of the total market value of stocks. (By contrast, the assets of 401(k) plans quadrupled from 1984 to 1990, when they reached $385 billion, and they totaled $525 billion by the end of 1994.)
Mr. Ball said there was no need for radical change. "Social Security is not in the emergency room and does not require radical surgery," he said. "To maintain its long-term health, it requires only a series of moderate adjustments to revenues and expenses."
Clinton Administration officials and senior Republicans in Congress, knowing that Social Security is an explosive issue among voters, reacted with utmost caution. They said that they wanted to study the proposals before taking action, and that action would not come for several years, at the earliest.
Administration officials and members of Congress said that Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, faced much more urgent financial problems. Its Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is expected to run out of money in 2001, assuming no change in current law.
Labor representatives were more vocal. Gerald M. Shea, a panel member who is assistant to the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., denounced the proposals to replace part of Social Security with compulsory private savings that would be invested in stocks and bonds. He said that labor unions were organizing a campaign to "prevent these ideas of radical reform from getting beyond the fantasy stage."
Mr. Shea said that the proposals would "divert large amounts of money to Wall Street" and could be a boon for stockbrokers, mutual funds and investment advisers. Companies involved in financial services are already trying to whip up support for such plans, he said.
Sylvester J. Schieber, a panel member who helped draft the proposal for personal savings accounts, said that financial service companies "did not influence our thinking." Moreover, he said, "this is a highly competitive industry," and added that the competition among investment managers would prevent them from "reaping undue or exorbitant profits." Mr. Schieber is a vice president of Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a management consulting concern that specializes in employee benefits.
Proponents of personal savings accounts rejected the characterization of their proposal as radical. "There was a time," they said, "in the early 1930's, that Social Security was considered radical. We must get beyond such politically charged words."
Social Security pays monthly cash benefits to 44 million people: 31 million retirees, 7 million survivors and 6 million disabled people.
The first baby boomers will reach the age of 65 in 2011. The Social Security trust fund now has assets of more than $550 billion, and the surplus is expected to rise to $2.8 trillion in 2018. But then, the Administration says, the assets will begin to decline, as the payments to retirees begin to exceed the revenues paid by workers. By 2029, if the system is unchanged, the trust fund will be depleted, and revenues will cover only three-fourths of benefit costs.
Council members expressed surprising agreement on the importance of the annual cost-of-living adjustment, which is intended to preserve the purchasing power of Social Security benefits and offset the effects of inflation.
Benefits are now increased each year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. The advisory council said that the cost-of-living adjustment could be reduced to reflect corrections that might be made in this index by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But the panel said Congress should not dictate changes in the cost-of-living adjustment because such action would set "a bad precedent" that could be used to cut benefits unfairly.
A panel of five economists appointed by the Senate Finance Committee said last month that the index overstates the cost of living by 1.1 percentage points. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, has said that Americans need not make immediate changes in the structure of Social Security if they agree to corrections in the cost-of-living adjustment.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who supervises Social Security as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, did not endorse any specific recommendation, but said he hoped that President Clinton would display "bold leadership."
Mr. Clinton's press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, offered a noncommittal response to the council's recommendations. At Mr. McCurry's regular briefing for journalists today, this exchange occurred:
Question: "What does the President think of investing some of the Social Security money in the stock market?"
Answer: "He believes that there are a number of ideas that have surfaced as part of this debate -- and certainly in the report of the advisory council itself -- that merit further discussion. He is not wedded to any of the suggestions made by any of the separate groups of members of the council itself, but agrees that many of these ideas will have to be discussed further and will have to be an element of the bipartisan process that would lead to resolution of questions about the future of Social Security."
Horace B. Deets, executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons, said: "Social Security is not in crisis. There is no reason to rush to radical reform proposals that would undermine the stability of the program."
Mr. Deets said that the proposals to channel a part of payroll taxes into individual investment accounts would be "especially risky for poor and middle-income elderly who rely on Social Security" as their main source of income.
These families, he said, "would have significantly less to invest than wealthy investors, would pay more in administrative fees and would be less able to protect themselves against downturns in the stock market."
Edith U. Fierst, a lawyer and member of the advisory council who specializes in women's pension rights, said: "Privatization is a threat to American women. The money accumulated in a personal savings account would belong to the person whose earnings were taxed, not to the spouse. Men are still earning more than women, so their accounts would be larger. If the man is not required to buy an annuity, he could take the money to Las Vegas or use it to support a girlfriend or buy a business."

HEADLINE: Federal Encroachment Or New Opportunity?

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif., Jan. 4

 BODY:
As an outspoken City Council member active on county and Federal land-use committees and a witness at Congressional field hearings, James Bagley has made himself this town's voice on environmental issues. And when it comes to the creation and expansion of several national parks and wilderness areas in the surrounding desert, he has been a loud and energetic critic.
"It's the new socialism," Mr. Bagley said, sitting in his real estate brokerage on the northern edge of town, near the huge military base that has long been the community's economic mainstay. "We're nationalizing the public lands." 
 But while Mr. Bagley may fit a popular image of small-town Westerners as sagebrush Republicans who distrust the Federal Government and want more control over nearby land, he does not speak for everyone here. While some people in the local cafes and bars agree with him, there is a wide range of views here on land use, with some residents holding a vision very different from Mr. Bagley's for the future of the Federal property that nearly surrounds this town, 150 miles east of Los Angeles.
William J. Garvin, a 41-year-old construction contractor and high school friend of Mr. Bagley, strongly opposed the decision by Congress in 1994 to preserve nine million acres of nearby land by creating new national parks and designating a patchwork of new wilderness areas.
But Mr. Garvin said he had since changed his mind about the move, which was led by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. What made the difference, he said, was seeing the extra tourism that seems to have followed the upgrading of nearby Joshua Tree National Monument into a national park. Now Mr. Garvin is converting an abandoned motel into apartments for would-be artists who want to supply the town's gift shops.
"I would have helped lynch Dianne Feinstein three years ago," Mr. Garvin said at the end of a lunch at the Finicky Coyote, a local cafe. "I didn't think it out far enough; I didn't think it out three years to now."
While precise tallies for tourists are scarce, the city's tax revenue from them has been rising. Municipal receipts from a tax on hotel and motel guests grew to $171,000 in the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 1996, from $155,000 in the previous fiscal year, said Ronald Peck, the city finance manager. And the increase came despite the temporary closing of national parks for a total of three weeks as budget battles were waged in Washington early last year.
B. K. Wiederhold, a broad-shouldered, retired Marine major and high school football coach, nursed a bottle of Coors Light at an oasis bar while describing his support for the National Rifle Association, his 40-year habit of keeping guns in his vehicles and his recent application for a concealed weapons permit. But after expressing dismay at Federal plans to store nuclear waste in the desert, Mr. Wiederhold voiced some enthusiasm for the recent expansion of federally protected areas and strong support for Federal limits on off-road driving in the desert.
"If they don't protect it," he said, "we'll find a way to mess it up."
And at the nearby office of the Twentynine Palms Inn, Paul E. Smith, who owns the inn with his wife, said he had no complaint when rangers at the new Mojave National Preserve 40 miles northeast of here had posted signs closing access to one of his favorite dirt roads.
"The funding for that park is so short that I wouldn't even ask the rangers why they did it," Mr. Smith said.
Mr. Smith, who grew up in the Los Angeles suburb of La Canada Flint ridge, spends half his time here and half his time working as a lawyer in Pasadena, another Los Angeles suburb. Recent arrivals here have tended to be more understanding of restrictions on Federal land than longtime residents, who remember when it was easier to tear across the desert on a dirt bike or build camp fires far from any ring of already blackened stones, and who more often agree with Mr. Bagley's views.
At the smoke-filled Stars Way Out bar, a popular hangout for rural miners and retired members of the military, David Wiesner, George Yoakum and Dale Satterfield sat near the pool table playing seven-card stud for quarters on Saturday afternoon. They had nothing good to say about Federal restrictions on land use, particularly on mining.
"What are they going to hurt out here in the desert?" asked Mr. Weisner, the bar's owner. "Nothing."
It is difficult to gauge the precise number of people here who support recent Federal restrictions on land use and who oppose them. Local elections do not provide a signal because they tend to be fought over law-enforcement and economic-development issues that local groups can influence, not over Federal land policies. The city continues to favor Republicans in national elections.
But what does seem clear is that while the image of small-town Westerners furious with Federal land restrictions has become part of popular American political wisdom, the residents of Twentynine Palms hardly fit that stereotype.
Mr. Bagley, who is now criticizing Federal acquisitions of private land in connection with the expanded parks, acknowledged when pressed that the town was divided on land use policy.
"You have the whole spectrum" of views, he said, before changing the subject to his memories of bygone days spent driving across the open desert, exploring every cave and canyon, without any fear of being ticketed by park rangers.

HEADLINE: A MOVE TO SHIFT BALANCE OF POWER IN NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
Barely seven years after voters approved a sweeping set of City Charter revisions that gave broad new power to New York's City Council, the Speaker of the Council said yesterday that it was not nearly enough.
Complaining that the current balance of power unfairly favors the mayor's office, the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, announced yesterday that he would form a commission to put before the voters another set of Charter revisions aimed at further expanding the Council's role in running government. 
 Specifically, Mr. Vallone said he wanted the Council to have more say over the city budget and land-use policy. And in a very clear attempt to gain more control over the executive branch, Mr. Vallone proposed a Charter change increasing the Council's powers to approve the Mayor's cabinet-level appointments.
Mr. Vallone said that the commission that proposed the 1989 Charter changes, which were enacted in 1990 after a citywide vote, had not fully anticipated how the mayor's office and the City Council would evolve. As a result, the relationship between the executive and legislative branches has grown bitter at times, leading to several opposing lawsuits by the Council and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Vallone called the situation a "syndrome of government by litigation."
Responding to Mr. Vallone, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he was satisfied with the balance of power, adding that he thought the Council should leave the Charter alone.
"We just had a Charter revision," the Mayor said. "We're still experiencing some new things under it, and I think it should be left alone for a while."
State law gives the Council the power to empanel a new Charter review commission and choose all its members without the Mayor's approval. This commission would, in turn, recommend Charter changes that would have to go before voters for final approval.
Mr. Vallone said the Council planned to appoint the new panel this year, adding that he anticipated a vote on Charter revision in 1999.
The commission would be required by law to review all aspects of the Charter, but a panel appointed by the Council would be likely to favor the Speaker's recommendations. But getting the voters to approve them is another matter. Last November voters rejected a measure that Mr. Vallone pushed to extend term limits for city officials.
The 1989 Charter changes produced the biggest overhaul of municipal government since the Greater City of New York was created in 1898. Under the changes the Board of Estimate was abolished and its powers divided between the Mayor and the City Council. Mr. Vallone urged Mr. Giuliani yesterday to work with the Council on revising the Charter, but the Mayor gave no indication that he intended to participate.
"I think that the balance in the City Charter is an adequate one and a good one and has served us well," Mr. Giuliani said. "And I don't know that I'd agree that there has to be the kinds of changes that he's talking about. It would almost create a very different kind of government."
Mr. Vallone argued that the Council's failure to extend term limits for elected officials last fall made Charter revision even more important. He has long argued that term limits will turn out virtually all of the Council's members at the end of 2001, creating a rookie legislative body that would also be much weaker than the executive branch.
"For a democratic government to endure, that government must be balanced," Mr. Vallone said in his annual speech to the Council yesterday. "Its powers must be equally distributed between the executive at the top, and the legislative branch closest to the people. If that balance cannot be struck, if it cannot be maintained, then democracy itself is in danger and slowly slips into government by executive decree."
Despite the resounding defeat the Council suffered last fall when voters refused to extend term limits to 12 years from 8 for the Council and other elected officials, Mr. Vallone said he believed voters would be willing to approve increased powers for the Council. When the current Charter was drafted in 1989, he explained, "there was a distrust that was held for the Council. Now, seven years later, I don't think anyone can objectively say that the Council as an institution has been irresponsible when it comes to adopting the budget or anything else."
Mr. Vallone said he was most interested in obtaining more control over the budget.
As it is, "we can always refuse to adopt the budget and budget modifications, but that's only the power to destroy," he said. "And legislatures should have the power to create as much as the Mayor does."
The Mayor and Mr. Vallone have usually tried to work out their differences quietly, and the Democratic Council has usually chosen to adopt city budgets with relatively little fuss.
But Mr. Giuliani and the Council have disagreed regularly over the legislative body's institutional power.
For example, the Council filed lawsuits seeking a role in mid-year budget modifications and in the creation of an independent police review board. The Council also sued to win final approval rights over the sale of city hospitals.
The legal wrangling over the budget ended in a split decision, and the other lawsuits are pending. Thomas V. Ognibene, the Council's minority leader from Queens, predicted the Speaker's Charter proposals would not become a partisan issue.
"It'll be an institutional issue between the executive and legislative branches," he said.
Eric Lane, counsel to the 1989 Charter Revision Commission and now a law professor at Hofstra University, said the authors of the City Charter deliberately chose to tilt the balance of budget-making power toward the Mayor. After the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, the commission decided that the Mayor's office would be a better check on runaway spending than a broader legislative body that did not have as much direct accountability.
"The commission fully believed that the power to estimate revenues was one that should remain with the Mayor," Mr. Lane said. "Legislative bodies tend to be inflationary because you try to satisfy people by providing them with benefits for their constituents. Coming out of the near bankruptcy of the mid-70's, everyone was very wary about creating another opportunity to inflate the budget."
But Mr. Lane said another point raised by Mr. Vallone -- that the Council should have more of a role in determining what agencies' budgets are cut, had more validity. Because the Charter was revised in an era of rising revenues, he said, the commission did not fully anticipate the kinds of massive mid-year budget cuts made by both former Mayor David N. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani.
Representatives from some advocacy groups, who have often criticized the Council as an ineffective counterweight to the Mayor, nonetheless welcomed Mr. Vallone's proposal. "Charter revision has its risks," said Chris Meyer, a senior attorney with the New York Public Interest Research Group. "But the Speaker is right. The city needs a more balanced government. The City Council is not a fully co-equal branch under the current City Charter."
Penelope Pi-Sunyer, executive director of the City Project, a liberal fiscal policy group, agreed. "There is more they could be doing with the power they have now," she said. "But they indeed are not equal partners with the Mayor. They can't do their own budget if they can't make revenue estimates.'
The 1989 Charter revision gave the Council new power over the budget and land-use policy. But the Council has never rejected the Mayor's budget, opting instead to negotiate compromises which critics have said amounted to little more than tinkering around the margins.
The Council accepts most mayoral initiatives after making only minor adjustments. But the legislative body has occasionally shown that it has the will to derail proposals in order to respond to community concerns. Last year, the Council rejected Mr. Giuliani's plan to remove fire alarm call boxes from the city streets after neighborhood groups complained bitterly.
On land use issues, the Council has been more assertive, most recently rejecting Mr. Giuliani's proposal to bring more megastores into the city.

New Warnings About Dollar Help Yen Pick Up Strength

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell for a second consecutive day against the yen yesterday, after senior Government officials in Japan intensified warnings about the yen's weakness and called for currency stability.
Currency traders said the dollar also declined after Gail Fosler, chief economist for the influential Conference Board research group, said the dollar was 15 percent overvalued against the yen. The dollar was little changed in most other foreign-exchange dealings. 
 "We had a group of officials in Japan trying to talk down the dollar," said Robert Gilmartin, a dollar-yen trader at First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C.
He said Ms. Fosler's comments, made at a National Economists Club speech in Washington, "helped lead the final move down."
In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 115.23 yen, down from 115.68 on Monday. The dollar rose to 1.5640 marks from 1.5632. The British pound was unchanged at $1.6941.
The dollar began the trading day on a weaker note from the residual effects of comments on Monday by Tadashi Ogawa, a Japanese Vice Minister of Finance, who called the yen's recent rapid weakening against the dollar undesirable.
That was the first official Japanese comment on the dollar's series of 45-month highs reached against the yen the last few weeks.
The official comments from Japan broadened yesterday, with warnings from Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, Trade Minister Shinji Sato and the Economic Planning Agency Director General, Taro Aso, that the yen's weakening could pose problems for Japan. All three spoke at news conferences in Japan.
Mr. Mitsuzuka added that the ministry would take unspecified steps in response to any yen decline deemed to be excessive. His comments in particular helped bring the dollar as low as 114.92 yen during the day.
"Now you've got three guys speaking with a little bit more veiled threat," Bob Near, vice president for foreign exchange at the Bank of New York, said. For that reason, he said, "the market is very wary of buying the dollar at these levels. There's a healthy dose of caution in the marketplace."

HEADLINE: Swiss Offer To Start Fund For Victims Of Holocaust

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Seeking to defuse the crisis over its financial dealings during the Nazi era, the Swiss Government offered today to use money from unclaimed bank accounts dating to World War II to set up a fund "in favor of Holocaust victims and their descendants."
But the offer failed to deflect a tide of Jewish anger over recent remarks by a high Swiss official who called Jewish demands for compensation from Switzerland "extortion and blackmail." 
 Jewish groups have demanded an apology for the remarks by the official, Economics Minister Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, but the Government statement today offering to set up a Holocaust memorial fund made no reference to an apology. Last week Mr. Delamuraz said he had been "misunderstood" and was sorry for any grief he might have caused.
The public confrontation between Switzerland and Jewish groups in the United States and Israel has been building since last year, fueled by assertions that Swiss banks profited from wartime dealings in Nazi gold and subsequently hoarded bank deposits belonging to Jews who had been killed in the Holocaust.
But in recent days the conflict has assumed new overtones for Switzerland, with talk among Jewish groups of an organized boycott of Swiss banks and the first tangible indications of financial repercussions on Monday when Swiss bank shares dipped in stock market trading.
Switzerland's banks -- and their reputations as havens of security and confidentiality -- are central to its economic well-being. The insistent clamor, particularly from the United States, for disclosure of their activities during and after the Nazi era has worried Swiss bankers.
After 90 minutes of telephone conversations, the seven ministers in Switzerland's Cabinet issued a statement today saying the 40 million Swiss francs, or $29.5 million, discovered so far in dormant accounts should be "put to proper use."
The Cabinet said it was "ready to immediately take up discussions with the banks and the interested organizations regarding the creation of a fund in favor of Holocaust victims and their descendants."
A Government spokesman, Achille Casanova, told reporters that there was no apology for Mr. Delamuraz's contentious remarks because "they were misunderstood and led to excessive reactions."
The developments in Bern, the Swiss capital, drew an angry response from Avraham Burg, the chairman of the Jewish Agency in Jerusalem, who is supposed to be part of an investigative panel set up under Paul Volcker, the former head of the United States Federal Reserve, to search for money belonging to Holocaust victims in dormant Swiss accounts.
"The Swiss are again playing with words, attacking marginal issues and ignoring the central issues," an aide quoted Mr. Burg as saying. "They're trying to buy us with money that's not theirs."
After a meeting with Swiss officials in Jerusalem, Mr. Burg said a decision would be reached within four weeks on whether to urge a boycott of dealings with Swiss banks -- an unparalleled move against the notion of integrity that is the Swiss banks' stock in trade.
As both sides depict it, the confrontation is not just about money. Switzerland fears that as Mr. Delamuraz said, the establishment of a compensation fund from Switzerland's own resources would constitute a damaging "admission of guilt" that its financiers profited illicitly from the Holocaust and its aftermath.
But Jewish groups insist that Switzerland must face the moral issue of whether the descendants of Holocaust victims suffered because of Swiss greed. "We are going to settle once and forever the moral and economic commitment that we have to families, fathers, mothers who have perished in the Holocaust," Mr. Burg said today. "Not even one dime or dollar or Swiss franc" that was acquired "in an unjust way will remain in their safety vaults."
After Hitler came to power in 1933, many Jews, risking prosecution in Germany, exported their assets to neutral Switzerland for safety as the Nazi authorities embarked on ever-greater persecution.
Switzerland expanded guarantees of bank confidentiality to protect these new customers. But those same bank secrecy laws have now been invoked in Switzerland to prevent full disclosure of the details of dormant accounts.
The Swiss Bankers Association said today that not all of the $29.5 million found in dormant accounts in recent months could be traced back to depositors who later died in the Holocaust. Therefore, the association said, not all of that money could be used in the Swiss Government's proposed Holocaust memorial fund until the title to it had been established.
"The legal rights of individuals must be guaranteed," the association spokeswoman, Silvia Matile, told Reuters.

Dollar's Slide Hurts Prices Of Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Treasury market turned down yesterday in response to a slide in the dollar and continued concern that the economy might be growing at a fast enough pace to accelerate inflation and drive interest rates higher. But the market bounced off the day's lows on a weak retail sales report.
The weekly Lynch, Jones & Ryan Inc. Redbook retail sales index showed retail sales up just seven-tenths of a percent for the week ended last Saturday, slightly above the six-tenths of a percent the previous week. 
 At the market's close, the 30-year bond was off 5/32 , to a price of 9612/32 to yield 6.78 percent, up from 6.77 percent on Monday. That is the highest yield since Oct. 28, when it was 6.83 percent.
Market participants basically ignored a factory orders report for November, even though it was not as weak as had been expected. The Government said factory orders slid four-tenths of a percent in November, a little stronger performance than the decline of seven-tenths of a percent economists had expected after a 1.1 percent increase in October.
Many traders and managers cited the dollar weakness as the cause of the market's downturn yesterday. Tony Crescenzi, head of government bond trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company, said comments by Japanese officials had not been helpful. The dollar's drop against the yen came after senior Japanese officials suggested they would oppose further declines in their currency.
"An excessive decline in the yen against the U.S. dollar would be undesirable," the Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, said. He also said the Japanese Government would take "appropriate measures as necessary" in the foreign exchange market.
A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors.
"These are threats," Mr. Crescenzi said, adding they may be causing Japanese investors to sell American investments. Mr. Crescenzi pointed out that the decline in the Japanese stock market had meant that Japanese banks could not draw on that capital to write off loans.
Patrick R. Ledford, senior fixed-income portfolio manager at Citibank Global Asset Management, said of the market, "The fundamentals are still intact, with moderate growth and low inflation."
But, he added, "Technically, it is obvious the market is weak, and susceptible to rumors of central bank and hedge fund selling."
Mr. Ledford said that between the weaker dollar and potential supply buildup, the market technical factors were not good over the near term.
Larry Berman, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said that unless there were bullish data in the Producer Price Index and employment report this week, the market was likely to see 7 percent yields in short order.
"The upside targets continue to be lowered as the technical condition continues to deteriorate," he said. He predicted it would take several months of favorable economic data to repair the damage that has been done in the last several weeks.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Ex-Secretary Sees Bureaucracy From the Other Side

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
For 13 years, Eunice M. was a rivet in New York City's vast bureaucratic machine. She worked as a secretary at a municipal agency in lower Manhattan, processing a flow of paperwork that remained constant even as the agency repeatedly changed its name and purpose.
Now, sick and unemployed, forced to live with a grown daughter because she has no home of her own, Eunice spends her days slogging through bureaucracy but from the other side. She is awaiting a hearing on whether she qualifies for disability benefits. She hopes to get an apartment in a public housing project. 
 Caught in a wave of downsizing more than two years ago, Eunice, 49, accepted a buyout offer that gave her six months of unemployment benefits and health insurance. She took a course to become a medical assistant and had hoped to move south to be near relatives in North Carolina. The plans fell apart.
She did not have enough money to move. She hoped to get another job and save up. "I wanted to work in a doctor's office or a hospital," she said. "I was out there for at least two years trying to find full-time employment. I took my resume all over."
But she could not find a job.
Last year, her chronic asthma and arthritis worsened, preventing her from continuing the job search. "My knees get weak," she said. "I have a difficult time getting up and down the subways."
She could not keep up with the rent for the apartment in Corona, Queens, that she shared with her youngest daughter, a college student, and she put her belongings in storage to prevent them from being seized during eviction. The daughter dropped out of Baruch College and got a job in a vitamin store. The two left the apartment to live with Eunice's oldest daughter and two grandchildren in the Astoria Houses, a dilapidated public apartment complex in the far northwestern tip of Queens.
Late last summer, the storage company threatened to sell off Eunice's belongings -- furniture, a television, lamps, dishes, linens and other personal effects -- because she had not been paying the monthly storage fee of $207. Anxious not to lose her things, Eunice called the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
Now in its 85th annual appeal, the Neediest Cases Fund assists seven of the city's largest and oldest social service agencies in extending a helping hand to New Yorkers who need one. The Times pays all administrative expenses so readers' donations go directly to services and cash assistance for the poor.
The federation gave Eunice a $627 grant to keep her belongings from being auctioned. But she still does not have an apartment and her possessions remain in storage. She has sought the help of Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, and City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, whose district includes the Astoria Houses and who wrote a letter on her behalf to the Housing Authority.
She is hoping to be assigned an apartment that will keep her close to her family and her doctors in western Queens. And she still hopes that someday she will be able to move south. "I have to try to be strong and have faith, to know things are going to be better someday," she said. "This is just a temporary setback."

HEADLINE: In Election Year, Giuliani and Vallone Compete on Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
With municipal elections coming up in November, both Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, are advancing proposals to reduce local taxes, trying to give voters a bit of relief even though the city still faces severe budget problems.
The Mayor is expected to call this month for a basket of cuts in sales and business taxes when he issues his preliminary spending plan for the 1998 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. The cuts could total as much as $200 million in a $34 billion budget, his aides said. 
 Not to be outdone, Mr. Vallone, a Queens Democrat, announced on Monday a proposal to reduce four municipal taxes, including the sales tax on household items like diapers, soap and toilet paper. Mr. Vallone said the cuts would total $65 million in the 1998 fiscal year, rising to $305 million annually in 2001.
But the Mayor said he wanted to go even further. "There is almost no level of tax reduction that the City Council would propose that I wouldn't support, and then more than that," Mr. Giuliani said.
The Mayor and Mr. Vallone have said that the city can afford the cuts, though they acknowledge that they must close a projected deficit for 1998 that could be as high as $1.8 billion. But it is unclear whether Gov. George E. Pataki and state legislators, who must approve any cuts in city taxes, agree.
Similar proposals by the Mayor and the Council have foundered in the Legislature in recent years. For example, city officials have often asked Albany for cuts in the municipal sales tax on clothing, but last year the Legislature passed only a one-week repeal of the state and city sales tax for clothing under $500.
The one-week cut, which legislative leaders characterized as an experiment, begins on Jan. 18. Yesterday, some of the Democrats who control the Assembly said they were wary of approving the new plans from the Mayor or Mr. Vallone, saying city officials had to show how they would close their projected deficit without major service reductions before the Legislature weighed new tax cuts. In the State Senate, the more fiscally conservative Republican majority responded favorably, saying that the proposals would probably encounter little opposition.
Even if the cuts are blocked in Albany, though, the Mayor and Council members can still take credit for pushing them. So they involve little political risk, administration and Council officials said. Either way, city officials hope to garner the benefits when they seek re-election.
The interplay between Albany and City Hall is further complicated by the debate over the city's personal income tax. Mr. Giuliani in recent months has strongly lobbied the Legislature to extend a 12.5 percent surcharge on the income tax to help him close the next budget deficit. That surcharge, which expired on Dec. 31, would bring in about $500 million for the city in the 1998 fiscal year, officials said. Governor Pataki and legislative leaders failed to reach an agreement on renewing the surcharge during a one-day special session of the Legislature last month.
Legislative leaders have promised to take it up again before the end of this month, but they may find themselves in an awkward position -- being asked to continue the surcharge while cutting other taxes.
Mr. Giuliani has said there is nothing wrong with reducing some taxes while keeping others high, asserting that the city needs to tinker with its mix of taxes to spur its economy. He has said he is very interested in reducing the sales tax, which he says hurts poor people the most.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
14 sound stages will be built on speculation southwest of downtown Los Angeles.

BYLINE: By Morris Newman 

DATELINE: MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif.

 BODY:
A DEVELOPMENT partnership has acquired a site in this ocean front city 15 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles with plans to build 14 motion picture sound stages.
The project is a sign of both the strong demand for such centers in the Los Angeles area and the changes in the Southern California economy being wrought by the entertainment industry. 
 The partners are Shamrock Holdings Inc. of Burbank, Calif., and CFN/Flesch & Neuhauser of Los Angeles. They say they will start construction in July on the $77 million Manhattan Beach Studios project, with completion set in July 1998.
In all, the studios project is expected to contain 550,000 square feet of sound stages, ranging in size from 18,000 to 30,000 square feet, a free-standing office building of 58,000 square feet and a commissary.
The 22.5-acre site is in an industrial area of the city traditionally devoted to aerospace-related manufacturing.
Shamrock Holdings is a closely held investment company owned by the Roy E. Disney family. It controls a diverse group of companies with involvements in real estate, cable television, telecommunications equipment, and electronics, food manufacturing and footwear. Together, those concerns generate about $6 billion in revenues, according to the company.
Shamrock's commercial real estate activities include the acquisition and renovation of a four-building office complex in West Hills, Calif., in partnership with Regent Properties, as well as the acquisition of two renovated historic buildings in downtown Los Angeles and the development of three other office buildings in the Los Angeles area.
The project represents an unusual example of sound stages being developed as speculative real estate. Although major studios lease such stages to film and television production companies, the demand for them far exceeds the supply, and companies frequently lease warehouses and aerospace hangars for film production. Before the Manhattan Beach project, however, few developers had undertaken to build new sound stages.
The Manhattan Beach studios will have advantages over the existing choices of sound stages available to film companies, according to Richard Gentilucci, vice president of real estate for Shamrock Holdings. "Most of the other facilities have only one, two or three sound stages, and they are old and antiquated," Mr. Gentilucci said.
Although the developers intend the buildings to be suitable for all kinds of film production, they are tailoring the structures for television production. Each building is large enough to accommodate the space requirements of a television series, including several permanent sets, and sites for multiple cameras at each set.
The stages will offer high ceilings of 35 feet and column-free space favored by film companies, as well as soundproof concrete walls. The site will also provide parking for 1,800cars.
Southwestern Los Angeles, known as the South Bay, is a pioneering area for sound stages, according to Robert P. Dubbins, an industrial real estate broker in the Century City office of CB Commercial Real Estate Services. Filming has tended to cluster near the established centers of the entertainment industry in the West Los Angeles area and in Burbank.
Most buildings being used as sound stages are near Burbank, the home base of the Walt Disney Company and Warner Brothers, which is about 20 miles northeast of Manhattan Beach.
On the other hand, the start of construction on the delayed DreamWorks SKG campus at Playa Vista, which is about five miles north of Manhattan Beach, may make the South Bay area more acceptable to the entertainment industry, Mr. Dubbins said.
The site, which is close to the ocean and an affluent residential community, will be attractive to the movie industry, said Ronald M. Flesch, principal of CFN/Flesch & Neuhauser. "Studio people like to work in low buildings with a very quiet atmosphere," he said. "They don't like a bustling environment."
Out of an inventory of about 13 million square feet of industrial space in the West Los Angeles area, currently an entertainment stronghold, about one million square feet is currently devoted to film production and related businesses, with studio space currently leasing from about $7 to $10 a square foot annually, Mr. Dubbins said.
"You can't get away from these movie people," he added. "They're taking over the market."
That does not seem to worry officials of cities in the South Bay, which suffered the heaviest job losses in the Los Angeles region in the early 90's because of a decline in the aviation and military businesses. "The last few years have been difficult," said Geoff Dolan, city manager of Manhattan Beach. "To bring a new industry here to help diversify the economy would be a great addition to the South Bay."

HEADLINE: U.S. Factory Orders Slipped in November

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Orders to American factories slipped in November for the first time in three months, the Commerce Department reported today, but analysts said the report did not alter their view that the economy was growing moderately at the end of the year.
"Economic growth in the fourth quarter exceeded growth in the third quarter, but it was nothing out of bounds," said Stuart G. Hoffman, an economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh. 
 The Commerce Department reported that orders for both durable and nondurable goods fell four-tenths of 1 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted $320.5 billion from $321.9 billion in October.
It was the first drop since orders fell 2.1 percent in August. Orders are considered an important gauge of the nation's manufacturing strength. Continued declines could result in decreased production and fewer jobs.
The decline was in large part a result of softer demand for electronic equipment and came after strong gains of 1.1 percent in October and 2.6 percent in September.
Factory orders for durable goods -- items like tractors and television sets expected to last more than three years -- slid 1.5 percent.
But the drop included a 9.1 percent decline in electronic and other electrical equipment, including semiconductors and communications equipment. This category had surged 17.2 percent the previous month, an increase analysts had said was unsustainable.

HEADLINE: Mail Bomb Is Linked To a Later Suicide

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: CLIFTON PARK, N.Y., Jan. 7

 BODY:
A bombing that injured a 10-year-old girl on Dec. 24 and a suicide five days later were the final acts of an unemployed salesman who nursed a five-year-old vendetta over losing his job, investigators said today.
State and Federal law enforcement officials said that the salesman, Christopher P. Gilson, 58, aimed his rage not at the man who dismissed him, but at the man's twin brother and his family. Five days after the bomb detonated, Mr. Gilson killed himself with a shotgun, an incident that was at first thought to be a hunting accident but that has since been ruled a suicide. 
 Investigators said that Mr. Gilson left the bomb in the mailbox of Jude Reardon, 41, of Clifton Park, about 15 miles north of Albany. The package was addressed to "Mr. Jude Reardon and family," and his daughter, Jordan, opened it. After the explosion, she spent six days at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla. She is expected to recover fully.
Officials said that Mr. Gilson had been a salesman at GE Consulting Services in Colonie, just outside Albany, where John C. Reardon, Jude Reardon's twin brother, was his supervisor. They said that Mr. Gilson had been dismissed in 1991 and had not had steady work since then.
Investigators said they did not expect ever to fully understand Mr. Gilson's motive. Mr. Gilson did not know Jude Reardon and his family, Maj. Peter A. Lawrence of the state police said, yet the package was clearly intended for them.

HEADLINE: SOCIAL SECURITY: THE POSSIBLE IMPACT;
Risks of Many Kinds in Reworking Social Security

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Social Security may not be getting a face lift this year, but the report from a Federal advisory panel released Monday insures that Washington, for the first time in more than a decade, will be forced to look long and hard at what ails the giant public pension system. A host of radically different proposals -- with radically varying effects on the economy, on the financial markets and on the incentives for Americans to save for retirement -- are now on the table.
Each of the plans to shift into private securities some of the money that Social Security now invests exclusively in government bonds would give a lift to the stock market. But the effects would be modest, probably temporary and raise new questions about whether pensioners or taxpayers are prepared to absorb the consequences of market volatility. 
 "Shuffling the ownership of stocks between public and private hands redistributes risk, but not much else," said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution.
 Indeed, those who see the partial privatization of Social Security and the subsequent flood of cash into private securities as a way to keep the good times rolling on Wall Street may be frustrated.
For one thing, nothing is likely to change in the immediate future. For another, there is reason to doubt the conventional wisdom that money going into 401(k)'s and other private pension accounts is the principal reason the market has experienced its stunning run-up since the early 1980's. Indeed, private savings have not, in fact, increased much in the last few years.
 More plausibly, rising stock prices have been driven by the expectation that American business will continue to increase its profits in the future -- an expectation linked to low inflation and the lack of a recession in recent memory.
"We really don't know what would happen to securities prices" if the stock market began to get Social Security money, said Stephen Ross, a specialist in finance at the Yale School of Management, "but we don't expect the impact would be large."
 After all, the flows of new investment in stocks that could be expected if one of the plans was established would be large but not without parallel. In the early going, each plan would be expected to generate new investment in stocks similar to the amounts now being contributed to 401(k) plans each year -- about $69 billion in 1992, the latest for which figures are available. That is little more than the volume of new public offerings of stock, which was $59 billion last year.
Once a plan is fully established, cash flowing from it into the stock market would resemble the amount investors are now putting into stock mutual funds each year. In the first 11 months of 1996, mutual funds that invest in American stocks took in $165 billion in net new money from investors; none of the three plans outlined by the council would yield a similar volume of new investment until the year 2010 or later. And by that time, inflation and a larger economy would dilute the impact of any additional flow of funds.
More significant, the plans could have a large and not entirely predictable effect on savings and growth. "Increased savings, which yields increased wealth, lies at the core of politically and economically sustainable reform," argues Carolyn Weaver, director of pension studies at the American Enterprise Institute and one of the 13 members of the Advisory Council on Social Security. That panel split into three factions over how to rescue Social Security from future bankruptcy.
In one sense the Social Security crisis is synthetic. Today, with payroll tax revenues far outpacing pension outlays, the Government faces no imminent cash squeeze. Indeed, narrowly viewed as a "pay as you go" system, Social Security is viable for another two decades.
 But seen through the lens of a future retiree, Social Security is wildly askew because the big baby- boom generation is owed some $9 trillion more than following generations are obliged to pay in Social Security taxes. And unless the economic pie grows far more rapidly than is now predicted, the only way to meet the system's obligations will be to transfer trillions in income throughout the 21st century from the young to those who will be old.
 One plausible political solution is neglect. Indeed, "pay as you go" might well be rationalized as a way to focus limited political energies on more pressing budgetary problems -- in particular, the need to raise revenue or cut outlays for Medicare and Medicaid. But delay means even more drastic change down the road. In 2011, projected outlays will equal payroll taxes collected at current rates. In 2025, however, the "pay as you go" deficit would reach 3 percent of national income -- forcing sharp tax increases or raising budget deficits while reducing national savings.
 Another idea, rejected by the panel but popular among many of those who want to preserve Social Security as it is, would be a payroll tax increase today that is large enough to pay for the boomers' retirement and beyond. "A 2.2-percentage-point increase would go a long way," explained Peter Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (Currently, workers and employers together pay 12.4 percent on salaries up to about $70,000 to finance Social Security.)
Such a tax increase would certainly shovel trillions of dollars of revenue into Federal coffers over the next quarter-century. And if it reduced the Federal debt by the same amount, it could increase national wealth and lower the cost of private investment. But that's a big "if", Mr. Bosworth suggests. "Would Congress keep its hands off the money?" he asks.
An equally simple fix -- a 1.1- percentage-point cut in annual cost-of-living adjustments for pensioners to reflect the near-consensus among economists that the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation -- is advocated by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee. By restraining benefits, he contends, Washington would largely achieve "actuarial balance" -- insuring that the expected inflow of funds would equal the projected outflow of benefits for several decades.
"If we were to make that small adjustment in the annual increase in retirement benefits," he wrote recently, "the system would be in actuarial balance until 2052."
 But there is no free lunch here. Unless lower-income recipients were protected, the already-serious financial problems of retirees who outlive private sources of income would only worsen. "The poverty rate among elderly widows is far higher than the poverty rate in general," Mr. Diamond, the M.I.T. economist, notes.
 For now, Washington can be expected to tread warily. But when it finally acts, the plans offered by the three factions on the advisory panel may well lead the pack.
The first, the "maintenance of benefits" option, is favored by 6 of the 13 council members. It would apply a handful of technical corrections that add up to modest cuts in benefits for future retirees, a reshuffling of some money now going to Medicare, plus a 1.6-percentage-point increase in the payroll tax in 50 years. The group, led by Robert M. Ball, a former Commissioner of Social Security, also recommends taking a hard look at investing 40 percent of the trust fund in private securities, with an eye toward increasing the return on the system's assets.
 Yet the plan would do little to actually increase savings by more than a token amount, notes Sylvester Schieber, an economist at the Watson Wyatt consulting concern and a member of the advisory council. Every dollar the trust fund invested in stocks rather than government bonds would be a dollar that the Treasury would have to borrow from private investors, leaving the total availability of capital unchanged. "You're just shuffling existing income -- and risk," Mr. Schieber contended.
 The partial privatization plan advocated by Mr. Schieber would redirect 5 percentage points of the existing payroll tax into personal security accounts that could be invested in stocks and bonds. The idea, its sponsors say, is to encourage individuals to plan for their own retirement while leaving the basic pension safety net intact. National savings would be raised more directly through a payroll tax increase of 1.5 percentage points, specifically designated to cover the unfinanced costs of benefits promised to older Americans.
 But here, too, there is ambiguity. If the stock market performed poorly, would Congress bail out retirees at the expense of taxpayers -- or simply by running deficits?
 Edward Gramlich, an economist at the University of Michigan who was the chairman of the advisory panel, championed a third approach. He would use the popular appeal of privatization to transform the unpalatable tax increase into a politically acceptable forced savings. Individual accounts, financed by a mandatory payroll levy and invested in private securities, would sit on top of the existing system.
 But that plan's impact on national savings is debatable as well. If the Government forced households to save in personal retirement accounts, would Americans respond by saving less in 401(k) plans and other existing retirement plans?
 Social Security's problems are well understood. Too well, perhaps. For it is now apparent that successful fixes to an institution so fundamental to the security of the vast majority of Americans are more elusive than many realize.

HEADLINE: Rowland Says G.O.P. Keeps Legislative Power

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The balance of power in the state's General Assembly has shifted toward the Democrats this year, but Gov. John G. Rowland maintains that the agenda is still being set by Republicans.
When the legislature convenes on Wednesday, Mr. Rowland says the focus will not be on whether to cut taxes but on which taxes to cut. 
 "Make no mistake, the whole atmosphere has changed in this body," Mr. Rowland, the first Republican Governor of Connecticut in 20 years, said in an interview. "There aren't two people out there promoting any new spending programs or any expansion of programs. The debate is which taxes to cut, and everybody feels fine about that. It's the property tax or the income tax or the gas tax."
"That's a fight I can have all day long," Mr. Rowland added. "At the end of the day, everybody wins."
Despite that optimism, he is facing a different political landscape than he did in the last two years. Democrats, who controlled the House of Representatives, gained State Senate control in the November elections, perhaps emboldening them to push their own agenda.
State Representative Chris Donovan, a Meriden Democrat, brushed aside the idea that the legislature would not consider new programs. After the "drubbing" that the Republicans took in November, he said, the Republicans' agenda had little credibility. He said he was part of a group of legislators who planned to push for an enhanced safety net for people whose welfare benefits may be cut off, as well as an expansion of medical coverage for uninsured children.
The session is also expected to bring significant changes to the state's educational system. The state is under court order to remedy segregation in Hartford's schools and in its surrounding suburbs, and Mr. Rowland acknowledged that education initiatives will be a top priority.
The House Speaker, Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat, reiterated on Friday that he was committed to expanding poor children's access to preschool programs, as well as increasing aid to cities, ideas shared by the Senate Democrats.
Today, the Senate Democrats offered an agenda that included increased spending for higher education and for student financial aid, and a host of other initiatives on education, crime, health care, campaign finance and economic development.
Yet perhaps the most striking aspect of their agenda was the many items Mr. Rowland could endorse: the heavy emphasis on tax cuts and on controlling state spending.
The Senate Democrats' agenda called for restraining growth in state spending, cutting the gasoline tax and moving more quickly to reduce the state's corporate income tax.
Dean Pagani, the Governor's spokesman, said, "We agree with most everything they've put on their agenda."
The session, of course, is likely to have some clashes, and today, Mr. Rowland and State Senate Democratic leaders exchanged shots over the centerpiece of the Democrats' tax reduction plan: a tax credit known as the circuit breaker that Mr. Rowland opposes. It would give an income tax deduction to any household that pays property taxes that exceed 5 percent of its income.
Mr. Rowland said the circuit breaker is "social engineering at best." A straight income tax cut, he said, would be easier for the public to grasp and not make the mistake of limiting the tax to a select group.
But State Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, a West Hartford Democrat who will take over as Senate President Pro Tem on Wednesday, said people care most about property tax relief, particularly in the state's cities. "If cutting their most burdensome tax is social engineering, then I think most people in the state of Connecticut will be happy to get that kind of socially engineered tax cut," he said.

HEADLINE: Reversal by Big Stocks Lifts Dow Over 6,600

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A late turnaround yesterday pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to its first close above 6,600 as bargain-hunting investors shrugged off rising interest rates in another volatile session.
Broader measures also turned positive, with the Nasdaq market closing at a record high for the second consecutive day. 
 The Dow erased a 55-point deficit, rising 33.48 points, to 6,600.66, as several leading components reversed course in the afternoon.
On Monday, the blue-chip barometer held on to a record high after surrendering a 75-point gain. The move above 6,600 marks a 10 percent advance less than three months after the Dow's first close over 6,000 on Oct. 14.
Stocks were hurt from the start of trading by another weak day in the bond market, where interest rates have been rising the last week amid a series of surprisingly strong economic reports. Bonds had rallied through the second half of 1996 amid indications that economic growth might be moderating enough to keep inflation in check.
The renewed inflation jitters were not calmed by yesterday's news that factory orders slipped four-tenths of 1 percent in November. While it was the first drop in three months, analysts had expected a steeper decline of 1 percent.
Bonds trimmed their losses later in the session, encouraging money managers to take advantage of the day's depressed share prices.
"This market has a lot of investors who are using dips to buy; there's a lot of money coming into the market early in the year," Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John Hancock Funds in Boston, said, referring to the flows of new capital from year-end bonuses and contributions to retirement plans.
The Dow bounced back with the help of turnarounds by I.B.M., which rose 2 1/8, to 163 3/8, after erasing a deficit of 1 7/8; Procter & Gamble, which gained 2, to 111 1/8, after dropping as much as 1 1/8 earlier, and General Electric, which was off 7/8 before finishing with a gain of 2, at 101.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was heavy at nearly 538.4 million shares, up slightly from Monday's brisk pace.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.58, to 753.23. The technology-rich Nasdaq composite index rose 11.33, to 1,327.73, with the help of Intel, which rebounded from a deficit of 1 7/8 points to finish at 143 3/8, up 4 1/2.

HEADLINE: SOCIAL SECURITY: THE REACTION;
Lawmakers Are Intrigued, But Still Want To Go Slowly

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Senior members of Congress from both parties expressed interest today in proposals to invest some Social Security assets in the stock market, but they said that the idea required much more study.
Initially, lawmakers seemed to be most intrigued by the proposal that the Government should control the investments, deciding how much of payroll tax revenue is invested in which stocks or mutual funds. 
 Soon after Congress convened today, Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, a Republican from upstate New York who is chairman of the Rules Committee, introduced a bill to let the Government make such investments, as recommended Monday by 6 of the 13 members of a Federal advisory panel.
Mr. Solomon said he wanted to encourage investment of some of the Social Security trust fund in "investment-grade securities, real assets with real investment returns." Since the creation of Social Security in 1935, the trust fund has been allowed to invest only in government securities, which have historically had a lower rate of return than stocks.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leaders of the two chambers, said they were willing to test such an approach, but they stipulated that investment decisions should be made by the Government, not by workers.
"The trust fund itself ought to experiment in private investment, with a pilot project allocating a certain percentage of its resources in the market to afford us an opportunity to compare both the security as well as the return on investment," Mr. Daschle said.
But some lawmakers had other ideas. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York was at the White House today talking to President Clinton about the formula used to compute the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security. The formula is based on the Consumer Price Index, which many economists say overstates inflation.
Revising the formula would save tens of billions of dollars and could offer a way out of the nation's "protracted fiscal crisis," said Mr. Moynihan, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, which has legislative authority over Social Security.
The Senator said that investing payroll tax contributions in stocks would not necessarily increase national savings, because the Government might have to borrow more to make up for the money taken out of the trust fund. The surplus in the trust fund is now, in effect, available to help pay the general operating expenses of the Government.
Republicans say they will not propose changes in the cost-of-living formula unless Mr. Clinton takes up the issue first.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said, "This won't be done unless the President takes the lead and it's done in a bipartisan fashion."
Mr. Domenici was cool to the major proposals offered by the Advisory Council on Social Security. "I'm one of those who say, 'Let's go slow on Social Security investing in the stock market,' " he said.
On the other hand, the House Republican leader, Dick Armey of Texas, said he was pleased that all the council members were willing to consider some such investment. That, he said, was "a vast paradigm shift."
Likewise, Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who heads the Finance Committee, said: "For the first time, all members of a Social Security Advisory Council have recommended that some of Social Security's funds be invested in the private marketplace to improve the return. This is a very important development and greatly increases the chance that Congress will adopt some kind of investment option."
Mr. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, said "privatization is not part of the solution," but investing in stocks was "worth looking at."
He added: "Raising the rate of return on the trust fund's investments could reduce the financial pressures on the system. But there are a lot of questions that need to be answered, and we must not rush to adopt a plan. We've got time. Let's recognize that the stock market goes up and down. We must not gamble the trust fund away."


GRAPHIC: Members of a Federal advisory panel agreed that Social Security faces long-term fiscal problems. They were in accord on some steps toward reining in costs, but split on how to increase revenue. Each of the three plans put forward would allow the investment of the system's funds in the stock market, instead of just government bonds, but would do so in very different ways.
Chart: "Sorting Out the Three Plans"
 The Maintain Benefits plan backed by labor unions would keep Social Security basically as it is: A traditional-style pension in which the Government bears all risk. At the other extreme, the Personal Security Accounts plan would limit the Government guarantee to a low flat payment and turn much of the resources and responsibility over to workers. The Individual Accounts plan would combine some of each approach.
 
POINTS OF AGREEMENT
 All three plans would close the threatened fiscal gap by including new state and local government workers not currently covered by Social Security. All three also assume that changes in the way the Government calculates the Cunsumer Price Index will lead to slightly lower cost-of-living benefit increasesin the future.
 Other proposals supported by majorities on the panel include accelerating a raise in the retirement age to 67, and taxing benefits that exceed a worker's contributions. Taken together, these changes would reduce the long-term deficit by about two-thirds; the changes outlined below would account for the rest.
 
Chart compares the three plans.
 
WHAT COMES NEXT
 Few in Washington expect action anytime soon. President Clinton and Republicans in Congress, both expecting a more immediate fight over Medicare's finances, responded cautiously to the proposals. Others in Congress, most notably Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, have called for moving quickly to make a sizable adjustment to the Consumer Price Index, a step that would slow the growth of Social Security payments. But the longstanding roadblocks to changing Social Security -- senior citizens' resistance to benefits cuts and business' resistance to tax increases -- remain.

HEADLINE: In a Blaze of Attention, McCarthy Joins Congress

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Her faithful came to the nation's capital today to celebrate the end of one long journey and the beginning of another. They crammed into her Government office, picked at hors d'oeuvres and watched televised images from the House of Representatives, looking for a spot of red -- her trademark color -- in the sea of gray and blue.
"Look for that red ribbon in her hair," someone shouted. Then came applause and cheers, for on a television propped on a desk could be seen the slight woman in red, Carolyn McCarthy, shortly before she was sworn in as Long Island's newest member of Congress. 
 Since the loss of her husband in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road massacre, Mrs. McCarthy's circuitous path to public office has attracted international attention. Still, her first act as a Congresswoman provided little drama. A registered Republican who ran on the Democratic ticket, she dutifully voted for Richard A. Gephardt, a Democrat, and not for the incumbent Republican and eventual victor, Newt Gingrich, in today's volatile contest for House Speaker.
"I wouldn't vote for Newt Gingrich anyway," she said recently, citing what she considers to be his weak stands against gun violence.
Today, Mrs. McCarthy officially moved into Room 1725 in the Longworth Building of Congress; it is the first time in her life that the retired nurse has had her own office. She dislikes both the desk, made from a wood she described as "government issue," and the overstuffed chair. "It's too big," she said. "I can't even put my feet on the ground."
But she has no complaints about the job itself -- only concerns about how she is perceived.
For example, Mrs. McCarthy said she is aware that some, including the leaders of the National Rifle Association, consider her to be a one-issue Congresswoman, a political rube from Long Island who never so much as served on a school board.
She counters by saying her continuing campaign against gun violence has always been broad in scope, searching for roots to the gun problem in the worlds of education and economics. That is why, she says, she is glad to have been appointed to the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. "It's not about guns alone," she said. "It's about Head Start, it's about drug-free schools, it's about job opportunities."
As for maneuvering through the daunting halls of Washington, she said, "That's where my life skills are going to come in."
But Representative Gary L. Ackerman, an eight-term Democrat from Long Island and Queens, said that he had advised his friend that life skills were not always enough. "That helps, but this is a different planet here," he said. "It's a different life form down here, and I'm not saying whether it's higher or lower."
Mr. Ackerman said he had told Mrs. McCarthy to be prepared to compromise to win support for her legislation, and to stifle the urge to say too much in public. "I told her also to be wary of all the people who are coming to her in an unsolicited fashion and offering advice because -- I know this will come as a shock to you -- some people down here have their own agendas," he said.
Despite these threats to a public official's credibility and effectiveness, Mr. Ackerman said he expected Mrs. McCarthy to thrive in Washington. "For her to have survived the horrors that she's lived through and come out on top, she has to be pretty hardened," he said. "I think that will serve her well."
The hardening began when a gunman opened fire on a Long Island commuter train, killing six people, including Mrs. McCarthy's husband, Dennis, and wounding 19 others, including her son, Kevin. She resolved to fight rather than withdraw, and became a lobbyist against gun violence. When Daniel Frisa, her Republican Congressman, voted to repeal a ban on assault guns last year, she decided to challenge him. Against considerable odds, she won the election. And so begins the rest of the story of Carolyn McCarthy.
The political courtship of Mrs. McCarthy as a public official is in its earliest stages. Her only contact with Mr. Gephardt, the House minority leader, came shortly after her election in November ("There was concern about how I was going to vote," she said. "I assured him I was going to vote for him.") As for Republicans, the majority leader, Tom DeLay, sent her a book of advice about how to balance one's life while in public office.
She appreciated the gesture, she said, adding, "I don't want to get caught up in the Washington scene."
That wish seems destined to be dreamed of, not realized. Reporters and camera crews accompanied her on the flight from New York on Monday, then joined her search for an apartment later that afternoon. Today they shadowed her from sunrise into late afternoon, asking questions about her ongoing battle to quit smoking, about her plans -- if any -- to attend the Inaugural Ball, about the angel pin she wears on her lapel. For the last two days, in fact, that angel pin has had to share lapel space with a small black microphone, courtesy of a television news program.
This afternoon the gaggle of reporters and film crews almost swallowed her and her son as they walked from her office. So tight was the media noose that Kevin McCarthy, whose limp reflects the grave injuries he received in the shooting, was jostled. The incident upset Mrs. McCarthy, an aide said, adding, "You don't mess with Kevin."
The demands continue to pile up. Mrs. McCarthy said that if she accepted every invitation she received, both here and on Long Island, she would be attending four functions a day, seven days a week. Even as she stood on the House floor, waiting to be sworn in, visitors were stopping by her office to say hello, from Congressional staff members to labor union representatives.
Late this afternoon, Mrs. McCarthy closed her office to the media so she could enjoy the moment with her family and supporters. At some point, she cut into a white sheet cake to celebrate her 53d birthday, which was on Sunday.
Mrs. McCarthy said she was also looking forward to the weekend, when she and other freshmen representatives will be attending seminars in conservative philosophy at the Heritage Foundation in Virginia. While others attend evening receptions, she said, she expects to be in her room, working on belated Christmas cards.

GRAPHIC: Photos: So many invitations poured into Mrs. McCarthy's office that, she said, accepting them all would mean four functions a day, seven days a week. Awaiting the first session of the 105th Congress, Representative Carolyn McCarthy was surrounded by some new colleagues, including, from left, Susan Molinari (back to camera), Gary L. Ackerman and Eliot L. Engel. (Stephen Crowley/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Malaria Makes a Comeback, And Is More Deadly Than Ever

SERIES: EVERYDAY KILLERS: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: MWANABWITO, Tanzania

 BODY:
 Her face was calm and soothing, but Mariam Karega's eyes brimmed with fear as she cradled little Hussein and nursed him, trying to pump life into him along with her milk.
"I'm losing hope," Mrs. Karega said, her big aching eyes radiating the terror of any parent holding a dying child. "He's tiny and he's stopped growing. And although he'd started to walk, now he can't anymore. I don't think he'll make it." 
 It was a sweltering afternoon, and a dozen other villagers sat solemnly around Mrs. Karega and her 15-month-old son, a knowing sympathy hanging in the air along with the flies. In this village of thatched mud huts in rural Tanzania, in East Africa, the trauma of losing a child is almost as common as a scraped knee.
These children are dying not from something intuitively monstrous, like the crocodiles that lurk in the Ruvu River below the village, ready to spring on any unwary bather. Instead, the children are dying of mosquito bites.
In 1996 alone, between one million and three million people died of malaria, the mosquito-borne disease that has struck Hussein and the other children in the village. Most alarming, malaria, far from coming under control, is becoming resistant to medications and is expanding into new areas and killing many more people than it did a few decades ago.
For these reasons, the World Health Organization recently declared that "public health enemy No. 1" is the mosquito.
Americans may think of medical care as incalculably complex, a world of angioplasty and echocardiograms and other technologies that to many people are as incomprehensible as they are unpronounceable. But for most people in the world, the challenges of health care are simpler: when mothers like Mrs. Karega hold dying children, it is usually because of something as simple as dirty water or a mosquito bite.
While medical care has made tremendous strides in recent decades, some of the most formidable challenges remain the most basic: providing people with toilets and clean water, and protecting them from deadly mosquitoes. The extraordinary thing about the mosquitoes is that in the current battle against the best minds of 20th-century science and medicine, the mosquitoes may be winning.
In the 1950's, experts were optimistic that malaria could be wiped out, and for a time DDT and other insecticides led to a sharp reduction of mosquitoes and of the disease. But the use of DDT and similar chemicals was sharply curtailed because of their dreadful environmental effects, and partly as a result malaria began a long upswing around the world in the 1960's and 70's.
"As a single disease, malaria has a bigger impact on the world than anything you can think of," said Dr. Kazem Behbehani, director of the division for control of tropical diseases at the World Health Organization in Geneva. "And it's spreading."
Between 300 million and 500 million people now get malaria each year, and someone dies of it about every 15 seconds -- mostly children and pregnant women. During the last decade, malaria has killed about 10 times as many children as all wars combined have in that period.
The cumulative statistics have so many zero's that it is impossible to conceive of the heartbreak that they represent. People in developed countries sometimes suppose that third world villagers are so familiar with suffering that they are numbed to it, but anyone who thinks that should have seen Mrs. Karega's eyes -- or should have been hiking on a muddy path in the Cambodian jungle, 7,500 miles to the east.
Banana trees dotted a starkly beautiful hillside of brilliant greens, but from up ahead an eerie wailing resonated through the trees, a shrieking that at first sounded inhuman.
It turned out to be human after all, coming from a wretched farmer named Yok Yorn, 48, a man with a gray crew cut, a long face and square chin, and tear-stained cheeks. He was bent over the body of his 7-year-old son, Kaiset, who had died of malaria a couple of hours earlier.
The boy's body lay on the floor, half-covered by a blanket, as his family sobbed and other villagers tried to comfort them. Mr. Yok Yorn was the most distraught: as tears trickled down onto his son's body, he cradled the boy's head and put his own next to it, rubbing his hair against his son's.
The boy had become seriously ill with malaria a week earlier, and Mr. Yok Yorn had carried him piggyback down the path to a local doctor. Mr. Yok Yorn borrowed the $50 doctor's fee and did not think twice about handing over what in local terms was a colossal amount, equivalent to tens of thousands of dollars for an American family.
"This was the smartest boy in the family," Mr. Yok Yorn said softly when he had recovered his composure. He added that his grief was compounded because Kaiset was his second son to die of malaria. His eldest child, Thad, 16, also died of the disease.
Mr. Yok Yorn looked around at his other five children. His voice broke as he whispered, "I'm so afraid that my other children will die of malaria as well."
 
Safeguards
A $5 Net Can Help, But Cash Is Lacking
Doctors say that there is no reason why children like Kaiset had to die, and that they can usually be saved if they get prompt treatment from a good doctor. But that is often impossible in the third world, where well-trained doctors are scarce. Cambodia has one doctor for every 9,500 people; the United States has one for every 387.
Drugs are normally used to treat malaria, although drug-resistant strains are becoming a problem all over the world and especially in Southeast Asia. In addition, mosquitoes are emerging that are resistant to ordinary insecticides, and together they make a ferocious combination: super mosquitoes armed with drug-resistant super malaria.
But the situation is far from hopeless. A new drug, Malarone, has done well against malaria in clinical trials, both as a treatment and as a preventive, according to data made public at a recent international conference. Malarone will undergo further testing, and experts also cite a slew of technical reasons to argue that with time and money a successful vaccine can probably be developed.
Until an effective vaccine is developed, experts say, the best approach is simply to keep mosquitoes from biting people. The anopheles mosquito, the variety that carries malaria, tends to bite after dark, and so several recent studies have suggested that sleeping inside a mosquito net impregnated with insecticide can reduce malaria sharply.
For now, however, the impregnated nets are not widely available in street markets of developing countries, and the insecticide has to be reapplied at least once every year. A more fundamental problem is that many people cannot afford even ordinary mosquito nets, which cost $5 or $10.
"We have no blanket, no medicine and not enough food to eat," said Soy Phal, 31, a Cambodian who is herself feverish with malaria and whose husband died of the disease three years ago. "How can I afford a mosquito net? I spend my life being sick, so I have no time to earn money to get a mosquito net."
Mrs. Soy Phal's complaint is echoed by development economists. They note that malaria and other tropical maladies create a cycle in which disease hinders economic development and thereby sustains the disease.
Take Jamaluddin, a 36-year-old man with a black beard and deep-set eyes who lives in Bhadas village in northern India. Until a few months ago, he ran a tea shop and earned enough so that he was gradually climbing out of poverty. Then he and his entire family suddenly caught malaria, and within two weeks in October he had lost one of his two wives and three of his seven children. Medical and funeral costs left him $350 in debt, forcing him to give up his tea-shop lease as well.
"I don't know if my life will ever get back on track," said Mr. Jamaluddin, who now hopes to get odd jobs as a laborer, paying $1.40 a day. "I'm completely shattered."
The last thing Mr. Jamaluddin can afford is a mosquito net to save his remaining children. But Nhem Yen is perhaps even worse off.
Mrs. Nhem Yen, a Cambodian villager, has one small mosquito net -- and that is the source of her anguish. A 40-year-old woman with thick hair brushed to the side around a high forehead, Mrs. Nhem Yen has five children and two grandchildren in her little hut. Every evening she must figure out which children sleep under the net, and which sleep outside the net and risk death.
"It's very hard to choose," Mrs. Nhem Yen said softly, her children clustered around her. "But we have no money to buy another mosquito net. We have no choice."
Mrs. Nhem Yen is looking after two granddaughters because their mother died of malaria recently at the age of 24, just a day after giving birth. The dead woman, Mrs. Nhem Yen's daughter, never saw a doctor -- it would have cost too much.
The elder granddaughter, a puffy-cheeked 3-year-old with a dimple on her chin, does not yet understand that her mother is dead. The younger one, just two weeks old and frail, surviving on cow's milk, still lacks a name because she seems unlikely to linger. For now, Mrs. Nhem Yen gives these two the place under the mosquito net, but she knows it may be a losing gamble: the two-week-old may die anyway and in the meantime is taking up the life-saving space under the net.
 
Research
Little Money Is Spent To Fight Malaria
One reason for optimism in the struggle against mosquito-borne diseases is simply that science has shown that it can often conquer age-old scourges when given the resources. Leprosy used to be one of the most dreaded of diseases, but it now is easily cured with drugs and may soon be virtually wiped out around the world. The same is true of polio.
But malaria remains a medical catastrophe in part because it does not get much in the way of resources. Only about $85 million a year is spent globally on malaria research, about half as much as is spent on asthma research.
A recent British study estimated that each year $3,274 is spent on AIDS research for each fatal case of AIDS, while $65 is spent on malaria research for each fatal case of malaria.
Money for malaria research is meager in part because the disease primarily afflicts poor people, and Western drug companies doubt that third world villagers would be able to pay much for a new malaria vaccine even if it was developed.
Another reason malaria is the exception, a disease that is killing more people than three decades ago, rather than fewer, is that it is difficult to imagine a more vexing adversary than the mosquito.
The mosquito has been on earth at least 40 times as long as humans, and it has proved a more wily antagonist than wolves or saber-toothed tigers. It is only the female mosquito that bites -- to get blood to nourish its eggs -- and that is when it transmits diseases. The mosquito does not itself catch malaria or yellow fever or encephalitis or the many other ailments that it can carry.
Malaria parasite cells multiply in the infected person's liver and cause severe fevers with hot and cold chills. Depending on the variety of malaria, the patient can fall into a coma, have seizures or suffer from anemia, kidney failure or rupture of the spleen. Survivors of the worst kind, cerebral malaria, are sometimes mentally retarded.
Experts are learning some tidbits about the habits of mosquitoes: they are finicky, often preferring animal blood to the human variety; they like dark colors; they are drawn to sweat; they respond to hormones and avoid menstruating women. But above all, what strikes many entomologists is that mosquitoes are enormously adaptable to new threats and environments.
That helps them expand into new regions, bringing diseases with them. Until 1970, only nine countries had experienced epidemics of dengue hemorrhagic fever, a mosquito-borne disease for which there is no cure or vaccine and which causes the victim to bleed from the mouth, nose and gums. Since then 29 more countries have experienced outbreaks, and a milder form of the disease, called dengue fever, has struck people in Texas.
Some entomologists worry that global warming may expand the habitat of the anopheles mosquito. The World Health Organization has warned that a result may be anopheles mosquitoes' living in places like the southern United States and southern Europe, and an extra 80 million cases of malaria annually by the end of the next century.
Another particularly dangerous kind of mosquito, the Asian tiger mosquito, which can carry dengue fever, encephalitis and yellow fever, arrived in Texas in 1985, apparently in a shipment of tires from Asia, and it has now established itself in at least 23 states, including those as far north as New Jersey and Illinois.
Malaria itself has cropped up recently in parts of the former Soviet Union, and it now is endemic in 91 countries. In little villages that dot the dirt roads of Rajasthan and Haryana States in northern India, melancholy farmers stand in their hushed doorways and say they had never heard of malaria locally until their loved ones began to die of it a few months ago.
"I don't remember anything like this in all my life here," rasped Jabar Khan, the white-bearded 80-year-old patriarch of Agaon village. "I lost a grandson and two granddaughters, but I still don't understand what happened. They were sick with fever, and they began shaking so much that their teeth chattered. Then they died."
 
Poverty
For Children's Sake, A Fearful Gamble
Parents in poor countries can face excruciating choices: often the only way to give their children an opportunity is to gamble with their lives.
In Cambodia, the death toll from malaria is rising in part because families are knowingly moving to malaria zones. They move there to earn the princely sum of $2 or $3 a day, enough to feed and clothe the children and send them to school so that they can escape the cycle of poverty. The catch is that the pay is high because of the deadly risks.
"I can't stand being here, because it's no use being rich if your children die," said Chim Savan, 36, who was preparing dinner in her hut as dusk fell in a village in the malaria zone. "Right over there, in that house, there was a family living with two children, about the age of mine, a boy and a girl. But they lost both children because of malaria, and so now they decided to move away."
So why does Mrs. Chim Savan stay in the village?
It is not just that her husband has a job there cutting wood and thus the family has food to eat, or even that the family's entire savings -- $4 -- were spent when they moved here in April. Rather, the problem is that the family puts honor above all else.
One of the couple's four sons, Rathna, a 5-year-old who was scampering naked around the hut, nearly died of malaria a couple of months ago. Mrs. Chim Savan managed to save his life, but only by borrowing $22 so that he could spend a week in hospital for a blood transfusion and other treatment.
So now the parents have saved Rathna, but they feel they are honor-bound to stay in the village until they can repay the $22 to the woodlot owner, who lent them the money. The risk is that in the meantime their other children will die.
"If I weren't in debt I would leave," Mrs. Chim Savan said. "But when we were in trouble, the owner helped us, so now we have to help him. Because he was good to us.
"We're scared that the loan will have saved one child's life while costing us the lives of our other children. But what we can we do?"
In talking to women like Mrs. Chim Savan, one is reminded that it is not just diseases that kill people, but also poverty.
Malaria itself is not such a deadly threat when it strikes the healthy and rich. But in the third world, few are healthy to start with, and they lack the resources to buy mosquito nets, to drain swamps that breed mosquitoes, and even to get simple treatment.
Mrs. Karega, the Tanzanian woman who fears for the life of her 15-month-old toddler, who cannot toddle, said a nurse at a rural clinic told her to take little Hussein to the district hospital, so a doctor could look at him and examine his blood and perhaps save him.
"But we can't afford to do that," Mrs. Karega said, looking down at Hussein as he nursed from her breast. "That would be too expensive. We don't have that much money."
How much would it be?
Mrs. Karega answered at once, for she had worked out the sums many times in her head, searching for a way to gather the money: "Including round-trip transportation, the lab test and a tip for the doctor, it would cost 10,000 rupees. We just can't afford that."
The amount is equivalent to $16.65.

HEADLINE: Houses Before Gardens, The City Decides

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER 

 BODY:
IN its drive to build affordable homes in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods, the Giuliani administration has sounded the death knell for hundreds of community gardens that have, over the last 20 years, risen out of the rubble and rats of bankrupt, abandoned land.
Starting this spring, 25 gardens in Harlem and Coney Island will be bulldozed as construction begins for low- and moderate-income housing. Another 20 gardens in Brooklyn and the South Bronx will soon be destroyed for either housing or commercial development, said Greenthumb, the city agency that for two decades has been offering gardeners yearly leases in vacant lots at no charge. Greenthumb also expects to lose at least half of its 750 gardens to development over the next few years, as the city sells off its inventory of 11,000 nontaxable vacant lots and cancels the yearlong leases that gardeners have obtained. 
 In a city desperate for housing, "the bottom line is, we're going to build wherever we can, whenever we can," said Fran Reiter, the Deputy Mayor for economic development and planning.
"Do we sacrifice gardens to build housing?" she said. "You're damn right we do."
If a community board makes a strong case for a garden, she said, the city will try to find an alternative development site. But more often, as in the case of the 15-year-old Dome Garden, on West 84th Street, bulldozed two years ago for public housing, the city offers gardeners another site.
But it's not so easy to move a garden that has rooted itself in the community's heart. About 200 community gardens are more than 10 years old.
"The reality is, once you've had a garden over 10 years, and the trees are up to the sky, you establish roots -- literally and figuratively," said Jon Crow, 38, the coordinator of the 10-year-old Brooklyn Bears Garden on Flatbush Avenue and Pacific Street, who learned the garden was scheduled for development only days before a tractor rolled over the new herb garden to take test borings.
Led by a community action group called the Point, neighbors in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx have been farming for 10 years on a two-acre plot that was once buried under abandoned cars and garbage. Teen-agers who knew all about selling drugs on the street learned how to sell the basil and mint they grew on land they had cleared. They composted, built garden beds and picnic tables, cut and sold firewood.
"It kept me out of trouble," said Ralph Acebedo, 23, who now drives a truck for Hunts Point Fuel Oil. "We learned a lot about agriculture and teamwork." And it helped guide Leighton Wynter, 24, who started "farming" at 14, into law school by giving him a window onto the larger world.
On West 122d Street in Harlem, neighbors have planted fruit trees, dogwoods and hundreds of bulbs on a lot that 11 years ago was given over to rubble and rats. With a $10,000 grant from the New York Women's Foundation, the group, called Project Harmony, bought a small greenhouse and started teaching unemployed women and their children how to grow sturdy plants from seeds. Today, they are a cottage industry, canning tomatoes, drying flowers and herbs, and making herb vinegar and wine.
These are just two of the gardens that will be sacrificed this year as the city gains some 800 units of affordable housing to be built under the New York City Partnership's New Homes Program, which funnels $100 million a year of public and private money into building houses in blighted neighborhoods. The two and three-family houses will sell for $155,000 to $230,000.
In Coney Island, about a dozen gardens thriving in the wide-open spaces of Mermaid and Surf Avenues will be bulldozed for much-needed neighborhood stores and services, to be built this spring with the help of $16 million of city, state and Federal money.
"I don't understand why, out of all the other lots on Coney Island, they single out our particular garden," said Frank Minors, 67, who helped create the Youth and Senior Garden on Mermaid Avenue out of the rubble of a collapsed bowling alley eight years ago. "I was riding around the other day, counting the lots. There are a million of them, for God's sake."
All he does is garden, he said, and he loves to plant collards, tomatoes, okra and the like. "There are a lot of poor people out here, and we give most of the stuff away to people who need it," Mr. Minors said.
Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger said the city is disposing of its vacant land "willy-nilly, with no regard to the surrounding context or long-term development goals.
"I don't think you can save a garden, as important as it is, if there's a clear contract to develop housing," she said. "It's important for government to keep its word."
But if the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development has a number of buildable lots in a neighborhood and one has become an important community garden, Ms. Messinger added, "and somebody says they have dollars to put housing in that neighborhood, I would hope that H.P.D. would work with the community board and elected officials to identify other sites."
Ms. Messinger, who three years ago pushed to find another home for the Dome Garden, is now opposing the city's moves to auction off nine lots on the Lower East Side, unless it defines appropriate uses for each, like gardens, commercial development or housing. As many as 20 gardens in the East Village and the Lower East Side have been designated for eventual affordable and market-rate development.
A handful of gardens have won permanent status, and recently, Housing Preservation and Development agreed to take some gardens off its development list. One, on West 132d Street in Harlem, had won the backing of Community Board 10 and the Trust for Public Land, which is one of several greening groups lobbying to preserve the city's most valuable gardens. More important, the developer was willing to relinquish the site. "We actually lost 12 units," said Victor R. Nova, whose company, Novalex Contracting, is building 60 units in the neighborhood. Mr. Nova looks down on the garden from the bedroom of his own brownstone on 131st Street.
Something happens to people who work a piece of land.
Ten years ago, Jon Crow, a Brooklyn Bear, helped plant a grove of five white birch trees, which are now 30 feet high. Another Bear, Edward Lincoln, 73, says he has planted 5,000 bulbs over the years. Robins raise their young in the grapevines covering the gazebo; migrating monarchs sip nectar from the butterfly bushes, pausing in the middle of the rush of cars.
"We're all for development," Mr. Crow said, "but when community gardeners go in and make a neighborhood livable, I think that needs to be respected and rewarded. I think we need to start landmarking the gardens that have been active.
"Here you have an active community group, which is exactly what you need to encourage. You don't just disband them and shoo them away. You try to accommodate them.
He continued: "We always thought we'd be a part of the process of any future development. But we weren't even given a chance to pitch the idea."
The city's position has always been that a Greenthumb garden is temporary. "For years, Greenthumb was where you could park land for interim use," said Henry J. Stern, the Park Commissioner, who has jurisdiction over the program. "These were sites of abandoned buildings that were torn down, leaving a gaptooth in the block."
And until the city finds money to rebuild, Mr. Stern added, "You don't want a rubble-strewn area, so you park it in Greenthumb and let it be used as a garden. But the key word is 'interim.' "
Deputy Mayor Reiter said: "We have lots of places where people can plant gardens. If you lose one, you put one somewhere else."
But the four-year-old children's garden in Bushwick, on the corner of Halsey Street and Central Avenue, is the only safe green space for blocks -- and it too must make way for housing.
"Before we cleaned up the lot, people were afraid to wait for the bus at the corner because rats the size of cats would run out of the trash piles," Janus Barton, 44, said. She started the garden, called the Rock Garden, an acronym for Reclaim Our City's Kids, as an extension of an after-school program at the nearby junior high school.
"There was a crack house and a brothel across the street," she said. "Until one of the prostitutes moved away, her children gardened with us."
Other cities, like Philadelphia, which has 15,000 vacant lots, are actively working with community development corporations to use some of this open land for gardens, which are consciously incorporated into housing plans.
"It's not just an afterthought, it's part of the planning of the neighborhood," said J. Blaine Bonham Jr., the vice president of programs for the Philadelphia Horticultural Society, which runs the Philadelphia Green Program. The group's open-space plans, which incorporate hundreds of vegetable gardens right into housing developments, have attracted large sums of grant money, including $2.75 million from the Pew Charitable Trust and $3 million from the William Penn Foundation.
A community development corporation in the South Bronx called the Mid Bronx Desperadoes has insured their garden's future by choosing an unbuildable site -- a blocklong rock ledge that runs along Longfellow Avenue, between 173d and 174th Streets. And because its plan includes a basketball court, a park with benches, a wildflower meadow and an amphitheater, the community project managed to attract $200,000 in Federal money, funneled through the Urban Resources Partnership, a coalition of seven Federal agencies interested in incorporating green space into community activities.
The Desperadoes had lost their Green thumb site to housing a few years ago, and it was quite a loss. "A lot of people just hung around because we could go over early in the morning and have our coffee and forget the horrors of the winter, when you didn't have no heat, or no hot water," said Dave Reid, 64, who has lived in the neighborhood for 35 years. "You could watch your vegetables grow, and it made life kind of interesting. You could escape. Maybe the whole house is getting ready to fall down, but look at the green corn, it's nice."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Insure wages? Home prices? Why not, a book argues.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
MOST homeowners wouldn't be able to sleep if they didn't have fire insurance. But what about the much greater financial risk of losing equity if the volatile housing market heads south?
By the same token, unemployment insurance is a crucial link in guaranteeing adequate income in the event of a job loss. But for most Americans, the greater risks to their livelihoods are borne privately -- for example, the risk of living in a declining economic region or simply entering the job market in an era of stagnant wages. 
 "Macro Markets" (Oxford University Press), by Robert Shiller of Yale University, explores these and other gaping holes in insurance. But when the book was published in 1994, it disappeared into the ether where unread books reside. Now, thanks to TIAA-CREF, the giant pension and insurance system for colleges, it is getting a second chance at the limelight.
"Macro Markets" received TIAA-CREF's first Paul Samuelson Award for Outstanding Scholarly Writing on Lifelong Financial Security last week at the annual meeting of the Allied Social Science Association in New Orleans. It was a choice that left John H. Biggs, the chairman of TIAA-CREF, dancing in the aisles.
"Economists have shown little interest in the institutions of insurance," he argued, "and we're delighted to support the sort of research that affects us."
This is a time of spectacular innovation, one in which it is possible to hedge against (or bet on) anything from the size of back orders in computer memory chips to changes in the price of orange juice concentrate. Trading in financial derivatives -- the generic term for synthetic securities that are, in essence, wagers -- now tops $50 trillion annually. That is just another form of insurance against risk. Strikingly, though, this market is confined to business-to-business transactions.
It has hardly touched household assets in general and human capital -- the ability to earn a living -- in particular. One reason, notes Stephen Ross, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a judge in the Samuelson Prize competition, is "adverse selection." Those most eager to insure themselves against, say, physical disability are typically those at highest risk. Another reason is "moral hazard." Those who are insured against, say, auto theft, are more inclined to leave their cars unlocked, pushing premiums beyond the reach of more prudent owners.
But insurance markets for disability and auto theft do exist. Why then, Mr. Shiller asks, is there no way to insure against stagnant wages? One possibility is that few would pay enough to get an insurer to take the other side of the bet. Another is that most people are willing to pay to protect themselves only against a catastrophe rather than the less severe losses from economic change.
Still, wage and income growth is often uncorrelated between countries. There's no good reason, Mr. Shiller argues, why, say, the Taiwanese, with relatively low incomes and rapidly rising wages, wouldn't be willing to bear some of the risk of wage stagnation in Japan, which has high incomes and slowly rising wages, in return for cash premiums today from the Japanese.
Or consider the less grandiose idea of insuring against changing housing costs the way farmers and food conglomerates insure each other against changing corn prices. Those who already own valuable houses might be prepared to forgo any profit from further appreciation in return for insurance against any fall in price. Meanwhile, renters thinking about buying might be prepared to take the other side of the bet, insuring themselves against rising house costs in return for forgoing the benefits if house prices fall.
Mr. Ross finds the Shiller approach "provocative and bold," but argues that "the issues of practicality loom large." An attempt to trade options linked to an overall index of house prices in Britain failed for lack of interest in the 1980's, he notes. It may be that the idea was never marketed well. On the other hand, there may be insurmountable psychological barriers to getting people to pay to reduce certain kinds of risks.
Olivia Mitchell, an economist at the Wharton School of Business and another judge on the Samuelson Prize committee, offers one other caution. While the risk of stagnant wages in a whole country might be offset by buying into the wage experiences of a larger pool of nations, she argues that most of the variation in individuals' incomes have nothing to do with overall wage trends. And those risks may be inherently uninsurable because of moral hazard: If the insurance company will replace 70 percent of any shortfall in my income next year, I think I'll take the day off.
Whatever the criticisms, everyone agrees that Mr. Shiller is plowing exceptionally fertile turf. The ideas seem -- dare one say it -- obvious. But like most profound ideas, they are only obvious after someone thought of them.

HEADLINE: Despite the Broadway Boom, Serious Plays Face Serious Peril

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
At a Dramatists Guild meeting several years ago, the playwright and director Arthur Laurents raised the scariest alarm in the theater business: he cried fire. "It's burning outside the window," he warned, "and you don't see the smoke."
The blaze was metaphorical, but the threat to Broadway and its writers real, Mr. Laurents said. The commercial play, perhaps an oxymoron in itself, was an endangered species. Its audience was disappearing, deserting it for musical spectacles and other entertainment. 
 Now, amid the trappings of plenty -- a season of record Broadway grosses and vibrant makeover in Times Square -- the issue has emerged as a leading concern in the theater community and the centerpiece of a soon-to-be-announced initiative by the industry and New York City to revitalize traditional theater with stipends for playwrights and new productions.
Boiled down, the question is this: Musicals aside, is there a future for Broadway on Broadway? Some put it more bluntly: Is entertainment killing the theater?
Today, many theater professionals say, a yawning gulf separates the prospects of straight plays and musicals, especially the tourist-thronged, London-incubated megamusicals that have taken root in some of the city's prime musical arenas, decreasing the prospects for new productions. Musicals account for about 80 percent of Broadway's box office, and the imbalance is growing. Take away the plays produced by nonprofit theaters with their subscription lists, and the lopsidedness is greater yet. Old Broadway hands remember when musicals and plays were near parity.
The trend, analysts say, is driven by mounting tourism. George Wachtel, president of the consulting concern Audience Research and Analysis, said that from 1990 to 1995 the foreign audience for Broadway nearly doubled to 15 percent, and it continues to grow as the number of foreign visitors to the city increases by about 3 percent a year. Edgar Dobie, president of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Company, said, "English is almost a second language at 'Cats.' "
All told, about 60 percent of the Broadway audience comes from outside the New York region, and these visitors, Mr. Wachtel said, tend to seek out the shows they've heard about at home. The same way "you know Disneyland is always there, 'Cats' and 'Phantom' are there," he said.
Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters and a leading producer, sees "a schizophrenic market, two different theater worlds." If only he had the theaters, he said, "we could easily book three or four more musicals." At the same time, he said, the smaller playhouses geared to drama are going dark.
Jed Bernstein, president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, said one generation had been lost to playgoing. "The question is," he said, "is there going to be two?"
In response, he said, the league, Actors Equity and other parts of the theater community, building on a detailed study of Broadway by the Boston consultants Bain & Company, have been working with the city to draft a broad revival effort including a fund to underwrite drama productions. The coalition is to meet on the plan, called "Broadway Initiatives," next week and make it public. Among its features is a transfer of development rights over theaters to other sites in midtown, with some of the proceeds going to support new works. Grants and loans would be made available to productions transferring to Broadway from the nonprofit theater, long the major launching pad for new playwrights and serious drama. Of the 13 Broadway musicals and plays that opened between June and December, seven came out of the nonprofit theater.
A governing board with an executive director would distribute the money to playwrights, workshops and productions, including original small musicals.
The effort is described as a big step from the Broadway Alliance, which capped production costs and ticket prices for designated plays in select theaters. But that initiative, begun in 1990, produced few viable plays. One exception has been the Terrence McNally drama "Master Class," which opened in November 1995, produced by Robert Whitehead and starring his wife, Zoe Caldwell.
In interviews over recent weeks, dozens of leading figures in the theater described an industry in flux as the lullaby of Broadway gives way to the boom of the wrecking ball and jackhammers. Weighty new players including the Walt Disney Company and the publicly held Toronto-based Livent Inc. entertainment empire, led by Garth H. Drabinsky, are joining the small circle of theater owners long dominated by the Shubert Organization, which is now into a transition of its own.
Many said the commercial theater was becoming more corporate and institutional, as rising costs demand ever-larger infusions of capital. At the same time, growing production costs are fostering new alliances, mergers and public offerings. No less a powerhouse than Pace Theatrical Group, a leading Broadway investor ("Dreams and Nightmares") and presenter of shows on the road, with grosses of more than $200 million a year, has been considering a plan to go public to raise more capital. Similarly, Dodger Productions ("Once Upon a Mattress" and a string of other Broadway revivals) has been in partnership talks with Endemol Entertainment of Amsterdam, one of Europe's largest producers.
From a Times Square office jammed with theatrical toys and souvenirs, Michael David, one of the three Dodger partners, saw a trend. "There are more and more grown-ups in this business," he said.
There almost have to be, given the fast-rising cost of staging shows. According to unpublished figures compiled by the theater league for labor talks, the average investment for a production in 1974-75 was $92,800. By 1987, the figure was almost 30 times higher: nearly $2.7 million. Now, a decade later, it has almost certainly multiplied again, but Mr. Bernstein of the league said a current figure was not readily available.
Mr. Landesman of Jujamcyn said that by the ratio of production costs to ticket price, prime seats now should cost $150, or double today's top price. "There are no economies of scale," he said. "It's new every night, handmade." Just to advertise a show for a week, he said, can cost $60,000, a complete night's proceeds in a fully booked theater.
James B. Freydberg, whose $10 million production of "Big" bombed last year, said that under union contracts, it had taken nine weeks just to load the show into the theater.
Yet overall, Broadway seems swept up in an enviable boom. According to figures collected by the theater league, Christmas week produced the highest Broadway ticket grosses ever, $13.9 million, although the record-breaking edge was attributable to the illusionist David Copperfield's limited but extraordinary run of up to three shows a day. Moreover, the league said, the 1996-97 season ending in May is likely to be the largest-grossing ever, with projected receipts of more than $470 million. Adding road productions should boost the total to more than $1.2 billion. (The American film industry, by comparison, grossed a record $5.7 billion domestically last year, Variety reported.)
And this year is to bring the addition of two big new $30 million musical stages on a reclaimed 42d Street: the 1,801-seat New Amsterdam renovated by Disney, and a new 1,839-seat Livent theater inside the facades of the old Lyric and Apollo Theaters.
Disney is getting a hefty city-state subsidy, but some theater figures are baffled by Mr. Drabinsky's gamble. "Maybe Garth knows something the rest of us don't," said Roger Berlind, a longtime independent producer, "but we don't know what." Mr. Drabinsky derides skeptics and says he plans to generate several million dollars by selling the name of his new theater.
 
No Place to Put More Megamusicals
Certainly the long-running musical spectacle seems to be Broadway's apotheosis. Together the megamusical quartet of "Cats," "The Phantom of the Opera," "Les Miserables," and "Miss Saigon" have run a total of 39 years and show every sign of continuing indefinitely (although a tired "Les Miz" is being reworked). These, on top of other long runs like Livent's now closed "Show Boat" (to be followed in the 1,933-seat Gershwin Theater by Livent's "Candide," advertised for April) have left new musicals circling for a landing like planes in a snowstorm.
"If I had 'Phantom' today," said John Breglio, a prominent Broadway lawyer, "I could not get it into a theater."
Plays are a different story.
For drama, in the smaller theaters of around 1,000 seats, there's ample room, although the Shubert Organization says that all 16 of its New York theaters have bookings for the season.
The traditional audience for plays has been dwindling, said Mr. Landesman. "The upper-middle-class, upper-age, Jewish West Sider is moving to Florida or dying out," he said. "That educated theater audience is getting harder to find."
Although more plays than musicals open each year, because they cost less to produce, they close faster. Last season 21 plays and 11 musicals opened, plus 6 special and return engagements, down substantially from the 32 plays, 26 musicals and 2 specials of the 1980-81 season.
Compared with "Cats," with nearly 6,000 performances since 1982, the longest-running plays on Broadway now are "Master Class" (434 performances to date) and "An Ideal Husband" (288). Edward Albee's revival of his critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize-winning drama "A Delicate Balance" ran a modest 212 performances before closing last September. Star appeal may help but not that much. "Taking Sides," with Ed Harris, closed on Dec. 29 after 84 performances. "Tourists want falling chandeliers and swimming pools," said Alexander H. Cohen, the show's producer.
With straight plays a difficult sell to a spectacle-oriented public, producers have sought to add dazzle with stars like Mr. Harris or Kathleen Turner, who appeared in "Indiscretions" in 1995. But few film stars are willing to commit themselves to open-ended theater roles and often prefer the limited engagements of the nonprofit theater.
As Times Square changes day by day into a new entertainment zone of 3-D virtual reality rides and cartoon-character stores, theme restaurants and cafes, Broadway as a synonym for theater risks losing a cherished identity, some theater people say.
Television and movies have already taken a toll. The 1931-32 season brought as many as 207 productions to Broadway. Last season there were 38 and this season should bring 35, up from 24 several years ago.
"Entertainment is killing the theater; the whole emphasis is on money," said Mr. Laurents, who wrote the books for "West Side Story," "Gypsy" and a new Broadway-bound play, "Two Lives," and who helped start Broadway Initiatives with Stephen Sondheim.
Broadway, he said, stands in danger of turning into another 57th Street arcade of Niketown and Warner Brothers. "It's all merchandizing," he said. "It's not helping the culture of this country. It's all, in one sense, a T-shirt."
 
Mass-Produced For the Masses
Surprisingly perhaps, Cameron Mackintosh, the producer behind "Cats," "Miss Saigon," "Les Miz," and "Phantom," did not disagree. "I do think there's a germ of truth in that," he said. "Broadway for a myriad of reasons doesn't have the same aura of creativity about it that it did."
Others also voiced concern. George C. Wolfe, producer of the Joseph Papp Public Theater, whose productions often land on Broadway, disparaged shows that are "mass produced and franchised out."
"It's 'Take this Phantom out and put in another one,' " he said, calling some of today's offerings "technology with interchangeable human parts."
"Once upon a time, people were drawn to adventure." he said. "Now they want something safe."
But Mr. Bernstein of the theater league said the threat to Broadway was overstated. "Killing? That's a bit strong," he said. "I would say maybe 'challenging' the theater."
Philip J. Smith, president of the Shubert Organization, said he was untroubled. "Everything is out there vying for the entertainment dollar, even a good meal in a restaurant," he said. What could be invidious in the success of megamusicals? he asked. "The more hits the better," he said. "Shows thrive on each other."
Mr. Smith, who took over from Bernard Jacobs, who died at 80 in August, derided speculation that the company, long Broadway's premier landlord, faced a succession crisis. He is 65, and Shubert's longtime chairman, Gerald Schoenfeld, is 72, but "we don't rely on one person or two people," Mr. Smith said. "We have a very strong organization, a lot of people not readily visible."
Disney executives, too, take pains to play down talk of any power shift on Broadway. "Under no circumstances are we saying, 'Oh, we're the new leader,' " said Peter Schneider, president of Walt Disney Theatrical Productions. "We do believe we're coming in with one or two little shows that will help Broadway as a business."
Still, he said, "clearly the question on everybody's lips is, is there a succession planned for the Shuberts?" About two years ago, as Disney was pondering the New Amsterdam deal, it took steps to inquire into the finances of the Shubert Organization with the aim of a possible purchase, said an intermediary in the discussions. But the Shuberts showed no interest, and the feeler was dropped.
To some in the industry, the Shubert Organization, which remains a formidable power, represents a time when Broadway stood for a theater of ideas, in contrast with, some would say, television, which is about characters, and movies, which are about stories.
Whatever the concern for the future, theater professionals say, Broadway remains famously unpredictable and anarchic, "an address, not an institution," in the words of Mr. David of Dodger Productions. If megamusicals are the big hits of today, smaller, more intimate productions like the current "Chicago," and "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk," seem the long runs of tomorrow.
"You can never discount the power of creativity," said Jeffrey Seller, one of the previously little-known producers of "Rent," the rock musical that has become one of the latter-day rags-to-riches legends of Broadway. The big guys didn't scare him, he said. "It just means they can bail longer."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Climbs Sharply Against Mark and Swiss Franc

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied sharply yesterday on gloomy economic forecasts in Germany and news that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia had been hospitalized.
The dollar reached a two-year high against the German mark and a 30-month peak against the Swiss franc. "The dollar is extremely well bid," said Jay Wertheimer, senior currency trader at Banco di Sicilia in New York. 
 A Kremlin statement late in the trading session disclosed that Mr. Yeltsin, who had quintuple bypass surgery in November, was hospitalized with early signs of pneumonia. The specter of political instability in Russia set off selling of marks. Germany is Russia's largest trading partner.
The dollar rose as high as 1.5787 marks before settling in New York at 1.5743 marks, up from 1.5640 on Tuesday and the highest level since late December 1994. The dollar also rose to 115.76 yen from 115.23 yen and to 1.3655 Swiss francs from 1.3535 Swiss francs. The British pound fell to $1.6877 from $1.6941.
Asian and European markets had already pushed the dollar higher early in the session amid broad expectations that a report due out today would show record unemployment in Germany.
The report comes out the same day that the Bundesbank will conduct its first policy meeting of the year. Some traders speculated that the central bank might cut German interest rates. Lower German rates would bolster the dollar by enhancing the relative value of assets priced in dollars.
"There may be some opportunity for the dollar to score further gains if we get a particularly bad employment report out of Germany," said Lisa Finstrom, currency analyst with Smith Barney.
Against the yen, the dollar rebounded after two days of heavy selling. Traders noted Japanese officials fell silent after several had made comments earlier this week calling for a halt to the dollar's recent rally.
In other trading, the Canadian dollar rose to 73.975 United States cents from 73.746 United States cents, as the Bank of Canada was forced to enter the market to sell the Canadian currency, which has rallied sharply in recent sessions.

Sell That Spectrum

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
My son the software developer gave me a gadget for Christmas that plugs into my television set, with a wire that plugs into the telephone jack on the wall.
Are you with me so far? I don't want to get too technical here. I press "power" on the remote (what did we do before remotes?) and the screen comes alive with a sign announcing it is dialing "WebTV," to which I have just been subscribed at who knows what expense, and whammo! there I am on the Internet like a regular hacker. This enables me to call up the Times home page and click to read my own column on the big screen. 
 I do not venture a whole lot further (you could fall off the Earth) but the notion strikes me that the computer on which I am writing today's essay has a new competitor. For about $400, we instant cybernerds can "surf the Net" without a $2,000 computer, provided we are willing to block the rest of our family from watching television or using the phone.
The lessons here are that (1) reading one's column on the TV screen is not much of a thrill after the first time; (2) refusing to be swamped with E-mail can now be done out of principle and not ignorance, and (3) competing for the consumer's dollar is a powerful force for economic good.
Surely this latest gizmo will be leapfrogged by another carrier, just as broadcast TV was leapfrogged by cable, which was leapfrogged by satellite, which is being leapfrogged by digital TV.
That latest -- digital TV, which used to be dreamed of as high-definition TV -- is the ultra-sharp picture you get when the old, beat-up analogue channel that broadcasters now use is split into a bunch of shiny new digital channels.
Now here's where competition comes in. Fat-cat broadcasters, who got the daddy channel free from the public, want to keep all the valuable progeny of that gift. Those digital channels are worth tens of billions; indeed, when a non-broadcast part of the spectrum was put up for bids, the U.S. Treasury received more money than from any auction in the history of the world.
Why not put those coming digital channels up at public auction? When Bob Dole suggested that last year, the broadcasters' lobby worked over every member of Congress to protect their giveaway; Trent Lott backed off, and Bill Clinton was not about to anger station owners who could affect his re-election.
But yesterday, as the new Congress convened, the Senate Commerce chairman, John McCain, met quietly with the House Budget chairman, John Kasich, to discuss the "Dirty Dozen" -- 12 corporate welfare items that ought to be knocked out of next year's budget to bring it toward balance.
Dirtiest of the dozen was the proposed digital spectrum giveaway. I spoke to both of these gutsy free-market Republicans afterward; Kasich said, "I'm going to take a much closer look at the broadcast spectrum," and McCain went further: "I'm all for an auction. Could turn up $30 to $35 billion. But we're up against the power of the broadcasting lobby, and it's the strongest I've seen in Washington."
McCain is hopeful that the President will bite the bullet and include a broadcast spectrum auction in his budget proposal next month. The F.C.C.'s Reed Hundt should lean on his friend Al Gore to push it as a way to preserve Head Start and Medicaid.
If Clinton now shows the gumption to go up against America's most powerful lobby, McCain and Kasich might then find an ally in Senate Budget chairman Pete Domenici.
This is not an issue that TV network news will relish covering, nor is it likely to be reported on many local stations or in magazines and newspapers with broadcast interests, but perhaps some solons in both parties would be emboldened if given political cover from the President and a few outspoken, budget-hawkish G.O.P. leaders.
Bring on the "Dirty Dozen," McCain and Kasich. Turn on your bosses, TV reporters and editors. Together you can shame the President into taking a stand that upsets the media-politico complex.
Then we can read all about it in big type on our television screens.

HEADLINE: Entergy Agrees to Manage Troubled Maine Nuclear Plant

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The Entergy Corporation, a large New Orleans-based utility, is aggressively moving into the business of running nuclear plants for other electricity companies.
On Tuesday, Entergy said it had agreed to manage Maine Yankee, the state's troubled nuclear plant. That deal, the first in the industry, is expected to be followed by similar arrangements with other utilities, the company said yesterday. 
 "We are in discussions with other utilities about operating their plants," said Don Hintz, president of Entergy Operations Inc., a subsidiary that runs five nuclear plants for Entergy. "We expect more deals."
He said the subsidiary had been able to make striking improvements in the operations of several of its own plants. That was the argument, he said, the company used to win the agreement with Maine Yankee, which is Maine's only nuclear plant and which has had numerous operational problems and shutdowns.
Some energy-industry experts said the Maine Yankee management arrangement could be a model for other utilities that have costly, troubled plants, many in the Northeast.
"It reflects a trend in the industry," said Jonathan Gottlieb, a partner at the law firm of Reid & Priest in Washington, which specializes in cases involving the utility industry.
As the industry moves toward greater competition, utilities are seeking to cut costs. Mr. Gottlieb said that contracting out the management of nuclear plants might be a way to improve the performance of those plants as well as to cut operating costs.
Entergy is not alone; Peco Energy of Philadelphia is also seeking to manage nuclear plants.
Mr. Hintz said Entergy studied utilities that have nuclear plants and found that many did not have the size or the expertise to run their plants as efficiently as possible.
He said the final contract with Maine Yankee, to be completed in about a month, would provide for Entergy's compensation to be linked to how successful it is in improving the plant's performance.
"Entergy knows how to improve efficiency, cost-effectiveness, morale and safety," said David T. Flanagan, chairman of the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company, which owns the nuclear plant. "That is what Maine Yankee needs."
Mr. Flanagan is also president of the Central Maine Power Company, which holds a 38 percent stake in the plant, the largest among the consortium of 10 utilities that own the plant. Maine Yankee, which began operating in 1972, supplies about 20 percent of the electricity used in the state. It is situated in Wiscasset, about 40 miles northeast of Portland.
The plant's difficulties have intensified in recent years, leading to costly shutdowns and repairs.
Although an inspection team from the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission found last summer that the safety of the plant was adequate, it also raised safety concerns, citing questions about its work force and economic pressures of an increasingly competitive industry.
The plant was shut for most of 1995 to make repairs costing about $27 million to reinforce tubes that had deteriorated in three steam generators. It operated for most of 1996 but was again shut for a plant-wide review of electrical cables. That led to further inspection of its fuel-handling equipment.
Managers hope that the plant will be back in service by mid-February. Meanwhile, the utilities that own the plant are forced to buy costly power from outside suppliers.
Recently, Charles Frizzle, the president of Maine Yankee, resigned, ending a 25-year career at the utility and signaling that a change in management was in the works.
Mr. Flanagan, at a news conference in Brunswick, Me., on Tuesday, said that under the agreement Entergy would take over the day-to-day operations of the plant and would assign a senior executive to be the plant's chief nuclear officer.
Some Maine opponents of nuclear power have campaigned to shut it down. That would lead to the utilities' having to find a way of paying for the remaining costs of the plant and the expense of decommissioning.
Maine Yankee's management has argued that the plant can produce power cheaply, has had a good performance record until 1995, and has proposed improvements to allow it run to the end of its licensed life in 2008.
The plant is a leading employer in Wiscasset, a seacoast town of 1,600, accounting for about 700 jobs including contractors. Mr. Flanagan said the management change would not lead to a reduction in the work force and could result in an expansion, since the 840-megawatt plant is already one of the leanest staffed in the industry. He also said that $27 million would be spent this year on maintenance and $10 million on capital improvements.
Entergy's utility subsidiaries serve two million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

Prices of Treasuries Drop; Long-Bond Yield at 6.84%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Government securities dropped yesterday in late afternoon trading after initially gaining ground. Bond traders apparently remain wary about economic data this week, and a buildup of supply in corporate debt is making securities with long maturities less desirable.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 21/32, to a price of 95 22/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.84 percent, from 6.78 percent on Tuesday. 
 Early in the day, the bond market rose along with the dollar, which derived strength from signs of economic weakness in Germany. That could lead to lower interest rates there and that would make dollar-denominated assets more attractive. The gains were also underpinned by talk in the markets that the Federal Reserve was buying Treasuries.
But large investors later began selling, making room for an expected $5 billion in supply, from corporations and several foreign governments, that should hit the market in the next few days. Large investors often sell Treasury bonds to hedge against expected declines in the market, while purchasing corporate debt and other dollar-denominated securities. Mexico and Argentina are preparing to sell a total of $3 billion in global bonds.
Traders are also wary about economic statistics coming this week, which will allow them to assess the chances of an interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve when it meets in early February. The Producer Price Index will be released today and the December employment report tomorrow.
Since the end of November, signs of a rebound in manufacturing and housing, as well as a gain in consumer confidence, have raised concern over inflation and pushed the yield on the 30-year bond up more than 40-hundredths of a percentage point.
Hugh Whelan, vice president and portfolio manager at Aeltus Investment Management, said the market was looking good until late in the afternoon; then, he said, rumors that a large block of five-year Treasury notes was up for sale sent prices down. "In a thin market, the one block was able to push prices below technical support levels, and that caused additional selling," he said.
"It's been pretty easy to sell into the market this week," Mr. Whelan said, "especially with most buyers sidelined and waiting for the employment report. We could a get a little bounce tomorrow if we get a favorable Producer Price Index. But it's unlikely the market will run away with itself with the employment number due Friday."
Mr. Whelan said the market's sentiment might be shifting toward a more bearish mode as investors were alarmed by recent signs of economic strength, fearing that inflation would erode the value of their bond holdings. He added that the Fed's stance on interest rates might change, too, despite the fact that its decision not to raise rates earlier this year was validated when economic growth fell sharply in the third quarter after its strength in the second.
"Now it looks as though the fourth quarter may be as strong as the second quarter," he said, "so now the question is, can the Fed be patient again and wait to see if the first-quarter rate of growth weakens from the fourth-quarter pace? At some point the Fed's patience is bound to run out."
Mr. Whelan said he did not believe that the bond market had priced in that eventuality yet, but he added that he tought it was leaning in that direction. "If we do get a strong employment report on Friday," Mr. Whelan said, "than we can start talking about a 7 percent yield on the long bond."

HEADLINE: G.M. to Regain American Market Share, Executives Say

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 8

 BODY:
General Motors executives said here today that they expected to reverse the long decline in the company's share of the American market while expanding G.M.'s highly profitable overseas operations.
Crippled by strikes and plagued by slow introductions of new models, G.M. has lost sales in the United States over the last year even faster than it had been in recent years; the company's American market share has been shrinking steadily since the early 1960's. G.M. officials encouraged financial analysts last month to reduce their estimates of the company's fourth-quarter earnings, while the company's stock has underperformed the market as investors have become impatient. 
 But after months of public silence, several top G.M. officials said in interviews that the company's long-awaited turnaround in the United States was at hand. The company's market share will bounce back as labor peace returns and new models begin coming out of factories at full speed, they said. The executives also predicted eventual gains in market share and profits in overseas markets, where G.M., the world's largest auto maker, is directing a rising share of its investment budget.
John F. Smith Jr., the chairman, chief executive and president of G.M., said that foreign markets would account for more than half of G.M.'s auto sales early in the next century, up from 35 percent now. Harry J. Pearce, the company's vice chairman, said on Tuesday that G.M. wanted to be seen as a global company rather than an American company.
G. Richard Wagoner Jr., the president of G.M.'s North American operations, predicted today that the company's share of the United States market, which has dropped to 30 percent this winter from nearly 34 percent a year ago, would rebound in the latter half of this year. The company expects its share to stabilize at 33 percent, he said, possibly by the end of this year.
J. Michael Losh, G.M.'s chief financial officer, seemed to hint on Tuesday at the possibility of a dividend increase. Asked whether the company could afford to raise dividends, he said that the decision would rest with the board later this month, but he noted that the company during the third quarter had exceeded its goal of holding $13 billion in cash reserves. He also said that cash reserves had increased further since then.
And Louis R. Hughes, the president of G.M.'s international operations, said that while further progress was needed, a combination of steps taken by company executives had allowed the company to bounce back from its "very serious financial difficulties" four years ago.
"We've restored the financial health of the company; we have completely renovated our product line, and that is coming to market," Mr. Hughes said.
G.M.'s 15 new car and mini-van models are reaching the market slowly. But the company says that is because it is trying to keep quality high, and some other auto executives have greeted the new designs with respect.
"They're well-styled, well-executed cars," said Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of the Chrysler Corporation.
But Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, said that it would be hard for G.M. to win back a large share of the American market because other companies might cut prices and offer larger rebates so as to hold on to their recent gains. Each percentage point of the market is equal to about $2.7 billion in sales.
G.M. should be able to regain some of its lost market share simply by maintaining labor peace. Two strikes last year prevented G.M. from building 300,000 cars and trucks, which would have been equal to two percentage points of the market, Mr. Wagoner said.
About one-third of the lost production consisted of trucks that G.M. is selling as fast as it can build them. The other production losses were cars, some of which have been in demand and some of which have not.
Mr. Wagoner nonetheless warned that the recovery of the company's North American operations could be hurt by the dollar's recent rise against the Japanese yen. The dollar's rise has helped Japanese companies cut prices or hold them level on cars and trucks imported from Japan or assembled in the United States from parts that are often imported.
Based on economic fundamentals, the dollar should be trading at 85 or 95 yen, Mr. Wagoner said. In late afternoon trading today in New York, the dollar stood at 115.76 yen.

HEADLINE: At Center of Plans for Education: Lower Default Rate on Loans

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Beginning a campaign to build Congressional support for his education proposals, President Clinton plans to announce on Thursday that the percentage of borrowers defaulting on their Federal student loans has dropped to 10.7 percent.
As he did last year in his State of the Union Message, Mr. Clinton planned to showcase the trend as a sign of student responsibility that should pave the way for making college education more accessible. 
 The President has had a longstanding proposal to make tax deductible up to $10,000 a year of college tuition. Last year in the Presidential campaign, he proposed a $1,500 tax credit for the first two years of post-secondary education tied to maintenance of a B average. And he has proposed to allow money from I.R.A.'s to be withdrawn for college expenses.
The programs are central to Mr. Clinton's theme that higher education is crucial to success in the global information age. And education proved a powerful selling point for him in the 1996 campaign.
While tax cuts are likely to appeal to the Republican Congress, some education analysts have begun to express concerns that the President's proposals could lead to inflation in tuition costs or cause states to cut back on the money they put into higher education. Educators have also asked whether tying a tax credit to a B average would put the Internal Revenue Service into the position of verifying college grades.
"We are most grateful to the president for having made clear that college education is an important focus of national attention," said Barmak Nassirian, an analyst for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. "In that sense we understand the intent is good."
But he added, "We have a number of very serious concerns about the specifics of the proposals."
Administration officials say the report that Mr. Clinton will unveil shows that for the 1994 fiscal year -- the most current data available -- the rate of borrowers defaulting on student loans dropped to 10.7 percent, compared with 11.6 percent in the 1993 fiscal year.
The downward trend began after the 1990 fiscal year when the default rate peaked at 22.4 percent and the Bush Administration began to tackle the problem, given new Congressional authority for sanctions.
Administration figures also show that increased collections, combined with the lower default rate reduced the net cost to the Government of defaults to $249 million in the 1996 fiscal year, compared with $1.7 billion four years earlier.

HEADLINE: Pension Economics

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: EW ORLEANS, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Today, millions of elderly Americans are nearly as well off in retirement as they were in their working years. But to live that well, they are absorbing, in Social Security and Medicare alone, an ever-growing portion of the nation's annual income. And one of the big questions raised by this week's Federal advisory report on Social Security is whether this trend should continue or whether more of that money should go to younger people.
"To an extent previously unknown in Western societies in modern times, the retired elderly are now able to live independently rather than as resident dependents of their adult children," Benjamin Friedman, an economist at Harvard University, said in a presentation at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association, which ended here this week. 
 The advent of Medicare in 1965 and the practice adopted soon after of linking increases in Social Security benefits to increases in the inflation rate have kept millions of elderly Americans out of the poverty many of their retired parents suffered. But will such living standards be sustainable after the baby-boom generation starts retiring in the next decade or so?
No one contends that the Social Security system can go on as it is. The recommendations of the 13-member Advisory Council on Social Security represent, in part, an attempt to sidestep the issue by suggesting that it is possible to generate a higher return by investing some Social Security revenue from payroll taxes in the stock market. The money that is not needed immediately to provide for current beneficiaries now goes entirely into Treasury securities, which have tended to perform worse than stocks.
But putting aside a stock market gamble designed to help cover the future fiscal shortfall in Social Security, two schools of thought have emerged about the more fundamental economic question.
On one side are those who argue that the elderly and their children are struggling over national income that in the 21st century will no longer be sufficient to support retirees in the current style without squeezing their children. That balance, they say, should be redressed.
"The real story is that we are taking from young savers and giving to old spenders," said Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University.
But the other school says that this sort of talk is scare-mongering. There will be enough income for young and old, they say, without major changes in the current level of Social Security benefits, Medicare and long-term care for the elderly under Medicaid. "The burden is not that great," said Dean Baker, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
The statistics lay out the framework of the debate, and in the process make clear that the real challenge is not so much Social Security as it is the cost of providing health care to the elderly. Nearly 9 percent of the $8 trillion a year in national income, or gross domestic product, is dedicated to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid for the elderly, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Social Security currently represents 5 percentage points of this 9 percent. Add in earnings from private income and the total percentage of national income going to the elderly is even higher.
Without changes in policy, that 9 percent share will more than double, to 19 percent of the national income, by 2050. But even without cutbacks in Social Security benefits, the 5 percent now dedicated to Social Security will rise to only 7 percent, the budget office projects, while Medicare will swell to 8 percent and Medicaid outlays for long-term care will reach 4 percent.
"If we could somehow get the cost increases in health care down closer to the growth of the economy," said Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, referring to a two-and-a-half-percent growth rate for the economy, "then you take care of about half the total growth in spending for the elderly."
But Mr. Kotlikoff says this is wishful thinking. More likely, he says, the national economy, and with it, the national income, will not grow sufficiently to finance the current level of Government benefits to the elderly. As a result, working-age Americans by the middle of the next century would have to pay out in Federal, state and local taxes more than 80 percent of their earnings to maintain retirement benefits at their current levels. All of these taxes are currently less than 35 percent of income.
"We are either going to bankrupt the next generation with sky-high tax rates or ask the elderly to pay their fair share," he said.
Many experts, on both sides of the issue, would cut back retirement benefits, at least somewhat. Most Social Security proposals, for example, argue that the retirement age, which is already scheduled to rise gradually to 67 early in the next century, should be pushed back even further. But while Mr. Baker and Mr. Steuerle would stop at small cuts in Government benefits for the elderly, Mr. Kotlikoff and Mr. Friedman would try to sharply reduce the proportion of national wealth going to the elderly.
They would do so by such measures as cutting Federal benefits for those with sufficient private income, by reducing the annual increases in Social Security pensions, by taxing the benefits, by requiring the elderly to pay more from their pockets for medical care, and by stiffening the eligibility requirements for Medicare.
But others see the glass as half full rather than half empty. Mr. Baker argues that if the Social Security payroll tax, now at 12.4 percent, were pushed up one-tenth of a percentage point a year, starting now and continuing through 2046, the total rise of just under 5 percentage points would pay for Social Security, without cutbacks, for 75 years.
"Given moderate economic growth," Mr. Baker said, "the income of American workers after paying this higher tax and allowing for inflation would still be higher than it is today."
But Medicare remains an issue, although Mr. Steuerle, who spoke by telephone, sees it as a declining one. Health care costs are no longer rising as rapidly as they were, he notes, and that decline is likely to continue.

HEADLINE: Economy Warms Up, and Eyes Turn to the Fed

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Less than two weeks ago, the economy seemed to be plodding sedately ahead and discussion focused on when the Federal Reserve might have to relax its monetary grip to keep the long-running expansion intact.
But suddenly analysts are more optimistic about the economy's vigor and talk in many quarters has now turned to how long the inflation-wary Fed can wait before tightening policy. 
 "Momentum has picked up," according to Michael P. Niemira, economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York.
The overall picture, however, is far from clear. In recent days, preliminary Christmas tallies have shown disappointing results for many retailers, although others, ranging from Wal-Mart to sellers of luxury goods, seem to have done quite well.
At the same time, the Government and various private groups were issuing statistics about other aspects of the economy that almost without exception surpassed expectations. Sales of both new and existing homes, consumer confidence, construction spending and results of surveys of production and inventory officials as well as of corporate purchasing managers were all more robust than specialists anticipated.
But unlike this Friday's report on the labor market in December, none of the recent indicators ranks among the most important gauges of economic health. Analysts also tend to be extra cautious about interpreting data covering holiday periods or when weather is extreme.
"Because of the uncertain impact of the holidays, inclement weather and year-end slowdowns, we would interpret the latest two weeks' data cautiously," Samuel D. Kahan, a Chicago consultant advised clients. Many statistics are adjusted for seasonal effects but this process itself sometimes distorts results.
Nevertheless, the recent figures have had a pronounced impact, unsettling securities markets as well as forcing economists to revamp their forecasts. Among other things, the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds climbed from just over 6.5 percent to 6.84 percent.
"You can't ignore the numbers that came in on the strong side," said Brian Gendreau, an economist at Morgan Guaranty. "The cumulative effect was enough to make people change their views."
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that orders to factories in November posted their first decline since August but this did little to dispel the notion that the economy was reaccelerating. Not only had an even larger decline been predicted but orders for October were revised upward.
Today, the Federal Reserve found that consumer credit outstanding grew $7.4 billion to a seasonally adjusted $1.19 trillion in November, a 7.4 percent annual growth rate. Analysts said the figure showed consumers confident enough to take on more debt.
Economists now generally think that the economy grew at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the October-December quarter, or more than one-third faster than the 2.2 percent consensus forecast by Blue Chip Economic Indicators in its monthly survey published Dec. 10. With housing and trade exceptionally powerful contributors, some analysts predict gross domestic product could come in at a rate as high as 4 percent when the Commerce Department makes its first estimate Jan. 31.
In any event, the figure will almost certainly exceed the pace of 2.25 percent or so that many regard as the fastest the United States can expand without pushing up the inflation rate. Thus, according to Joshua N. Feinman, an economist at Bankers Trust, the figures from late December and early January "are a reminder that it would not take much additional economic growth to kindle some inflationary pressures" since the labor market is "already stretched."
But while most analysts agree that fourth-quarter growth will prove to be faster than the Federal Reserve can long endure, opinion appears to have polarized about prospects for 1997, no doubt more challenging to predict than the past.
Some, including Mr. Gendreau at Morgan Guaranty, predict a robust 3 percent pace of growth in the January-March period, saying that will contribute to a decision by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates as early as its March policy meeting.
But others, such as Paul A. McCulley, chief economist at UBS Securities in New York, believe the economic vigor of late 1996 will be temporary. They noted that the fourth-quarter lift came despite the fact that retail sales during the holidays generally disappointed merchants hoping for sizable improvement from a poor 1996 season and that the automotive market faded in December. Consumers account for two-thirds of economic activity, half of this at retail counters.
The economy isn't able to "take off before it has landed, taxied and refueled," Mr. McCulley said, predicting first-quarter growth no faster than a 2 percent pace. "I think the next Fed move is down," he said.

HEADLINE: SERB RULER YIELDS ON VOTE OUTCOME IN 2d LARGEST CITY

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The Government of President Slobodan Milosevic, in its most significant concession since daily street protests began seven weeks ago, today acknowledged that opposition parties had won control of Nis, Serbia's second largest city.
The announcement, read on the Government-controlled television tonight, appeared to be an effort by Mr. Milosevic to defuse the protests, which erupted after the Government moved to invalidate the opposition coalition's victories in 14 of Serbia's 19 largest cities. 
 It was immediately rejected by the opposition, which pledged to continue the demonstrations until Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party relinquished local power in Belgrade and the other contested cities.
"The Government is trying to work out a compromise, but that is unacceptable to us," said Aleksandar Krstic, a leader of the opposition reached by telephone in Nis. "This decision is a clear admission by the Government that it carried out fraud during the vote in 13 voting stations. "This is one small step forward in our drive to get the Government to honor the election results in Nis and the rest of Serbia."
A former Communist who swept to power on a platform of Serbian nationalism, Mr. Milosevic has a well-earned reputation as an autocratic and often ruthless political leader. But he has also proved adept at using compromise to maintain his power, both with his domestic opponents and with the outside world.
Mr. Milosevic's concessions to student dissidents' demands in 1992 brought to an end the last major protests against his rule. And he was instrumental in pushing through the Dayton peace accord for Bosnia, although it brought an end to a war he had largely been responsible for starting.
Just last week, in the face of pressure from the United States and Europe, the Government said it would accept opposition victories in three contested cities. It insisted then that the results in Nis were still in doubt.
Opposition leaders said tonight they would not accept the Government's proposed resolution for Nis, under which the ruling Socialist Party would hold 32 of the 70 seats on the local council, twice as many as it appeared to have won in November's elections.
Nis (pronounced neesh), a bleak industrial town where huge Government-owned factories lie nearly idle and unemployment is 50 percent, is where the street protests began. It has proved the most militant city in the country, and opposition leaders there have built what the Government views as a dangerous alliance with local police and military commanders. Military officers, for example, guard city installations in civilian clothes most nights, and protesters are applauded by the soldiers as they walk past the barracks. Opposition leaders in the city praise the work of the local police officials, who they describe as "friendly and helpful."
Western diplomats said the Government, while perhaps willing to concede Nis and some smaller cities, still hopes to hold on to Belgrade, where the opposition also won decisively. As long as Mr. Milosevic insists on retaining control over the local government in the capital, the diplomats said, it will be difficult for him to bring a nonviolent end to the huge street demonstrations, which have seen tens of thousands of people brave the blustery cold to voice their anger and demand for reform.
If the opposition takes control of Nis, it says, it will use the city as a base to try and build independent broadcasting and newspaper outlets to counter the Government's iron grip on the media. But there are signs that the Government is working behind the scenes to circumvent this strategy by giving the Government-run companies in Belgrade control over all of Serbia's local print and broadcast concerns.
Today thousands of heavily armed riot police officers in the capital prevented opposition supporters from driving their cars into the center of the city after protesters staged a traffic jam on Sunday that paralyzed the city.
Cordons of police officers in gray flak jackets and equipped with truncheons blocked cars from entering the city. The police also prevented some 3,000 students from marching.
But the announcement that Nis had been lost appeared to indicate another crack in the Government shell.
"On the basis of documents inspected by the Justice Ministry, the Zajedno political organization won 37 seats, the Socialist Party of Serbia 32 and the Serbian Radical Party 1 seat in Nis local council," reported Tanjug, the state news agency.
Opposition leaders in Nis say the Socialists won only 16 seats in the November vote, with 41 for the coalition, 1 for the Radical Party and 12 that remain in dispute.
"We will not negotiate about these elections," said Miroljub Labus, a senior leader in the Zajedno coalition. "The total electoral decision of the people must be accepted."

HEADLINE: 'Parting Benediction' by Lonely Liberal

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
One of the lonely liberals of the Clinton Administration, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, leaves Washington this week declaring that the Government must lead a campaign to narrow a growing gap between rich and poor and to fight the policies of corporate America.
In a draft of a speech for delivery on Thursday, a day before he leaves the Labor Department, Mr. Reich says he "can't resist a last word." He maintains that the Administration's "unfinished agenda is to address widening inequality." 
 Mr. Reich insists that his focus on an issue that others in the Administration generally avoid discussing is not intended as criticism of his colleagues or of President Clinton, a longtime friend who, he says, "harbors the same convictions as the young man I came to know in our student days."
But it may well be interpreted as thinly veiled criticism of the Administration's drift to the center, because Mr. Reich questions whether the United States is abandoning "the implicit social contract" it has maintained with workers for half a century. And once again, he baits corporate America for its treatment of workers in the pursuit of profits, a tack that other Cabinet members, especially Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, have persuaded Mr. Clinton not to take.
Specifically, Mr. Reich complains of a growing "benefits gap" in which "top executives and their families receive ever more generous health benefits, and their pension benefits are soaring in the form of compensation deferred until retirement." Meanwhile, he cites statistics showing that only 14 percent of workers earning $10,000 to $20,000 are covered by the most common types of retirement savings plans, known as 401(k) programs, and only 34 percent are covered by a pension plan.
In a phone conversation, Mr. Reich, who is resigning to spend more time with his two teen-age boys in Boston, said today that his speech was "not a parting shot but a parting benediction."
Yet he also seems acutely aware that his departure leaves only Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as an outspoken liberal voice in the Cabinet. But Ms. Shalala has had little influence on policy and is not as pithy a speaker as the ever-quotable Mr. Reich.
"Bob acted as the liberal conscience," an Administration colleague said, "and in the new Cabinet, you won't find one of those."
That may be by design. To the consternation of Mr. Clinton's political advisers, Mr. Reich often called for far more Government efforts to intervene in the economy on behalf of ordinary workers than others in the Administration, particularly Mr. Rubin, were willing to endorse.
When Mr. Reich called for an alternative tax system that would favor corporations that gave greater benefits to workers, officials called reporters to declare that he was not speaking for the Administration.
Whenever conflict with Mr. Clinton's aides reached a fevered point, Mr. Reich would call his friend of 30 years to ask whether he should tone down his comments. The President, by all accounts, would tell Mr. Reich to go ahead with his views.
Tonight, at a farewell tribute to Mr. Reich, Mr. Rubin joked about their occasional policy clashes but insisted that their many areas of agreement were often ignored by the press. He said that Mr. Reich's influence over Administration policy would continue even after he left Washington and that if he disagreed with the Administration, "he will certainly call and let us know."
At the core of Mr. Reich's speech, to a nonprofit group that deals with economic and labor issues, is an attack on the argument that a growing economy will lift all boats -- and that all American workers will prosper.
"Some deny that inequality is rising," he says in the draft of his speech, clearly addressing his critics but never naming names.
"Simply said, they are wrong. They view widening inequality as a byproduct of structural changes in our economy -- most notably technological advances and global economic integration, both of which tend to reward the best-educated and penalize those with the poorest education and skills. The same phenomenon is occurring the world over, they say. Nothing can be done about it."
But Mr. Reich argues that "denial, resignation and silence" will only worsen a trend that has accelerated since the late 1970's. "We are not merely an economy, but also a culture," he argues. "It has never been economics alone that defines America. If we choose, as a culture, to push back against the economic forces that would otherwise divide us, it is within our power to do so."
Mr. Reich skirts any specific prescriptions to narrow the gap. But he argues that "we need to carry with us the implicit social compact" that American prosperity had to include "almost everyone."
The first principle of that unwritten compact, he argues, is that as companies grow more profitable, wages and health and pension benefits should rise and jobs should grow more secure. He cites statistics, debated at length early in 1996 when "corporate downsizing" was a frequent topic of political discourse, showing that people are being laid off at the same rate as they were in less prosperous times.
Most of those laid off, the statistics show, find new jobs. Mr. Reich's critics say such change is a sign of economic health, because it shows that the economy is dynamic enough to shed workers from obsolete jobs and to hire them in new sectors that need talent. Mr. Reich says he agrees but insists that the system will only work with a far greater commitment to retraining.
Mr. Reich added that he had not clear his speech with others in the Administration. "I came in talking about these issues," he said, "I'm going out talking about them, and I'll keep talking about them."

HEADLINE: Rowland, in Address, Urges Income and Gas Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Saying Connecticut was in the midst of an economic recovery, Gov. John G. Rowland urged lawmakers today to stay the course he set in his first two years in office, continuing to cut taxes and hold the line on spending.
In a 25-minute State of the State Address, Mr. Rowland provided few details and offered no bold pronouncements but vigorously reasserted his intention to seek further cuts in the state income tax. While Democrats had hoped he might signal interest in property tax relief, his speech suggested little enthusiasm for compromise. 
 "Make no mistake," he said, "it's the income tax that picks the pockets of the working people of this state every single day and every single week, cutting into the size of their take-home pay, robbing them of disposable income that could be used to fuel our state's economy or maybe to increase savings, or, perhaps, put one of our children through college."
Mr. Rowland also added his voice to the chorus of legislators who have called for cutting the state's gasoline tax, at 39 cents the nation's highest, and said that the legislature should focus on cutting taxes the state imposes, a backhand swipe at those whose priority is the property tax, which is imposed by municipalities.
Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat of Hartford, said that he was surprised at the Governor's vehemence about the income tax. "He's setting up a collision on taxes," Mr. Ritter said, arguing that the Governor's insistence on cutting the income tax was fiscally imprudent.
"Any excess reserve we have is because of the income tax," Mr. Ritter said, a reference to recent reports that show the unexpected income tax revenue is largely responsible for the state's budget surplus.
State Senator Kevin B. Sullivan, the leader of the new Democratic majority in the Senate, added that the Governor's remarks about the income tax were likely the start of a full-fledged campaign to pressure the legislature on the issue.
In general, Democrats said they were struck more by what was absent from the speech than what was in it. In contrast to his speech a year ago, when Mr. Rowland made revitalizing the state's troubled cities a central subject of his budget address, today's address made no mention of urban policy.
Both Mr. Ritter and Mr. Sullivan said they were dismayed that Mr. Rowland did not discuss expanding poor families' access to early childhood education, a top Democratic initiative, and were disappointed that Mr. Rowland made only a passing reference to how the Governor and the Legislature should respond to an order from the State Supreme Court to desegregate the schools in the greater Hartford area.
Yet the tone of the speech was decidedly upbeat. And while Mr. Rowland, in the words of one Democrat, may have taken some "poetic license" with his pronouncements about the state's economy, few disagreed with Mr. Rowland's declaring a "Connecticut comeback."
Indeed, Cathy E. Minehan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in a speech Tuesday that the state's economy "is by many measures in the best shape it's been in nearly a decade."
While there are a host of explanations for the state's economic rebound, Mr. Rowland today offered his. "The Connecticut comeback is under way because we -- as a state -- have decided to reject the free-spending, high-tax ways of the 1980's," he said.
Mr. Rowland praised the bipartisan cooperation of the last two years that led to a $200 million income tax cut and held growth in spending to one of its lowest increases in more than 30 years. The budget he presents Feb. 5 will continue in that direction, he said.
"By the end of this session, everyone's taxes will be lower!" he promised
There already appears to be widespread support in the Legislature to cut the gas tax. While Mr. Rowland did not elaborate on how he would cut it, or how much, a bipartisan legislative task force recently recommended cutting it by 8 cents over the next few years.
The Connecticut gas tax, which Mr. Rowland referred to today as "highway robbery," has been raised several cents over the last year, an increase that was passed before Mr. Rowland took office in 1995. At 39 cents, it is much higher than in other Northeast states, with New York at 21.92 cents a gallon, New Jersey at 10.5 cents, Massachusetts at 21 cents and Rhode Island at 29 cents.
There would also appear to be backing for a proposal by Mr. Rowland to eliminate the state income tax on Social Security income, an idea that was put forward Tuesday as part of the Senate Democrats' agenda for the session.
And many legislators said today that Mr. Rowland's speech, with its promise of fiscal restraint, was an accurate reflection of the moderate mood in the Legislature, even if it offered little new.
State Senator George C. Jepsen, a Democrat of Stamford, remarked that despite the income tax-property tax debate between Mr. Rowland and the Democrats, there was still consensus about tax cuts. "We may be at opposite ends of the same page, but we're on the same page," he said.
State Senator William H. Nickerson, a Republican of Greenwich, said the speech's tone was to be expected. "He doesn't need to drop a bomb on this building to shake it up," Mr. Nickerson said. "The mood of the Legislature is already behind him."
And Mr. Nickerson observed that both parties were moving toward a consensus on fiscal policy. "Bill Clinton could have given that speech today," he said.
 
In His Own Words
 
GOV. JOHN G. ROWLAND
 
"I can make you two promises as I stand before you today:
By the end of this legislative session -- I'll be 40 years old. And I can tell you that I look and feel far older than that. Looking at the news last night, I could see a total difference in my hairline and hair color from the State of the State speech last year.
But, more importantly, by the end of this session everyone's taxes will be lower!
We must focus our efforts -- first -- on cutting the taxes that we impose as a state government. And the cuts we choose to make must benefit as many people as possible.
We all realize the gas tax increases approved by the previous administration are nothing less than highway robbery, and we will make cuts in the gas tax this session.
Our effort to cut the gas tax has got to be responsible, because while the roads and bridges of Connecticut are far better than they were 10 years ago, there is still some work to be done, and that work will continue.
And make no mistake, it's the income tax that picks the pockets of the working people of this state every single day and every single week, cutting into the size of their take-home pay, robbing them of disposable income that could be used to fuel our state's economy or maybe to increase savings, or, perhaps, put one of our children through college."

HEADLINE: Calls for Cuts in State Capitals

 BODY:
Saying that tax-cutting has helped reinvigorate the economies of both states, the governors of New York and Connecticut used their introductory addresses to their legislatures yesterday to urge the lawmakers to continue on that path to assure continued growth.
In his Albany address, Gov. George E. Pataki promised to send the state "roaring into the next century," and vowed to cut property taxes while increasing spending on schools. But Democrats reacted skeptically to his plans, expressing concern that continued tax cuts would only end up hurting education in the state. 
 The speech appeared to give Mr. Pataki some weaponry as he prepares for an expected re-election bid. By calling for property tax cuts, he could be hoping to undercut criticism that his previous cuts in state spending have placed a financial burden on localities.
Mr. Pataki also made a direct appeal to women, calling for tougher penalties in domestic violence cases, and he asked for rules that would assure longer hospital stays for women who have had mastectomies.
In Connecticut, the state's Republican Governor, John G. Rowland, also urged lawmakers to stay on a tax-cutting course. While he offered no new bold initiatives, he urged further cuts in the state's income tax, which was instituted by the previous administration.

HEADLINE: Pataki Vows Property Tax Cut and Rise in School Spending

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Setting an agenda with broad appeal to middle-class and suburban voters, Gov. George E. Pataki today vowed to cut property taxes while increasing the amount of money spent on school textbooks and computers.
In his third annual address to the Legislature, Mr. Pataki said he had a plan to induce school districts around the state to freeze and even reduce property taxes, though the specifics will have to wait until he releases his proposed budget next week. 
 His aides say the Governor's plan would offer the local districts more state money to make up for the loss of property tax revenue.
"Property taxes in New York State are too high," Mr. Pataki said. "The budget plan I will release next week will begin a multi year program to stop the continual increase in school taxes, reverse that trend and actually begin to lower these taxes for every homeowner."
But the Democrats who control the Assembly were quick to say that until they see the Republican Governor's budget, they will not be convinced that property taxes can be cut without hurting education.
"I welcome the Governor, his words, in concept," said the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat of Manhattan. "I await the details of his real property tax plan. But I won't accept a shell game."
Mr. Pataki's 58-minute speech offered several initiatives that fit neatly into potential gaps in his political armor. Indeed, Mr. Silver called it "a campaign speech" delivered in preparation for the 1998 governor's race.
The tax plan could blunt the charge by Democrats in the Legislature that the Governor is to blame for the rapid rise in property taxes in some localities since Mr. Pataki took office.
They argue that, to accommodate the income tax cuts that Mr. Pataki championed early in his administration, the state has not increased school aid fast enough to keep up with expenses, forcing local districts to raise property taxes.
But Mr. Pataki's message dealt with more than taxes. At a time when Republicans fare far better at the polls among men than women, the Governor appealed to the Legislature for tougher sentences and higher bail in domestic violence cases, and for longer hospital stays for women who have had mastectomies. Last year, the state mandated that new mothers be allowed at least two days in the hospital, not one.
And, like Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Pataki appears determined to make himself appear more friendly to the public schools. Last year, he proposed what he said was a slight increase in education money, but Democrats in the Legislature charged that at a closer look, it was a decrease. School spending was increased in the budget that was eventually enacted.
The Governor said that this year, he wanted to increase state aid to public schools, which stands at $10.2 billion this year, by $250 million. Much of that money would go toward keeping his promises to double state spending on textbooks, $114 million this year, and triple state spending on classroom computers, now $21 million, over several years. He also said that districts that cut administrative waste would be rewarded, but he did not elaborate.
Mr. Pataki spoke at some length about the Internet, calling it "a powerful and promising tool" for children.
"With private help, labor and volunteer support," he said, "let's pledge today that between now and the turn of the century, we will have a computer available for every student in every school. And that every student will know how to tap into its limitless resources."
But Louis Grumet, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association, said that he, like Mr. Silver, could not be confident until he saw the budget that the Governor's new tax and spending proposals would mean more aid to schools.
The Governor is expected to propose a budget keeping state spending at this year's level, about $65 billion, and he must close a gap estimated at $3 billion, so any new state spending on education would have to come out of other programs.
That could add tension to a legislative session that already promises to be as contentious as last year's, when the budget was passed 102 days late.
Mr. Pataki spoke at length on the achievements of the last two years, stating repeatedly that lower taxes and less business regulation had meant job growth in New York, which he and his aides have said is the ultimate measure of his performance.
He repeatedly cast taxation and big government as enemies not just of prosperity, but also of liberty, saying that his term will be remembered as a time "when freedom prevailed over bureaucracy."
But Mr. Silver charged that the Governor was taking credit that belonged to others for achievements ranging from lower crime to new rights for patients in managed-care programs, and he noted that New York still lags behind the nation as a whole in job growth.
"While the nation has been riding the train of economic recovery for the last two years," Mr. Silver said, "New York is still waiting at that station."
But Senator Joseph L. Bruno of Brunswick, leader of the Senate's Republican majority, said, "I really think the Governor did a remarkable job in putting together a vision, not just for the next couple of years, but literally to lead us into the 21st century."
The Governor urged the Legislature to adopt the proposal he made last year to overhaul welfare programs, which is expected to be one of the most acrimonious issues of the coming session.
A law passed last year by Congress and signed by President Clinton hands over much of the responsibility for setting welfare policy to the states, while mandating that, with some exceptions, families spend no more than five years on welfare.
Under the Governor's plan, each year a family remained on welfare, its benefits would shrink, to barely half the starting level in the fifth and final year. Cash payments to able-bodied, childless adults would be replaced with vouchers for food and shelter.
Mr. Pataki added a new feature today, a program employing welfare recipients to renovate derelict housing, teaching them building trades in the process. He did not say how it would be financed.
Mr. Pataki made a substantial shift in tone, if not in substance, on welfare, perhaps seeking to deflect charges of meanness from advocates for the poor.
In the past, he has derided New York's as the "Cadillac" of welfare systems, a wasteful burden on society and one that drew people to the state for its generous benefits.
Today, he said the true victims are welfare recipients. "The welfare system we are presiding over today is democracy's Berlin Wall," he said, separating "those who are free to pursue and follow opportunities and those who are denied even the chance."
Though he looked worn after staying up until 12:30 A.M. rehearsing his address, Mr. Pataki, dressed in his usual plain gray suit with a yellow tie, showed flashes of wit.
At one point, a state trooper fainted and fell against the Governor as he spoke, and had to be helped from the chamber.
"I didn't think the speech was that long," Mr. Pataki said. It was not clear why the trooper, whose name was not released, collapsed.
When Mr. Pataki's tax cut proposal drew booming applause and cheers from Republicans on the right side of the Assembly chamber but blank-faced silence from the Democrats on the left, he said, "It's great to see clapping from both sides."
 
In His Own Words
 
GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI
 
"We stand at the edge of a new era, a new century and a new millennium.
There is only one way to enter this new era. We must go roaring into the next century, bold, confident and determined, accepting every challenge that comes before us.
When future generations look back at this period in our state's history, they will recall these years as the years when hope prevailed over fear, when confidence prevailed over cynicism, when freedom prevailed over bureaucracy.
They will know these as the years when the Empire State, led by the irrepressible spirit of its people, roared back to life and laid the foundation for a brighter future.
The past two years have prepared us well for our passage into the 21st century.
A great shift of power has taken place, from the government back to the people. And because this historic transfer of power has taken place, the future of our state is in good hands. It is in the hands of the people."

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
From Co-Ops to Rentals To More Like Condos

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: EDGEWATER, N.J.

 BODY:
Built as a cooperative and then turned partly into rental housing, the Grand Cove complex will again be selling apartments next month -- this time to be more like a condominium.
Next month Greenthal Realty Partners, a Manhattan-based real estate and asset management firm, is to reopen sales at the two-building gated waterfront site on River Road in this Bergen County borough, not far from the George Washington Bridge. Some 56 of the 108 one- and two-bedroom apartments remain unsold. Shareholders changed the bylaws to be similar to those of a condo. Owners can buy and sell their units without board approval and will have more flexibility in subleasing them. 
 "Anything that will help sell the units is good," said Richard Dutton, president of the board. After the recession people generally "were left with a bad taste for co-ops" because they could not sell or rent their units, he added.
Greenthal also plans to sell the units, of 1,010 to 1,347 square feet, for $103,000 to $173,000 -- some $10,000 to $30,000 less than the original prices, and with financing for buyers. The apartments, now rented, will be offered first to tenants and then to the public as they become available, said Lance N. West, Greenthal's president. Monthly fees are $783 to $979.
The switch to sales comes 18 months after Greenthal bought for $8.4 million the unsold apartments and two mortgages at the nine-year-old development, which was pushed to the brink of foreclosure after the original sponsor defaulted on its loan in 1991.
Grand Cove also includes 51 town houses, a clubhouse and pool. All the town houses were sold before the market soured.
Since its purchase Greenthal has increased rents and consolidated and refinanced the loan. That has helped reduce monthly maintenance fees by 13 percent to their current level and to restore the co-op to fiscal health. Grand Cove's comeback, in many ways, echoes that of the Hudson waterfront in general and Edgewater's in particular.
New and revived housing projects are advancing up and down the 18-mile stretch of shoreline after a long slump. All told, some 5,000 residences could be built in the next three years, said Robert P. Antonicello, president of the ACI Group, a real estate company in Jersey City.
Most of the apartments are rentals as developers look to take advantage of a tightening market. The vacancy rate along the waterfront is under 5 percent, Mr. Antonicello said.
In Edgewater, three riverfront projects totaling 460 residences are under way or about to start. The largest is a 266-apartment rental now rising called the River Club.
This is Edgewater's "second chance," Mayor Bryan Christiansen said. He pointed to two retail projects that would also produce a total of more than 500,000 square feet of stores and a 14-screen movie complex. And the second half of the expansion to River Road, which runs along the river, could add more, he said, while musing over the possibility of a hotel on the former Hills Brothers coffee plant site.
"It has brought a new economic boom to Edgewater," Mayor Christiansen said of the construction activity which last year totaled $31 million. "A good portion of the tax base lost when industries left also has finally been replaced."
Of the reason his company decided to reactivate sales at Grand Cove, Mr. West said, "With the upward pressures on rents it makes sense to sell the units because the economics of home ownership justify buying rather than renting them."
That prospect is helped by signs that the sales climate in the Fort Lee area, which includes Edgewater, has improved for condos and co-ops. Last year 238 co-ops were sold at an average price of $85,457, up from 221 units sold at an average price of $76,952 in 1995. In that same time 300 condos were sold at an average price of $221,239, up from 198 sold at an average price of $193,385, according to the local office of Murphy Realty Better Homes and Gardens.
The supply of condos has been depleted and prices have risen, said Michele Kolsky-Assatly, a broker at Murphy Realty. "The next step for many buyers is co-ops," she said.
The preferred housing in suburban New Jersey remains the one-family home. Buyers here "have a coolness" to co-ops because they are used to getting a deed, not a proprietary lease, and buying an apartment, not shares in a corporation, said Benjamin Lambert, a Woodbridge-based lawyer who specializes in co-ops. There are 239,491 condos in New Jersey, compared with 27,636 co-ops, according to state figures.
The fiscal woes that arose after the mid-1980's boom deflated hurt co-ops, as did the restrictiveness of that form, he said, adding that more are doing what Grand Cove has done and blending the two forms.
Structuring Grand Cove as a condo will "offer more flexibility to buyers who may later choose to sell or rent their apartments," Mr. West said. That along with providing financing will make the project more competitive, he added.
Mr. Dutton agreed and added, "We will not recoup our full investment initially, but eventually values will rise."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Economic Weakness Abroad Spurs Rally in the Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied broadly yesterday as fresh signs of economic weakness overseas contrasted with surging stocks and bonds and generally upbeat economic news in the United States.
The dollar rose first against the Japanese yen in Asian trading after the Nikkei 225 stock index plunged more than 3 percent, bringing total losses for the first four trading days of 1997 to nearly 7 percent. 
 That weakness helped drive investment to American markets, lifting the Dow Jones industrials 76.19 points, to a record 6,625.67, and raising the United States 30-year Treasury bond slightly.
Those gains touched off heavy purchases of dollars for yen, currency traders said.
"What's most significant right now is the relative strength of the U.S. stock market compared to Japan," said Thomas Arnold, chief currency dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York. "There seems to be some sort of asset shift going on between the two countries."
Later in the session a report showing German unemployment had risen to a record high in December sent the dollar to a fresh two-year high against the German mark and a 30-month high versus the Swiss franc.
The dollar rose to 116.34 yen, from 115.76 late Wednesday, and to 1.5778 marks from 1.5743. The American currency rose to 1.3701 Swiss francs from 1.3655.
The British pound rose to $1.6955 from $1.6877. The dollar stood little changed at $1.3512 (Canadian) from $1.3513 (Canadian).
Despite its gains, the dollar failed to hold above 1.58 marks and many traders cited rumors that European central banks had intervened in the market to sell dollars at that level.
As the mark weakens against its European counterparts, exports from other European countries become more expensive, prompting official concern. Traders said there were rumors that central banks were selling dollars at 1.58 marks.
Traders also said an overnight report that Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin had reiterated his oft-stated desire for a "strong" dollar helped bolster the dollar.
Several Japanese officials publicly warned earlier in the week that the dollar was rising too quickly against the yen, fueling sharp dollar losses.

HEADLINE: Semiconductor Index Fell in December

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Jan. 9

 BODY:
The computer chip industry's monthly book-to-bill ratio, which measures demand, fell to 1.10 in December from November's revised 1.16.
The Semiconductor Industry Association said the decline was caused by a 2.9 percent drop in new orders. Bookings fell to $3.87 billion in December from $3.98 billion a month earlier. 
 The ratio compares the value of chips shipped in the North American market with the value of new orders received. A ratio of 1.10 means that for every $100 in chips shipped, $110 in new orders were received.
Analysts said the decline in the ratio was expected because November is traditionally the strongest month of the year as personal computer makers gear up for the expected holiday rush.
November's ratio was revised up from 1.15.
This month's figure was the final book-to-bill report. The association is dropping it in favor of a measure that better reflects the industry's conditions worldwide, rather that just North America. The association calculated the ratio since 1978. The first report of the new measure, called the Global Billings Report, is scheduled later this month.
Orders for December, based on a three-month rolling average, fell 23 percent from the $5.01 billion reported in December 1995. Billings rose 2.7 percent, to $3.52 billion, from $3.43 billion in November. The month's shipments were 21 percent lower than in the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: U.S. Prosecutors in 6 Cities File Charges of Smuggling Refrigeration Gas

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Federal authorities today charged more than a dozen people and businesses with smuggling into the United States a refrigerant that is banned because it damages the Earth's protective layer of atmospheric ozone.
Clinton Administration officials also vowed to expand their crackdown on illegal imports of the refrigerant chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, including the type commonly known by the brand name Freon. Such smuggling has been increasing since the United States, in keeping with an environmental treaty, banned imports and the production of such ozone-depleting chemicals a year ago. 
 A lively and lucrative black market has sprung up, with canisters of gaseous CFC's sold to dealers and service stations that use the chemical mostly to refill air-conditioners in automobiles made before 1994. There is a two-year supply of legal CFC's in the United States, but after that runs out, older cars will need to be modified to use an environmentally benign alternative.
The charges were filed by prosecutors in Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, San Diego and Savannah, Ga.
In the biggest case, the owner of Refrigerant Management Services Inc., R. Colin Dayton of Bryn Mawr, Pa., was indicted along with several other people, accused of having smuggled about 1.5 million pounds of the refrigerant into the United States in 1994 and 1995. The activity earned profits of $1 million and deprived the Government of excise taxes of $7 million, according to an indictment.
A lawyer for Mr. Dayton, Stanley Arkin, said that the charges were totally unfounded and that they were based on allegations by people under prosecution who were seeking to implicate others falsely.
"This is a trendy prosecution with no substance," Mr. Arkin said.
A typical car uses two or three pounds of the gas, worth $12 to $15 a pound, in its air-conditioning system.
The United States Customs Commissioner, George J. Weise, said that there had been a "dramatic shift" in smuggling from the Miami region to the border with Mexico and that some big smuggling rings appeared to involve Russian organized crime. Other major sources of supply, Mr. Weise said, include India and China.
The indictment in San Diego is that district's 10th case involving the apparent smuggling of CFC's across the Mexican border, and a case filed in Houston was one of several similar prosecutions.
Eighteen people have been convicted of smuggling the chemicals, mostly as a result of a crackdown in the Miami region, and prison terms of up to 57 months have been imposed, along with big fines.
One and one-half million pounds of CFC's have been confiscated, but officials estimated that 20 million pounds illegally crossed into the United States last year.
Although the chemicals end up in cars, motorists are unlikely to share in the smuggling profits. Instead, they are likely to pay full price for the refrigerant, with middlemen reaping the profits. Service stations and distributors are sometimes unaware that the chemicals that they are buying are illegal, officials said.
Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news conference today: "To people who service cars or distribute refrigerants, we say: 'If you're offered something at a price that seems too good to be true, it probably is. Please alert the E.P.A. or your local F.B.I. office if you see such situations.'
"And to CFC smugglers, we say: 'We're going to find you. We will shut you down. We're going to shut down this black market.' "

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Protest From a Member

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In the mail comes an invitation to a conference sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations. In news stories, the council's name is usually preceded by "prestigious," "elite" or "influential," and all three are correct.
The title of the two-day conference, in April, is "From Bicycles to Beepers: The Politics and Economics of Business in China." 
 Seminars and workshops will be held on opportunities for investment in the provinces, the future of U.S.-Chinese relations, taxes and accounting, and such specified targeted investment subjects as banking, securities, computers, telecommunications, power and energy, "joint ventures and strategic alliances" and textiles and manufacturing. The fee is $500 for non-members, $250 for members or employees of companies with corporate membership.
Two things about the meeting trouble me. One is in the list of subjects. A few are broad but most seem remarkably like how-to courses. As a member, I do not think it befits the council to help investment in the world's most brutal and dangerous dictatorship.
The second is not on the agenda. When I asked who was paying for the conference, the answer came that much of the money is from American businesses operating in China.
Well, sir, I said, this strikes me as a conflict of interest -- taking money to hold a conference on China trade from companies already in business there and hardly likely to raise such questions as government blackmail, official corruption, slave labor, religious persecution and other matters that might be of interest to Americans contemplating investment in China.
I was told the council would not allow company support to dictate the discussion. Also: If the corporations had not come through, the council could not have afforded the meeting.
I have been a member for 34 years, one of 3,265 other prestigious, elite and influential Americans, among them foreign-affairs specialists, businessmen, former government officials and journalists. Meetings usually are held under the rule that what is said cannot be attributed to anybody.
Now, nobody worth listening to is fool enough to tell a chamber full of people any great secret. But often I profited intellectually from the speakers and discussion. Eventually this helped me journalistically, and thus was of trickle-down benefit to the entire nation.
So I did not want to be rude enough to say that the rationalization for taking money from China-trade companies was the same dreary excuse that journalists, politicians and academics give when they let money create the reality or appearance of conflict of interest. Listen, it won't influence me and I need the money for the good of my work.
But I managed to overcome politesse and said I would print my objections. I rule that the confidentiality condition does not apply to public invitations.
The council, I was reminded, had held similar business-focused meetings on the Mideast, South Africa and other regions. But the meeting on the Mideast did not include Iraq or Libya and the session on South Africa was held after the defeat of apartheid. Also: I had not known that those meetings were sponsored by companies doing business in the regions involved.
The International Herald Tribune goes further. It holds conferences on doing business in China with financial help from companies in the trade -- and also lists the Chinese Government State Commission for Reconstructing the Economic System as co-convener. I doubt the two newspapers that own The I.H.T. would do that themselves -- The Washington Post and The New York Times.
Why pick on the council or I.H.T. when so many think tanks take money from foundations that try to and do influence their agenda or from companies that have commercial interest in what is studied?
Reminds me of when the writer Nick Pileggi called me years ago to say The Times was taking dozens of free baseball tickets every day and, for a story he was doing, how come. I said it was impossible. But the sports editor delightedly told me it was true. He gave them to the printers to get sports copy moved fast.
We stopped it that day. But I grumbled to my colleagues that somebody was always picking on The Times. Then I reminded myself of the reason and I did not feel bad at all. We are prestigious, elite and influential, that's why.

HEADLINE: Triumph Turns Sour for Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH and DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
This should be a time of triumph for a political fund-raiser like Marvin S. Rosen, who as finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee over the last 16 months was responsible for designing the machine that raised $120 million and helped to insure President Clinton's re-election.
Instead, Mr. Rosen, a Florida lawyer whose firm maintains a Washington lobbying office, has had his records at Democratic headquarters subpoenaed by a Federal grand jury, and he is seen little in Washington. His former colleagues are blaming him for some of the fund-raising problems that have engulfed the party and forced the return of $1.5 million in questionable donations. 
 The organization that Mr. Rosen took over with the help of powerful friends in the Democratic Party is now under investigation by the Justice Department and Congress in connection with questionable donations from foreigners and foreign companies and offering access to the White House in exchange for big campaign contributions.
And as questions continue to surface about the Democrats' fund-raising practices, there are indications that Mr. Rosen may have pushed ethical limits in his law practice and business dealings.
Mr. Rosen was accused by Federal regulators of unethical practices that contributed to the failure of a Florida savings and loan he had represented and helped to finance in the 1980's. His Miami law firm, Greenberg, Traurig, Hoffman, Lipoff, Rosen & Quintel, settled the case five years ago by paying $8.15 million to the Resolution Trust Corporation, which oversaw the industry bailout.
Mr. Rosen was among a number of lawyers whose political connections were highlighted several years ago in a controversy that led to stricter regulations for the selection of law firms for state work in New Jersey. Although Mr. Rosen's firm was in Florida, it was awarded lucrative New Jersey bond work after he raised campaign money for former Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat.
In many ways, Mr. Rosen represents the dozens of lawyers and lobbyists who are the chief generators of money for both Democratic and Republican candidates. They are behind-the-scenes deal makers whose personal and business interests are often intertwined with those of the politicians they court. They are players in a world where money, more than ever, means access. And politicians, desperate for funds as campaign costs skyrocket, have come to view them as indispensable.
Mr. Rosen said today that he had accepted the job at the Democratic National Committee purely because of his belief in the party's agenda. "It's a corny answer, but I truly felt the Republican agenda would be so extreme that it was vital to keep President Clinton in office," he said in an interview.
And he said that he had never lobbied public officials or sought to trade on his fund-raising activities to get help for his clients. "I never called any public official to discuss my client matters," he said.
Mr. Rosen's reputation as a master fund-raiser was a major factor in Mr. Clinton's decision to approve him for the party's top finance position in 1995, as the Presidential race was about to begin in earnest. Mr. Rosen won the post with major support from his longtime friend, Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Rosen has been a prolific fund-raiser for Senator Kennedy.
Because of his long experience as a Democratic fund-raiser, Mr. Rosen said, no one looked into his background and legal practice before he was offered the unpaid post.
The savings and loan case "wasn't even on my radar screen," he said, adding that the accusations were false and that he had done nothing improper. Mr. Rosen's problems with Federal regulators began in 1989, after the failure of the Royal Palm Savings Bank of Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Rosen had been an organizer of the savings and loan in 1983 and was also a shareholder and its lawyer. Like other savings institutions that failed in the 1980's, Royal Palm rose swiftly with the booming economy and failed abruptly as imprudent loans and other management failures left it too weak to withstand an economic slump.
When Federal regulators took over, they found a tangle of what they said were improper loans and stock transactions, and they said some of the problems were the fault of Mr. Rosen, his law firm, Greenberg, Traurig, and two other lawyers in the firm.
In a complaint first filed in Federal court in Miami by Royal Palm's board, the directors said that Mr. Rosen and two other lawyers at his firm had been involved in serious conflicts of interest over several years. The Resolution Trust Corporation took over the lawsuit when it became the receiver for the failed savings and loan in 1989.
Harvey Kurzweil, a New York lawyer who handled the suit for the Resolution Trust Corporation, said this week that Mr. Rosen had been named in the lawsuit because he had been the principal lawyer for Royal Palm, having brought the account to Greenberg, Traurig when he joined the firm in the mid-1980's.
The lawsuit said Mr. Rosen and his law firm withheld information from the saving and loan's board of directors and that Mr. Rosen had a conflict of interest because he had personally borrowed $750,000 from the institution's chairman while serving as its lawyer. An analysis by Federal regulators in 1992 said that Mr. Rosen had also prepared stock offering documents and reports for regulators that inflated Royal Palm stock prices. The analysis said Mr. Rosen then sold his own stock in the savings and loan at a profit.
Mr. Rosen denied the allegations today. "I never sold my stock or profited from it," he said. "Substantially all of my holdings in Royal Palm were held until the end and never sold. The basis of the allegation was the transfer of the stock to a brokerage account, so I could borrow money, but I never sold it."
He added, "I never prepared any stock offering for the savings and loan and never aided in any regulatory reports being filed."
Many of the allegations centered on the activities of two other lawyers under Mr. Rosen's supervision, according to the lawsuit. One of those lawyers received $49 million in inadequately secured loans, the regulators said.
In all, the Resolution Trust Corporation sought damages of $38 million from Mr. Rosen's law firm. After three years of negotiations, the regulators settled for the cash payment by the firm of $8.15 million. Mr. Rosen said, "There is not an ounce of truth in any of this stuff and the lawsuit was settled because our legal fees were tremendous."
At the time Mr. Rosen's career seemed unaffected and his legal practice was thriving.
"He understood what people wanted and was able to deliver it to them," said Byron L. Sparber, a partner of Rosen's at his previous law firm. "If someone needed a business partner, he could find them. He has a tremendous talent as a matchmaker, and that was perhaps his unique capacity."
Mr. Rosen had joined Mr. Sparber's firm when he arrived in Miami in the 1977 but moved to the fast-growing Greenberg, Traurig, now one of Miami's largest law firms, early in 1980's. "It had more political presence," Mr. Sparber said. "It was a more mature firm. Perhaps a faster horse to ride."
At Greenberg, Traurig, Mr. Rosen developed an expertise in municipal bond finance, which meant courting and contributing to local politicians, first in Miami and later in New Jersey and other places.
And he was moving from local to national politics, serving as Florida chairman of Senator Kennedy's Presidential primary campaign in 1980, and raising money for his Senate re-election campaign in 1982. In 1983, he signed up as a fund-raiser for Walter F. Mondale's Presidential primary campaign and was finance chairman for the Presidential campaign of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.
By 1992, Mr. Rosen was so highly sought-after that Mr. Clinton personally telephoned to ask for his help. Mr. Rosen's fund raising for Mr. Clinton earned him a spot on the stage at the President's inauguration in 1993. Mr. Rosen quickly sought to capitalize on his prominence by opening a lobbying office for his firm in Washington. Among the people he hired for the office were Michael Brown, the son of then-Commerce Secretary Ron H. Brown, and Victoria Kennedy, Senator Kennedy's wife.
Mr. Rosen's move into the finance chairman's office at the Democratic National Committee in 1995 was a natural next step. He was in charge of the President's birthday fund-raiser in Manhattan, which brought in more than $10 million.
Some of Mr. Rosen's associates at the committee said that he made most decisions by himself and rarely held strategy sessions with senior officials. Previously, veteran fund-raisers and staff members might have kept an eye on each other, some of them said.
For instance, few said they had ever met John Huang, the fund-raiser who brought in millions of dollars from American-Asians, and whose activities are now a central issue in the Federal investigation. Mr. Huang, they said, reported directly to Mr. Rosen.
In his position, Mr. Rosen also attended some of the White House coffee meetings with donors whose contributions are now under scrutiny.
Mr. Rosen described his job as ceremonial, and said he did not have direct supervisory responsibility. He said he stopped actively practicing law when he took the job, but did not sever his ties with his firm.
His connections to top politicians remained useful to the firm's clients.
One of them, Carlos Herrera Jr., said today that he was able to get a meeting with Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena last April 3 after meeting Mr. Pena at a fund-raising party at Senator Kennedy's home in Virginia. Mr. Rosen had helped to arrange the party.
Mr. Herrera is the president of a Florida company that is seeking to lead a $1 billion redevelopment of Homestead Air Base south of Miami. The project, opposed by environmentalists, requires Federal approval. Mr. Herrera said he had discussed it several times with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Most recently, he said, he raised the issue with Mr. Clinton at a fund-raising event in Miami last spring that had been set up by Mr. Rosen and the Democratic National Committee. Before the party. Mr. Herrera contributed $75,000 to the Democrats.
Mr. Herrera said he first made his case to the President at a private White House breakfast in 1994. "When I first met the President I had not contributed a penny," he said. "Any politician who would listen without me giving him a penny gets a lot of respect. Then I did contribute as much as I could."

HEADLINE: Producer Data Show Inflation Still Moderate

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Producer prices rose more than expected during December, the Government reported today, but when the cost of energy and food was excluded, the increase was below forecasts.
The Labor Department said that producer prices over all grew half a percent in the month, exceeding analysts' expectations of a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent and above November's increase of four-tenths of 1 percent. However, the so-called core rate, which excludes the energy and food categories, rose only one-tenth of 1 percent, below the forecast of a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The small rise in the core rate, which is watched closely because prices for energy and food are especially volatile, cheered the financial markets by adding to speculation that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates soon. The good news on inflation helped to send the Dow jones industrial average up 76.19 points, to 6,625.67.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Michael H. Moskow -- a voting member of the Fed's policy-making committee -- said today that "we should have another year of respectable growth with low inflation and low unemployment."
In the full year, producer prices rose 2.8 percent, faster than 1995's 2.3 percent increase and the biggest annual gain since 1990, when the Persian Gulf crisis pushed up oil prices. The core rate rose only six-tenths of 1 percent in 1996, well below 1995's 2.6 percent increase and the second-smallest yearly gain on record.
In another report today, the Labor Department said first-time claims for state unemployment insurance fell last week to 361,000 from 374,000 a week earlier, the largest decline since mid-October.
 Today's inflation report showed that producer energy prices, which account for 13.6 percent of the Producer Price Index for finished goods, rose 3.1 percent during December -- the biggest gain in a year. However, wholesale food prices, which make up 22.8 percent of the index, decreased one-tenth of 1 percent. Wholesale auto prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent, as did wholesale tobacco costs.
 The question is whether rising oil prices will lead to higher costs for other goods. Mr. Moskow of the Chicago Fed said he did not expect that to happen.
In a speech Wednesday night in New York, the Fed's vice chairwoman, Alice M. Rivlin, said, "It's hard to remember any time when the overall economic situation looked so good." The economy, she said, showed "no clear signs of overheating or serious imbalance."
The White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said today that the Clinton Administration was focusing on the core rate component of the Producer Price Index "because a large part of the increase reported is due to the home heating oil and gasoline price increases." Given that, he said, the President was not particularly concerned.
To be sure, some prices have moved higher since December. The price of oil for February delivery has climbed back above $26 a barrel from the low $20 range a month ago. And the Goldman, Sachs & Company industrial metals commodity index has increased about 2 percent since the end of December.

HEADLINE: R. L. Nelson, 70, Pioneer In the Study of Philanthropy

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Ralph L. Nelson, an innovative Queens College professor who helped harness the science of getting to illuminate the practice of giving, died on Jan. 1 at his home in Manhasset, L.I. He was 70 and widely regarded as a father of the economic study of philanthropy.
His family said the cause was a heart attack. 
 Never mind that American philanthropy is a $500 billion-a-year industry, drawing $150 billion a year in charitable donations and providing indispensible support for myriad religious, educational, medical and other causes.
Until recently, economists gave charity short shrift, and for good reason. For one thing, of course, for a field devoted to the study of the creation and acquisition of wealth, the very idea of giving it away seemed downright subversive.
Then, too, until Dr. Nelson came along, the few economists who were interested in philanthropy had virtually nothing to work with, specifically no measure of who gave how much to which charities under what circumstances.
That is because there is no Government clearing house to tally annual giving, for example, and because tax records of deductible contributions are not tabulated and reported until years after the fact.
So in 1984, Dr. Nelson, already a pioneer in the economics of philanthropy, created a complex economic model based on survey data and other variables to produce annual estimates of current donations.
The figures, published annually by the American Association of Fund Raising Counsel, are regarded as so reliable and so indispensable to researchers that they have become the philanthropic equivalent of official Government estimates of employment, inflation and other economic factors.
They have also helped spawn an entire new branch of economics. As recently as the 1960's, only a handful of economists specialized in charities. Today, hundreds are working on research projects that would simply not have been possible before the Nelson model.
Among other things, researchers using Nelson data have established that high tax rates, year-end stock rallies and Republican control of White House all stimulate charitable contributions, as do Government cutbacks in social-service financing -- although never enough to make up for the shortfall.
By the time he helped establish the economics of philanthropy, Dr. Nelson was an old hand at switching gears.
A native of St. Paul, he was majoring in electrical engineering at the University of Minnesota when he decided that the hard science was far too predictable and much too boring. Seeking a greater challenge, he switched to economics, perhaps the squishiest science of them all.
After obtaining a master's and a doctorate from Columbia, he specialized in industrial organization and held a series of teaching posts before settling in at Queens College in 1964.
A 1967 assignment from the Russell Sage Foundation to study the investment policies of foundations helped alter the course of his work and led to a key appointment as consultant to the Filer Commission on Private Philanthropy, whose landmark 1975 report helped point up the inadequacies of philanthropic statistics.
Known as man of unbending integrity who believed foundations had a moral obligation to spend their tax-exempt dollars well, Dr. Nelson was a meticulous researcher who never trusted computer printouts quite as much as the figures he had written down himself on a yellow tablet.
"Give him a spreadsheet," a colleague said, "and he would check every cell." There was no reason, the colleague added, to check Dr. Nelson's figures. "They were always right."
For all his standing in a field he helped create, Dr. Nelson was a modest, unassuming man with such a sure sense of priorities that when a news conference to publicize his findings conflicted with a teaching assignment, he invariably passed up the limelight for the classroom.
As a spcecialist in philanthropy, Dr. Nelson was more than a cold-eyed professional. He believed in charity so much, his wife said, that he gave far more of his income than the 2 percent that has long been the national average.
He gave generously to the headquarters of the Unitarian Universalist Association in Boston; far less to his local congregation. As his wife noted, because of a long-ago bequest of mineral rights on some German land where oil was later discovered, the little church has an endowment of more than $100 million.
At the time of his death, the man who believed money should be husbanded carefully and well was the church treasurer.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, David, of New Orleans; a daughter, Rachel Moeller of Allentown, Pa., and a grandson.

HEADLINE: Pataki Vows To End Taxes On Inheritance

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki today proposed a three-year plan to end most of the state's taxes on gifts and inheritances, adding them to a rapidly growing list of tax-cut proposals on the Legislature's agenda before budget negotiations have even begun.
Minutes after Mr. Pataki's announcement, the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, said he expected to push for a plan later this year to reduce or abolish the state's 4 percent sales tax on clothing costing less than $500. But Mr. Silver, a Democrat of Manhattan, said he would not formally endorse such a plan until he studied the results of a one-week suspension of the sales tax on clothing that begins on Jan. 18. 
 Mr. Pataki released his estate tax proposal a day after advocating using state funds to freeze or reduce local property taxes. And it came just two weeks after leaders of the Republican-controlled State Senate unveiled a multiyear plan to reduce property and business taxes by more than $2 billion.
The plan Mr. Pataki announced today would eliminate most state taxes on estates left behind by New York State residents after they die. Currently, the state imposes taxes of 2 to 21 percent on estates worth more than $115,000 -- or $365,000 if they include a home -- one of the nation's highest rates. (There are no taxes on estates left to spouses if they are United States citizens.)
The abundance of tax-reduction proposals being advanced by the leadership of both parties makes it increasingly likely that Albany will agree to some new tax cuts in the coming year, even though they must find ways to close a projected $3 billion shortfall in the state's $65 billion budget. None of the leaders have explained how they would pay for their plans, and critics have warned that new cuts could leave a gaping hole in the budget if the economy turns sour.
The Governor also urged today that the state raise its lifetime exemption on gift taxes to $600,000 from the current $115,000. Under that plan, the state would allow a person to give up to $600,000 in gifts in his lifetime without imposing state gift taxes.
The Governor's plan would reduce state revenues by $10 million in the fiscal year that begins on April 1 and by $400 million when fully phased in by mid-1999. Mr. Pataki also proposed setting aside $50 million in the 1997-98 budget for business tax cuts that would be determined through negotiations with the Legislature.
The Governor said New York's high estate taxes had driven many people to retire in other states, though he could provide no statistics to bolster that claim. "It's not just the weather that makes people go to Florida or Arizona," he said.
He also contended that reducing the estate taxes would, over time, expand the state's tax base by keeping more people in New York so that the state could continue collecting income, sales and eventually estate taxes from them. Mr. Pataki said his plan would eliminate taxes on 85 percent of the 22,000 estates that are charged state taxes each year.
But the Governor flatly declined to explain how he would pay for his latest tax-cut proposal, saying those details would be in the budget he expected to unveil on Tuesday. He has also not explained how he would pay for his property tax proposal, which his aides have estimated would cost the state several hundred million dollars over five years.
Similarly, Mr. Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, have not explained in detail how they would finance their proposals. Mr. Silver said today that he thought that abolishing the state's sales tax on clothing items costing less than $500, which would cost the state more than $400 million a year, would eventually pay for itself by generating additional business for New York stores that have been losing out to competitors in nearby lower-tax states.
Mr. Bruno, a Republican of Rensselaer County, said his tax-cut plan, which calls for freezing local property taxes, phasing out a utility tax and eliminating a host of smaller business taxes, would also spur new economic activity, generating new jobs and taxes.
But critics of new tax cuts, mainly urban Democrats and unions, said that, if anything, the Legislature should be thinking about increasing taxes on the wealthy to pay for essential services like education and health care.
"We all want prosperity and fairer taxes, but not at the expense of services people depend upon," said Stephen Madarasz, a spokesman for the Civil Service Employees Association, a public workers' union. State Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat, said, "I think the tax fever has abated for everybody but Albany politicians."
But estate lawyers said Mr. Pataki's plan would benefit people on both ends of the economic spectrum. Though a person inheriting an estate worth hundreds of millions of dollars would stand to save millions, people with estates worth a few hundred thousand dollars -- the value of a typical suburban home -- would also save tens of thousands of dollars under the proposal.

HEADLINE: Producer Data Help Initiate A Stock Rally

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose to new highs yesterday, propelled in large part by an inflation report that caused short- and long-term interest rates to fall sharply.
Led by oil stocks, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 76.19 points, to 6,625.67, the third closing high it has set this year. Earlier in the session, the Dow was up nearly 108 points. 
 According to analysts at Birinyi & Associates, a market research firm, four big computer-driven program trades were responsible for 66 points of the Dow's advance.
But the advance was not relegated to the bluest of blue-chip stocks. Broader market indexes also registered strong gains.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 6.44 points, to 754.85, and the New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 3.33 points, to 398.58, a level slightly less than its closing high of 398.86.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.85 points, to 1,326.20, and the American Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.02, to 581.74.
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 1,632 to 957. Volume was heavy, at 555.37 million shares.
Analysts said that the catalyst for the rally was a Government report showing that producer prices remained largely in check during December.
While the one-half of 1 percent increase in the Producer Price Index was higher than expected, stock and bond traders seemed to focus more closely on the "core" rate, which excludes the food and energy prices that are given to sharp swings. That rate rose by just one-tenth of 1 percent.
Stock prices have been closely tracking movements in the bond market, where interest rates have risen sharply on fears of stronger economic growth and higher inflation.
But the rise in interest rates in the last three days was virtually erased yesterday; the yield for the Treasury's 30-year bond yield fell to 6.75 percent, from 6.84 percent on Wednesday.
Stocks have not been troubled by the recent increase in energy costs. The rise reflected in yesterday's producer price figures did generate interest, but for bullish reasons.
"The stock market is taking note of rising oil prices, figuring they will push up profits at the oil companies," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers.
"I am very bullish on energy, but while rising oil prices are good for profits at oil and oil-service companies, they will be a negative on profitability elsewhere."
The advance by oil companies was led by Exxon, which gained $3.375 a share, to $102.875, Texaco, up $3 a share, to $105, and Mobil, which rose $2.50, to $128.625.
But most energy stocks did extremely well. The S.& P. 500's list of large oil companies recorded its biggest one-day gain in four years, jumping more than 4 percent.
Oil prices eased slightly yesterday, but at $26.37 a barrel they remain at their highest levels since January 1991.
And while stock traders appear to believe the worst of the rise in oil prices is over, analysts who are pessimistic about the market's prospects said they were concerned about a surge in commodity price inflation.
"Oil inventories are very low, and demand is strong," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company.
"I think this will be the first of many surprises on the upside in commodity inflation," he said. "So far the market has ignored that possibility, but it is something I think it will have to face."
The big market move came the day before December employment data are released, figures that tend to roil financial markets. But the stock market closed its books yesterday in an apparently ebullient mood.
"Both the stock and the bond market are saying the employment figures will show an economy that is growing but not overheating," said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
Mr. Goldman said that yesterday's rally left stock prices vulnerable to a report that indicatess that payroll employment grew at a more rapid rate in December than the consensus forecast of around 200,000 jobs.
"If the numbers are stronger than that, the market could go down," he said. "But the Dow is up about 400 points in the last month and is entitled to a pause. And if it does decline, I am going to look at it as a buying opportunity. We are in a bull market, and bull markets go up."

VW to Pay $100 Million To G.M. to Settle Lawsuit
Volkswagen agreed to pay $100 million to General Motors to settle a lawsuit contending that a former top VW executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, stole trade secrets when he left G.M. The settlement brings to an end a four-year feud between two of the world's largest car companies.
In the agreement, one of the biggest in a corporate espionage case, Volkswagen also agreed to buy at least $1 billion worth of auto parts from the American company over the next seven years. While not admitting any wrongdoing, VW also said that it "acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities" by Mr. Lopezmight have occurred. [Page A1.]
 
Hughes Bids May Top $10 Billion
The two bids for the military businesses of Hughes Electronics are likely to come to perhaps $10 billion, but will hinge less on their face value than tax considerations and estimates of the future value of the stock of the winning company. The bidders, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman, have both submitted packages that come to 500 pages each. [D2.]
 
Producer Prices Rise
Producer prices rose more than expected during December, but when the cost of energy and food was excluded, the increase was below forecasts. Prices were up half a percent over all, but they rose only one-tenth of a percent without the two volatile categories. [D2.]
 
Liggett Seeks Broader Settlement
The Liggett Group, which shocked the rest of the tobacco industry last March by breaking ranks and agreeing to settle several major lawsuits, is now trying to reach an even broader settlement, according to lawyers familiar with the talks. [A16.]

The Agony of Finishing Second
Ikon Office Solutions, a giant office equipment and technology company with a new name, is urging those who consider business a battle to "Work to win." The company hopes the theme of its $50 million campaign will cut through the technological clutter of office supply advertising. And it will do that with humorous views of the downside of not finishing first. One ad shows a dinosaur skeleton, declaring, "Second place, evolution." Another ad shows a statue of Lenin being pulled from its pedestal; the headline is "Second place, cold war."

Stocks Sell Off in Japan, And Worst May Not Be Over

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Jan. 10

 BODY:
For close to five years, Japan's troubled markets, like its economy, have been trying to climb out of a pit, only to slip back over and over. This week's market drops -- a 10 percent fall for the main market index, including a 3 percent plunge on Thursday and nearly that much again this morning -- suggest that the slide may be far from over.
After falling on Wednesday, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index plunged 606.51 points, or 3.25 percent, on Thursday and closed today at 770.22 points -- 4.26 percent -- to 17,303.65, its lowest level in more than a year. The frenzied selling surprised even stock market bears and fueled jitters that policy makers were not taking effective measures to turn around the nation's faint economy. 
 "As we left our offices on Dec. 30, we had a faint glimmer of hope," said Douglas E. Weirens, head of equity trading at Lehman Brothers Japan, "but after this week, people are thinking that this is going to get ugly. We've had a huge down week, and it has the investment community sitting in shock."
Analysts cited a number of reasons for the long-struggling market's sudden drop, but one stood out: accumulating evidence that the Japanese economy was likely to remain too weak to expand out of the troubles that have weighed down banks and other financial institutions.
Recently, the Government forecast that the economy would grow 1.9 percent in 1997, its lowest forecast since the end of World War II. Some private economists have been more pessimistic, raising the possibility of a slide back into recession.
Added to worries about a weak yen and cuts in public spending, the result has been a spiral of selling, in which worries about the strength of banks in particular, leads to selloffs that further weaken those banks.
Nor is help likely to come from overseas. American investors began pulling money out of Japanese markets last year, particularly mutual funds specializing in Japan, which ranked as the worst-performing category of funds in 1996,
Since trading opened for the new year on Monday, Japanese policy makers have been trying to nudge the bond, currency and stock markets up with optimistic comments. The yen on Monday weakened here beyond 117 to the dollar, its lowest since March 1993, and the declining currency trend has led many to sell their yen-denominated investments, like Japanese stocks and bonds.
The yen has since edged back up to around 116 against the dollar, in part after Tadashi Ogawa, the Finance Ministry's highest-level bureaucrat, reassured the markets earlier this week by saying that a weak yen would not help the economy.
Concerned by tumbling stocks, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka emerged on Wednesday to say that the ministry would "keep a close eye on developments in the market."
After stocks fell again on Thursday, Mr. Ogawa tried to brush aside growing fears that the Government was hurting the economy by trying to rein in the budget deficit. "The Japanese economy is moving in a firm direction, out of the situation where it needed support from a huge amount of public investment," he said.
However, Japan's economic planner seemed to rule out Government intervention in the stock market today. "Interference by authorities will contradict the ongoing deregulation moves," said Taro Aso, director general of the Economic Planning Agency.
Financial shares have been taking the worst beating these last few weeks. The selloff has pushed the shares of some banks, which are struggling to dispose of billions of dollars in sour loans, to precarious levels. And since the Finance Ministry shut down Hanwa Bank, a failing regional institution, investors have focused on other financially pressed banks, sending their shares, and those of the industry, down.
"Investors are worried about the system over all, especially if interest rates start rising," said James P. Fiorillo of ING Baring Securities. "What's going on is a vicious cycle."
As investors dump financial stocks, depressing their prices, this impairs the banks' already thin capital base. And as the capital base weakens, investors no longer want to hold the stocks, and this selling further depresses the shares.
Japanese banks are trying to maintain an international standard of minimum capital of 8 percent of outstanding loans. To do that, they have relied in part on unrealized profits from portfolio shareholdings they bought years ago at much lower prices. But the lower the market drops, the smaller the unrealized profits become and the closer the banks come to slipping below the 8 percent capital standard.
In fact, the nation's banks are making headway in disposing of the bad real estate loans. But they face dim prospects for the future: loan demand is weak, profits from bond trading are dipping, and steady or rising interest rates erase some of the profit they make on lending.
Analysts say that another big reason for the market selloff is that some financial institutions seem to be trying to lock in profits before the fiscal year ends on March 31 by selling their cross-shareholdings, stakes held in friendly companies, which in turn assume shares in the institution.
The market is unlikely to be bolstered by foreign hedge funds, which have pulled out money the last few weeks.
And in 1996, American mutual funds that invest in the Japanese market were the worst performing of 44 categories of funds tracked by Morningstar, losing 11 percent on average and leading many American investors to withdraw their money.
The Japan fund managed by Scudder suffered net outflows of more than $90 million in the first 11 months of 1996, roughly 16 percent of the $550 million in assets with which it began the year.
These came as Americans put a record $28.7 billion into all international stock funds in the first 11 months of the year, much of it into other Pacific Rim countries. According to Morningstar, mutual funds specializing in Pacific markets other than Japan gained 12.4 percent on average last year.
But while the overall Japanese market picture may be grim, the prospects for blue-chip exporters like Toyota and Canon still seem bright. Indeed, their stock prices have held steady or even risen.
This has given some optimism to some market contrarians like Neil C. Rogers, equity strategist at UBS Securities Ltd. Though the rising New York markets seem to have drawn capital away from Japan, Mr. Rogers argues that Tokyo may now offer investors a more lucrative buying opportunity than those that has sailed to record highs for two years.
"I am a bear on Japan by nature," he said, "and I have turned bullish."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong U.S. Jobs Report Pushes Dollar Up, Except Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most currencies yesterday after robust December employment figures, reinforcing the view that the United States economy is growing while Japan and much of Europe struggle with resilient weakness.
A sharp selloff in the British pound also fed into the dollar rally. The pound tumbled after optimism for higher interest rates in Britain faded on data that showed an unexpected decline in manufacturing. 
 Demand for dollars pushed the dollar to the highest level against the mark since early July 1994 and the highest against the Swiss franc since mid-June 1994.
"The foreign exchange market was very pleased with the employment numbers, which show the economy is still strong," said Roger Chapin, foreign-exchange manager at Bank One in Columbus, Ohio.
But the dollar eased slightly against the yen, reflecting some fear in the foreign-exchange market that the Bank of Japan would take action to defend its currency, which has been trading at or near 45-month lows against the dollar for the last few weeks. Japanese officials earlier this week warned that the plummeting yen was undesirable.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5855 German marks from 1.5778 marks on Thursday, and to 1.3765 Swiss francs from 1.3701 Swiss francs. The dollar slipped to 116.06 yen from 116.34 yen. The pound fell to $1.6807 from $1.6955.
The main force driving the dollar higher was the stronger-than-expected employment report, which depicted a growing American economy with stable to slightly higher interest rates.
The pound's sudden fall reflected diminished chances for higher rates on Wednesday, when the governor of the Bank of England. Eddie George, confers with Kenneth Clarke, Chancellor of the Exchequer. There have been widespread expectations that Mr. George would nudge up interest rates to thwart inflationary pressures.
But the Office for National Statistics reported yesterday that British factories produced five-tenths of 1 percent fewer goods in November than in October, defying expectations of an increase.

HEADLINE: Cuba Measure Strikes Back At the U.S.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Raising the stakes in its battle with the United States over American legislation aimed at blocking foreign investment in Cuba, the Cuban Government has approved a law that penalizes Americans who seek restitution of their expropriated properties and allows Cuban citizens to sue the United States for damages.
The Cuban measure is clearly intended to counter the law that President Clinton signed in March after Cuba shot down two unarmed civilian aircraft off Havana, killing four Cuban-Americans. Named after its two main sponsors, the Helms-Burton Act allows Americans to file lawsuits against foreign companies that use American property confiscated by Cuba and denies executives of those businesses entry to the United States. 
 The Cuban action preceded Mr. Clinton's announcement on Jan. 3 that he would indefinitely suspend the carrying out of Helms-Burton's most disputed aspect, the provision allowing American citizens or corporations to seek damages in American courts for their expropriated properties.
Significantly, the Cuban measure formally recognizes that American companies and individuals who were United States citizens when Mr. Castro came to power in 1959 have the right to seek compensation for their losses, though only when the United States and Cuba are able to negotiate an agreement to that effect. But any American citizen or company that takes action against Cuba under Helms-Burton is to be excluded from any such indemnification settlement.
"This legislation is significant because it contains a threat to people not to register their claims and separates the big U.S. companies that can afford to wait from Cuban-Americans who were naturalized later," said Pamela Falk, author of the book "Cuban Foreign Policy."
"But the fact they are talking about compensation at all is a significant concession, and sets a bilateral agenda for opening the door on the issue of claims," she added.
The Clinton Administration's closest allies and trading partners in Europe and the Western Hemisphere have erected barriers to the American law. On Jan. 1, for instance, legislation went into effect in Canada that would allow Canadians to seek recovery in their courts of any losses they suffer as a result of the American legislation.
Most of the provisions of the new Cuban law appear to be tit-for-tat responses to American efforts to weaken the struggling Cuban economy. For instance, the law codifies Cuba's offer to assist foreign companies that wish to camouflage their investments in Cuba to evade American sanctions.
In addition, the Justice Ministry is ordered to set up special commissions at which Cuban citizens can bring suit against the United States and Cuban-Americans. These courts would be authorized to hear all claims of "theft, torture, corruption and murder" against officials from the era of the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista who are now living in the United States.
The law also allows Cubans to pursue damage claims stemming from United States military action, American-sponsored "terrorism" or Washington's 34-year economic embargo against Cuba. In theory, at least, a Cuban will now be able to sue the United States in a Cuban court for damages said to have been caused by the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, though obviously there is no mechanism by which a verdict could be enforced.
"Many of those provisions are highly propagandistic, intended basically for domestic political consumption," said a Latin American diplomat in Havana.
But one clause makes it a crime for Cuban citizens to cooperate in any way with news organizations that publish or divulge American Government arguments in favor of Helms-Burton. Another makes it a crime for foreigners, apparently including news reporters, to seek or provide any information, like property registers, that could be useful in carrying out Helms-Burton.
"That's kind of a new twist, and it's something that we are very concerned about," said Sarah DeCosse, who monitors the Caribbean for Americas Watch, a Washington-based human rights group. "I think this kind of repression would undoubtedly create a chilling effect in terms of the willingness of the Cuban people to speak openly and honestly to the press."

HEADLINE: An 'Us vs. Them' Mantra Raises the Balkan Fever

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The Grand Master of the United Grand Masonic Lodges in Germany, armed with a visa issued to him at the Yugoslav Consulate in Hamburg, planned to spend this Serbian Orthodox Christmas week inaugurating a new lodge in the city of Novi Sad.
But when the Grand Master, Rainer Schieke, arrived at the Belgrade airport last week, his visa was invalidated by customs officials and he was abruptly told, with no explanation, to return on the flight he came in on, according to a letter he faxed to Belgrade. 
 It was a trivial slight in the world of international relations, causing hardly a ripple in the small independent press and being ignored by the state-run media. But it highlighted the bizarre conspiracy theories, purported international plots, prejudices and fantasies that are spun in dizzying complexity by political leaders here.
Political debate has been twisted by a combination of the Communist ideology that gripped the former Yugoslavia for five decades and the nationalist Governments that rule Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia. Diatribes against foreign powers, secret organizations and rival ethnic groups plotting everyone's demise are the stock of public speeches.
The Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, and the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, have in the last month warned their followers that "foreign enemies" were trying to destabilize their respective countries. The two leaders have accused their political opponents of being financed and directed from abroad. And both have pet lists of human rights groups, religious orders, charitable organizations and foreign powers that they say are arrayed against them. Mr. Tudjman, in one of the more mystifying assaults, recently attacked Croats who he said have sold themselves to "black, green and yellow devils" and receive in return "the pay of Judas."
All sorts of groups, including Amnesty International, the Open Society Foundation run by George Soros, an American businessman, and even the Vatican scheme behind the scenes against Serbs, to name a few forces cited by leaders here. And although Tito actually shut down the Masonic order in Yugoslavia, his history has been rewritten by conspiracy theorists who have portrayed him as the secret international leader of the Masons.
"You know Tito was a Mason," said a 54-year-old Orthodox priest in St. Sava Cathedral one recent afternoon, "and so is the Pope and all the Catholic bishops. After Mahatma Gandhi was killed, Tito became the head of the Masons. And the toughest opponent of the Masonic order, which wants to rule the world, is the Serbian Orthodox church. We know Tito was secretly buried in the Vatican."
The lack of self-criticism, the tendency to always blame the outsider, often cuts short any rational political debate. And even the political opposition within Serbia frequently evokes the image of Serbs as "victims," ignoring the fact that Mr. Milosevic's nationalist campaign to build a "Greater Serbia," a major contributing factor to the war, also got him elected to office and, for a time, saw him lionized by nearly all sectors of Serb society.
"The propaganda of the Communist regime repeatedly told Yugoslavs that there were strong international groups conspiring against us," said Stojan Cerovic, a columnist for the opposition magazine Vreme. "Milosevic achieved power by warning that such foreign groups were behind the disintegration of Yugoslavia. He said the sanctions imposed on Serbia during the war and the economic collapse were all part of the plot. He is again playing on this paranoia to portray his opponents as foreign agents out to destroy the Serbs, although having less success."
For the hapless 150 Masons in Belgrade, part of the Regular Grand Lodge of Yugoslavia, the attacks -- political and sometimes physical -- have nearly wiped out their small organization. The car of a leader of the Belgrade group, Dragan Tanasic, was badly vandalized last year and a steel-tipped arrow was fired through the window of this home.
He has also been accused in the press of working for Mr. Schieke, whom the daily newspaper Politika Ekspres said last month was "the chief C.I.A. official in Germany."
"Not only do people not want to join, but current members want to get out," he said. "After these press attacks, my own neighbors look at me as if I was the devil."
The propaganda campaign, Masonic leaders say, has more to do with the intellectual and political distortions than the beliefs of their organization. The Masons are a secret society and say they promote tolerance, brotherhood and charitable work. But they have found few allies to protest Mr. Schieke's expulsion.
"In this society, we believe that if we fail, someone else is guilty," said Mr. Tanasic. "We live under a regime where all decisions are made in secret. Rulers go behind closed doors and come out to hand down decrees. We never see the process of Government. When you live like this for over 50 years you begin to believe that all political systems operate in the same manner. The secrecy, and the propensity to blame others for our own mistakes, have kept alive these ridiculous conspiracy theories."
As if the conspiracy theories were not enough for Mr. Tanasic's group, they have to contend with another Masonic lodge, known as Grand Lodge Yugoslavia, that they say has close links with Mr. Milosevic's Government. The lodge is not recognized by Masonic groups abroad.
"It is impossible in this country to have an independent civic organization," he said, "even for the Masons. The Government insists on putting its own people in to run every group, no matter how obscure."

HEADLINE: JOB REPORT SHOWS UNEXPECTED VIGOR FOR U.S. ECONOMY

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Jobs and paychecks grew with unexpected vigor in December, powerful evidence that the economy was gathering fresh momentum as 1996 ended, Labor Department figures showed today.
Although the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.3 percent, the 262,000 jobs created last month were far more than economists had predicted, and there was a second consecutive large gain in average hourly earnings. Analysts said the robust report raised the specter of higher inflation and of a decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to counter it. 
 Both fears combined to cause the bond and stock markets to plunge, although the stock market later recovered strongly.
President Clinton dismissed any worries about inflation, pointing instead to the jobs created in his term. "This is the first time in the history of our economy that over 11 million jobs have been created during one four-year Administration," he told reporters at the White House.
The economy is "on a roll," said Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, also playing down jitters about inflation. "There's much to celebrate."
While investors in the stock market ultimately agreed, traders in the bond market, which is sensitive to inflation, felt differently. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, an important benchmark for corporate and consumer interest rates, rose to 6.84 percent, as prices, which move in the opposite direction, fell.
Interest rates are now nearly a half-point higher than in early December and a quarter-point higher than just before Christmas, when indications of economic resurgence first emerged.
More economists joined the scramble today to raise estimates of economic growth in the final 1996 quarter, which already appeared to be higher than is consistent with steady inflation. They also raised their projections for the first half of this year.
"You're starting off from a much higher platform," said William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, who now figures the economy grew at a 3.6 percent pace, rather than 3 percent, in the quarter that just ended.
But while the chances increased that the Federal Reserve will decide to tighten monetary policy, most analysts also agreed that the central bank would probably not act before its March 25 policy meeting.
At that point, they said, it would be better able to tell whether growth will ebb on its own, helped by higher interest rates generated by the market.
Some analysts predicted just this. "The current strength in the economy will be temporary," said Mickey D. Levy, an economist at Nationsbank in New York. "In the spring we'll see signs that the current rate of growth won't be sustained."
The jump in payrolls of 262,000 was the biggest gain since August and about 50 percent more than the consensus prediction. The Labor Department also raised its previous tally of total job growth for October and November by 46,000.
For the full year, the number of Americans with jobs climbed 2.8 million, split almost evenly between men and women. The labor force grew by 2.6 million, with women accounting for three-fifths of the increase. This has caused the jobless rate for adult men, which a year ago was higher than that for adult women, to fall to 4.4 percent, a half-point lower than that of the women. The unemployment rate for teen-agers last month was 16.5 percent.
A startling development, however, was the large increase in average hourly earnings. Most specialists had expected little change after a huge 9-cent November increase but pay rose instead by an additional 6 cents.
This suggested a hefty rise in the quarterly Employment Cost Index, to be published Jan. 28, an indicator that gets close scrutiny at the Federal Reserve.
For the full year, average hourly pay rose 44 cents, or 3.8 percent, compared with gains of 3.2 percent in 1995, 2.7 percent in 1994 and 2.4 percent in 1993.
One factor in the recent acceleration is the increase of 50 cents an hour in the Federal minimum wage that took effect Oct. 1.
But workers in retail trade, where there is a concentration of the lower-paid employees, had average increases of only 2 cents an hour in December and 4 cents in November after an 8-cent October increase. Secretary Reich said the law had had "possibly a small effect" on wages in general.
Other signs of strength included 18-minute extensions of the factory and private-sector workweeks and 12 minutes more of factory overtime. The measures of factory hours have now rebounded to near-record levels and suggest that employers may need to step up hiring.
Nearly all sectors of the economy added sizable numbers of jobs last month, with business services contributing 45,000 jobs after a small decline in November and retail trade added 48,000 jobs, many of them in restaurants and bars.
Construction employment, aided by milder-than-usual weather in most of the country, rose by 23,000 and manufacturing rose by 19,000 despite a continued decline at factories that make electronic equipment.
Government showed 31,000 more jobs, but most of this reflected the fact that fewer election workers than usual were hired in November and thus there were fewer to be dismissed in December.
The combination of more people at work and longer workweeks drove the index of aggregate weekly hours up nine-tenths of 1 percent, to 139.2, assuring a big increase when the Federal Reserve reports on industrial production for the month next Friday, the payroll data also showed.
The Labor Department's survey of households registered 211,000 more people with jobs last month than in November, enough to keep up with a 191,000 rise in the labor force and thereby hold the unemployment rate at 5.3 percent.
The November rate had initially been 5.4 percent but this was recalculated downward as part of the usual year-end revision that incorporates updated seasonal adjustment factors. The rates for January, March and May were also revised one-tenth of a point lower while August was raised one-tenth of a point, to 5.2 percent.
Regionally, the December jobless rate edged up two-tenths of a point, to 6.5 percent in the West and one-tenth of a point, to 5.6 percent, in the Northeast. The rate eased two-tenths of a point, to 5.2 percent, in the South and one-tenth of a point, to 4.5 percent, in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks Business Help On Proposal Over Welfare

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Noting that the changes he approved last year to the welfare system "did not put anybody to work," President Clinton embarked today on his post-election campaign to persuade business leaders to hire welfare recipients.
Citing new time limits for most adults receiving welfare benefits, Mr. Clinton said before meeting with business executives at the White House: "Unless we can create new jobs in the private sector within the two-year time line, the welfare reform effort will not succeed." 
 Beginning what his aides said would be a national effort as the changes to the welfare system take hold, Mr. Clinton today brought together executives who are already trying to hire people receiving welfare.
"My single message is the C.E.O.s of America need to step up and recognize this now is a private sector initiative," Gerald Greenwald, the chief executive of U.A.L. Corporation, said as he left the hour-long meeting. "The challenge really of welfare reform is the challenge in the private sector. We're the ones that have the jobs."
He said United Airlines had hired 25,000 people in 2 1/2 years, 15,000 of them at $7 to $10 an hour. "A lot of them have been coming off welfare," he said.
Prodded by reporters asking why the White House was not leading by example, Mr. Clinton's staff is looking into hiring welfare recipients, Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary said today. "We have to look very carefully at what Federal guidelines and restrictions are and whether it's possible," he said.
After signing welfare legislation in August over the anguished objections of his liberal supporters, Mr. Clinton met with business leaders twice during his re-election campaign to urge them to hire welfare recipients, while promising to amend the new law to soften its impact. He also proposed $3.4 billion in grants and tax incentives to help provide jobs for people being forced off welfare benefits.
Executives who attended today's meeting said Mr. Clinton had promised Federal help with efforts like worker training, day care and transportation from the inner cities to jobs. But they said they anticipated little new Federal money.
"It's not a question of money, because there's a lot of money going to people on welfare," said Bill Esery, the chairman and chief executive of Sprint. "It's a question of how you can use that money in a different way to get people gainfully employed."
Mr. Clinton also announced today that his Administration had granted waivers for three more states -- Louisiana, Maryland, and North Carolina -- to carry out their welfare plans. In all, 29 states have waivers.
While critics of the President praised him for reaching out to business leaders, some raised concerns about Federal encouragement to hire welfare recipients.
"We must proceed with caution," Representative Bill Archer, chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, wrote in a letter to Mr. Clinton on Thursday. "Welfare recipients should not be given jobs at the expense of the working poor, who may not qualify for a corporate tax credit but who, nonetheless, still need jobs."
A further obstacle to hiring welfare recipients was suggested by a question put to Mr. Clinton during his appearance today. Citing new jobs data, a reporter asked if Mr. Clinton worried that unemployment had dropped too far.
As Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich left the meeting with executives, he said: "Even at a low unemployment rate of 5.3 percent, there are still some 7 million people unemployed and actively looking for jobs. People who are now welfare beneficiaries are likely to be at the end of any job queue. The ultimate answer is economic growth, and simultaneously, a better match between unemployed workers and jobs."
Another question is how responsive business leaders will be to jawboning from the White House.
Mr. Reich said: "In my experience, it's difficult to get most of the business community to rally behind a request that they do the right thing. Unless they see a direct relationship between profit maximization and doing the right thing, they will not be persuaded."
Some business people at the meeting today said hiring welfare recipients made good business sense. Robert Lowes, the chief executive of Burger King, said one of his franchisees recently opened stores in Federal empowerment zones in the depressed city centers in Baltimore and Detroit, employing "a high percentage of welfare recipients."
Those stores, he said, were averaging $2 million in sales a year, compared with $1.1 million for Burger King restaurants nationwide. "It's not just the right thing to do, it's a tremendous business opportunity," he said.

Japanese Stocks Off 10% in Grim Week

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 10

 BODY:
After a week in which Japanese stocks tumbled by more than 10 percent -- including a 4.26 percent drop today -- many people still fear the market will continue to sink.
There is no reason to think the pessimists are any more right than the optimists were seven years ago, when the market was trading at more than twice today's level. Still, the revolution in attitudes underscores Japan's profound malaise and the enormous economic challenges the country faces. 
 The Nikkei index of 225 leading stocks ended a dismal week today, closing at 17,303.65, down 770.22 points for the day. It was a hectic session in which 536 million shares changed hands, nearly double the turnover on Thursday. For the week -- and for the year so far, since the Japanese market had its first day of 1997 trading on Monday -- the index has fallen more than 2,000 points, or 10.6 percent.
The drop brought the Nikkei to its lowest point since August 1995, though the index has been as low as 14,300 since it peaked at 38,915 in December 1989. In percentage terms, this was the worst week since the Nikkei lost 11.75 percent in the week ended Sept. 28, 1990, a few months into what has become a seven-year bear market.
By contrast, the United States has not seen a week as bad as this one in Japan since the stock market crash of 1987, when the Dow fell 13.2 percent in the week that ended Oct. 23. The market had dropped 22 percent that Monday, but recovered somewhat later in the week.
The abrupt fall in stock prices here threatens to provoke a banking crisis as well as pose a huge political challenge for Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. The plunging market could also give new impetus to the calls for sweeping changes in Japan's economy and Government.
"For every politician, the economy is the No. 1 issue," said John F. Neuffer, a political analyst at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute. Referring to Mr. Hashimoto, Mr. Neuffer added, "He needs to say that we finally have to move aggressively on administrative reform and deregulation; otherwise the economy will end up on the scrap heap."
Mr. Hashimoto, who is on a state visit to Southeast Asia, has been unusually silent, prompting speculation that officials are trying to create a plan to address the market plunge.
"The Cabinet will not ignore it, because otherwise another round of political turmoil will develop quickly," said Takashi Kiuchi, an economist at LTCB Research Institute Inc., a research group tied to the Long-Term Credit Bank. "What is missing is some secret trump card."
Other investors, however, are concerned that policy makers have few tools available to retune the economy. A rising budget deficit has ruled out an increase in Government spending and with interest rates already near zero, the Bank of Japan cannot use rate cuts as a stimulus.
 That may explain the market's reaction today when three top Cabinet officials, including Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, emerged in public one by one to try to calm the selling frenzy. After they spoke, the market plummeted further.
Japan's market quagmire may also have sobering lessons for the United States as it sits perched atop a record stock market. Japan, too, was full of exuberance seven years ago. At Japan's market peak in 1989, many analysts argued, as people always have during boom times, that for a host of reasons, stocks would continue to rise and this boom was different from those in the past.
While there are clear differences between the American and Japanese situations -- for one, the American economy is on a solid growth path -- some people see similarities. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, drew the comparison last month, citing Japan as evidence that stocks fall as well as rise.
"There are lessons to be learned," said Ronald Bevacqua, an economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. "People are justifying the level of the Dow to themselves. I don't hear enough people saying that the Dow is too high."
One puzzling aspect of this week's plunge is that there was no single event that set off the selling, and the currency market was relatively stable today, with the yen settling in Tokyo at 115.92 against the dollar. There are, however severe underlying problems: a dim economic outlook, a rising sales tax and budget tightening by the Government.
Economists say that an increase in the sales tax to 5 percent, from 3 percent, is likely to crimp buying by consumers after it goes into effect in April. Given a tiny increase in fiscal spending and an end to tax breaks, the economy is projected to show little growth in the 1997 fiscal year, which begins in April.
The lackluster economic outlook helped drag down stocks, and the depressed stock market may, in turn, hurt the economy, possibly causing Japanese companies to scale back the spending plans they are drawing up for the next fiscal year.
Moreover, the damage from the stock market is already being felt acutely by Japan's thinly capitalized banks, which are burdened by several hundred billion dollars in sour property loans. The banks are trying to maintain an international standard of minimum capital equal to 8 percent of outstanding loans.
To do that, they have relied in part on unrealized profits on stocks they bought years ago at much lower prices. In today's market, however, those unrealized profits have shrunk so much as to nudge the weakest and even some moderately weak banks below the 8 percent capital standard. The depleted capital makes it even more difficult for those banks to write off bad debt.
For that reason, bank shares took a severe beating today. Sakura Bank was the most heavily traded stock, dipping 49 yen, to 650 yen.
Mr. Hashimoto's "Big Bang" -- his extensive plan for deregulating the financial industry and the overall economy -- in some ways is contributing to the plunge in bank stocks. One crucial result of the Big Bang will be that strong banks will survive, while weak ones will not.
"The move to sell bank shares initially reflected the impact that the Big Bang could bring," said Mitsuhiro Nakano, an equity strategist at Daiwa Research Institute. "Keener competition could create losers in the financial market."
Financially strained banks could sell overseas securities, particularly United States Treasuries and other bonds. A concentrated bout of such selling before the fiscal year ends in March could cause ripples in the American bond market, analysts say, but they added that the American bond market was so huge that no one group of players, even one as large as the Japanese, could sway it too significantly. Also, Japanese financial managers tend not to shift money rapidly around the world.
So, for all the talk about globalization of markets, of how money sloshes between Tokyo and New York, the market crisis here is not expected to knock over any dominoes abroad.
"Capital moves freely around the world, but not all capital," Mr. Bevacqua of Merrill Lynch said. "Japanese have an enormous supply of capital, which doesn't move around the world to where the returns are the highest."

HEADLINE: As Nature and Economics Collide, Some Boardwalks Evolve

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: BELMAR, N.J.

 BODY:
It has been more than four years since a ferocious northeaster raked the towns along the jutting chin of New Jersey's coast, the storm's 90-mile-an-hour winds and pounding surf destroying whole sections of boardwalk.
Afterward, some hard-hit towns did what they always did: They simply rebuilt their boardwalks. Not rebuilding was not an option in those towns, which rely on tourists for whom boardwalks are as emblematic of the New Jersey shore as salt water taffy. But other towns, faced with declining state aid and scarcer local tax dollars, began to consider new approaches. The northeaster may have been the worst storm to hit the coast in 30 or 40 years, but the mayors said they realized they were essentially in a losing battle with the sea and the sand. 
 As a result, the boardwalk in Spring Lake is now made of a wood substitute made of sawdust and plastic that requires less maintenance than regular wood. In Bradley Beach, the boardwalk is not really a boardwalk anymore; it is a pathway made with concrete paving stones and built farther inland. And Belmar chose to make its boardwalk removable. Forklifts and backhoes dismantle the boardwalk and take it inland during hurricane season and winters.
"This stuff is expensive, but we couldn't do away with the boardwalk which attracts so many tourists," said Belmar's Mayor, Kenneth E. Pringle. "I guess we accepted the realities of Mother Nature and made a strategic withdrawal. It's what I like to call peace with honor."
Hard-pressed, blue-collar towns reliant on weekend visitors often made different decisions than more affluent communities less dependent on tourism. But in almost all cases, said Norbert Psuty, director of the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University, officials acted with a keen eye toward cost effectiveness and cutting their economic losses over time.
"It's part of the tenor of the times," he said. "They are looking for ways to cut budgets in ways that some of their predecessors were not."
The Mayor of Bradley Beach, Stephen Schueler, said the town had been spending $40,000 to $50,000 a year to maintain its old boardwalk. Even so, he described it as "rickety, fall-down and like a child whose hair had not been combed."
"We know the ocean is rising and coming inland so we decided to retreat as well as get away from the traditional wood solutions," he said. "Now 90 percent of our boardwalk is masonry which is cool to the feet, low maintenance and has 20 times the life of wood."
Many of these Monmouth County shore front towns are looking as well to the promise of Federally financed beach replenishment programs that would replace yards of lost sand and restore the storm-raked dunes that once prevented some of the storm damage to boardwalks and other man-made structures. But dependence on such money has long been controversial among groups which see it as basically throwing tax dollars into the ocean. As a result, some areas to the south, like Avalon and Ocean City, have used their own scarce funds for periodic beach replenishment in tandem with rebuilding boardwalks.
"It's difficult to draw a line in the sand and defend it," Dr. Psuty said. "But the mass of sand from larger beaches and dunes can be a natural barrier that absorbs some of the energy of waves and storm tides and slows the erosion. And if a community feels itself dependent on tourism so that they have to constantly rebuild, then it makes sense for them to be flexible."
The first boardwalk in this country was built in Atlantic City in the 1870's, said Phillip Correll, the manager of the National Park Service's New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route. And it was not long before the once narrow, removable wooden walkways grew to wide, raised promenades that all but replaced the Atlantic Ocean as the resort city's major attraction.
In the Victorian era, people took a grand view of the healthful properties of fresh air and walking at coastal resorts that were touted as the cure for everything from consumption to "nervous affections and mild cases of mental disease," as one brochure of the time suggested. But the motives for building Atlantic City's boardwalk had little to do with that.
It actually was prompted by more mundane considerations. According to several histories of the city, a railroad conductor and a hotel proprietor petitioned the city's officials to build the walkway to keep patrons and bathers from tracking sand into lobbies and rail cars.
But it was not long before the boardwalk became a staple of the New Jersey shore, whether it was the wide, nearly desolate promenades of Spring Lake and Long Branch or the commercial and carnival atmosphere of Atlantic City and Asbury Park. They snaked their way north up the 127-mile-long New Jersey coast, cropping up like dune grass in one community after another from the turn of the century on to the 1920's.
In 1923, the first New York City boardwalk was built at Coney Island -- arguably the country's second most famous ocean front promenade, after Atlantic City's.
"While it began as a way to prevent people from tracking sand inside, they soon became extensions of the community and its economic activity," said John Cunningham, who has written several books on New Jersey history.
For this reason, Mr. Pringle, the Mayor of Belmar, said it was inconceivable for the town not to replace a quarter-mile section of the boardwalk and two public restrooms that were battered by the 1992 storm. Even in good years the boardwalk was the town's No. 1 maintenance item, he said, costing as much as $60,000 for simple timber replacement and renailing along the entire length. To rebuild that one section more than doubled the annual cost, the Mayor said. So the removable sections made sense. Today the sections are stacked in a municipal parking lot six blocks inland from the beach.
"Beach replenishment has been a promise for more than 40 years but never a sure thing," Mr. Pringle said. "We hedged our bets so that we could maintain the boardwalk at the minimum cost by making it removable if beach replenishment doesn't happen soon."
In an unexpected bonus, said Mayor Pringle, the annual removal of the boardwalk sections is spawning a new tradition in town, that while not as gold-plated as Victorian-era boardwalk promenading, has its own postmodern allure. Year-round residents have begun to turn out to watch the heavy equipment take up the removable boardwalk decking and haul it inland for storage.
Belmar considered rebuilding with new materials, the Mayor said, but in the end reasoned that "what you make a stationary boardwalk out of was sort of like a debate over the material you use to make the deck chairs on the Titanic."
Spring Lake's Mayor, Thomas J. Byrne 3d, disagreed. A milelong stretch of the boardwalk in his affluent town, where Victorian-style houses abound, is made of sawdust and recycled plastic. The product, called Trex, was more expensive to install than normal wood, he said, but it requires far less maintenance because it does not splinter, split, warp or attract termites. And he noted that the weathered gray Trex timbers were less likely to shatter into thousands of splintery shards in a storm and were fastened to pilings in such a way that they would be upended in sections rather than timber by timber.
Because the wood in the old boardwalk was chemically treated, storm-damaged timbers had to be disposed of at great cost at hazardous waste landfills. The Trex material is environmentally safe for regular landfill disposal, the Mayor said. And what is more, he said, the town has avoided scores of lawsuits from joggers or walkers who claimed injuries from exposed nails or splinters on the old timber boardwalk.
On a recent morning as a frigid wind whipped along the Spring Lake boardwalk, Bill Woodruff, a Point Pleasant resident who regularly walks the several miles of boardwalks from his home north through Manasquan, Spring Lake, Belmar and Bradley Beach, graded the various surfaces. The wood he encountered in Belmar was "bumpy, has no give and sometimes you trip," he said. In Bradley Beach "the paving stones look nice" but were hard on the knees. But he said the Trex, without the inconvenience of knots, warping and nails, was springy and flexible to the step.
That was endorsement enough for Mayor Byrne.
"They come to Belmar to watch them move their boardwalk, but they come to Spring Lake to walk on ours," he said with satisfaction. "I'll accept that."

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Fall on Strong Jobs Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices tumbled yesterday after an employment report that was stronger than expected.
The data showed that the economy was still vibrant, raising expectations in the bond market that the Federal Reserve would soon need to raise short-term interest rates to prevent inflation from accelerating. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 27/32 , to 9522/32 . The bond's yield -- an important benchmark for corporate and consumer interest rates -- rose to 6.84 percent, from 6.75 percent on Thursday. Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions.
Bond prices fell by more than one and a half points in the morning reaction to the jobs report before recovering more than a third of their losses.
The drop in prices meant that bondholders lost about $8.44 for every $1,000 invested.
The Labor Department reported that 262,000 jobs were added to the nation's payrolls last month, way above the 175,000 expected in the market consensus.
"The number seemed to confirm two things today," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, "that growth in the fourth quarter was clearly stronger than the third quarter and that the market has now conclusively once again built in the concept that the next Fed move is a tightening."
While some market participants say they expect the Fed to raise short-term rates next month, many others say they believe that the central bank will want more evidence that the strength from the fourth quarter has carried over into the first quarter. That would mean the Fed may decide to put off any action until the March meeting of policy makers.
Indeed, the central issue now confronting the market, Mr. Fine said, is whether growth in the first quarter will continue at such a strong clip or ease back to its pace of the third quarter.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, agreed that the employment data should generate more serious discussion about a possible rate increase in the near term.
"Although the Fed may not have enough support within its ranks for an immediate hike," Mr. Chan said, "any additional evidence of the type found in this report could quickly change the sentiment at the Fed and lead to a tightening that takes place sooner rather than later."
The market's fears were eased somewhat, Mr. Chan said, by a report on the Market News service that argued that it would be more plausible for the Fed to wait until its March 25 meeting to push rates higher rather than to do so on Feb. 5.
"This story," Mr. Chan said, "held out the hope the Fed may have read this report as being somewhat out of line with true economic trends. And with this reasoning, some investors may have assumed that if the Fed wasn't about to panic, why should they?"

HEADLINE: Stocks Plunge, Then Soar, As Dow Finishes Up 78.12

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stock prices went on a wild ride yesterday, first plunging and then leaping. The swings came after the Government reported that jobs grew more strongly than expected last month.
The Dow Jones industrial average surpassed 6,700 for the first time and notched its fourth record in a week, closing at 6,703.79, up 78.12 points in heavy trading. For the week, the Dow was up 159.70 points, or about 2.4 percent. 
 Other market indexes also set records. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 4.65 points, to 759.50, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 5.82 points, to 1,332.02.
The Russell 2000 index rose for the second consecutive day, closing at a record 366.09, up 0.50 point. The New York Stock Exchange composite rose 2.18 points, at 400.76.
Stocks tumbled at the opening of the market on the Labor Department's report on December employment, which showed higher-than-expected job growth.
Bond prices fell even more sharply in the morning, dropping by more than a point and a half before recovering somewhat.
The Dow was down 67 points in early trading, restricting trading on the New York Stock Exchange, but by early afternoon blue-chip stocks bounced back on what was to become a 150-point turnaround.
"Stocks had a very, very wild day," said Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Days like this embolden investors. They see a day where the Dow comes back from what looks like a death spiral and then it goes on to make a record high."
Analysts said that cash flowing in from foreign investors and larger- than-expected investments in mutual funds had helped bolster the stock market.
There is also increasing confidence in the economy and the strength of the dollar.
"What the stock market is beginning to reflect is that maybe we can have a strong economy without a strong rise in inflation," said Byron Wien, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. 'There's a feeling out there that nothing can go wrong. It's a dangerous attitude but it's out there."
Indeed, investors continue to focus on prospects for growth, despite fears of inflation that have unnerved investors in the bond market, analysts said.
"There's a view the economy is firm," Mr. Alexy said. "Right now, the equity market is saying earnings will be O.K."
Mr. Wien and other analysts said that the advance in stocks was broad. Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, only 4 declined in trading yesterday, and cyclical stocks were particularly strong.
Oil stocks again were a significant part of the rally. Shares of Texaco closed at 107 3/8, up 2 3/8. And shares of Exxon rose to 105 3/4, up 2 7/8.
Allied Signal was one of the Dow's big gainers, rising to 70 1/2, up 2 3/8.
Shares of General Motors closed at 61 1/8, up 1 7/8, and Caterpillar was up 1 7/8 to close at 78.
With those gains, the Dow has risen nearly 4 percent since the beginning of the year.
Some analysts said that despite a plunge in Japanese stocks and weakness in the bond market, investors and speculators continued to favor equities.
"A bull market celebrates good news and ignores bad news," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "There's the so-called January barometer, when people look at how the market performs. Strength encourages people, weakness discourages them. This month tends to suggest a bull market."

HEADLINE: Winning N.F.L. Team Gives Jacksonville a Sense of Itself

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 7

 BODY:
Two Saturdays ago, after becoming the first N.F.L. team to win a playoff game in only its second year, the Jacksonville Jaguars made a rookie mistake by zipping away from the Jacksonville airport without acknowledging the 5,000 fans who had jammed the terminal to await the team's arrival.
Stung by angry comments from the fans, team and city officials did some serious planning for the Jaguars' next playoff game. And when the team flew home early Sunday after upsetting the Denver Broncos, the plane banked over an illuminated Jacksonville Municipal Stadium so players could see the 40,000 fans who had gathered at 1:30 A.M. for a raucous celebration. 
 They are starting to get the hang of winning around here.
And not just here. There may be no greater testament to the economic, cultural and political ascension of the South than the elevation of its second-tier cities -- Charlotte, Jacksonville and Orlando -- into the major leagues.
With the advance of the Jaguars and their two-year-old counterparts, the Carolina Panthers, to Sunday's conference championship games, football is being embraced and promoted by those upstart towns as a metaphor for civic momentum.
In the eyes of the rest of the country, professional sports uncomplemented by other cultural assets may not singlehandedly move a city into the first tier. People in Jacksonville and its sister cities understand that. But they also firmly believe that pro teams, especially underdog teams that continually defy expectations, can captivate a nation and make people remember your name.
"There are 13 Jacksonvilles in America, and now when you say you're from Jacksonville, you don't have to say Florida," said Laurence J. DuBow, a Jacksonville businessman and part owner of the Jaguars.
Jacksonville's leaders believe that the recognition and respect that follow a winning sports franchise can help lure new employers and create the sense of community needed to attack problems like racial tension.
"What we hope is that the sense of good will that comes with this will help us address some of our lingering problems," said Jacksonville's Mayor, John A. Delaney.
This sprawling northeast Florida city, known for its port on the broad St. John's River, its military bases, and its insurance and banking industries, has rapidly grown in the last two decades. The metropolitan area's population is now about one million.
But Jacksonville's mentality has always seemed far smaller than its size, and the city, while by far the most populous in Florida, has never been able to compete for national attention with cities like Atlanta, Houston, Miami, New Orleans, Orlando and Tampa.
For years, Jacksonville was known to those passing through to South Florida as a city whose air was fouled by the sulfur dioxide emissions of its pulp and paper mills and whose Interstates were clogged by quarter-gobbling toll booths. It consistently finished second or third in the competition for companies relocating to the South and in the hunt for professional football teams, whose owners used Jacksonville's recruitment efforts to win better deals from other cities.
When the city made national news, it was because snipers were firing at motorists from Interstate overpasses or because its chief judge was being sanctioned for making racially insensitive remarks.
Now football -- winning football -- has given Jacksonville the means to shake off what its leaders characterize as a civic inferiority complex.
"The Jaguars make people feel good about themselves who haven't felt good about themselves in a long time," said James B. Crooks, a local historian who teaches at the University of North Florida.
This visually striking city had already started to clean up its air and water, had leveled its toll booths and had become one of the country's 10 fastest-growing job markets, thanks to the arrival of prestigious businesses like the Mayo Clinic and Merrill Lynch. But the most potent transfusion of pride came on Nov. 30, 1993, when the National Football League announced its decision to place an expansion team in Jacksonville.
Some critics complained that the city gave the team a sweetheart deal by spending more than $100 million on stadium improvements. But the 73,000-seat stadium was quickly sold out, and the city's golf courses and thoroughfares now empty whenever the Jaguars appear on televison. More people greeted the returning Jaguars in Sunday's wee hours than watched many actual football games in Atlanta and Houston this year.
"Self-esteem is a funny thing," said Thomas F. Petway, a minority owner of the Jaguars. "In this instance, I think Jacksonville needed something to call its own, something to rally around."
To a degree probably possible only in the South locals view the essence of the Jaguars' success as a matter of overdue respect.
When a Denver sportswriter, Woody Paige, made the mistake of disrespecting both the Jaguars and their hometown in a game-day column, he incited not only the team but also much of northeastern Florida. "How do you get worked up to play somebody called Jacksonville, with a bunch of nobodies?" he asked.
Jacksonville residents clogged his e-mail with angry rebuttals and painted their car windows with impolite suggestions for Mr. Paige.
How closely linked is the city's image with the Jaguars? Suffice it to say that the newly elected chairman of the Chamber of Commerce is Daniel W. Connell Jr., the senior vice president of marketing for the team. Since the team's arrival, the chamber has been promoting Jacksonville as "the expansion city."
The city has gone Jaguar crazy in the last two weeks. After the Broncos game, Dana Romano, the manager of Authentic Pro Gear, sold nearly 2,000 commemorative T-shirts at $18.99 in just two days. Karen A. Sinclair, a 47-year-old teacher, felt right at home at a sports bar on Monday night wearing a Jaguar-spot blouse, Jaguar-spot earrings, a gold Jaguar choker and a Jaguar pin.
Even those who are normally disinterested in football have become converts. During last Saturday's game, Helene Baker, an artist, found herself watching the Jaguars on a muted television in her studio while listening to a radio broadcast of her favorite opera, "Tosca."
"The next thing I know," Ms. Baker said, "I'm beginning to turn the opera down slowly and turning the TV louder. I finally decided I knew what was going to happen at the end of the opera but I didn't know what was going to happen to the Jaguars, and I turned the radio off."

Job Growth Is Strong, Raising Inflation Fears
Jobs and paychecks grew with unexpected vigor in December, powerful evidence that the economy was gathering fresh momentum as 1996 ended, Labor Department figures showed.
Although the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.3 percent, the 262,000 jobs created last month were far more than economists had predicted. Analysts said the robust report raised the specter of higher inflation and of a decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. [Page 1.]

Stocks Rise and Bonds Fall
The employment report sent stock and bond prices down, but only stocks recovered. The Dow Jones industrial average surpassed 6,700 for the first time and notched its fourth record in a week, closing at 6,703.79, up 78.12 points in heavy trading. Other market indexes also set records. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 4.65 points, to 759.50, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 5.82 points, to 1,332.02. The Dow was down 67 points in early trading, but blue-chip stocks bounced back on what was to become a 150-point turnaround. [47.]

Treasury prices tumbled after the employment report as bond traders took the strong numbers to mean inflation was a greater risk and that the Fed might raise interest rates to counter it. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.84 percent, from 6.75 percent on Thursday. Interest rates are now nearly a half-point higher than in early December, when indications of economic resurgence first emerged. [47.]

Shares of 2 Drug Companies Fall
Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Amgen fell sharply after the companies disclosed that their jointly developed drug for the treatment of Lou Gehrig's disease had failed in clinical trials. [38.]

Breast Implant Settlement Opposed
Stepping up their opposition to Dow Corning's proposal to settle all silicone breast implant claims and other debts, committees representing both the implant claimants and Dow Corning's commercial creditors asked a Federal bankruptcy judge for permission to file a competing payment plan. [9.]
 
Utility Plans to Sell Plants
Massachusetts regulators approved a plan by the New England Electric System, a huge utility in the Northeast, to sell its generating plants and offer customers a choice in buying their electricity by January 1998. [50.]

Airbus in Talks on Jumbo Jet
At least two South Korean companies said they are talking with Airbus Industrie about becoming partners on its jumbo jet project, which is aimed at breaking Boeing's monopoly in large airliners. Spokesmen for the Samsung Aerospace Industries Company and Korean Air said their companies and several others were involved in the talks to build an aircraft capable of carrying 550 passengers. [38.]
 
Fed Governor to Resign
A Federal Reserve governor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, announced that he would resign on Feb. 5, creating a second vacancy on the central bank's board. [38.]
 
A High Price for Seinfeld
The most valuable show in television is about to become the most expensive as "Seinfeld" moves toward a deal with NBC for one more season at a price that could reach as much as
$5 million an episode, by far the highest for any show in television history. But no matter what the price, the network is expected to make a deal because "Seinfeld" is, by every reckoning, NBC's indispensable, irreplaceable program. [11.]

Jobs Report Sends Dollar Higher
The dollar rose against most currencies after robust December employment figures, reinforcing the view that the United States economy is growing while Japan and much of Europe struggle with resilient weakness. [40.]
 
Corn and Soybean Prices Rise
A Government projection of tighter corn and soybean supplies sent futures prices soaring on the Chicago Board of Trade. [40.]

NEW YORK
 
Mayor Raises $1.2 Million
Outpacing his Democratic challengers by nearly two-to-one, Mayor Giuliani has raised nearly $1.2 million for a re-election campaign since July 12. Combined with money he had collected earlier as well as matching funds he will request from the city, his campaign fund totals $8.5 million, aides say. That means that with 11 months until Election Day, the Mayor has almost reached the point where he will be spared the time-consuming obligation of further fund-raising. Under the city campaign finance laws, he is allowed to spend $9.7 million. [Page 27.] 

Seeking Solidarity in Workfare
Traveling through Brooklyn, Sharon Bush distributes forms that authorize her group, known as Acorn, to represent workfare crews in their dealings with the city. "They have rights, but it's degrading how they're treated," she said. "But I never heard one of them say they didn't want to work for their public assistance check." About New York by David Gonzalez. [27.]
 
Resignation at Willkie Farr
A partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, one of New York's premier corporate law firms, resigned after the firm discovered that he had never been admitted to the bar even though he had graduated with honors from a top law school and had passed the bar exam. [29.]
 
Appeals Court Backs Mayor
An appeals court has sided with Mayor Giuliani in his battle to prevent the City Council from setting up an independent agency to investigate police corruption, ruling that a bill approved by the Council over the Mayor's veto violated the City Charter. [29.]
 
Groups Press Ebonics
Though officials ranging from the Schools Chancellor to representatives of the teachers' union have rejected the notion, a group of community advocates is nevertheless urging that teachers in New York City schools be instructed in how better to teach students who speak so-called black English, or ebonics. [29.]
 
Wounded Officer Goes Home
A police officer from Queens who was run down and critically injured a month ago by a station wagon driven by an off-duty police officer was released from the hospital after making what doctors called a remarkable recovery. [29.]
 
Regulating Fish Market Parking
In the latest phase of a campaign to overhaul business practices at the Fulton Fish Market, New York City is regulating the parking and security fees charged to buyers from restaurants and retail stores. Only two of the six companies that have controlled the market's 800 parking spaces will be given licenses to operate. [28.]
 
Youth Shot Near School Dies
A teen-ager shot on a basketball court outside a Brooklyn high school on Wednesday has died, and three youths arrested in the shooting could now face murder charges. [28.]

Republican Squabble on L.I.
When John Powell was sworn in as leader of the Suffolk County Republican Party, he was viewed as a rising star among state Republican leaders. But his decision to back one of the youngest and least experienced Suffolk County legislators for the Legislature's highest post has touched off an embarrassing public squabble in his own backyard.

NEW JERSEY
 
Building Better Boardwalks
After a ferocious northeaster raked the New Jersey coast in 1992, some hard-hit towns followed tradition and rebuilt their boardwalks. Other towns, faced with declining state aid and scarcer local tax dollars, began to consider new approaches. But in almost all cases, officials acted with a keen eye toward cost effectiveness and cutting their economic losses over time. [27.]

On Karma and the Environment
It has long been a custom among some Buddhists to liberate animals whose destiny would otherwise involve a lifetime of captivity or worse -- dinner. Setting animals free is considered an act of compassion that will be rewarded with good karma. But to some environmentalists, it is also a practice that threatens native species. [27.]

Hawaiian Hula Festival
Q. Do you have information about a hula-dancing competition in Hawaii in the spring? -- Sheila Miller, Richmond
A. The competition you are probably referring to is the Merrie Monarch Festival, an extremely popular annual event, in which about 30 hula halau, or hula troops, gather in Hilo. Two styles of hula are judged: kahiko (ancient hula) and auana (modern hula). The 1997 Merrie Monarch Festival is scheduled for March 30 to April 5. 
 The competition is one of the grandest hula-dancing spectacles in the world, with kahiko dancers wearing traditional costumes of native plant material, including hau tree bark and ferns, and auana performers in more elaborate apparel, including Victorian-influenced costumes of velvet and feathered hats.
The event, which dates from 1964, is named after the 19th-century "Merrie Monarch" David Kalakaua, the last King of Hawaii. The King was an avid supporter of hula, the ancient Hawaiian tradition that combines dance, legend, religion, story-telling and music.
Besides dancing, there are displays of traditional Hawaiian crafts, a parade and free Hawaiian entertainment (including hula dancing) at various places in Hilo.
The actual competitive performances are staged at Hilo's tennis stadium, which is situated near the Hilo airport, on April 3, 4 and 5. The competition is expected to attract about 6,000 viewers.
Since 1981, tickets have sold out, typically by the end of January or the beginning of February, so you'll want to attain your ticket soon. Prices range from $5 for a single performance to $23 for three nights. Tickets are limited to two per person. To request tickets, send a money order or cashier's check payable to the Merrie Monarch Festival, and a self-addressed stamped evelope to: Merrie Monarch Festival, Hawaii Naniloa Hotel, 93 Banyan Drive, Hilo, Hawaii 96720. Orders will not be taken by telephone. For information, call the Merrie Monarch Festival office, (808) 935-9168.
 
Visiting the Aeolians
Q. Next summer, I will be renting a house on Salina, one of the Aeolian Islands. What is the most efficient and economic way to reach the island? Is there background information I should know? -- Joan Arcari, New York, N.Y.
A. The natural beauty of Salina, the second largest of the Aeolian Islands, is already familiar to those who saw the 1995 Italian movie "Il Postino," which was shot there. The island, with its terraced hillsides, dramatic coastline and a permanent population of less than 3,000, is one of the less popular sites on Italy's tourist trail; indeed Salina's reputation as a tourist spot is probably surpassed by its reputation as a producer of exceptional wine, capers and raisins.
There are three main towns -- Santa Marina Salina, Malfa and Leni -- which are linked by decent roads. Santa Marina, a cluster of small white houses on the east coast, is the largest town. Roman ruins are still visible near the town's beach. In the nearby volcanic grotto of the Saracen, carved altars and Christian emblems indicate the presence of an ancient Christian cult that may have dated to the third century.
From Santa Marina, you can drive to Lingua, on the south coast, and from there drive to the top of the 3,156-foot Monte Fossa delle Felci volcanic crater where you can view the surrounding islands. Monte Fossa delle Felci is one of the island's six inactive volcanoes.
Other sites on the four-mile-long, three-mile-wide island include the Sanctuary of the Madonna del Terzito where, according to tradition, the Madonna appeared on July 23, 1622.
The only way to reach the island is by sea. There are ferries and hydrofoils leaving both Naples and the Sicilian port of Milazzo almost on a daily basis throughout the summer.Last summer, from June 1 to Sept. 3 the SNAV company in Naples operated its hydrofoils daily, departing at 2:30 PM and arriving in Salina at 7:30 P.M. The schedule has yet to be set for next summer. Last summer's one-way tickets cost about $70. Information: (39-81) 761 2348. Another navigation company, Siremar-Agenzia Genovese has daily ferries (excluding Wednesday) departing Naples at 9 P.M. and arriving in Salina at 8:30 A.M. the following day. Tickets cost $78. Prices and schedule are subject to change.
 
Globe Theater Schedule
Q. I will be in London for several weeks next summer, and would like to attend a performance at the Globe Theater. What plays will be performed, and how I may get tickets? -- Louis Schmidt, Seattle
After 10 years of construction, Shakespeare's Globe Theater on London's South Bank at Southwark will open for its first full season next summer. Four plays will be performed in repertory during the 1997 season, two of which will be "Henry V" and "The Winter's Tale." The other two are expected to be announced in February.
The plays will be performed by the Globe Theater Company, consisting of 30 actors, including 4 Americans. Richard Olivier, son of Joan Plowright and the late Lord Olivier, will direct "Henry V" and the Globe's artistic director, Mark Rylance, will play the lead role. David Freeman, associate artist of the English National Opera and founder of the Opera Factory in Sydney, Zurich and London, will direct "The Winter's Tale."
Previews will run from May 27 to June 7. The regular theater season will recommence on June 24 and will run until Sept. 21.
Tickets for the general public will go on sale on March 3. Prices range from $8.50 to $34. Information: (44-171) 401 9919.
The plays will be staged in the new "wooden O" theater, which seats about 1,000, with 500 places for "groundlings" who stand in the open air yard around the stage. The theater's permanent stage and tiring house (the backstage area where actors attire themselves) are still under construction. It is possible to visit the exhibition and tour the theater to see master craftsmen, thatchers and plasterers at work, using 400-year-old techniques and materials. The tours, which are offered throughout the year, cost $8.50. The entire project, which will include a 300-seat indoor theater modeled after a 1617 design by Inigo Jones, a restaurant, shopping area and a Shakespeare exhibition to be housed beneath the complex, is expected to be completed in 1999.

These scholars scrutinize scientists as though they were merely members of another tribe, like teen-age mall rats or the Taliban, compelled by their own peculiar cultural influences. Needless to say, some scientists have not taken kindly to this treatment. In recent meetings and books, scientists have denounced science studies as pretentious gibberish at best, and at worst as a left-wing plot to undermine science.
Some science studies invite such criticism simply by choice of topics. There seems little point to probing the cultural soil within which, say, the theory of stellar fusion took root; the salient fact is that the theory is true. But when applied to the right field and carefully done, science studies more than proves its worth. It points the way to a science that is more self-aware and thus more capable of achieving what the philosopher Sandra Harding calls "strong objectivity." "The Idea of Biodiversity" demonstrates the genre's potential. The author, David Takacs, who obtained a joint degree in science studies and environmental science from Cornell University and who now teaches at California State University, Monterey Bay, scrutinizes conservation biology, whose adherents are attempting both to document humanity's destruction of nature and to arrest it. This analysis is timely, coming as it does when an anti-environmental "brownlash" has the green movement on its heels. In the confessional mode that post-modern anthropologists call "I-witnessing," Mr. Takacs emphasizes that his is a biased account. He believes that the questions raised by conservation biologists are the most important facing humanity today, and he shares their passionate love of nature. Yet he also thinks conservation biologists need to be more self-critical, especially since they mix scientific aims -- the discovery of truths about nature -- with political ones.
Early on, he shows how proto-conservation biologists like Aldo Leopold and Rachel Carson placed their facts at the service of their beliefs to persuade society to take better care of nature. He includes extended profiles of Inbio, a Costa Rican preserve that has become a kind of laboratory for testing conservation strategies, and of Edward O. Wilson, who has transformed himself over the last two decades from the dark prince of sociobiology into the archangel of the environmental movement.
But the core of the book consists of Mr. Takacs's interviews with more than a score of conservation biologists, ranging from the tough-talking Cassandra Paul Ehrlich, who has been warning about the dangers of overpopulation for decades, to Thomas Eisner, the St. Francis of bugs. Mr. Takacs asks his sources various questions: What is biodiversity? How should it best be protected? Can science achieve complete objectivity? Then he ponders the responses. His goal is not to play "Gotcha!" or to flaunt his own cleverness, as some scurrilous science critics do, but to reveal tensions and contradictions that he believes should be recognized, if not resolved. He shows, for example, how Mr. Wilson, Mr. Eisner and others manufactured the buzzword "biodiversity" during the 1980's to serve their political ends. The word conveys much the same meaning as "nature" or "wildlife" but adds a glossy scientific sheen. As Mr. Takacs puts it, the term "is a tool for a zealous defense of a particular social construction of nature."
Unfortunately, as science evolves, the meaning of such terms may change in ways that are not always politically expedient. Ecologists once implied that nature exists in a state of equilibrium and harmony disrupted only by human intervention, but they now depict nature as dynamic, mutable; it is a process rather than a collection of things. This shift in perspective has spurred a debate over whether the Endangered Species Act should be abandoned for a more "holistic" approach that focuses on "habitats" or "ecosystems" rather than on individual species. But as one biologist notes drily, ecosystems "have no big, brown eyes to endear themselves to the public." Environmentalists are also deeply divided over the degree to which their programs should respect the cultures of indigenous people, and all people, for that matter. Some advocate policies -- such as mandatory birth control and restrictions on the rights of Indians to convert jungle into farmland -- that would sharply curtail human diversity.
One of Mr. Takacs's central concerns is the increasingly popular proposal that preserving biodiversity makes economic sense; a nameless weed or beetle in that patch of threatened rain forest may contain an enzyme that can cure cancer or the common cold. Some biologists admit that they adopt this argument not because they believe it, but because it helps to enlist governments and companies in the cause. Mr. Takacs fears that if the claims are shown to be exaggerated, they may backfire. Moreover, he writes, "these economic arguments allow the hubristic, violent way we treat the earth to continue."
"The Idea of Biodiversity" does not have the flair of, say, one of Mr. Wilson's lyrical polemics. I wish Mr. Takacs had reworked his manuscript once more to prune redundancies and jargon. (Stephen Hawking once said that every formula in a science book reduces its potential readership by half; surely the same is true of the awful word "normative," which Mr. Takacs and other academics unaccountably find irresistible.)
Mr. Takacs beats some rather obvious points to death -- like the squishiness of such terms as "biodiversity" and "nature" -- and the long, unedited excerpts from his interviews become wearying at times. On the other hand, the rawness of the material allows -- even invites -- readers to draw their own conclusions rather than merely to submit to those presented by Mr. Takacs. My own reading left me rather ambivalent. Although I try to color myself green, I was disturbed by the self-righteousness and absolutism of conservationists like Hugh Iltis, who declares we must do all we can to save every species on earth. This goal seems neither realistic nor reasonable. I'm delighted that my children do not encounter wolves in our backyard, or elephants, or malaria, as inhabitants of less developed regions do. The declaration that "biodiversity is good" recalls the antiwar axiom that "nuclear war is bad." No sane person would disagree with either sentiment. Contention arises when one considers how these values should be reconciled with others, like our desire for freedom or comfort or consumer products. And, as David Takacs shows, knowing how to balance these competing values can be extremely difficult.
That said, I'm not sure I agree with Mr. Takacs that conservation biologists should spend more time examining their motives and assumptions. Would the world really be better off if eco-warriors like Mr. Ehrlich or Mr. Wilson began indulging in Hamlet-style introspection, given that their opponents are hardly likely to do the same? In some areas of science, as in the law, the adversary system may be a necessary evil.

THE BANKERS
 The Next Generation.
 By Martin Mayer.
 514 pp. New York:
 Truman Talley Books/Dutton. $29.95. 
 Martin Mayer isn't just a business writer, he's a phenomenon. He has churned out a slew of popular nonfiction books about money and the people who rake it in. And hardly a month goes by without some smart, tart opinion piece appearing under his byline. Moreover, he apparently thinks he can do just about anything well, and he's gone a long way toward proving it.
He has published three novels, including a thriller and a political potboiler. He has analyzed social studies curriculums for the American Council of Learned Societies and was chairman of a district school board in New York City. He has dabbled at television criticism, and crossed party lines to serve as a member of Ronald Reagan's National Commission on Housing. And he has still found the time to write about music, currently serving as the New York critic for Opera magazine in London.
"The Bankers: The Next Generation," written from his perch as a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, is nominally an update of his 1975 best seller. In fact, it is an excuse for Mr. Mayer to share his latest erudite, witty and only occasionally jargon-choked observations about the industry that makes the world go round.
Mr. Mayer understands that banking is not everyone's cup of tea. So he laces the dreary parts with oddball facts and believe-it-or-not history. Between lessons on how the payments system underpins capitalism, we learn that Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase (as in the Chase bank) decided to give Ulysses S. Grant a break, deferring a ruling that paper currency was unconstitutional until the President had a chance to pack the Supreme Court with friendly faces. That A. P. Giannini, founder of the Bank of America, lent money to Walt Disney to make the first animated feature, "Snow White," over the protests of the banker's brother and son. That thousands of people who challenged their credit card bills from Macy's in its last days before bankruptcy walked away without paying.
By the same token, Mr. Mayer never hesitates to digress on the trail of a delicious put-down. When Darla Moore, a vice president of Chemical Bank, was told by the octogenarian Prentice Hale of the Carter Hawley Hale department stores, "You are unlike any banker I have ever met. So lovely -- and bright," she replied, "There are lots of lovely girls at Chemical Bank, and we're all bright."
Or take Jimmy Lee, a superstar at the Chase Bank, on why it's still necessary to schmooze the corporate clients in an era of whiz-kid deal making: "People don't do business with you because you're a geek and you can do regressions in your head. They come to do business with you because they like you."
Nor does Mr. Mayer pass up opportunities to dish the high and mighty. We discover that Leo Melamed, the child of Yiddish teachers who created the financial futures markets, "made his first real money in the pork-bellies pit." And we are reminded that Alan Greenspan, keeper of the nation's money supply, was once a devotee of Ayn Rand. "I have a precious copy of a truly nutty piece he wrote for her magazine," Mr. Mayer says, and he cannot resist quoting from it: "In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. . . . This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists' tirades against gold."
But the meat and potatoes of "The Bankers" is often so satisfying that the fancy plating is a lagniappe. Mr. Mayer devotes a hefty chapter to the 1995 fiasco of Barings Bank, in which the 233-year-old, oh-so-British institution was brought down by Nicholas Leeson, a 27-year-old clerk newly promoted to trader in its Singapore office. While the story has been told before, nobody tells it more archly.
It seems that Mr. Leeson was supposed to be "arbitraging" differences in prices between very similar securities traded on the Singapore, Osaka and Tokyo exchanges. The idea, reduced to essentials, was to buy the cheap version and sell the expensive one, locking in a profit at the end of each trading day. But Barings, for all its blue blood, was very green in the trading of the synthetic securities (called derivatives) that have made it possible for bankers to bet on practically anything from the difference on the interest paid on United States Treasury bills and bonds to the number of eggs it will take to buy a share of each stock in the Dow Jones Transportation Index. And nobody in London -- not the directors of Barings, not the stuffed shirts at its regulator, the Bank of England -- bothered to ask why Mr. Leeson was borrowing money, until he was in the hole to the tune of $1.1 billion, or twice the bank's net worth.
Even more impressive is the account of America's $300 billion savings-and-loan debacle, whose causes Mr. Mayer probably understands as well as anyone on the planet. He traces the disaster from its origins in the irresponsible decision of the state of California to let the thrifts lend money to real estate hustlers to the appointment of Danny Wall, a former architect without a lick of knowledge about banking, as the chief S. & L. regulator. Thus, while most commentators have focused on the bounders, Mr. Mayer sees the story primarily as one of bad government -- of "the systematic, sometimes ignorant and sometimes deliberate misdiagnosis of the disease that was wasting the business, and the administration of quack remedies in response."
But certainly the most original analysis in this book is of the revolution in banking that is being driven by technology. Mr. Mayer explains how credit cards, automated teller machines, electronic funds transfers, Internet transactions and "smart cards" that substitute for money are eroding the ground under the financial establishment and turning banking into a competitive free-for-all. The promise: $40 billion in annual savings in the United States alone. The worry: a global payments system that is beyond the capacity of governments to understand, let alone regulate wisely.
"The Bankers" can be heavy going for the uninitiated. But that's just Mr. Mayer showing off. Follow his usually delightful ramble though the board rooms and byways of high finance, and you'll learn more about banking than you ever thought you wanted to know.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Generations On the Move

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
INTERGENERATIONAL travel sounds a bit like intergalactic travel, and in some ways it may be that far out: grandparents and grandchildren who may not know each other well set out on a trip to an unfamiliar place, often where the language is unknown.
The combination of 55-plus and 17-minus, while not nearly so common as family travel -- parents traveling with their children -- has grown in importance in the last 10 years. Its increase is linked to the large number of children of divorce and of families in which both parents work outside the home, leaving little time for vacations. The increase in the number of grandparents who retire before 65 also means there are more active people who can handle vacationing children and who may be better able to pay the bills. 
 The rub with intergenerational travel is that grandparent and grandchild may live far apart and almost certainly have different life styles. Custody decisions may mean that a grandparent is seldom even discussed. Turning these relatives into roommates for 10 or 14 nights is not accomplished by benevolence and money alone.
Dr. Robert P. McCaffery of the Familyhostel program, which operates summer overseas trips for adults and children related to them, warns that 24-hour-a-day togetherness can sour fast. Travel in groups, he says, provides time for adults to take a break while the children are involved in other activities.
"Children need to relate to children," said Helena T. Koenig, the owner of Grandtravel in Washington. "There is only so much beauty you can impart to a child at once."
Both of these group travel sponsors provide time for children to be with children, particularly at the end of the day, and to get vigorous exercise. Dr. McCaffery said that his organization had tested staying in suburbs to provide more space, or perhaps a pool at the hotel, but discovered that the travelers still preferred the convenience of lodgings downtown for urban destinations.
The Familyhostel program was spun off by the University of New Hampshire, sponsor of Interhostel. For this seventh year, it is offering six 10-day educational trips for grandparents or parents -- sometimes both -- and children 8 to 15 years old. The maximum group is 40 people; the minimum is 17.
The trips are to Provence and Paris; Paris and Normandy; Vienna; Switzerland; Wales and London. The adult prices range from $1,925 to $2,975; for the children, from $1,665 to $2,895, all with air fare included, in multiple-occupancy rooms. Familyhostel, 6 Garrison Avenue, Durham, N.H. 03824; (800) 733-9753 or (603) 862-1147.

Worldwide Destinations
Grandtravel is offering 17 tours this year. When Ms. Koenig created this company in 1987 as a division of the Ticket Counter, her Chevy Chase, Md., travel agency, she offered a trip to Washington, one to the Southwest and a safari to Kenya. She still has these three, plus the 14 others, most with two departure dates. Although the recession a few years ago brought a patch of no growth -- Grandtravel's offerings are expensive -- Ms. Koenig says that as she has added trips, they have continued to fill with her usual maximum of 26.
Other Grandtravel offerings are in the Pacific Northwest, the Grand Canyon, Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota; Hawaii; Ireland, England and Scotland, London and Paris; the French countryside; Italy; Munich, Salzburg, Vienna and Prague; Spain and Australia. The cost for nine nights in Hawaii, without air fare, is $4,590 for an adult in a double, $4,380 for a child. Grand travel, 6900 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 706, Chevy Chase, Md. 20815; (800) 247-7651; (301) 986-0790.
Both Familyhostel and Interhostel use teachers as escorts. "We thought we wanted experts in the area or the material," Dr. McCaffery, a historian, said, "but we really needed the middle-school or elementary teacher who knew the kids' span of attention and level of understanding."
In the pure adventure category is a high-priced company, Rascals in Paradise, a division of Adventure Express in San Francisco. It is in its 10th year of "distinctive family vacations," with yacht charters in Turkey and Tahiti and trips to Africa, Hawaii, Alaska and Australia. The adults are more often parents than grandparents, but grandparents who enjoy things like scuba diving will find opportunities here. The prices are still being set, but as an example, a Tahiti charter for up to eight people is quoted at $2,090 a day. Rascals in Paradise, 650 Fifth Street, Suite 505, San Francisco, Calif. 94107; (800) 872-7225 or (415) 978-9800.
Ms. Koenig's typical clients are a grandmother and a child whose parents are divorced. Sometimes two grandparents will take two children. The overall boy-girl ratio is 50-50, although some trips attract more of one sex than the other.
The Grandtravel ages are 7 to 17, and often one departure of a trip will be designed for the 7 to 11's, the other for 12 to 17's. Grandtravel has booked grandchildren going up in steps in succeeding years; younger children may hear from older ones and want the same trip exactly.

Establishing Who's Boss
Whether inside the rather firm structure provided by an intergenerational tour or moving at will, the travel companions need to reach basic agreements early on.
It must be established who is in charge. "Once it's clear that it is to be done Grandma's way," Ms. Koe nig said, "then everything falls into place." At the packing stage, for example, if a child resists taking a raincoat, the parent says that the raincoat must be packed because otherwise it will be too much stress for the grandparent. Rules about leaving the group and getting permission for certain things need to be made clear.
The "days at leisure" found so frequently in itineraries for adults are not found in intergenerational schedules. Grandfather may be buckling, but the kids are still going like Energizer bunnies.
Helen Richer of Laguna Hills, Calif., who took her 15-year-old grandson, Ian Richer, to Japan in 1991 on a conventional escorted tour, did not use the word stress, but said, "You take on a huge responsibility." She said she offered Ian a trip anywhere he wanted because her husband had recently died, she wanted to resume traveling, and Ian is her oldest grandchild. She had never been to Japan, and it was expensive -- $10,000 for the two of them -- but Ian loved the trip, and was always the first off the bus with his camera. Only one other child, a boy of 13, was along.
On Grandtravel tours, no child stays in a room without an adult, so the issue of how late the light or television stays on is to be resolved by the grandparent and grandchild. Mrs. Richer was usually ready to turn in by evening, so often her grandson did exploring on his own, with a card in hand bearing the hotel name and address in Japanese.
Ms. Koenig said that grandparents needed to realize that "it is no longer a crisis when a child misses a meal." When Mrs. Richer and Ian craved familiar food, they went together to McDonald's.
What do the grandparents get from the trip? "They are energized, they come alive." Ms. Koenig said. "They have that responsibility again."

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
A Crystal Palace of Culture and Commerce

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
JAPAN'S NEW TOKYO International Forum is such a perfectly realized building that you may actually find yourself hoping that a flaw will turn up. Everything about this complex of theaters and convention halls has been thought through with precision. The only thing it can be faulted for is a pursuit of excellence so unyielding that it seems to not quite deserve a place in our world of scintillating compromise.
Designed by the New York architect Rafael Vinoly, the $1.5 billion Forum opened on Friday. His design was selected in 1989 from among 395 entries in Japan's first international competition. The architect may be best known in the United States for the sports center at Lehman College in the Bronx (his most important New York project to date). A current project is the design for a new sports stadium for Princeton University to replace Palmer Stadium. 
 Vinoly's design for the monumental Forum flies in the face of architectural history, or at least runs against the current preoccupations of many leading contemporary architects. It is lucid, whole and completely straightforward, qualities that have not enjoyed wide favor in architecture for some time. A text is not needed to comprehend it. It does not speak in codes. Some will call it modern, but it is a tribute to this building's strength that one wants to protect it from standard appellations of style and taste. In a lecture, Vinoly once said that architecture is "an art of dealing with heaviness," and that is what you get here: a feat of creativity in which floors, ceilings and walls have been made to soar.
The Forum occupies a privileged site in the heart of Tokyo, steps away from the city's main train station and a five-minute walk from the Imperial Palace Gardens. Though built with private money, the Forum is a civic, indeed a national, symbol, a monument to Japan's global economic power.
It is a hybrid building: a place where concerts and other performing arts events will take place amid trade fairs and conventions: Lincoln Center crossed with the Javits Center, in effect. Americans can be discomforted by the mixing of culture and commerce, but in Japan, the most progressive art is typically displayed in department stores. There's nothing contrary about a building that brings Kabuki, Beethoven and cars together under the same roof.
And what a roof! Hagia Sophia, the Guggenheim Museum and Grand Central Terminal have a new cousin. By day a glittering crystal, at night a glowing lantern, the Forum's Glass Hall joins the ranks of the world's great spaces. Like some lighter-than-air vessel, the hall's shipshape roofing slices through the Tokyo cityscape. The atrium roof of metal and glass was designed in collaboration with the structural engineer Kunio Watanabe. It is wonderful to see that even in a built-up contemporary city, a strong horizontal arc can become a landmark as emphatically as a skyscraper.
As you approach, the Forum divides itself into two structures joined by a public plaza. The Glass Hall rises on one side, tapering to a blade-sharp corner at both ends. On the other side, the Forum's four main meeting halls occupy a graduated row of gray concrete cubes. The plaza is actually more like a two-blocklong pedestrian promenade. Beautifully landscaped and furnished with seating, the plaza is meant to be an oasis for office workers in the financial district nearby. The visual effect of this outdoor space is of a man-made ravine, a portage between rippling glass reflections and a cliff of faceted gray stone.
You will want to go into the Glass Hall immediately, but first you ought to look at the fire stairs set between the concrete cubes. These are the Rolex of fire stairs, immaculately engineered cascades of open-mesh steel that rise without a crude or wasted motion. If you climb a flight or two of them, you will get the key to the whole building.
It's almost unheard of for architects today to devote themselves to this level of detail. We pretend not to mind, because if we did we'd go crazy. We accept that architects develop concepts, sketches, drawings and models, and then hand the project over to an "associated" firm to create the physical object in space. Here we're dealing with a radically different economy of mind. The bolt beneath our feet emerged from the same esthetic intelligence that conceived the space around it. An architect is making architecture, and we almost can't stand it. It is dizzying to realize that excellence is a polite term for obsession.
And these are just the back stairs. Officially, people arriving to attend functions at the forum will enter from the opposite side, facing the street. Once inside, you grasp that Vinoly has chosen to celebrate Japan's power with a lavish display of the country's scarcest commodity: space. There hasn't been a spatial sweep like this since the Paris Opera House: wide lobbies with floors of white glass illuminated from below lead to escalator banks of such glamour that you may have to squelch the impulse to ride them twice. Or give into it. At the top of the escalators are mezzanines with glass walls that look out to the plaza and back down to the entrance lobbies. The play of reflections infinitely expands the interior's already sizable three dimensions.
The Forum's four meeting halls are misnamed. They go by letters of the alphabet and ought to start out small, but Hall D is the smallest. This is a screening room intended mostly for showing movies about Tokyo and Japan to foreign visitors. Black leather seats, luxurious darkness. Hall C is the gem of the lot, startlingly warm in the midst of so much glass, steel and concrete, a resonant interior of wood, related to the rest of the building by the rectilinear geometry of the sculptured walls. The impression is of being inside a Cubist violin.
Hall B is a banquet hall, a showplace for the wedding reception that went to heaven but still in the end a banquet hall, its impressively high ceilings functionally justified by the hot air destined to rise nightly from the rostrum. Hall A: Unimaginably huge, said to be Japan's largest theater. Kabuki time. Ice-skating spectaculars. Madonna. Michael Jackson. The walls here, too, are of illuminated glass, set at mind-bending angles that make you feel giddy but somehow bring the last row closer to the stage. The point is, it all works.
Now go into the Glass Hall. The moment of entrance recalls a visitor's first sight of the upper chapel of Ste.-Chapelle. The Glass Hall is not a church, and this is 20th-century Japan, not 13th-century France. But this is as good as space gets without age and religion to mold its character. And the sense of it is Gothic: just two slim columns support the skeletal frame from which the structure is hung. The impression is of watching trapeze artists at work within the world's largest marquise diamond.
THE AWESOME IMPRESSION isn't solely due to the hall's height and transparency. It also comes from the discovery that a transparent object can hold so much surprise.
Just inside the entrance, the floor drops away from ground level to reveal the third major component of the Forum: an underground exposition hall that runs nearly the full length of the site. The plaza is this hall's roof. In a master stroke of space craft, what appeared to be solid ground is flattened into a thin horizontal plane. Conference rooms for the conventioneers are ranged in rows along the wall opposite the plaza. Like the entire hall these spaces muffle the noise from the curving train tracks from which the hall takes it shape.
The Forum has been criticized by Japanese architects. They are careful to point out that what bothers them is not the building's design but its commercial function in the center of the city. The Tokyo Forum went up around the same time as a new museum of contemporary art, a building on Tokyo's outskirts. Arata Isozaki, Japan's leading architect, among others, thinks that the locations should have been reversed. He regards the Forum as the symbol of Japan's bloated bubble economy.
Isozaki's view is part of the soul-searching going on throughout Japan today following the bubble's collapse. But the Tokyo Forum is a very bad symbol of the excesses of the bubble economy. Not even Tadao Ando has produced a building with greater moral and esthetic integrity. And it's that rigor, I suspect, that disturbs some architects.
This is an absolutist building. The scrupulousness of Vinoly's detailing and the clarity of his esthetic are of a piece. It has the authority of a True Faith. And we're not supposed to believe in that concept anymore. We're supposed to be allergic to the sort of canons laid down by the modern movement.
And yet this building possesses none of the shortcomings for which modernist buildings were faulted. It is not visually impoverished. It does not lack delight. No major public building designed by a post-modern architect is as elegant or as full of surprise. Walking through it, you don't even think "modernism," "functionalism" or "machines for living." You think about George Balanchine. Or a thoroughbred race horse. Or ancient Greece. You think about physical poise.
Perhaps this building's disturbing power is that it challenges the True Faith of relativism, pluralism and the mediocrities that those beliefs have sent spinning in the world. It upholds a belief in reason that predates the modern movement. It is 18th century, not 20th, in its outlook, and the outlook is fine. The enduring value of European Enlightenment: that is what's right about Vinoly's contribution to modern Japan.

A Maestro Takes Fond Leave of an Old Love

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

DATELINE: LEIPZIG, Germany

 BODY:
EVEN IN NEW YORK, THE 6 foot-3-inch figure of Kurt Masur looms large. Just ask the members of the New York Philharmonic, who have toiled in his shadow for the last five and a half years. Mr. Masur's diminutive Japanese wife, Tomoko Sakurai, and her family call him the Elephant and give him elephant tchotchkes. But in Leipzig, a storied cultural capital, where memories of Bach and Mendelssohn, Goethe and Schiller have been fitfully preserved, Mr. Masur is regarded as a peer among giants, and his physical size is only a part of his stature.
"He is a great personality, a good human being," said a taxi driver here who, having learned that his passenger was a music critic, was eager to discuss Mr. Masur's most recent concert. 
 He is known everywhere. Museum administrators rush to welcome him, waiving admission fees despite his protestations. Autograph hunters besiege him in restaurants. Heads follow him on the street. A commanding "Masur here" on the telephone is enough to make a baggage tracer at the airport leap into action if not necessarily produce results.
It is against this backdrop of esteem, even love, that Mr. Masur, now 69, begins to sever his ties to the city to concentrate his energies more fully in New York. "To these people, he is like Michael Jordan in the States," said the American tenor John Aler, who recently joined Mr. Masur and the Gewandhaus Orchestra in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
Year-end performances of that work are traditional in Leipzig, where Schiller wrote his "Ode to Joy," which is used in its choral finale. The legendary maestro Arthur Nikisch set the precedent on New Year's Eve, 1918, with a concert in the name of peace and freedom, causes that were highly charged at the time.
The four performances this season took on added significance as Mr. Masur's official farewell to the Gewandhaus, a 253-year-old orchestral association named for the fabric trading house it came to occupy in 1781. In his 26-year tenure as Kapellmeister, he raised the orchestra to new levels of execution and spurred construction of a magnificent new concert hall in 1981. He also thrust the institution into the center of the city's -- indeed, the nation's -- consciousness with his role as a mediator in the peaceful revolution of 1989, which led to the reunification of Germany and a variety of unforeseen consequences, not all of them good.
Since becoming music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1991, Mr. Masur has divided his time equally between the two organizations in alternating three-week periods. But he gave his last performance as Kapellmeister of the Gewandhaus on New Year's Eve. At its end, he was named the orchestra's honorary conductor in an emotional ceremony on stage, and he gave his first performance in that capacity on New Year's Day. Then he quietly handed his master key for the building, which he had conceived and ruled in virtually every detail, to his deft and devoted assistant, Christa Heyner.
If ever a mere human faced the daunting task of replacing an institution, it is the Swedish conductor Herbert Blomstedt, formerly of the San Francisco Symphony, who will conduct the Beethoven concerts at the Gewandhaus next December and take over as Kapellmeister in 1998. Mr. Masur, meanwhile, will maintain a presence in the city and tend to its cultural legacy in ways that he outlined in a series of leisurely conversations. In particular, he will continue his campaign to rehabilitate Mendelssohn's house and reinforce his reputation, emulating Mendelssohn's own activities in the city a century and a half ago on behalf of Bach.
BUT HERE BEETHOVEN was the concern, and Mr. Masur's performance of the Ninth Symphony on New Year's Eve, attended by many of his family members, friends and colleagues, and televised in the region, was especially powerful, with the conductor holding the audience in stunned silence for half a minute at its end. At the big statement of Schiller's phrase "All men will become brothers under your gentle wing," Mr. Masur opened the music out in an expansive, bearlike embrace.
"I was never only conducting music," Mr. Masur said in a reminiscent mood in his bright, spacious corner office at the Gewandhaus. "I always thought that we musicians have a role which is much more meaningful. We can make people understand each other. We can make people understand that on the other side of the world there is also culture."
Mr. Masur was certainly more than a conductor in the events of 1989. By his account, a resistance movement had been building in East Germany for a decade, eventually including 70 percent of the population. In Leipzig, it centered on Monday evening peace prayers in the historic Nikolaikirche, or St. Nicholas Church.
On Oct. 9, after a weekend during which the Government had flexed its repressive muscles in Dresden and Berlin, it mounted a show of force in Leipzig, complete with army tanks and water trucks full of tear gas. A group of concerned citizens including Mr. Masur -- the Leipzig Six, as they came to be known -- met at his house and formulated a plea for calm and order and a promise to hold public discussions. Mr. Masur read the statement over a loudspeaker system covering the entire center of the city. In response, some 70,000 demonstrators mustered peacefully outside the Gewandhaus at concert time, carrying candles and chanting Mr. Masur's name.
"They only made me a kind of hero because it was my voice that read the message," said Mr. Masur, who for a time was touted as a possible Presidential candidate, a notion he denies ever having seriously entertained.
"Even the soldiers retreated, and not a window was broken," he added. "No one could have believed that this would be a signal for the whole country."
NOR COULD ANYONE IN East Germany have anticipated the myriad effects of sudden reunification with the West and a return to a free-market economy. The unified Government, which has yet to unite the country spiritually, missed a golden opportunity, Mr. Masur explained, sounding like the politician he professes not to be. For the good of the nation and the region, it could have allowed the former East Germany to continue supplying Eastern European countries, which had come to depend on its production. Instead, fearing that bad old attitudes and alliances might linger, it shut industries down.
As a result, Leipzig has become a poor city again, Mr. Masur noted as he revisited old haunts, his and those of historic luminaries. Its population has shrunk from 500,000 to 400,000 in recent years, he said, with young people fleeing in droves. Although the cranes and scaffolding of new construction and reconstruction are everywhere, the unemployment rate is 17 percent.
Things could be worse, of course. Mr. Masur vividly described the last great wave of deprivation and reconstruction in the city, after it had been bombed out in World War II. Born in Brieg, Silesia (now in Poland), in 1927, he came here in 1946 to study at the conservatory. Heat and food were scarce, and the students took their teachers lumps of coal as partial payment, he said. But spirits were often high, as he and his fellows played in swing clubs and discovered a wheat beer that could keep them drunk for three days running. Even the new political regime inspired optimism for a time.
What seems to disturb him most now are cavalier and Philistine attitudes emanating from the West. After so many years of despair produced by Stalinism and its aftermath, the recent burst of optimism has already faded. Under a new lord mayor from the West, the city has come to treat its wondrous cultural legacy as a burden, said Mr. Masur, who has become one of its prime spokesmen and defenders.
He had intended to leave the Gewandhaus after its 250th-anniversary season, in 1994, he explained, but he agreed to stay through last year to continue fighting for the institution, as the Government withdrew a subsidy of $1.3 million. "There was a great danger for the Gewandhaus to be reduced to just another local orchestra," he said. He even considered staying on until Mr. Blomstedt's arrival next year, but he found the terms offered by the city demeaning and decided to call it quits.
"Masur is a figure inextricably linked with musical life in Leipzig," said Georg Christoph Biller, the latest successor to Bach here as cantor of the Thomaskirche, which, along with the Leipzig Opera, is also served by the 187-member Gewandhaus Orchestra. "He has come to symbolize the integration of its various aspects, for he studied here and his artistic biography is closely tied to the city. He means very much to the Leipzig tradition, which also means very much to him, and he gives it direction. His departure will be a serious loss."
Although Mr. Masur plans to spend more time in New York now, he and his wife, a professional soprano and former violist, are keeping their rambling house here, complete with a Japanese-style garden and a heated outdoor swimming pool. His pet project at the moment is the reconstruction of the house Mendelssohn used to live in.
The building is now "in criminal condition," he said, and a quick tour gave confirmation. But he had just coaxed $650,000 out of city coffers and a commitment of $2 million more, leaving another $650,000 to be raised privately. Work is well under way, and a Mendelssohn festival is planned around the reopening of the house as a museum in November.
"What you very often hear in this city," Mr. Masur said, "is: 'We have to care for Bach. He is more famous than Mendelssohn.' And I become furious about that crazy, stupid idea. For Leipzig, Bach was important only 100 years after he died. Even then, the ministers wouldn't let his music be performed in the Thomaskirche until they discovered that Bach brought the people into the church. But Mendelssohn was important here during his lifetime."
Indeed, Bach was largely forgotten in Leipzig until Mendelssohn himself took up his cause, conducting the "St. Matthew Passion" in the Thomaskirche in 1841 and erecting a monument two years later. (That monument, dominated by its pedestal, is not to be confused with the more familiar statue, installed early in this century near the Thomaskirche.) In addition to founding the city's conservatory, in 1843, and enriching musical life with his adventurous programming as Kapellmeister of the Gewandhaus, Mendelssohn was largely responsible for instilling the historical sensibility to which Mr. Masur has fallen heir.
Now the Thomaskirche, like so many of Leipzig's treasures, is run down, and restoration stalled recently when city funds ran out. One end is anomalously clean. "We like the other part better," Mr. Masur said, "because it is nice and old."
Still, for all his attentions to Mendelssohn, Mr. Masur is by no means insensitive to the cause of Bach. In February 1998, he will expand on his already distinguished series of Bach performances with the New York Philharmonic by importing the choir of the Thomaskirche, for its first appearance in the United States. And to judge from performances heard here, that group of young men and boys may be finer now than when it was led by a ceaselessly harassed and frustrated Bach.
So now the Philharmonic has Mr. Masur's full attention, and it is a house in at least slight disarray: a project for a man ever in search of one. After reports of grumbling among the players a few years ago, Mr. Masur recently crossed swords with the management.
"We still have to find each other in the kind of openness and communication which I believe is necessary," Mr. Masur said, choosing his words more carefully than he sometimes has. "We have had difficulties and different ideas, and this is dangerous, especially if someone is accused of not understanding box-office needs because he is not American.
"It limits your fantasy to ask first, 'Does it sell?' and only second, 'Is this what the New York Philharmonic wants to bring out?' We have to find a way that we all have the same direction in mind."
When Mr. Masur took over the Philharmonic, he disclosed hopes, perhaps a bit naive, that the orchestra could achieve a kind of centrality in the life of its city comparable to that of the Gewandhaus in Leipzig. He has made strides and envisions others, still hoping to install something like the summer London Proms concerts in the Seventh Regiment Armory on the East Side of Manhattan. Still, with the differences between the cities, a situation like that in Leipzig was probably never possible in New York.
It may be too bad, because to see Mr. Masur sweep all before him here to good effect is to realize that New York has yet to see the full measure of the man.

HEADLINE: OUT OF ORDER;
Oh, How I Missed Long Island

BYLINE: By DAVID BOUCHIER; David Bouchier of Wading River is an essayist and commentator heard regularly on public radio.

 BODY:
I AM still in recovery from our trip to Florida over the holidays.
Just three hours from MacArthur Airport, we arrived on what might have been an alien planet. 
Driving the rental car out of the futuristic bowels of Tampa International, we found ourselves on a wide, almost empty highway lined with palm trees. The sun blazed down out of a blue sky. The air-conditioner had to be found and switched on.
Adults were seen strolling in public places, wearing shorts. If it had not been for the reassuring landscape of signs that said 7-Eleven, Burger King, Pizza Hut, McDonald's and so on, we might have panicked and taken the next flight back to Islip.
Our destination, the City of St. Petersburg Beach, added to the feeling of unreality. The beach is dominated by a grandiose pink castle in the Moorish taste called the Don Cesar Hotel.
None of the hotels along the beach conform to the standard Long Island pattern. They are shaped like birthday cakes, rocket ships or illustrations from geometry textbooks. When we arrived at our room, in a hotel shaped like a chef's hat, we stepped onto a balcony that overlooked the beach, which curved away brilliant and white in both directions.
Inadequately dressed young women were strolling on the sand. Bronzed youths were out in the ocean, windsailing and roaring around on power skis.
This was glamour! We had escaped from the mundane world of cold and sleet, overflowing cesspools and long delays at Exit 48.
It seemed right to begin the vacation with a sophisticated meal. We dressed with some care. But the hotel restaurant had a large sign that said, "Any Apparel Acceptable," and the customers had taken that seriously.
This was not the trendy New York dining crowd. This was "The Muppet Show" in human form. The menu had four tired dishes -- chicken, fish, meat and pasta -- and two wines, red and white.
Obviously we had not hit the precisely right spot for a glamorous beachfront meal. But that evening we decided to experience the high point of St. Petersburg Beach nightlife, the revolving bar on top of the tower.
Alas, the revolving bar was tired and tacky, and it creaked uneasily as it turned. Gloomy waitresses, bulging out of their miniskirts, delivered watery drinks at astronomical prices.
A four-piece band played in the center, rising to ear-splitting volume as our revolving table passed them and then mercifully faded away. The advertised sunset spectacular was somewhat eclipsed by the view from the other side, an all-night beachwear store lighted in such brilliant green and yellow neon that it put the sunset to shame.
The glamour of Florida was beginning to wear a bit thin. But any graduate of Travel and Tourism 101 will say glamour is all in the mind. Its called "the Trump effect," and it works only at a distance. As soon as you go there and do it yourself, the glamour evaporates like a snowball in the microwave.
But if it works so well for the Florida State Tourist Board, surely we can make it work for us here?
Half the citizens of Long Island flee to Florida every winter, taking money and business with them. How can we make Floridians abandon their comfortable style of life and visit Long Island in the dead of winter?
The Florida travel brochures suggest several strategies. Like any tourist promoter, we have to emphasize the positive and eliminate the negative. First, the absence of Walt Disney World will be a big plus.
Almost everybody who goes to Florida feels obliged and blackmailed to spend a small fortune visiting that fabled plastic wonderland.
Come to Long Island, and you can put that money in the bank and watch television instead. We do have at least minimal dress codes in most of our restaurants. So you will not have the impression of dining in the circus commissary.
And our bars do not revolve, although some customers may think so. Visitors can have quiet drinks without enduring alternating views of, say, Hempstead, Levittown, Uniondale and Westbury.
Our beaches in winter are not crowded with annoyingly slender women and bronzed young athletes who make us all feel old. Our beaches are delightfully empty and quiet at this time of year, and they can be enjoyed in peace by anyone who remembers to take along Arctic exploration gear.
Sunblock is not needed. We have our ski bowl at Bald Hill, offering exhilarating downhill runs of up to 300 feet.
We can guarantee that all our hotels will look exactly the same and have the same view -- expressway on one side and parking lot on the other. So visitors do not need to spend hours agonizing over where to stay. And we can offer spectacular savings on shopping, not because prices are low, but because the walk from the parking lot to the mall entrance is enough to put off all but the most determined spenders.
Florida is for wimps who just cannot face our special brand of flu viruses or our refreshing breezes straight from Canada. The image that Long Island needs to promote winter tourism is the kind that induces people to go on mountain-climbing holidays in Nepal or dog sledding in Alaska.
A winter vacation here has to be sold as a feat of endurance and triumphant survival or, at worst, the brave acceptance of death from pneumonia. If we can sell Long Island as a winter vacation paradise, the whole local economy will benefit.
So let's get this campaign off the ground. Our sales logo will be crossed ice scrapers on a background of dead automobile batteries, and the slogan, "Long Island in Winter: It's Really Cool."

HEADLINE: Glen Cove Puts Faith in Waterfront Plan

BYLINE: By LISA PULITZER 

 BODY:
IF you build it, they will come," says Glen Cove Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi of his city's proposed seaport village, a multimillion-dollar waterfront revitalization project that calls for the redevelopment of a 214-acre industrial site on both sides of Glen Cove Creek.
The property, behind the Glen Cove firehouse on Glen Cove Road, is one of three historical waterfront communities situated along Nassau County's North Shore and is accessible to motorists by Shore Road. 
 Under the proposal, several environmentally hazardous sections of the Glen Cove property would be cleaned up and the area would be transformed into a tourist destination, like Mystic Seaport in Connecticut and South Street Seaport in Manhattan, with waterfront restaurants, boutiques, maritime attractions, a pedestrian promenade and a high-speed ferry to Manhattan and Connecticut.
Currently, a handful of light industrial and public service businesses, as well as three commercial marinas, occupy the waterfront site. But it is also home to many environmental problems that stem from an inactive landfill, a recently closed garbage incinerator and two Federal Superfund sites: the 68-acre Li Tungsten property, once the site of a carbide tungsten producing plant, and the 1.9-acre Mattice Petrochemical property.
"It is our intent to establish realistic uses for this area which will be capable of substantially contributing to the economic base of Glen Cove and the neighboring region," Mr. Suozzi said in an interview this month. "Imagine a place where people can go with their families and enjoy a fresh lobster or clams on the half shell while watching the sun set over Hempstead Harbor."
The third in his family to run Glen Cove, Mr. Suozzi is widely seen as having done more to revitalize the land-locked North Shore community and reinvigorate its flagging economy in a few short years than the last several mayors combined. Some storefronts are still shuttered, but Mr. Suozzi has lured some new businesses into town, among them Acclaim Entertainment, a video games manufacturer that has moved its corporate headquarters and several hundred employees to vacant offices on School Street.
His current project, one he hopes will help in a possible bid to unseat Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, is his Waterfront Revitalization Plan: a seven-step proposal that incorporates the environmental cleanup of several hazardous waste sites together with an economic business plan for the area's polluted waterfront property.
The plan requires the cooperation of a 40 Federal, state, and county agencies, including the Department of Environmental Conservation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation.
But competing interests, bureaucratic sluggishness and a lack of government money threaten the plan. Mr. Suozzi, who is serving his second term, has projected the plan will take five years to realize and says he will tackle it in stages.
Mr. Suozzi has already got a variety of agencies to commit more than $1 million to environmental cleanup. The first phase began last month with the arrival of the Army Corps of Engineers.
In November, the agency began dredging the creek's 1.1 mile navigation channel, something not done since 1965. More than 30 years of neglect has left the waterway almost unnavigable, because of the layers of silt and sand at the creek bottom.
In December, the Mayor celebrated yet another victory, winning money toward a cleanup of a severely contaminated piece of land at the heart of the waterfront project. The 32-acre tract, known as Captain's Cove, is the site of a shell of an abandoned condominium complex that has been repossessed by the Maryland Insurance Deposit Fund. Last week, the Mayor struck a deal with the fund that, along with financing from the state, will pay for the cleanup of the polluted property and result in the acquisition by the city of 25 percent of the land.
"It's been a coordinated effort," said George Stafford, the Secretary of State. His department awarded a $227,000 grant for an environmental impact study of several of the contaminated sites. "The process is long and complicated," he said. "People have inhabited these areas for two or three hundred years, so you never really know what you will find."
Most residents agree that the area's environmental problems must indeed be resolved, but there are those who say it is fantasy to think that people will trek up the peninsula on the already overcrowded Glen Cove Road to frequent an out-of-the-way seafood restaurant or another as-yet undetermined lure. Glen Cove is 20 minutes to the north of the Long Island Expressway.
"I don't know if this is the panacea that this city needs to cure its ills," said Jeffrey Lang, who has lived across from the Glen Cove Creek for more than 10 years. "I don't know if it will bring any glory or significant improvement to Glen Cove. I think it's an ambitious project, but you'd have to be honest and say you'd need a tourist base to begin with."
Mr. Suozzi disagrees. Alluding to unidentified economic analysis, the Mayor says people are attracted to waterfront areas.
"Look at Mamaroneck, Port Jefferson and Port Washington," said the Mayor, who says his waterfront project will entice day-trippers from Manhattan, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk. "People go to those areas because they can see water, walk along the shore, and have a nice meal."
"At one time, Glen Cove was the Gold Coast," the Mayor said, looking back to the 1920's, when Glen Cove was home to wealthy industrial barons like F. W. Woolworth, Charles Pratt and Henry Morgan.
"It was the place where people like the Pratts and the Morgans built their mansions. The Woolworth mansion, with its 18-karat gold staircase, is no less of an estate than the mansions that people visit in Newport, R.I. Not everyone wants to drive out to Montauk Point or the Hamptons for the weekend."
The city of Glen Cove has tried to revitalize in the past. During Mr. Suozzi's first term as mayor, the city poured millions of dollars into an urban redevelopment project aimed at breathing new life into the financially depressed downtown. The city received a makeover that included new sidewalks and fancy street lamps, and the construction of a multilevel parking garage.
While there has been some improvement, like the arrival of a Starbucks coffee house and a six-screen Cineplex Odeon theater, the downtown is hardly the thriving community that officials had anticipated.
Mr. Suozzi and other local officials now think the remedy may be a revitalized waterfront. They point to places like Norwalk and Mystic, Conn., and Newport, R.I., where waterfront maritime centers have proved successful.
"Norwalk, Conn., is an excellent example of the direction Glen Cove is heading," said Jim Frayer, incoming president of the Glen Cove Chamber of Commerce. "We want to revive Glen Cove's maritime history. Glen Cove's downtown has not been an economic growth area. But we believe the waterfront revitalization plan can stimulate the downtown area as well. "
In November, members of the Long Island Regional Planning Board visited Glen Cove to hear the Mayor's plan.
"We endorsed the concept," said Lee E. Koppelman, the board's chairman. "We think the city is moving in a correct direction, and we are encouraging its implementation. There are a lot of problems in Glen Cove. Part depends on private investment, but it is a complex, imaginative plan."
Mr. Koppelman cited Port Jefferson in Suffolk County. "It has become a tourist Mecca," he said of the bustling waterfront village. "The Glen Cove plan not only would revitalize the City of Glen Cove, but I think it has positive economic aspects for the whole of Nassau County, and from an esthetic point of view, the challenge of being able to revitalize the village concept is a direction that Long Island communities should be taking."
He cautioned, however, that the plan will require cooperation from every branch of government. "The key element of this is improvement of road access down to the waterfront," Mr. Koppelman said, referring to the need for the construction of a road that, because of the wetlands must be traversed, will involve input from the Department of Transportation and the Department of Environmental Conservation. "It will be a challenge, but it is not insurmountable."
The first renderings of the still evolving master plan, which included several vehicular and pedestrian roadways that bridged the existing downtown area to the waterfront area, were shown at an informal public meeting in December.
Mark Strauss, a principal of Jambhekar Strauss, the New York consulting firm preparing the plan, reviewed the schematic and spoke of the maritime center and village to be constructed on the Captain's Cove property. Restaurants, retail shops, a hotel and family recreational center, as well as a proposed high-speed commuter ferry terminal, currently under study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are all part of the grand plan.
The plan was met with wide support from the more than 300 residents at the meeting.
"The project does make a lot of sense," said Chris Guides, an environmental consultant who lives in Glen Cove. "It's a good idea to put money back into an area that right now is not generating any revenue for the City."
"It will be a long process," the Mayor told his constituents, vowing to remove the contaminated tanks from the Li Tungsten property within five months and to demolish the plant's black smokestack within 18 months.
"It will take a lot of public input along the way. The object is to try and develop a place that is beneficial to residents of Glen Cove. We want to make the Gold Coast glitter again."

HEADLINE: Hospitals Unite for Savings and Care

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
EIGHT and one-half million dollars. That is the projected savings that hospitals in the Westchester area expect to achieve this year by joining forces and becoming members of the Health Star Network in Armonk.
Health Star, organized to help community hospitals deal with the sharp changes in the industry, became the first major health care network in the area last September as the result of the alliance of Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco and White Plains Hospital Medical Center. In November, Putnam Hospital Center in Carmel, Putnam County's largest health care organization and Putnam County's largest employer, became a member. And Jan. 3, Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville announced its plans to join, too. 
 "The objective of Health Star allows participating hospitals to share resources in a way that helps them deliver high-quality health care services while keeping community control of their hospitals," said Jon B. Schandler, president and chief executive officer of the White Plains Hospital Medical Center. "It also gives member hospitals greater financial leverage in everything from buying supplies to sharing data-processing services to negotiating with managed-care companies."
Donald W. Davis, president and chief executive officer of Northern Westchester Hospital, said: "And it is invisible to the patient." Each Health Star member hospital remains independent to deliver the same level of care to its patients as before. This is not a situation where a large New York City hospital absorbs a local hospital. We're a locally based alliance of financially strong hospitals, each retaining community control of our own organization."
Rodney N. Huebbers, president and chief executive officer of Putnam Hospital Center, added: "Economically, we certainly feel we will benefit from our membership in Health Star. But we also look forward to sharing resources. For example, we have a strong outpatient renal-dialysis program we can make available to patients of our member hospitals."
In turn, Mr. Davis observed that Northern Westchester Hospital's new neonatology program for premature babies would be accessible to Health Star participants.
And the White Plains Hospital Medical Center's Breast Imagery Center, a state-of-the-art screening and diagnostic program for breast cancer, will also be available to patients at the other hospitals, Mr. Schandler said.
"We complement one another," he said. "We're all bringing something of value to the table. This is a major benefit of the alliance, sharing resources in a way that allows us to give the highest quality of health care to patients in a community setting."
After Lawrence Hospital had explored several options, its president, Roger Dvorak, said: "We were convinced that Health Star was the right course for us to take. Health Star offers Lawrence Hospital the economic benefits of a large health care network while allowing us to retain our tradition as a community-based hospital. By bringing together the finest and financially strongest hospitals in our region, Health Star is taking the lead in making sure that we can deliver the highest quality of health care services."
With the addition of Lawrence Hospital, the Health Star Network now extends from southern Westchester to Putnam County and has expanded into an organization with a total of 1,387 doctors, 1,010 licensed hospital beds, 3,584 full-time employees and total operating revenue of almost $310 million.
"With numbers like that, we become a major player with clout needed to negotiate with insurance companies and other payers," said Dr. Peter C. Welch, Health Star senior vice president for Medical Affairs.
Dr. Welch was referring to the change in the law on Jan. 1, which abolished, after 15 years, state price control of hospital procedures .
Last year, the State Legislature voted to end state price controls in favor of having the rates set through negotiations between hospitals and insurance companies and other payers, which is the way prices are set in 48 states.
Negotiations with the eight major managed-care insurance companies in the area are continuing, said Kevin G. Murphy, Health Star's chief financial officer.
"We have already come to terms with two of them and expect to sign contracts shortly," Mr. Murphy said. "And we have reached agreements with three others, which demonstrates how Health Star has strengthened its member hospitals' ability to compete effectively in a tough, key market."
Dr. Welch said: "Our combined medical staffs alone is impressive by any standards. As a physician, I appreciated the value of a strong community hospital. I am involved with the medical staffs of all member hospitals and oversee communication between the physicians and the network. Although each hospital will still offer a full range of health care service to their own patients, we have plans for a joint state-of-the art information system. In this rapidly changing health care environment, sharing the cost makes it possible."
The buying power of Health Star is a bargaining tool with vendors, Mr. Schandler said. "Before Lawrence Hospital joined us," he said, "we figured that the combined spending on supplies for the three of us amounted to $40 million annually, which makes us a very desirable customer and will result in a purchasing savings to each of us of at least 10 percent."
Dr. Welch observed: "It's a win-win for the patient. Savings will be reinvested in our hospitals' clinical care services."
Other hospitals are welcome to join, Mr. Davis said. "The criteria is that they have a reputation for quality care," he said, "are financially strong and located within our natural market, which is Westchester County and environs."
The board of directors is made up of 20 members with equal representation from the four hospitals. Day-to-day management of the alliance is handled by a committee consisting of the chief executives of the participating hospitals and Dr. Welch and Mr. Murphy.
