HEADLINE: Albany Deal Eases Rules On Banking

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Just minutes before midnight, as state banking laws were about to expire, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed legislation that makes permanent a group of laws that give banks great latitude to create new financial products and to set interest rates for credit cards and most types of loans.
Banking officials said the agreement on the legislation, which ended more than a year of difficult negotiations, will help the state retain thousands of financial service jobs. But consumer advocates criticized the legislation, saying that it does not do enough to guarantee low-cost banking services for the poor or establish consumer protections for bank users. 
 The legislation makes permanent laws passed in the 1980's that deregulated banks by removing state-set caps on interest rates and allowing banks to create a wide range of new products, such as variable-rate loans and automatic teller machines.
 
Small-Business Fund
 Until now, those laws have expired periodically, setting off partisan debates in Albany over whether to amend, extend or scrap them. That process has created uncertainty in the industry, made long-term planning difficult and discouraged some banks from expanding their operations in the state, banking lobbyists have argued.
In addition, the legislation does several new things. It establishes a fund of $90 million for small-business loans intended for the poor, requires all banks to provide low-cost checking accounts and establishes a toll-free number on which consumers can get the latest information about interest rates.
It also requires long-term car leasing companies to disclose information about the total cost of leases to consumers. The Democratic-led Assembly had added the leasing provisions to the banking bill in a maneuver designed to win approval in the Republican-controlled Senate, which supported the banking legislation but had objected to aspects of the leasing bill.
 
Political Victory
 In an election year when layoffs and the economy are becoming major issues, the new legislation gave all three sides in the Albany power structure something to tout as a victory.
The Democratic-led Assembly said the auto leasing provisions would provide important protections in a growing and largely unregulated industry. Mr. Cuomo said the legislation "makes the state more hospitable to banks." And the Republican-led Senate claimed credit for authorship of the banking legislation, which they have championed for several years.
"This measure provides security and stablity for bankers and consumers alike," said Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino, Republican from Oyster Bay.
 
Praise From the Industry
 It was also hailed by the banking industry, which said it would encourage banks to expand or establish credit card operations here. Banking lobbyists have said that the state's tight credit rules in the 1970's caused several major credit card operations to move to South Dakota and Delaware.
"This ends the uncertainty and conflict that have surrounded past negotiations over bank laws," said Michael P. Smith, executive vice-president of the New York State Bankers Association, which represents 160 commercials banks.
But consumer advocates said the Legislature should have demanded more from the banking industry before yielding the power to review the banking laws each time they expired.
"This was a gift to banks," said Travis Plunkett of the New York Public Research Interest Group.
The long-term auto leasing provisions are intended to address complaints that some leasing companies charge low monthly fees but later tack on extremely high charges for early lease termination and for "excess wear and tear."
The legislation requires leasing companies to disclose information about the total cost of leases, which theoretically will make it easier for consumers to know how much they will be charged if they end their leases early. It also establishes a process for customers to dispute extra fees for damage to their vehicles.
The $90 million small-business loan fund will be divided equally between two programs: one open to any small-business owner and one designed to assist communities with high poverty or unemployment rates. Loans from the second program will be available to working poor of any race, but priority will be given to members of minority groups living in poor communities.
The legislation will also allow banks for the first time to offer low introductory rates on credit cards as an inducement for new card owners and to charge for replacing a credit card the third time it is lost. Chemical Bank, which has the largest New York-based credit card operation, had lobbied particularly hard for those provisions.
Had the Legislature allowed the banking laws to lapse at midnight, the banking industry would have been thrown into turmoil.
But even though that possibility was thought extremely unlikely, legislative leaders and their aides circulated throughout the day detailed information about what banks might do if the laws expired, from closing down automatic teller machines to drastically restricting consumer loans.

HEADLINE: UNEASY ALLIANCE OF BLACK GROUPS

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Recent bigoted remarks by a chief aide to Louis Farrakhan, minister of the Nation of Islam, and Mr. Farrakhan's failure to disavow them have interrupted the tenuous rapprochement between mainstream civil rights leaders and the Muslim group.
The discomfort being felt by some black officials reflects their continued inability to decide how to deal with the Nation of Islam, a group whose membership numbers are a mystery and whose ability to influence elections directly is slight. 
 Although black officials have been repelled by some of Mr. Farrakhan's more contention remarks and those of his aides, leaders of mainstream black organizations have been reluctant to criticize Mr. Farrakhan. They often praise his emphasis on black self-reliance and his group's statements on fighting crime and drug abuse.
"Black leadership has never before been willing to confront what Farrakahn and the Nation of Islam had been saying and distance themselves from it," said Milton Morris, vice president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research organization specializing in black issues. "They're always found a way to say it's not been our business."
Mr. Farrakhan's failure to disavow himself from remarks made by Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a spokesman for the Nation of Islam, has placed in jeopardy the fledgling political alliance that was announced with much fanfare last September between the Nation of Islam and the Congressional Black Caucus
At the time, Representative Kweisi Mfume, the Maryland Democrat who heads the caucus, said his group and Mr. Farrakahn's had entered into a "sacred covenant" and would work together on issues like drug abuse and crime in inner-city neighborhoods.
 
Declined to Criticize Aide
 Ten days ago, after several civil rights leaders denounced Mr. Muhammad's speech as bigoted, Mr. Mfume wrote to Mr. Farrakhan demanding to know if his aide's remarks represented those of the Nation of Islam. Don Willson, a spokesman for Mr. Mfume, said today that the Congressman had yet to receive a reply.
Several civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, condemned the remarks made by Mr. Muhammad, who in a speech in November at Kean College in New Jersey excoriated Jews as "blood suckers of the black community." These civil rights leaders urged Mr. Farrakhan to dissociate himself from the remarks.
But so far, Mr. Farrakhan has declined to criticize his aide. In a speech last week before 10,000 black men in Harlem, Mr. Farrakhan accused the Federal Government and some black leaders of trying to use Mr. Muhammad's words to divide his group.
Some black politicians have made a point of distancing themselves and the black caucus from the Nation of Islam.
Since the publication of Mr. Muhammad's remarks, senior members of the black caucus have emphasized that no joint programs were established with Mr. Farrakhan's group, and they point out that the full black caucus never ratified the partnership that Mr. Mfume had announced.
Some black officials say the problems of drugs, violence, high rates of teen-age pregnancy, poor schooling and poor discipline that are overwhelming low-income black neighborhoods are so great that some form of unity among black groups -- including the Nation of Islam -- is necessary. Mr. Mfume essentially made that argument in October when he met with leaders of Jewish groups who expressed concern about the announced alliance with Mr. Farrakhan's group.
But some students of black politics say achieving a rapprochement between Mr. Farrakhan and leaders of mainstream black groups involves each side taking some chances. When it came to the Nation of Islam, only the leaders of mainstream black groups took the risks. Mr. Farrakhan, who made no promises, now has them squirming.
"Everybody wants unity and nobody likes the idea of somebody who is not one of us to set the standard of relationships between us," said William Raspberry, a syndicated columnist who is black. "It's also understandable that Farrakhan wants to come to the table. After all, it's been a little bit lonely out there. But if you have been outside and you want to come to the family table, it's not asking too much to ask you to wash your hands first."

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks Extra $1.5 Billion in Quake Relief

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
President Clinton will ask for at least $1.5 billion in additional Federal aid for victims of the Los Angeles earthquake, Administration officials said today, raising the proposed Federal commitment to earthquake relief to more than $9 billion.
At least $8 billion of that would be sought in a supplemental budget request officials are planning to send to Congress. The Government is now using $897 million in already budgeted money to aid victims. 
 An Administration official said the new request would be directed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for aid in housing 25,000 people left homeless by the earthquake.
"The needs have turned out to be greater than expected," the official said.
 
Acknowledging Need
 In authorizing the new expenditures, Mr. Clinton conceded that Gov. Pete Wilson of California was right in arguing that the Federal aid for the earthquake would fall far short of the need.
Last week, Mr. Clinton said he would ask Congress for $6.6 billion in emergency money, a request that would make the earthquake the costliest natural disaster ever for Federal taxpayers. The earthquake, which measured 6.6 on the Richter scale of ground motion, killed 61 people and injured 8,000.
Leon E. Panetta, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said at the time that he expected the figure to grow and has said since that the Federal Government should re-examine the way it pays for disaster aid.
"Somehow, we've got to do a better job in terms of preparing for disasters, either by setting aside some kind of fund to deal with disasters, or looking to insurance companies to try to deal with those areas that are particularly vulnerable to disasters," Mr. Panetta said in an interview on the Cable News Network.
At the same time, Mr. Panetta has maintained that victims of natural disasters should not be "held hostage" to budgetary constraints.
Congress must agree to waive budget limits when it approves new disaster assistance, and the White House has acknowledged that the earthquake relief will add at least $3 billion to the deficit.
Although states must normally match at least 25 percent of the Federal commitment, the Clinton Administration has relaxed that commitment for economically distressed California, requiring only a 10 percent match.
The Midwest floods last summer have cost the Government $4.6 billion so far, and hurricane damage aid in 1991 surpassed $8 billion, but that figure takes into account both Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and Louisiana, and Hurricane Iniki, which struck the Hawaiian island of Kauai.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Implies a Pre-Inflation Rise in Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, strongly implied today that the central bank would break with tradition and raise interest rates before revived inflation became clearly visible.
But Mr. Greenspan left unclear, as is his custom, how close or how large a "pre-emptive strike" might be. Wall Street analysts were divided in their interpretation of his remarks to Congressional committee members and answers to their questions. 
 President Clinton, commenting on Mr. Greenspan's testimony, said that while low rates were vital to continued expansion, he would not object to a modest increase if the move did not make mortgages and other long-term borrowing more expensive. If the Fed should "make that decision on short-term rates, what I hope is it won't raise long-term rates because there's no need to do it," the President said.
In financial markets, stocks continued to rally, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 32.93 points and approaching the 4,000 mark. The bond market apparently focused on Mr. Greenspan's failure to offer a timetable for taking action on inflation, and prices edged higher. The dollar eased on Mr. Greenspan's remarks.
Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress in advance of a policy meeting to set interest rate policy for the year, Mr. Greenspan said that "regrettably" the Fed had frequently erred in the past by waiting too long to combat inflation, which often accompanies rapid economic growth.
"Inflation tends to surface rather late in the business cycle and hence is not a good leading indicator of emerging troubles," he said. "By the time inflation pressures are evident, many imbalances that are costly to rectify have already developed and only harsh monetary therapy can restore the financial stability necessary to sustain" economic growth.
Some Wall Street analysts thought the Fed might act as soon as Friday if the Labor Department reported that employers' payrolls expanded by more than 200,000 in January. But others said the conditions for raising rates were nonexistent.
Mr. Greenspan further clouded the issue by noting that some of the Fed's traditional benchmarks, including the money supply, have become less useful as guides to policy.
Long-term rates are important because these are used for economy-spurring activity like buying homes and building factories. These rates are mainly governed by expectations on inflation that investors have over a long period, such as 30 years. The Fed can affect long-term rates by its attitude toward inflation, but its main control is over short-term rates, which are generally regarded as covering loans lasting from a day to perhaps a year.
Mr. Greenspan declared short-term rates "abnormally low" after adjustment for inflation, and he added that "at some point, absent an unexpected and prolonged weakening of economic activity, we will need to move them to a more neutral stance."
The 3 percent rate on overnight loans among banks is barely above the 2.7 percent rise in consumer prices over the last 12 months.
 
Not to Squelch Growth
 The Fed chief added that action "would not be taken in order to cut off or limit the economic expansion, but rather to sustain and enhance it." By this he meant that a demonstration of anti-inflation vigilance would reassure long-term investors that the Fed would not allow the value of the bonds or mortgages to be eroded.
While Mr. Greenspan did not mention a specific case of late response to inflation, which he said had "arisen too often," the most striking example in recent memory was in 1979, when Paul A. Volcker was summoned by President Jimmy Carter in near-emergency conditions to take over the Fed and arrest oil-fueled inflation that ended the year at 13.3 percent.
Mr. Volcker's harsh treatment led directly to the 1981-82 recession, with double-digit unemployment and a recession that ranks as the most severe since the end of World War II.
The four Republicans on the committee and the Democratic chairman, Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, praised Mr. Greenspan today for nurturing the current business expansion -- Mr. Obey requesting only that the rate rise be held in abeyance for "a few months."
But Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, disputed the notion that the Fed should act against a menace that had not yet appeared. "You can do anything on that basis," he said.
Private analysts were inclined to think Mr. Greenspan tilted toward a fairly early move today, mindful that his carefully hedged remarks came after the Government reported that the economy accelerated to a 5.9 percent rate of growth in the final quarter of 1993, the strongest in six years.
"The Fed is perhaps a little closer to moving" than had been thought, said Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, predicting a one-quarter-point rise in the Federal funds rate between February and April.
David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley, said, "the evidence is building" and Mr. Greenspan appears "edgy," but the Fed still lacked a "trigger" to justify action.
But Cheryl Katz of Lehman Brothers offered a quite different conclusion. Citing what she called ample productive capacity, she said that it was "way too early" for the Fed to raise rates and suggested that it might go all year without doing so.
 
Importance of Price Expectations
 In his statement, Mr. Greenspan seemed to anticipate this argument by stating that the level of inflation "depends crucially on price expectations and not on the degree of slack" in the economy.
The Fed chief also made the following points today before leaving for London for a brief trip. On his return, he will convene the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee on Thursday afternoon:
*Canada and Britain seem to be emerging from severe recessions, but there is only scant evidence of improvement in Japan and continental Europe.
*Policy makers should consider the possibility that the American economy's growth potential is well above the 2 1/2 percent a year commonly assumed, a statement suggesting that the Fed would not automatically slow the economy if it started to exceed that level on a sustained basis.
*Low foreign labor costs have almost no effect on levels of inflation in this country, unlike low foreign commodity prices.
*Money supply figures have been distorted by increased escrow balances related to intense mortgage refinancing, stepped-up shipments of currency out of the country and mutual-fund activity. Also, the Fed has failed in its attempt to make its monetary base useful as a policy gauge.
*Fed researchers believe the Consumer Price Index overstates inflation by an even greater, but unspecified, amount than the half-point cited by the Labor Department.
Mr. Greenspan joined a consensus predicting that "further solid gains" for the economy could be expected in 1994, though "growth will almost surely slow appreciably" from the final three months of last year. So far, he added, the labor market has displayed only marginal inflation pressure.

HEADLINE: Ex-Congressman Again Joining Hartford Race for Governor

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 31

 BODY:
John G. Rowland, a 36-year-old Republican who almost defeated Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in the 1990 race for governor but then virtually disappeared from the public eye, announced today his return for another run.
But despite the hopes of senior Republican officials that the party would quickly rally around Mr. Rowland, he faces what is shaping up as a major and perhaps bruising personal scrap with the Republican Secretary of the State, Pauline R. Kezer. 
 Mrs. Kezer, who declared her own candidacy for governor earlier this month, has not minced words in saying that she thinks Mr. Rowland, a former three-term Congressman from Waterbury, is no longer a big vote-getter among Republicans or Connecticut voters in general.
Mr. Rowland, who announced his candidacy in a series of appearances around the state, said that he had learned from his defeat and that Connecticut had changed as well after four years of recession. In 1990, he said, the issues were taxes and how to rescue a deficit-plagued state budget.
 
Tough Talk on Crime
 Today Mr. Rowland scarcely mentioned taxes at all. His new campaign agenda -- tough talk on crime, an overhaul of the welfare system and vehement opposition to forced busing as an answer to Connecticut's segregated school system -- will speak to an electorate living in fear, he said.
"They're fearful of losing their jobs, fearful of crime in the streets," he said.
Mr. Rowland spoke of Mrs. Kezer only in the most dismissive of terms, saying he believed she could be kept from obtaining even 15 percent of Republican delegates at this summer's convention, thus preventing her from waging a primary contest against him.
She immediately fired back.
"He ran that race and he didn't win it," Mrs. Kezer said, referring to the 1990 election. "He has done absolutely nothing in three years to further his agenda -- he has not been here -- then he comes waltzing back and says it's mine, I'm owed this."
Mrs. Kezer, who is 51, is the first Republican to win a statewide election in Connecticut since 1970, other than Mr. Weicker himself, who served three terms as a Republican in the United States Senate before losing in 1988 to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. She pointed out in an interview that in the 1990 race, when Mr. Rowland lost by less than 33,000 votes out of 1.1 million cast, he still drew only 38 percent of the vote, compared with 41 percent for Mr. Weicker, who ran on his own independent ticket, and 21 percent for the Democratic candidate, Bruce A. Morrison. Mrs. Kezer got 52.3 percent in her race.
Mr. Rowland appears to be the last major candidate to announce plans to run for governor, party leaders say. As in 1990, it will be a three-way race, with a Democrat, a Republican and a major third-party candidate, Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, whose name will appear on top line of the ballot by virtue of Mr. Weicker's victory in the last election. Mrs. Groark, also a former Republican, joined Mr. Weicker's party, known as A Connecticut Party -- in 1990 and declared her intention to replace him last year after Mr. Weicker declined to seek a second term.
Democrats have already said they expect to have a primary, and many say they hope to benefit from it as a way of increasing the name recognition of their roster: William E. Curry Jr., the State Comptroller; State Senator John B. Larson, the president pro tem of the Senate, and State Senator Richard J. Balducci, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives.
For the short term, however, the focus of the race seems likely to stay on Mr. Rowland and Mrs. Kezer, if only for the contrasts between them and the sparks that are likely to fly.
With endorsements already in his pocket from all three of the state's Republican members of Congress, including Nancy L. Johnson -- who had considered running for governor herself -- Mr. Rowland is expansive and confident. But he is also in the midst of a divorce that some Republicans fear could become a factor as the race develops. Mr. Rowland's wife, Deborah, was a constant and effervescent companion at his side in 1990, along with his three children.
 
Offering an Alternative
 Mrs. Kezer, by contrast, is positioning herself as the alternative Republican to vote for, if only to tweak the monolith of party allegiance. As Secretary of State, she has concentrated on increasing voter registration and participation and on upgrading her department's record-keeping and record-collection efforts.
As a candidate, she expresses surprise that members of her party find her needling of Mr. Rowland to be tiresome, but then she repeats her critique that Mr. Rowland's positions have fluctuated over time, and that it's only right to discuss the phenomenon.
"John has a history of not being consistent on the issues -- that will be pointed out because it's factual," she said. "All I'm asking for is an even shot."

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers Concessions On Health, Governors Say

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Governors who met with President Clinton today said afterward that he had shown new flexibility on two important elements of his health plan: spending limits and the structure of the purchasing groups through which most Americans would buy health insurance.
Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, a Republican, and Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat, said Mr. Clinton had agreed that participation in the purchasing groups, or alliances, might be voluntary, not mandatory, as the President initially proposed. 
 In an interview tonight, Mr. Dean, a doctor who is vice chairman of the National Governors' Association, reported, "The President said he was willing to be flexible on mandatory alliances and global budgets." The purpose of a global budget is to set an annual limit on health spending.
 
Defining Flexibility
 Mr. Campbell, who is chairman of the governors' association, confirmed Mr. Dean's account of the meeting with the President. Mr. Campbell quoted Mr. Clinton as saying that he knew of cases where the alliances were voluntary and small employers were "clamoring to get into them."
Under the proposal Mr. Clinton sent to Congress in late October, all businesses with 5,000 or fewer employees would have had to participate in the alliances. The alliances are intended to concentrate the purchasing power of hundreds of thousands of consumers so they can obtain the same type of insurance coverage and the same type of discounts as large corporations.
In the past, President Clinton said he was willing to discuss virtually any element of his health care proposal except the goal of guaranteeing coverage for all Americans. Today Mr. Clinton was more explicit than in the past about his flexibility on the structure of alliances and spending limits.
 
Universal Availability
 Jeffrey L. Eller, a White House spokesman, said: "The President is inflexible on the goal of universal coverage, but he is flexible on the details of how to achieve that goal. His bill calls for mandatory alliances because he believes that approach is the best way to achieve universal coverage. But the President has also said, and he told the governors today, 'We have heard your concerns and we are willing to be flexible on this question of alliances.' "
After meeting with Mr. Clinton, the governors adopted a health care policy that supports the idea of a standard package of health benefits for all Americans, an important part of the Clinton plan. But the policy remains neutral on the critical question of whether employers should be required to pay for their workers' insurance.
The policy says: "All employers must make the core benefits package available to those employees who wish to purchase it. While governors do not agree on whether employers should be required to pay for any portion of the premium, governors agree that coverage should be available."
 
'Naysayers and Nitpickers'
 Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said today that Congress would not pass a comprehensive health bill this year "if we don't address it on a bipartisan basis."
Speaking to the American Hospital Association, Mr. Dole endorsed Mr. Clinton's goal of providing health insurance coverage for all Americans, but he urged the White House to be flexible and open to compromise.
"The Administration is attempting to sell price controls and global budgets and Government monopolies as answers to very real problems," Mr. Dole said. "They call us naysayers and nitpickers because we oppose turning one-seventh of the economy over to the Federal Government."
But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, defended the President's proposal, saying, "No other plan provides a credible guarantee of universal coverage."
 
Slowing Drug-Price Increases
 In a separate development, Senator David Pryor commended prescription drug companies for "an honest effort to restrain price increases in 1993." While 18 drug companies voluntarily made some commitment to hold down prices last year, he said, "these pledges may not be resulting in meaningful price restraint, especially at the retail level, where most Americans buy their drugs."
Most discounts go to hospitals and health maintenance organizations, not to consumers who buy drugs at local retail pharmacies, said Mr. Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat.
The overall Consumer Price Index rose 2.7 percent last year. Medical care in general rose 5.4 percent. Prescription drugs rose 3.3 percent, the lowest increase in 20 years.
But Mr. Pryor said that drug companies were still raising prices more than other manufacturers. Last year, he observed, the producer price index for prescription drugs rose 3.1 percent, while the index for all finished goods rose just 0.2 percent.
Richard J. Pollack, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, praised President Clinton's effort to guarantee health insurance for all. But, like many governors, he said Mr. Clinton's original proposal gave too much power to the regional health alliances.
 
Budgets vs. Needs
 Likewise, Mr. Pollack expressed doubts about Mr. Clinton's proposal for limits on health care spending, to be enforced through limits on health insurance premiums. Such limits, he said, "may force choices which are not practical or realistic from a political, economic, social or moral perspective."
Moreover, Mr. Pollack said: "Hospitals are prepared to talk about how much we spend on health care. We are prepared to talk about targets and goals.
"But we will not talk about global budgets that are imposed from the top down based on an arbitrary number pulled out of thin air. We will not talk about a global budget enforced by a rate-setting guillotine tied to the Federal budget process."

HEADLINE: U.S. Moves to Halt S.& L. Sales Amid Concern on Insiders' Profits

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Treasury Department imposed a moratorium today on commercial bank purchases of most mutual savings and loans, citing concerns that insiders may be enriching themselves at the expense of depositors.
But regulators have closed the barn door very late: all but one of the nation's big mutual savings and loans have already been sold or have converted to shareholder ownership. 
 Coupled with recent moves by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to review executive compensation at mutuals that sell stock in themselves to investors, the moratorium is likely to halt the disappearance of mutuals, a trend that has been reshaping the nation's savings and loan industry, banking experts said today.
"It looks like the party is over -- this is the beginning of the end," said Scott M. Winslow, the research director at SNL Securities, a financial research firm in Charlottesville, Va.
 
Not Many Are Left
 Low interest rates have made hundreds of mutuals quite profitable, so many banks and investors want to buy them. A wave of deals cut the number of mutuals last year by almost 10 percent, from 1,343 at the beginning of 1993 and 2,000 a dozen years ago. Most of the 1,231 remaining mutuals are tiny institutions in small towns.
Green Point Savings Bank, a $6 billion institution based in Flushing, Queens, issued stock on Friday, leaving only one large mutual, Pomona First Federal Savings and Loan Association in California, which has $1.65 billion in assets.
The rest of the big mutuals have already converted into shareholder institutions, said Brian P. Smith, the policy director at Savings and Community Bankers of America, the industry's Washington-based trade group.
According to a study by SNL Securities, in each of 16 small deals in December and early January, an average of $5.3 million in free stock or stock discounts was awarded to the directors and corporate officers as a group. That works out to 13 percent of the value of the stock sold and does not count the executive salary increases and the generous retirement plans that usually accompany these transactions. Depositors, who technically own the institutions but typically buy few of the shares when the institutions sell stock, got very little.
The Treasury and the F.D.I.C. are both paying particular attention to whether mutual executives have issued stock at unusually low prices and bought large blocks of shares at those prices. Last year, shares in mutuals soared by an average of 28 percent on the day they were issued.
In imposing a moratorium on commercial bank purchases of mutuals, the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision said that it would continue to accept applications from mutuals that want to convert to stock ownership. But the office said for the first time that its limits on executive compensation for these transactions would be reviewed. Leaders of the Senate Banking Committee introduced legislation last week to force the office to tighten these limits, which do not currently cover stock options.
 
'At a Standstill

 
 David S. Schaefer, the head of the banking practice at Loeb & Loeb, a New York law firm, said that close regulatory scrutiny would bring to a halt all sales of mutuals to investors or banks. "Applications which have been filed have come to a standstill," he said. "It also prevents other institutions, which have wanted to take advantage of the market, from acting."
The moratorium will last while the office reviews its regulations on the transactions. Treasury officials declined to estimate how long that would take; the F.D.I.C. has been reviewing the issue for nearly a year without reaching a decision.
Two Congressional hearings in the last 10 days and proposals for tough new Federal legislation have left regulators red-faced and wishing that they had acted sooner. This is particularly true at the F.D.I.C., which oversees state-chartered savings banks, unlike the Office of Thrift Supervision, which oversees federally chartered savings banks and state and federally chartered savings and loans.
Managers at state-regulated savings banks awarded themselves some of the largest multimillion-dollar compensation packages in exchange for approving the sale of their institutions to banks or investors.
 
Some Regrets Expressed

 
 "It's not our shining hour in terms of raising the issue; in hindsight, I wish we'd done more earlier," said a senior F.D.I.C. staff official who insisted on anonymity.
Andrew C. Hove Jr., the acting chairman of the F.D.I.C., declined to comment.
Jonathan L. Fiechter, the acting director of the Office of Thrift Supervision and a member of the F.D.I.C.'s board, said last week that he had sent memos to the F.D.I.C. over the last year urging it to be more aggressive. "I probably should have been more aggressive on the board," he said.
Mr. Hove told a House Banking Committee panel last week that his agency would start closely reviewing sales of state-chartered mutuals and would propose new regulations that would make it easier for depositors to benefit from the sale of mutuals. Until recently, the F.D.I.C. relied heavily on state regulators to determine whether compensation packages were excessive.
 
A New York Case

 
 Green Point Savings issued stock last week after a long legal struggle in which the New York State Banking Commission forced its executives to give up the stock and stock options that they had planned to award to themselves. Estimates of the total Green Point compensation packages started at $40 million, and ranged up to $85 million or more if the bank's stock had doubled after it was issued.
Savings banks differ from savings and loans only in that savings banks are allowed to hold a slightly lower percentage of their assets in real estate loans.
The Office of Thrift Supervision put some limits on executive compensation in these transactions but had not limited stock options. Dozens of savings and loans have converted into state-chartered savings bank before issuing stock, thereby avoiding the thrift office's limits. Mr. Fiechter of the thrift office called for the F.D.I.C. to impose its own moratorium on commercial bank acquisitions of mutuals that it oversees.
The ownership of mutuals is fiercely disputed. The thrift office said today that depositors "are considered the owners of a mutual thrift." Mr. Hove of the F.D.I.C. made a similar comment at a Congressional hearing last week, as did the top regulators from Ohio and Wisconsin.
But many savings and loan executives and some state regulators, including regulators in New York and North Carolina, contend that the ownership of mutuals is murky. The Federal courts have ruled that while a mutual's depositors may divide up its net worth if the institution is liquidated, they may not take their stakes out of an active institution.
Mr. Schaefer at Loeb & Loeb, who has represented mutual executives in past conversions to shareholder ownership, said he did not think depositors had any ownership rights. Since the 1930's, Federal deposit insurance has protected depositors against financial loss if a mutual fails, he pointed out. So depositors do not meet a legal test of ownership that requires owners to prove possession of something that can be lost, he said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Climb in Heavy Trading, With Dow Rising 32.93

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks surged in heavy trading yesterday, as good demand for auto stocks and aluminum stocks helped equities extend their record setting pace of last week to new closing highs on the last day of the month.
Some of the follow-through buying from last Friday's rally was focused on General Motors and the Aluminum Company of America. 
 General Motors' chief executive, John F. Smith, in an interview that was reported in The New York Times yesterday, hinted that 1993 earnings will be better-than-expected. Alcoa, along with other aluminum stocks, was up amid news that major aluminum-producing nations have agreed to cut annual production by one million tons. A production cutback in aluminum would put upward pressure on prices and that translates to greater profits for aluminum makers, traders said.
The Dow Jones industrial average, while setting its 12th closing high of the year, approached yet another of those psychological barriers that traders and investors watch so closely -- the 4,000 mark. The industrial index finished at 3,978.36, up 32.93 points.
Analysts said an afternoon upward spike in the Dow, which pushed the index up as much as 40 points, might have been caused by positive comments on inflation made by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, in Washington.
Other positive economic news came with the report that personal income rose six-tenths of 1 percent in December, close to market expectations.
The other major stock indexes also set new highs for the second day yesterday. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, another measure of blue-chip issues, was up 2.91 points, to 481.61, while the Nasdaq composite gained 3.94 points to close at 800.47 and the American Stock Exchange index rose 2.46 points to finish at 485.68.
 
Heavy Trading Volume
 Volume on the Big Board was heavy, with 322.9 million shares changing hands. The number of issues making gains on the day outpacedthose that declined by a margin of 1,396 to 733.
Joseph V. Battapaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisors, a division of Gruntal & Company, believes that if interest rates stay down and inflation remains low, the market will take care of itself, which means stock prices will continue to move higher.
"The market entered the year with questions about valuation and questions about the White House. And even with an earthquake, a deep freeze and two new legislative initiatives, equity prices are at new highes," Mr. Battapaglia said. "Overriding those challenges are very strong economic news and a growing sense that the Fed will not raise rates at this time."
He says mutual fund cash continues to pour into the market, which is fresh fuel for the rally. "The only thing left that may stop the market in its tracks would be an unexpected event, such as a political upheaval in Russia," he added.
While marveling at the January rally, traders and investors are also remaining cautious because of a concern that the market could be overextended and ready for a a correction. For the month, the Dow is up 224.27 points, or about 6 percent.
Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm, says the Dow's gain in January is the ninth-best January performance since 1915, with the best in 1975, when it was up 14.2 percent.
Lawrence R. Rice, a chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, sized up the market this way: "This market is finishing the month the same way it started, very strong and very positive, with good volume. Even though we are over extended near term, it still looks positive for intermediate term."
Xerox reached a new 52-week high, closing at 98 1/8, up 5 1/2. The large copier maker outlined details of cost reductions including layoffs that will be achieved from a previously announced restructuring.
Investors bought CBS as Brown Brothers Harriman upgraded the stock to buy from neutral. Traders said the analyst, John Nelson, had said: "It's a soft cyclical company, and the ecnomic cycle is right. CBS is holding its audience levels and you've got a relaxation of regulations." The stock was up 9 3/4, to 306 a share, on the Big Board.

Treasury Bonds Retreat in Price

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices ended lower yesterday after rising earlier on suggestions from Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, that inflation remained under control for now.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond dropped 5/16 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 6.23 percent, from 6.21 percent on Friday. Prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 1/16 to 3/32 and intermediate maturities were off 1/16 to 1/8, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
 Market analysts traced part of the decline in Government bond prices to a wave of corporate borrowing, including a $1 billion deal from the Province of Quebec. As part of corporate bond transactions, underwriters typically sell Treasury securities as a way to hedge against potential losses.
 
Expected Corporate Borrowings
 Yesterday's sales were the first in a flood of expected corporate borrowing by foreign countries in the United States market this week. China, for instance, is expected to sell at least $1 billion in 10-year bonds.
Mr. Greenspan, speaking before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, reiterated that the central bank was prepared to raise short-term interest rates to keep inflation pressures from worsening.
"Short-term interest rates are currently abnormally low," he told Congress. "At some point, absent an unexpected and prolonged weakening of economic activity, we will need to move them."
Typically, such talk would drive bond prices lower. But because the market expects the Fed to nudge up rates at some point, investors apparently focused on Mr. Greenspan's failure to offer a specific timetable for taking action, and prices edged higher.
"If anything, Greenspan seemed to hint there are some considerations that may act to delay any movement toward restraint," said William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
The Fed's policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, is scheduled to meet on Thursday and Friday to map its monetary strategy for the next six months.
The early gains were set back after the market for corporate bonds picked up pace. Quebec priced its $1 billion sale of 30-year bonds to yield 7.167 percent, or 0.82 percentage point above the comparable Treasury bond.
In another deal, the USX Corporation expanded a planned $250 million sale of 10-year notes to $300 million after strong demand. The steel company priced the securities at 1.60 percentage points above the comparable Treasury note.
Mr. Sullivan of Dean Witter said Treasury bond prices might also have been depressed by investors' anticipation of new United States Government borrowing in coming weeks.
The Treasury is to announce tomorrow a sale of $40 billion in 3-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds next week. More notes are scheduled for sale later in February.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 3.02 percent as the discount was up 0.04 percentage point, to 2.97 percent. Six-month yields were up to 3.23 percent as the discount was up 0.04 point, to 3.15 percent. One-year yields were up 3.50 percent as the discount was up 0.03 point, to 3.38 percent. Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the interest at which they are sold.

HEADLINE: BMW Will Buy Rover of Britain

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Seeking both an entree into the small-car business and lower-cost automobile production plants, BMW of Germany said today that it would acquire the Rover Group of Britain for about $1.2 billion.
The deal, which puts the last big British auto maker under foreign control, advances the strategy of the Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G. of reducing its reliance on its home market in Germany, where labor and production costs are among the world's highest. 
 In Rover, BMW gets an efficient producer of small cars, notably the Metro and Mini and its 200 and 400 series. Rover also builds more expensive cars, like its 800 series coupes, and it has built its Land Rover division into a high-quality and fast-growing producer of large four-wheel-drive utility vehicles sold under the names Land Rover and Range Rover.
 
Labor Costs at Issue
 For Germany and Britain, the deal also suggests the economic forces that are at work reshaping European industries including automobiles. German companies, which for decades enjoyed a reputation for unparalleled industrial craftsmanship and engineering, now find it difficult to compete because of labor costs.
At $24 an hour, labor costs in the German car business are double those in Britain, where social welfare levies on employers are lower and unions are not so strong as in Germany. That is forcing many Germany companies to build or acquire new production capacity abroad.
BMW said it had considered building its own small-car manufacturing operations, but that it was faster and cheaper to acquire Rover from British Aerospace P.L.C., which has owned the marque for the last five years. The deal will roughly double BMW's share of the European market to 6.5 percent.
BMW's chairman, Bernd Pischetsrieder, said at a news conference here that there was little overlap between the companies' car lines and that BMW would be able to distribute Rover cars more widely, particularly in Germany and America, than had British Aerospace.
He said Rover would continue to be run by its British managers and that the Rover brand name would be maintained. There are no plans to produce BMW cars in Britain, Mr. Pischetsrieder said, but he added he was interested in reviving some of Rover's famous but now-dormant name plates like Austin Healey.
British Aerospace has been eager to sell Rover and concentrate on its aerospace and defense businesses. The deal, however, brought a sharp protest from Honda of Japan, which owns a 20 percent stake in Rover's car-making operation and has been integral in Rover's efforts to cut costs and improve quality.
Honda had been seeking to increase its stake to just under 50 percent, but had been unwilling to meet British Aerospace's demand for a full buyout. Now, BMW will be able to use and study Honda's technology and production techniques up close.
In Tokyo, Honda's president, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, said in a statement that British Aerospace's decision "negates Honda and Rover's long-term efforts to establish a firm future for Rover as a British company with its own brand identity." Honda said it had no immediate plans to sell its stake in Rover.
Mr. Pischetsrieder said he hoped that Honda would continue its association with Rover, under which Rover also has a 20 percent stake in Honda's British operations. In response to questions at the news conference, however, Rover's chairman, George Simpson, said, "Today's development may suggest some change in that relationship."
Rover sold about 368,500 cars and about 73,500 sports utility vehicles last year, primarily in Britain, and was the only European auto maker to sell more cars than in 1992, reflecting Britain's recovery from the recession that lingers elsewhere in Europe. Rover had a pretax operating profit last year of 56 million, or $84 million, on sales of 4.3 billion, or $6.45 billion. In 1992, Rover had an operating loss of 49 million, or about $73.5 million at today's exchange rates.
BMW sold 534,000 cars of its luxury cars worldwide, including 78,000 in America, where its sales have been rebounding, aided by an improving economy, a fresh ad campaign and limited price increases. BMW is building an assembly plant near Spartanburg, S.C., which is expected to begin producing models from the smaller 3-series line next year followed later by what is believed to be a sporty new two-seater. Until today's Rover deal, the South Carolina plant was BMW's only significant production outside of Germany and Austria.
Mr. Pischetsrieder said BMW saw considerable opportunity to sell more Land Rovers around the world, including in the United States, possibly by distributing them through BMW's dealer network. But analysts said the real motivation for BMW was to establish itself in the market for smaller, less-expensive cars.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Prices for Gold Rise Strongly As a Slide's End Is Forecast

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices posted strong gains yesterday after snapping back from a two-month low. Some analysts said the performance marked the end of the market's recent decline.
Silver prices also rose sharply. 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery settled at $381.60 an ounce, up $4.70 from Friday. The rally came late in the session after the February contract bounced off $375.50, its lowest price since Dec. 3.
March silver rose 11.5 cents, to $5.135 an ounce, also on the Comex.
 
Inflation Fears Ebb
 Gold's drop of $18.70 since Jan. 20 was motivated in part by fading inflation fears. The market's disinflationary mood was reinforced yesterday morning when the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the central bank would need to raise short-term interest rates "at some point" to guard against inflation.
Mr. Greenspan's comments set off an immediate drop in gold prices, which is often perceived by investors as an inflation hedge. The market then settled into a tug-of-war between players trying to push it below $375 and those looking to buy back contracts they had sold at higher prices. The latter forces won.
"It was a case where everyone who wanted to sell had sold, and it kind of left a vacuum above the market," Tom Griffo, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services in New York, said.
United States investment funds and floor traders were the most active players, Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential Securities said. She said the strength of global stock markets suggested the world economy was reviving. As for gold's recent decline, "it's over," she said.
Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Westfalia Investments, agreed that the market had touched bottom but did not foresee gold surpassing recent highs any time soon. "The market's going to remain in a tight range between $375 and $390," he said.
Elsewhere, cotton for March delivery soared the permitted daily limit of 2 cents on the New York Cotton Exchange to 77.86 cents a pound, the highest settlement for near-term deliveries since June 25, 1991. The move accelerated a powerful rally that began in mid-November with prices below 60 cents a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off Over Uncertainty On Interest Rates and Trade

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar eased against other leading currencies yesterday as traders' expectations of a near-term increase in American interest rates were replaced by uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.
Traders were also uneasy about the trade talks between the United States and Japan. 
 In statements to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, disappointed the market because he failed to disclose when monetary tightening would take place.
He said the top item on the agenda at this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting starting on Thursday would be deciding when to push up interest rates. He added that real short-term interest rates were "abnormally low" and that at some point the Fed must move them to a more neutral stance.
"Greenspan didn't say anything that sounded like imminent tightening and so the dollar fell off," said Richard Koss, director of foreign exchange sales for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
 
Dollar Firm Recently
 The dollar has firmed recently amid growing expectations for higher American interest rates. Higher rates make dollar-denominated assets relatively more attractive than foreign investments, as the economy grows.
The dollar also weakened in the absence of evidence of new progress toward an American-Japanese trade agreement. Without an agreement, the United States is likely to push for a stronger Japanese yen, and thus a weaker dollar, in order to narrow the American trade deficit with Japan. A stronger yen would make Japanese goods more expensive in the United States, while reducing the effective price of American exports to Japan.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 108.65 yen, from 109.90 yen on Friday. The dollar also fell to 1.7330 German marks in New York trading from 1.7427 marks.
The British pound rose to $1.5065 in New York, from $1.4950 on Friday.
The Canadian dollar weakened sharply against most leading currencies except the United States dollar. Dealers attributed the decline to futures-related selling and liquidation by foreign investors. The Bank of Canada bought Canadian dollars to try to smooth the slide.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
President To Become Mobil Chief

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Lucio A. Noto, the president and chief operating officer of the Mobil Corporation, was named on Friday to succeed Allen E. Murray as chairman and chief executive in a move that analysts said might bring some change in the management style but not in the direction of one of the world's leading oil companies.
Mr. Noto, 55, grew up in Brooklyn, and as did Mr. Murray, came up on the financial, rather than the production, side of the company. 
 "I would like to express my own deep personal satisfaction with the board's decision," said Mr. Murray, who was born in Queens and will retire on March 1 after 41 years at Mobil, which is based in Fairfax, Va.
Mr. Noto made his career largely overseas, running Mobil's refineries and gasoline stations in Italy and Japan. From 1977 to 1985 he built Mobil's presence in Saudi Arabia.
 
Close to Saudi Leaders
 Mr. Noto moved to Jidda, Saudi Arabia, in 1979 and became close to many of the Saudi leaders while helping to set up joint ventures in petrochemicals and a big refinery.
The overseas experience will serve him well, some analysts said, because Mobil, like other big oil companies, faces the challenge of finding new oil and gas deposits to replace fields that will run down this decade. Most of the new exploration will be in areas like Russia, Kazakhstan, East Asia and Africa.
"The challenge for Mobil is the challenge facing all major oil companies," Constantine Fliakos, oil analyst for Merrill Lynch, said. He said Mr. Noto and his company would have to find large new fields to replace the highly successful ventures like its natural gas business in Indonesia, where Mobil has a liquefaction plant from which it supplies gas to Japan.
 
Formed Management Team
 "It's not easy to find such projects," Mr. Fliakos said. But he added that Mr. Noto would have a good team that had been formed by himself and Mr. Murray.
Both executives have long worked in tandem to shed extraneous businesses and refocus Mobil on its core oil and gas business. Both have sought to cut costs and increase the efficiency and profitability of its refineries and huge chain of stations.
Mr. Murray sold Montgomery Ward and the Container Corporation of America, which were distracting management, to reduce debt. Acquisitions like a Tenneco refinery in Chalmette, La., were made to build up the core business.
Analysts said they expected Mr. Noto to move faster to shed operations in areas where Mobil has a weak market share, and he may keep a tighter hold on the purse strings when financing new projects.
 
Holds Degree in Physics
 After graduating with a degree in physics from Notre Dame in 1959, Mr. Noto got an M.B.A. at Cornell University in 1962. He worked as a summer intern for Mobil that year and then was hired as a member of its regional planning analysis group.
Four years later Mr. Noto went to Italy to work for Mobil Oil Italiana. He then worked in Japan for five years and came back to Italy as an executive vice president.
After building up Mobil's presence in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Noto was brought back to the company's headquarters in 1985; he was made vice president of planning and economics a year later.
He became a contender for the top job when he was elected a director in 1988 and was made the chief financial officer a year later.

HEADLINE: An Israeli Anxiety: Should Charity Stay at Home?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Jewish lore has a soft spot for the shnorrer -- in Yiddish a beggar, even a moocher, but a mendicant with wit and brass.
"I don't have a cent right now," a man says to the shnorrer. "Come back tomorrow." 
 "My friend," the shnorrer says with a sigh, "if you only knew what a fortune I've lost by extending credit."
Less humorously, the word "shnorrer" dominates a rekindled political debate here over whether that is what Israel has become.
Some ask whether a country that is ever more prosperous, with pockets of great wealth, should continue its decades-old practice of asking Jews abroad for cash donations totaling hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
 
A Sensitive Relationship
 Even as they accept the money, much of it going for programs for new immigrants, some Israelis are resentful about the relationship. They sense that they are patronized by their overseas Jewish cousins as a people who may win wars but who would be unable to hold themselves together economically if not for outside help.
And increasingly, in speeches, books and articles, some of them are telling fellow Jews: Keep your gifts. If you want to feel kinship, increase your business investments instead, and send your children on work and study trips. The donations amount to less than 1 percent of Israel's annual gross domestic product of $65 billion.
Although not new, the debate has resurfaced with the intensity and occasional nastiness of a family dispute, which is what it basically is. The catalyst was a speech this month by Yossi Beilin, the outspoken Deputy Foreign Minister, who appeared before Zionist fund-raisers and told them that their dollars were no longer needed.
 
Beilin's Bombshell
 "If our economic situation is better than in many of your countries, how can we go on asking for your charity?" he said at a gathering of the Women's International Zionist Organization.
When delegates protested, Mr. Beilin replied: "You want me to be the beggar and say we need money for the poor people. Israel is a rich country, I'm sorry to tell you."
His remarks did not sit well everywhere, especially with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Not one for sugarcoated observations, he called the Beilin speech "completely moronic."
Israel considers itself responsible for Jews around the world, Mr. Rabin said. But by the same token, he added, those Jews have a duty to share the burden of tending to nearly 500,000 newcomers who have poured into Israel since 1989, most from the former Soviet Union. "I don't feel like a shnorrer when I demand that world Jewry help the Israeli Government and people to absorb immigrants," he said.
Besides, he argued, if Israelis stop calling on fellow Jews for help, "what right do we have to ask the American taxpayer to give us $3 billion every year" -- Israel's total of United States military and economic aid, by far the most for a single country.
 
Fund-Raisers Displeased
 No less unhappy were pro-Israel groups. While no one may like "checkbook Zionism," they said, cash contributions enable diaspora Jews to show solidarity with the Jewish state. "It's the glue that holds the whole thing together," said Harry Wall, Israeli director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. Michal Modai, international chairwoman of the Women's International Zionist Organization, the group that Mr. Beilin outraged, added that the money was in fact needed because "so much poverty" seemed to be beyond Government solution.
Israel, poor? On one level, yes.
Government figures show that more than 600,000 people in a population of 5.2 million -- and at least 20 percent of the children -- live below the official poverty line, defined as a monthly income of $675 for a couple with two children.
Israel, rich? On another level, also yes.
Its per capita gross domestic product for 1992 was $12,610, putting it on a par with Hong Kong and well ahead of some European Union members like Portugal and Greece. There certainly is no shortage of expensive cars or consumer products.
The problem, Mr. Beilin says, is not an absence of wealth but uneven distribution.
Merits of the argument aside, he clearly touched a raw nerve in the symbiosis between the 4.2 million Jews in Israel and the nearly 9 million Jews in the diaspora, two-thirds of them in North America.
Even before the creation of the state in 1948, Jews here expected overseas brethren to help settle the land, if not with their bodies then with their purses. A multi-tier network of contributions developed. Unfortunately, says Avraham Avi-Hai, a Canadian-born Israeli writer who has worked with several fund-raising groups, "many ambivalences in the Israel-diaspora relationship" also developed.
"There is the love of Israel, pity for Israel, respect for the heroic Israel, condescension for the poor and backward Israel," Mr. Avi-Hai writes in a new book, "Danger! Three Jewish Peoples."
Virtually no important Israeli organization gets by without overseas cup-rattling.
There is also direct government-to-government aid, conspicuously Washington's $3 billion.
And there is money from groups like the United Jewish Appeal, the main fund-raiser in the United States. In tandem with scores of local federations, it collected $841 million in 1992.
Much of it stayed home, for Jewish education and social programs. Less than 40 percent, $313 million, was sent on to Israel, through the Joint Distribution Committee and the Jewish Agency, lately under attack by critics as bloated and obsolete.
The fact that such private aid comes to less than 1 percent of their gross domestic product persuades many Israelis that they could live without it. Israeli universities and museums have their own elaborate fund-raising mechanisms abroad. So do big cities like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. So do the major political parties. So do Jewish settlers in the territories. So do the settlers' Jewish opponents.
Politicians, former generals, professors, journalists -- all join this money circuit.
 
Biting the Hand?
 Especially irksome to some American Jews are the Israeli politicians of all ideological stripes who barnstorm the United States and then slap down their hosts, saying that their money does not buy them the right to tell Israel what to do because they do not share the risks of living here.
At the same time, Israelis have their own grievances, including a complaint that overseas Jews use them as bait to bring in money that largely stays home and never makes it here.
"Everybody's out there shnorring," said Matti Golan, editor in chief of Telegraph, a business daily, and a critic of the overseas circuit. "But many Israelis don't want to hear it. And the Americans don't want to hear that we don't need charity. It's not that I don't want their money. I want it in a more suitable way, with investments."
Mr. Beilin, somewhat chastened by the criticism he received, explained last week in remarks to a Hadassah convention from the United States that he wanted money-raising groups to re-examine their missions, not to go out of business. In New York, Rabbi Brian L. Lurie, executive vice president of the United Jewish Appeal, says soul-searching is already under way.
"The noblesse oblige that we once thought to be our role is gone," Rabbi Lurie said. "We have to look on this now as voluntary taxes to help the entire Jewish people in partnership with the taxpayers of Israel."
But that does not mean misunderstanding will disappear, Rabbi Lurie warns. "The dichotomy between those inside and those outside," he said, "goes back to Babylon."

HEADLINE: U.S. Asks Allies to Help Speed I.M.F. Aid to Russia

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has proposed to its Western allies that they work more closely with the International Monetary Fund and the Russian Government to help both sides work out loans for Moscow, which have been stalled for months over Russia's reluctance to meet I.M.F. terms.
The United States has also proposed speeding the amount of money available through the World Bank for privatizing and repairing state industries, as well as trying to get some hard cash into the hands of Russia and Ukraine by having international financial institutions lend money to other former Soviet republics that have not been able to buy Russian oil or goods now that they must pay real world prices instead of subsidized rates.
 
Essential for Agreement
 All of these proposals are part of an evolving American response to events in Russia that officials say will be driven by three imperatives: 
 *First is a desire to prove to Russians that Western-backed economic reform is not all pain and no gain by getting more concrete benefits to people on the ground.
*Second is a willingness to press ahead with the $4.1 billion in purely American aid programs aimed not at the central Government but at small grass-roots programs promoting capitalism and democracy in towns and villages.
*Third is a refusal to weaken the conditions the I.M.F. has set before any more large-scale aid promised to the Russian Government by the Group of Seven is disbursed by the fund.
American officials say they not only endorse these conditions, but they believe that without firm I.M.F. targets for lowering Russian inflation and Government spending neither their partners in the Group of Seven industrialized democracies nor the Congress would go along with aid for Russia.
But where American officials believe the I.M.F. may be faulted is that when Russia has adopted economic measures that run contrary to I.M.F. advice, the fund has not worked hard enough to persuade the Russians of the right course. Instead, they say, it has let negotiations lapse for long periods while it waited for the Russian authorities to return to their senses. American officials concede that the Western allies have entrusted the I.M.F. with important elements of the aid effort to Russia without paying close attention.
What the United States has proposed to the other Group of Seven members -- which is almost sure to be accepted -- is that their deputy finance ministers meet with greater frequency to monitor the discussions between the I.M.F. and Russia to insure that Moscow was taking seriously, and understood, the fund's conditions.
"The idea is that the G-7 would be asking how things are going, not letting time lapse, and making sure that everyone is getting together to discuss the situation," a senior American policy maker said. "The fund can be faulted for a certain lack of urgency at times, but they have had the right instincts about demanding that the Russians control inflation as a condition for aid."
The managing director of the I.M.F., Michel Camdessus, said last Friday that an I.M.F. team will leave for Russia on Tuesday to reopen discussions with the Russian Government about how it can meet conditions for another $1.5 billion in economic assistance.
Talks between the fund and the Russian Government have been interrupted as a result of several surprises by Moscow -- ranging from July's decision to recall all rubles printed before 1991 to the announcement last month that Belarus would become part of the Russian Economic Union, under terms viewed as inflationary by the West.
"This took us, the G-7, the I.M.F. and the World Bank by surprise," a senior American official said. "So each time this happens the I.M.F. says, 'We'd better sit back and see what the Russians are going to do.' This causes delays. The idea is that when Russian policies become inconsistent with economic stability, the G-7 would step in and engage the Russians and the I.M.F. -- not just let everyone go home."
The United States has proposed to its Group of Seven partners some other concrete steps that they might take to encourage economic reform in Russia -- despite its new go-slow, conservative Cabinet.
 
Privatization Fund
 At the Tokyo summit meeting last July, the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Germany -- promised Russia a $3 billion Special Privatization and Restructuring Program to help break apart and privatize the huge state-owned Russian industries that dominate whole towns.
One of Russia's problems is that these companies provide all the social services for their workers, everything from health care to resorts for recreation. The Russian Government does not want to close them down because they constitute the country's social safety net. Of the $3 billion promised, the World Bank was supposed to provide $500 million to help these companies shift their social service responsibilities to the municipalities.
The Administration has proposed to its Group of Seven partners that they intensify their efforts to speed up delivery of this loan, which the Russians have been resisting because they do not want to go into debt for anything that does not generate income. The Americans also want the World Bank to move ahead with more structural assistance for specific Russian industries.
The idea, American officials say, is that while it may make no sense now to be supporting the Russian Government budget when the country is in hyperinflation, it does make sense for the World Bank to help repair Russian oil wells that will earn hard currency.


GRAPHIC: Of the $28.4 billion in aid promised by the West to Russia in 1993, $8 billion has been disbursed.

Chart: "Promises, Promises: Moscow Waits"
 Of the $4.1 billion in short-term currency stabilization support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, $1.8 billion has been disbursed. The rest still awaits Russia's meeting lower inflation targets.
 Of the $10.1 billion in long-term currency stabilization funds, none have been disbursed; this depends on comprehensive economic reforms, which the Russian Government has not even begun negotiating wiht the I.M.F.
 Of the $14.2 billion in export credits pledged by various members of the Group of Seven, about $6.2 billion has been disbursed. This money was to allow the Russians to buy goods on credit and obtain technical assistance to revamp various segments of the Russian economy.

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
The I.R.A.'s Advocate: Gerard Adams

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
After long years of ostracism by Washington, Gerry Adams, the political head of the Irish Republican Army, was permitted onto American soil yesterday and immediately predicted that Northern Ireland's 25 years of urban guerrilla warfare would enter a climactic stage toward peace.
"Let me be quite clear about this: this generation of republicans is going to see peace in Ireland," Mr. Adams said upon arriving for a conference about the intransigent politics and deadly troubles of Ulster. 
 Mr. Adams, an articulate and enigmatic partisan leader in a centuries-old struggle, commended President Clinton for reversing his visa ban. At an airport news conference, he expressed optimism in the long run but made no predictions of a peace breakthrough during his New York visit.
"It's a small step," he said of finally reaching America, with its influential political and news media institutions. "But it's also a small victory for free speech." As president of Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political arm, Mr. Adams has been subject to censorship in Britain and, until recently, in the Irish Republic.
His supporters were busy yesterday booking him onto television news shows, most likely guaranteeing him more exposure in his two days in New York than he has been able to achieve in years of muted coverage at home.
His very arrival, after eight earlier denials of a visa, was hailed by his jubilant Irish-American partisans as a historic step of recognition for his side in the agonizing warfare that has long afflicted Northern Ireland and British mainland targets.
 
'A Legitimate Force'
 "He's been brought out of the shadows by Clinton," said Representative Peter T. King, the Nassau County Republican and staunch Adams ally.
"This finally recognizes Sinn Fein and the I.R.A. as a legitimate force in Northern Ireland -- not bad for an ex-bartender from Northern Ireland," said Mr. King, who predicted that the visitor would make the most of his visit in explaining the I.R.A.'s position in 25 years of violent resistance to British rule in Ulster.
Some British and American diplomats were complaining that Mr. Adams had made no real change, as the White House insisted, in his long-standing defense of I.R.A. violence. They contended that President Clinton was mainly yielding to domestic political pressures.
But Mr. Adams's supporters argued that the President had belatedly recognized the I.R.A.'s central role in the troubles and that the inclusion of Mr. Adams improved the chances for productive negotiations.
"I think what we have to do, in the words of Albert Reynolds, is to produce a demilitarized society," Mr. Adams declared at Kennedy International Airport, referring to the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic.
Mr. Adams, lean and darkly bearded, is the central figure in one of the most promising but delicate peace initiatives in years, one in which the British and Irish Governments have offered him a position at the negotiating table in return for a cessation of I.R.A. violence. The violence lately has lessened but not ceased, producing some qualified optimism.
 
A Veteran of the Troubles
 A 44-year-old veteran of the troubles, Mr. Adams has not yet committed himself to the formal peace proposal. But his arrival in this country for a separate discussion of Northern Ireland is considered a significant step both in this initiative and, even more, his own long fight to win greater understanding and legitimacy for the I.R.A.
Mr. Adams is to attend a conference on Irish peace prospects today at the Waldorf-Astoria, sponsored by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a private organization.
"I think we are at a very critical point in the peace process," Mr. Adams said, comparing its complex and lethal dimensions to the Middle East peace talks currently making progress.
The brutal war in Northern Ireland has involved military and civilian targets and seen 3,114 killed since 1969 -- an estimated 1,400 attributed to the I.R.A. and the rest to Protestant paramilitary fighters organized against the predominantly Roman Catholic I.R.A. and to British troops.
Mr. Adams denies that he is de facto general of the I.R.A.'s street campaign. But his supporters here and in Ireland say he is the only figure with enough stature and credibility to take up the offer from London and Dublin and lead the more militant members of the I.R.A. toward peace talks.
"This makes him a major player," Mr. King said of the visit, contending that it was easing a long and unfair foreign policy tilt toward London by Washington. British and Northern Ireland officials and other Adams critics consider the visit an implicit victory for urban terrorist tactics.
In this latest endeavor, his precise position on violence has been called into question, and Mr. Adams has offered some fresh language now being scrutinized by critics and supporters.
His long-held view is that without "the cutting edge" of the I.R.A. guerrilla campaign, "Ireland would not even be an issue." Lately, he has also said he wants "to bring an end to the Irish Republican Army, to be taking the gun out of Irish politics." This is language that foresees an I.R.A. triumph in reuniting Ireland, a possibility that chills the Protestant majority of Northern Ireland.
On the "Larry King Live" television program last night, Mr. Adams once more called for the "demilitarization" of the issue -- a call in effect for the withdrawal of British troops who are looked on as vital protectors by the Northern Protestant majority.
The program also offered Americans a taste of the complex acrimony of the issue as Mr. Adams was questioned and rebutted by Dr. John Alderdice, a Protestant rival and leader of the Alliance Party, and accused of engaging in the words but not the actions of peacemaking.
The awful lesson of Mr. Adam's winning a visa, Dr. Alderdice said, is that "violence on the republican side has gotten them credits," so that loyalist violence is now rising among the I.R.A.'s Protestant enemies.
Gerard Adams grew up in the Falls Road slum of Belfast, where bombings and sniper warfare have raged for a generation, and he suffered neck and shoulder wounds in an attack by his enemies 10 years ago. He is one of 10 children, the son of a laborer also convicted as an I.R.A. partisan. His first efforts were in the peaceful civil rights protests of the 1960's against British rule.
In 1972, he was freed from imprisonment as an I.R.A. leader and flown to London for peace talks, which failed. Elected to the British Parliament from Northern Ireland, Mr. Adams never took his seat as part of the I.R.A. protest of British rule. He lost the seat in 1992 to the North's more popular and moderate Catholic faction, the Social and Democratic Labor Party.
Mr. Adams is a history student more aware than most of the many false starts toward peace in the Irish struggle. "It is a bit of a grind and it would be wrong to say that one doesn't get despondent," he admitted four years ago.
For him, the cause is for an Ireland reunited and resurgent enough to undo the economic underpinnings of the struggle, which he finds rooted in the two parts of the Belfast underclass, the impoverished, embattled Catholic and Protestant ghettos.
In recent years, Mr. Adams, who is married to the former Colette McArdle and has a 20-year-old son, Gearoid, has expressed concern that "what I've gone through and my father has gone through is going to be the same for our children and grandchildren." He added: "We have to end it. And I think I can."
But in the face of all the killing, Mr. Adams's critics have branded him a terrorist and a hypocrite for his expressions of regret and apology for some of the more wayward I.R.A. bombings and civilian casualties. His supporters -- including a pro-I.R.A. faction of Irish-Americans -- hold that he is the only "hard man of destiny" now on the Ulster scene who might have anything approaching the resources needed to bring about peace.

HEADLINE: FIGURE SKATING;
Lawyer for Skater's Ex-Husband Says He Has Tied Her to Attack

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 31

 BODY:
Jeff Gillooly, the former husband of Tonya Harding, has told investigators that Miss Harding helped plan the assault on her figure-skating rival, Nancy Kerrigan, Mr. Gillooly's lawyer said today.
Ronald H. Hoevet, the lawyer, said Mr. Gillooly told Federal investigators last week that Miss Harding had given final approval for the Jan. 6 attack in Detroit, where Miss Kerrigan was struck above the right knee and kept from competing in the national championships. The lawyer said Mr. Gillooly's account was fully detailed, and included many points that could be corroborated by phone logs and bank records. 
 Miss Harding, who initially denied any knowledge of the plot, said last week that she had learned several days after the attack that several people close to her had been involved. However, in more than 10 hours of interviews with investigators on Jan. 18, she consistently denied knowing anything in advance about plans for the attack.
Mr. Gillooly identified Miss Harding as an important figure in planning the attack only after he learned that she had told the authorities that he had played the central role, his lawyer said. She had been telling him privately that she did not implicate him in her statements to the investigators, Mr. Hoevet said.
Miss Harding's lawyer, Robert C. Weaver Jr., did not return several telephone messages left for him.
Mr. Gillooly, a 26-year-old former warehouse worker who is currently unemployed, is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday morning to accept a plea bargain offer from the Multnomah district attorney's office. Mr. Hoevet said that his client has accepted a proposal of pleading guilty to a single count of racketeering and a fine of $100,000 in exchange for telling his version of what happened and a maximum jail term of two years, one year less than he could have received on the original charge of conspiracy to commit assault.
As part of any plea bargain agreement in Oregon, the court routinely makes public reports by law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which interviewed both Miss Harding and Mr. Gillooly. Norman W. Frink, the deputy district attorney, said he assumed that those statements would be released on Tuesday.
Mr. Hoevet said he was speaking out now to send a message to United States Olympic officials that Miss Harding should be "eliminated from the Olympic team." "She is entitled to due process, for sure," Mr. Hoevet said of Miss Harding. "But we would be a morally bankrupt nation if we send to the Olympic games as teammates, Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding, a woman who helped get her whacked."
Skating officials are making their own inquiry. They had no comment on Mr. Hoevet's statements. Mike Moran, spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, said it would be inappropriate to comment on the Harding matter.

 
 
Evidence Includes Videotape
 In a 30-minute interview today, in which he revealed many of the details of Mr. Gillooly's 17 hours of testimony over two days last week, Mr. Hoevet made these general points, based on his client's assertions:
*Miss Harding, who lived with Mr. Gillooly at the time despite their divorce, was involved with Mr. Gillooly in planning the assault from a point in early December after she finished fourth, a disappointment, at a skating competition in Japan.
*Mr. Gillooly identified a Pennsylvania woman well-connected in figure-skating circles who Miss Harding called to ask for help in learning Miss Kerrigan's home address in Stoneham, Mass., and details of her training schedule at her practice rink on Cape Cod.
*Investigators have compiled a wealth of corroborating evidence that bears out much of what Mr. Gillooly told them, including telephone logs, money transfers and videotape surveillance of movements around Portland by Mr. Gillooly and Miss Harding after they returned to Portland from Detroit on Jan. 10.
On one tape, Mr. Hoevet said, Federal investigators have pictures of the couple driving back and forth in front of the home of Shawn E. Eckardt, Miss Harding's one-time body guard, at a time they knew Mr. Eckardt was being interviewed by the authorities.
Mr. Eckardt is one of three other men charged in the case. The authorities say he confessed to arranging with the two others, Shane M. Stant and Derrick B. Smith, to carry out the attack.
Mr. Frink said he would have no comment on any aspect of Mr. Gillooly's statement, other than to say the investigation was continuing.

 
 
Olympics Issue Unresolved
 The United States Figure Skating Association and the U.S.O.C. are monitoring the case and are waiting for a five-member panel from the skating association to complete its own investigation. The group is scheduled to meet for the first time on Tuesday and make a recommendation by the weekend whether there is reasonable cause to bring Miss Harding before a disciplinary panel.
But the ultimate decision of whether she would be allowed to skate in the Olympics belongs to the U.S.O.C., which certified Miss Harding as a member of the Lillehammer team today. The women's figure-skating competition in the Lillehammer Olympics is scheduled to start on Feb. 23.
William J. Hybl, chairman of the skating association panel and a former U.S.O.C. president, said from Colorado Springs that whatever evidence arises out of Mr. Gillooly's court appearance "would be weighed along with all the other evidence. Obviously, if there is any indication of prior knowledge on Miss Harding's part, that would be weighed very carefully by the panel."
Mr. Hoevet said that Mr. Gillooly's statements to investigators about Miss Harding "implicated her in the plot from the beginning. He told them that Tonya gave the final O.K. for the attack."

 
 
Concern About Politics
 The motivation for the couple to initiate an attack of Miss Kerrigan, he said, came from Miss Harding's poor performance in Chiba, Japan, and their fear that judges in the United States would hold it against her at the national championships, from which only two women would make the American Olympic team.
"They viewed Kerrigan as the clear favorite, the fair-haired girl," Mr. Hoevet said. "They thought what happened to Tonya in Japan was politics and that would hurt her in Detroit."
As a result, he said, reflecting the statement Mr. Gillooly gave the authorities, Miss Harding "gave the final O.K." to devise a plan that would remove Miss Kerrigan from the national championships. "It was up to Tonya," Mr. Hoevet said.
Through statements of Mr. Eckardt, Mr. Stant and Mr. Smith, the authorities patched together an outline of what they say happened, with Mr. Gillooly giving Mr. Eckardt $2,000, and Mr. Stant initiating his attempt to commit the assault in one of several Massachusetts locations. The assault was later carried out as Miss Kerrigan left a practice rink in Detroit.

 
 
Denial Changes to Confession
 But even after all four men were charged, Mr. Hoevet said that Mr. Gillooly would not have implicated Miss Harding had she not misled him in their "personal contacts" after her interview with investigators.
Mr. Hoevet and several other people familiar with Miss Harding's interview said that after hours of denying any knowledge of the plot, Miss Harding finally changed her story to say that Mr. Gillooly was deeply involved but that she only found out about it days later. In her first public comments on the case last week, she apologized for her delay in informing the authorities of what she learned. "My first reaction was one of disbelief,' she said. "The disbelief was followed by shock and fear."
Yet Mr. Hoevet said that Miss Harding and Mr. Gillooly were in contact after Miss Harding gave her statement to investigators, and in those conversations, he said, Miss Harding assured Mr. Gillooly that she had not told the authorities that he helped plan the attack.
Mr. Hoevet, who had maintained his own conversations with prosecutors and the district attorney's office, said he knew that what Miss Harding was telling Mr. Gillooly was false. He told his client. "But at that point," he said, "Jeff knew in his head, but not in his heart." He was still reluctant to say that Miss Harding had helped plan the attack, Mr. Hoevet said.
Finally, Mr. Hoevet said he offered to show his client the actual F.B.I. reports, a 46-page document, from its interview with Miss Harding. It even included what Miss Harding ate during a break, a turkey sandwich.
"That convinced him," Mr. Hoevet said, and in another conversation with Miss Harding, he quoted Mr. Gillooly as saying, "Tonya, you're not telling the truth. I saw the notes."
Mr. Hoevet said that Mr. Gillooly was also willing to go forward because he knew that the statements by the other three men had tied him tightly to the crime.
"The case against him was overwhelming," Mr. Hoevet said. "When he finally had his interview, he didn't minimize anything. Not even his own role."

Nike Gives $25,000 to Harding
 PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 31 (AP) -- Nike contributed $25,000 today to help Tonya Harding defend her place on the United States Olympic Team.
Philip Knight, the chief executive officer of the company, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., said he feared that Harding, who does not have a contract with Nike, would be forced off the team before the criminal justice system has rendered judgment on whether she had a role in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan.
"If she wins and is guilty, you can take her medals away, but if, in fact she is innocent and doesn't get to skate, you can never repair that damage, ever," Knight told ESPN.

HEADLINE: Home Rule's Exclusive, Costly Kingdoms

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DERING HARBOR, L.I., Jan. 28

 BODY:
Sitting on a gently sloping hill of elm and locust trees that leads to a rocky beach, Dering Harbor offers virtually none of the amenities of a modern municipality. No post office. No playground. Not a single quaint country shop. Just 32 houses, a puny water tower and a maintenance staff named Richie.
Still, it is an incorporated village, the smallest in New York State, a locality with a budget of $115,000 a year and two major parties: the Independent Party, from which all candidates for village mayor and trustee are drawn, and the yearly summer cocktail party, to which all Dering Harbor is invited. 
 "We're just doing on a very small scale what other places are doing on a larger scale," said the Rev. Stewart W. Herman, the village historian, a retired Lutheran minister who comprises nearly 4 percent of Dering Harbor's official population of 28. (Some of the 32 houses are occupied only in the summer, when the population swells to 90.)
While Dering Harbor's size is singular, there is nothing unusual in these parts about its tight embrace of self-determination.
Dering Harbor, on Shelter Island in Suffolk County, is only one of 94 incorporated villages within the 13 towns encompassed by the two counties that make up Long Island. And that is not to mention the hundreds of other governmental bodies with the powers to tax and set fees -- the street-lighting districts and fire districts, water districts and sewer districts, park districts and sidewalk districts and garbage districts and, in one Nassau County hamlet at one time, a railroad-station escalator district.
Long Islanders, like their suburban brethren in Westchester County and much of New Jersey, are locked in an embrace with home rule, a devotion that has created a fragmented and often duplicative system of local control of streets, parks and schools, a system that has helped make property taxes in New York's suburbs among the highest in the nation.
It is a system that some critics say has also fostered a sense of separateness and racial and ethnic exclusion in many suburbs, a way of government that lets some communities tightly control the kinds of businesses and people who can live there.
Home rule has also inspired a veritable cottage industry of blue-ribbon panels issuing multi-volume reports and calls for streamlining and reform. But the calls are rarely answered, for as anyone who has ever studied the phenomenon will acknowledge, home rule is as securely anchored in the soil of suburbia as a swimming pool or a backyard deck.
The New York suburbs are not the only area of the nation where home rule is treasured. A 1987 Census survey showed that Illinois ranked first in the nation in the number of local governments; New York ranked eighth. But officials in the metropolitan region say that few localities compare with Long Island for the multiple layers of local government. Along the 32 miles of Fire Island's coastline, for example, seven separate entities -- two villages, two towns, Suffolk County, the State of New York and the Federal Government -- regulate the beaches.
John V. N. Klein, a lawyer and former Suffolk County Executive, says he makes his living today as a kind of municipal Sherpa, navigating the various levels of local government for out-of-town businesses seeking to locate on the Island.
"These people with headquarters in Texas, California or Michigan, they end up in my lap because they just discover they are at the edge of a governmental Okefenokee Swamp, and they can't even get across without a guide," said Mr. Klein. "They are absolutely dumbfounded by the multiplicity, the regulations and agencies that have a voice in the simplest of projects."
 
'Fantasy' in New Jersey
 The latest salvo against home rule occurred two weeks ago, when Gov. Jim Florio, in his farewell address, proclaimed New Jersey's patchwork approach to local government -- 567 municipalities and 610 school districts -- wasteful and outmoded. He told the Legislature it was time to end what he called "a fantasy where we think small is automatically better," and even uttered a word that strikes fear in the hearts of those who cherish home rule: "regionalization."
It was the echo of a complaint that has been lodged again and again by political scientists, business leaders and officials of higher levels of government, a complaint that rarely earns a politician points with voters.
"Isn't it interesting?" observed Clifford Zukin, a professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. "We had a Governor who was willing to take on raising every tax and never looked away, and even with that Governor, he mentioned home rule only when he was going out, not when he was coming in."
In the end, it may not matter what Mr. Florio says: where home rule is concerned, no one seems to listen. In 1966, the Committee for Economic Development, an independent policy research group in Manhattan, studied local governments in the United States and recommended that 80 percent of them be eliminated. Twenty years later, the Census Bureau found that the number of local governmental units had grown by about 3,000.
 
'Out of Control' on L.I.
 To some on Long Island, where more than 1,000 separate government bodies have the power to reach into taxpayers' wallets, home rule has got out of hand. "With four tiers of government and hundreds of separate taxing units, it is to a large extent out of control," said Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board.
Mr. Koppelman, who also heads the Center for Policy Studies at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, is the Don Quixote of local consolidation, forever tilting at the excesses of home rule -- and never getting very far. In 1992 he and his staff produced a three-volume report for the State Temporary Commission for Tax Relief on Long Island, offering recommendations for privatization and consolidation of services.
Mr. Koppelman said that if his recommendations were adopted -- from merging school districts to cutting duplicated services -- the savings to Long Island taxpayers could total more than $500 million.
In a time when voters were expressing frustration over high taxes, he hoped the report would be received enthusiastically. "What I thought this time was the Island was facing such a crisis that it was impossible for them to ignore the work," he said. "And I thought, 'This time something is going to come out of it.' "
 
Mostly More Committees
 Nothing much did. A few recommendations were adopted; other committees were formed. Mr. Koppelman is not pleased. "The more we looked into it, the more it was clear there was bloat in government," he said. "That's precisely what it is: bloat."
In some parts of Long Island, in fact, creating more levels of government is still in vogue. Last year, owners of houses along a section of erosion-wracked Dune Road in Westhampton Beach, where summer cottages wash away with each new storm, voted 87 to 0 to form a new village, Westhampton Dunes, in hopes of gaining influence to remedy their problems. And earlier this month Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed in his new budget to give $50,000 to a Long Island institute to determine whether five East End towns should leave Suffolk County and form a new one, Peconic County.
"It's out of control, and nobody knows how to put the genie back in the bottle," said Patrick Halpin, a former Suffolk County Executive. He traces the suburbs' infatuation with home rule to the postwar generation that fled the cities in search of a different way of life. "They wanted to have some control over their community, their destiny, which they felt they didn't have in the city," he said.
Mr. Halpin learned about the dangers of challenging home rule the hard way. In his 1988 State of the County address, he observed that half as many children were being educated in the county as had been 20 years earlier.
 
'Have You Gone Mad?'
 "I asked a simple question: 'Why do we need 72 school districts?' " Mr. Halpin, now a local political commentator and businessman, recalled. "And all hell broke loose. I heard immediately from all the school districts, who said, 'How dare you tread on our turf!' And then I heard from my friends in the teachers' union, who said, 'Have you gone mad?' "
There is perhaps no place that practices a homier home rule than Dering Harbor. It is so small that when 11 lots in the 200-acre village went up for sale a few years ago, village residents suddenly had to scare up a planning board; there hadn't been one before, said the Mayor, Tim Hogue. (The land was never developed.) It is the kind of place where the landscaping that surrounds village hall comes from taxpayers' gardens and where the one full-time village employee, Richie Surozenski, does everything from mowing the lawns to plowing the roads.
"It's to give people some extra services and control," said Mr. Hogue, a financial consultant who divides his time between an apartment in Manhattan and a white Victorian house a block from the water. The village budget pays the salaries of Mr. Surozenski and a part-time village clerk as well as the costs of trash disposal and a water district. The village pays the Town of Shelter Island for police and fire protection.
Mr. Herman, the retired minister, and his wife are two of a handful of year-round residents of the community, a place he described in his privately printed 1976 history of Dering Harbor, "The Smallest Village," as "no more than a good-sized farm." It was founded in 1916 by the well-to-do owners of the summer homes that dotted the hill overlooking the harbor at the northern end of Shelter Island, and was incorporated for much the same reasons other Long Island municipalities have organized: to keep something out.
 
Nothing Much Comes In

In his book Mr. Herman wrote that there had been "whispered fears" among the founding fathers about the potential encroachement by "concessions that degenerate into some kind of Coney Island Boardwalk."
The concessionaires never came, and neither did much of anything else. Dering Harbor has remained out of the way and largely unnoticed, so anonymous that occasionally the part-time village clerk, Margaret Gibney, receives letters addressed to the village with checks and requests for reservations that were intended for the nearby Dering Harbor Inn. Which is not in Dering Harbor.
"Very little happens here," sighed Mayor Hogue, after explaining that the village does not encourage the inquiries of the curious. "We're such a boring group of people."
Even in Dering Harbor, it occurs to inhabitants like Mr. Herman that perhaps the $2,500 he pays in village taxes each year is a bit steep for what amounts to garbage pickup and the privilege of living in a municipality operating separately from the Town of Shelter Island (Pop. 2,265).
But eventually, as with all things in this laconic village, the concerns seem to recede with the tides.
"There's been some discussion as to whether it is outmoded," Mr. Herman said as he tooled around the village in his station wagon, pointing out sights like the water tower. "But we stop to think about it. And then the inertia sets in."

HEADLINE: U.S. BLOOD SUPPLY HITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE WORLD WAR II

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
Once again, the nation's blood supply is perilously low. But this winter the shortage has been the worst and longest since World War II.
The situation was so bad, blood bank officials said, that if more people had been injured in the earthquake in Los Angeles on Jan. 17, there might not have been enough blood to treat them, increasing the death toll. 
 At that time, the supply around the country was down to less than a day from the preferred five to seven days.
"The blood supply in Los Angeles and surrounding areas was in incredibly bad shape, and there was no blood to send in from anywhere," said Marcia Lane, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Blood Banks in Bethesda, Md. The association represents 2,400 blood banks, including those in the American Red Cross, that collect and process 80 percent of the blood transfused in the United States.
 
Dangerous Levels in 40 Cities
 Officials offer a number of explanations for this year's shortage, ranging from severe weather to the flu outbreak to potential donors' irrational fear of contracting AIDS. But the severity of this year's shortage combined with the predictability of seasonal shortages in general raises an underlying question about the reliability of the blood collection system.
Transfusions of blood and blood products are crucial to the repair of many injuries and to much modern surgery as well as to the treatment of heart disease, cancer and other conditions.
Some 4 million patients in this country receive transfusions each year, using 14 million units of blood collected from 8 million volunteer donors drawn from among the 189 million Americans who are 17 and older. The blood must be used within 42 days or discarded.
In the last month, blood supplies reached dangerous levels in more than 40 cities and resulted in postponement of elective surgery in several areas. In an unusual action, the blood bank association and the Red Cross made a national emergency appeal for blood donations. Americans responded, easing the crisis. Now the supply has a two-day margin.
Nevertheless, the threat of shortages will not disappear quickly. The demand has increased in recent years, while the donor pool has been shrinking, despite attempts to increase it by, for instance, eliminating the upper age limit for donors. In recent years, doctors have been urged to transfuse blood more judiciously.
Why is such a crucial and long established component of the health system in trouble?
Blood bank officials offer several explanations. One is that too few younger Americans are replacing their elders as blood donors. Second, a series of tests introduced in recent years to screen out the viruses that cause AIDS, hepatitis and other infections have removed people from the donor pool, although the numbers are unknown.
Third, fear of contracting AIDS from needles apparently keeps many people away. Twenty-five percent of respondents to a poll said they would not give blood for fear of catching AIDS. But that fear has no basis, since blood banks use new disposable needles every time they draw blood. Many experts suspect it is an excuse to avoid getting a needle stick or to take the time to donate blood.
Several other factors affecting supply and demand led to this winter's crisis, blood bank officials say. They cite arctic temperatures, snow storms, a heavy flu season and an unusually low turnout at holiday blood drives, partly because of layoffs. And they say violent crime has increased demand for blood.
 
Critics Fault Management
 Few would dispute that running blood banks is difficult. But critics contend that blood bank officials blame the public instead of themselves for the shortages. The critics say the shortages could be eased, if not prevented, through improved management. Many of the problems cited, like bad weather and the flu, tend to recur each year.
Granted, this year's bad weather struck at a time of extraordinary vulnerability. A large scheduled blood drive in Washington two weeks ago, for example, was called off when bad weather closed the Government.
Drives were also canceled elsewhere, and officials said they were left with no quick way to make up the shortfall.
But critics note that the blood shortage in some cities began before the cold weather struck, and several of the metropolitan areas affected by the shortage are in Florida, Puerto Rico and other areas that escaped the severe weather.
As for the flu, while it did strike in many areas, over all it was not as severe as Federal health officials had predicted. Nevertheless, an outbreak of flu in an area that is usually self-sufficient and exports blood to chronically short areas can have an enormous impact on blood supplies thousands of miles away.
Blood bank officials have also blamed the economy, saying that as large companies have laid off employees, fewer donate at work, the source of much of the blood supply. Blood bank officials say some production-minded companies are reluctant to give employees time off to donate blood.
The blood bank officials also say the closing of military bases has contributed to the shortage as military personnel and their families leave. But officials say they have no national statistics measuring the effects of either of these economic changes on declining donations.
At least one city that might be expected to need extra blood for all the reasons cited, including violence, has not issued an emergency appeal for blood. New York City juggled collection schedules in the workplace before the Christmas and New Year's holidays and helped prevent a crisis, said Dr. John W. Adamson, who heads the New York Blood Center. His organization, which imports blood from Europe to supplement the local supply, did not need to increase imports this season.
In San Diego in early January, when blood collections dropped by half from the usual 400 units a day, six people were shot in drive-by shootings and in a movie theater. They needed 118 units of blood. (A unit is slightly less than a pint.) Three other accident victims needed 192 units, straining the supply.
But although blood bank officials cite such anecdotes, they do not have national statistics to back up the contention that such trauma has suddenly increased demand.
 
Using One's Own Blood
 One complicating factor is that many people have heeded advice from health officials, doctors and blood banks to donate blood in advance of undergoing elective surgery.
"We want people to give their own blood" whenever possible, "and we have worked hard to convince people that it is the safest thing to do," said Dr. Arthur J. Silvergleid, who directs the blood banks in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties in California and who is a former president of the blood bank association.
Giving, and later receiving, one's own blood is called an autologous transfusion. An estimated 8 percent of donors nationally participate in autologous transfusion programs, Dr. Silvergleid said. But some people may also end up getting blood from community sources because it is not always possible to estimate the amount of blood needed in an operation.
But, Dr. Silvergleid also said, encouraging autologous transfusions "is a double-edged sword." By emphasizing the benefits of autologous blood transfusions, Dr. Silvergleid said, "we realize we are giving out a message that the alternative of community blood is not as good; it is not a large degree worse, it is different."
Since the advent of AIDS, blood banks have asked donors more probing questions in interviews about their personal behavior, including sexual preferences and use of intravenous drugs. Those in groups at high risk for AIDS are asked not to donate blood. But most blood banks also give all those who do donate an opportunity to indicate that their blood must not be used for patient care. They do allow such blood to be used for research.
While the practice increases the safety of donated blood, it has created problems.
Blood banks code the identity of potential or actual blood donors who are found to be unsuitable on the basis of medical history or laboratory testing and enter the information into what is known as a donor deferral registry, Dr. Jeffrey McCullough wrote in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
Dr. McCullough, who is from the University of Minnesota Hospital in Minneapolis and Clinic and American Red Cross Blood Services in St. Paul, also wrote:
"The increasingly specific questioning of donors, the increasing number of laboratory tests done on donated blood, and the use of donor deferral registries have created a new type of adverse consequence of donating blood."
Dr. Silvergleid said that "what we need is a pool of regular repeat donors."
 
Problems of Credibility
 The image and credibility of blood banks was seriously damaged in the early 1980's, when it was discovered that AIDS could be transmitted through contaminated blood. Many blood banks at first denied a link between blood and AIDS, and later played down the risk of contracting AIDS from donated blood. Only after pressure from Federal health officials did the blood banks take steps to discourage donations from those at high risk of AIDS and other infections.
Federal pressures to improve the safety of the blood supply continue. Last May the American Red Cross, which collects and processes about half the blood transfused in the United States, agreed in a consent decree to demands by the Food and Drug Administration for a timetable to establish clear lines of managerial control over quality assurance in all 47 regions of its blood program.
Under the accord, the Red Cross will establish a comprehensive quality assurance program and will enhance its training program for all blood program employees, including an annual competency review. It also agreed to improve its computer systems, record management and policies for investigating and reporting errors, accidents and adverse reactions.
In imposing good management processes on blood banks, officials of the food and drug agency say they are invoking a new philosophy that views blood banks as part of the pharmaceutical industry and not simply a service. But many blood bank officials criticize the agency's position as further taxing an already burdened system.
They say the effort needed to meet F.D.A. regulations reduces the time they have to try to increase the donor pool.
"Clearly, a blood shortage can make us uncomfortable," said Dr. Silvergleid. But, he went on, a violation of the Federal regulations "or the release of a contaminated unit can put us out of work, so our energies are directed toward what we consider more pressing concerns right now."
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Dr. David A. Kessler, said there was no evidence that the consent decree had contributed to this season's blood shortage.
 
Ignorance About Donor Pool
 As blood bank officials face more lawsuits and are subjected to considerably greater scrutiny than they were accustomed to in the days before AIDS, they complain that reports by news organizations of violations of F.D.A. standards, contaminated units that have slipped through the system and crises have contributed to a falling off in blood donors. But they know far less than they would like about the potential donor pool.
For example, the percentage of Americans who are eligible to donate blood is not known, although Dr. Silvergleid said that "we do know that the eligible donor pool is a lot smaller than everybody had thought for a long time."
Blood banks also have an inadequate understanding of what motivates people to donate blood.
"We need sociologists and anthropologists to do the studies to learn why we are not replacing with younger donors the aging generations that regularly gave gallons of blood over their lives in a community spirit that grew out of World War II and the Korean War," Dr. Silvergleid said.
Donations through high school programs in his area of California have dropped by 15 percent over recent years, in part because parents have advised their children not to donate at school, Dr. Silvergleid said.
Most blood bank officials agree that advertising, particularly on television, would lead to adequate supplies, and in fact there is no shortage of donors who respond to blood drives after earthquakes and other crises. Dr. Silvergleid said the problem was how to come up with the money for advertising.
The introduction of new screening tests and Federal regulations have undoubtedly made the nation's blood supply safer than ever. But critics say that blood banks need to be more aggressive in stimulating people to donate blood. Ultimately, it seems, only development of an artificial blood would fully solve the blood shortage. But until then, anyone might need blood unexpectedly at any time, and Americans remain dependent on the good will of others to provide it.

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXVIII: NOTEBOOK;
Super Headache: Keeping the Stars

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Now that the Dallas Cowboys have won their second straight Super Bowl and the Buffalo Bills have played in (and lost) their fourth straight, they must try to keep their teams intact. Or at least they must seek to keep the players they want despite the tricky paths of unrestricted free agency compounded by the introduction next season of a salary cap.
Of the 1,680 players on team rosters at the end of 1993, the National Football League Players Association expects there will be 499 unrestricted free agents this year. All of them have played in the N.F.L. at least four years and their contracts have all expired. On Feb. 18, those players can sign with any team, no holds barred. On the same day, 155 restricted free agents -- those with three years in the league and whose contracts have expired -- can also sign, but their old teams can match those offers. 
 The unrestricted free agents include cornerback Deion Sanders of the Atlanta Falcons, wide receivers Tim Brown of the Los Angeles Raiders and Anthony Miller of the San Diego Chargers, linebackers Rickey Jackson and Renaldo Turnbull of the New Orleans Saints, tight end Eric Green of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the National Football Conference's three Pro Bowl guards -- Nate Newton of the Cowboys, Randall McDaniel of the Minnesota Vikings and Guy McIntyre of the San Francisco 49ers.
 
Kosar Expected to Go
 The Cowboys have 19 unrestricted free agents. The backup quarterback, Bernie Kosar, will probably leave, kicker Eddie Murray and fullback Daryl Johnston will probably stay and defensive tackle Tony Casillas will probably test the market. But the Cowboys' biggest worry is the offensive line, where they could lose Newton, center/guard John Gesek, tackle/guard Kevin Gogan and center Mark Stepnoski, all full-time or part-time starters. Wide receiver Alvin Harper is a restricted free agent, and the Cowboys will probably match any offer he receives.
"I'd say we're in better shape than any other team in the league in signing our free agents," Coach Jimmy Johnson said of the Cowboys.
Not really. As quarterback Troy Aikman of the Cowboys said, "I hope everyone is back, but the reality of it is probably that not everyone will be." But of the key Cowboys, only Kosar, who knows he will not start ahead of Aikman, may choose to leave.
 
Simmons and Joyner Available
 The Bills have 14 unrestricted free agents, including cornerback Nate Odomes and the offensive linemen Howard Ballard and John Davis. The Philadelphia Eagles' two best remaining defensive players are available, and their agent, Jim Solano, wants big money for each -- $3.7 million a year for end Clyde Simmons and $3.3 million for outside linebacker Seth Joyner.
The Giants have 15 unrestricted free agents, including the unhappy cornerback Mark Collins, safeties Greg Jackson and Myron Guyton and almost all of the offensive line -- William Roberts, Doug Riesenberg, Bart Oates, Bob Kratch, Eric Moore and Brian Williams. The Jets have 14, including offensive linemen Dave Cadigan, Jim Sweeney and Roger Duffy.
This is not college football, where players may do or die for dear old alma mater and never think of moving. Many pros will move anywhere for money, which is fine because this is their business. Some, like tailback Lorenzo White and linebacker Al Smith of the Houston Oilers, may move because they are getting less playing time.
 
Turner to Visit Redskins
 Norv Turner, the Cowboys' offensive coordinator, flew home to Dallas today. On Tuesday, he is expected to be in the Washington suburbs to discuss the Redskins' head-coaching vacancy, which is apparently his for the asking.
"I think the Redskins were very positive on me," Turner said after the Super Bowl, "and I'm real excited about them. And there've been rumors that Phoenix is going to contact me, so I'm just going to see what's going to happen over the next three or four days."
The Redskins said they had no announcement on a timetable for meeting with Turner, although a Redskins source said that "the wheels are in motion." A Cardinals spokesman said he had no word from Bill Bidwill, the owner, on a possible meeting with Turner. The Cowboys concede that Turner will leave.
"He's going someplace," said Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner.
Turner's players are unhappy about losing him.
"I promise you I'd give up part of my salary to keep him here," said Michael Irvin, the Cowboys' wide receiver.
 
Is There a Team in San Juan?

 
 One major coaching job was filled Monday when the Green Bay Packers named the 61-year-old Fritz Shurmur as defensive coordinator. Shurmur held that job with the Phoenix Cardinals from 1991 until last week, when Coach Joe Bugel and his staff were swept out.
Shumur replaces Ray Rhodes, who resigned Thursday after two years with the Packers, saying it was a family decision. He did not give reasons, although he conceded that cold weather (the temperature dropped to 29 degrees below zero one day this season) was a factor.
 
 
Galloping Inflation

 
 Ah, American business ingenuity.
All last week, a Super Bowl XXVIII cap was available in Atlanta for $10.99. Two hours after the game, a similar cap saying "Dallas Cowboys, Super Bowl Back-to-Back Champions," was being sold for $19.99.

HEADLINE: U.S. Incomes Outpaced Spending for December

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Americans increased their personal incomes slightly faster than their spending last month, but their spending outpaced their paychecks for the year, a Government report showed today.
For December, incomes increased six-tenths of a percent, while spending rose a more modest five-tenths of a percent, the Commerce Department said today. 
 But for all of 1993, personal income climbed 4.7 percent after rising 6.1 percent in 1992. Consumer spending, meanwhile, advanced 6.1 percent for the biggest gain in three years, the Commerce Department said.
Some economists saw the report as a sign that the economy could lose momentum this year.
"It seems difficult to envision how the consumer can keep up this pace" of spending, said Kevin Flanagan, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York.
Cary Leahey, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York, said, "If income continues to lag, then the economy slows down."
Wages and salaries increased last month along with Government subsidies to farmers. The income figures were also bolstered by retroactive Social Security payments.
December's increase in income, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.542 trillion, followed a five-tenths of a percent gain in November, initially reported as six-tenths of a percent rise.
The increase in spending, to an annual rate of $4.505 trillion, followed a two-tenths of a percent gain during November, previously reported as an increase of four-tenths of a percent.
Disposable personal income, or money left over after taxes, increased six-tenths of a percent in December after rising five-tenths of a percent in November. The savings rate edged up to 4.2 from 4.1 percent.
The implicit price deflator, a measure of inflation tied to the report, was unchanged in December after showing a one-tenth of a percent increase during November.
In a separate report, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said today that its gauge of Midwest manufacturing activity slowed in January, sliding to 59.6 from 62.2 in December.

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Tuesday with an article about the growth of Americans' total personal income in December mislabeled the most recent month. It was December 1993, not January 1994.

HEADLINE: Billions for School Are Lost In Fraud, Waste and Abuse

SERIES: Looting Student Aid: Public Money, Private Gain -- First of three articles

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
For several years, the Federal Government has been losing $3 billion to $4 billion annually to waste, fraud and loan defaults in its higher education student-aid programs. That is more than 10 percent of the Education Department's annual budget of $29 billion -- enough to finance the nation's entire Head Start project.
Education officials, both inside and outside the Government, are well aware of the problem. The Education Secretary, Richard W. Riley, recently called his department's management of its main scholarship program "worse than lax." Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, representing 1,600 colleges and universities, terms the fraud and abuse "an intolerable embarrassment."
 
Students Are Hurt
 In the most dramatic cases in recent years, directors of for-profit trade schools and colleges have looted the budgets of these loosely regulated Federal student aid programs to buy themselves Mercedes-Benzes, travel the world, subsidize a drug habit, invest in religious causes or pay themselves million-dollar salaries. 
 Instead of promoting education, some Federal student-aid programs have been used to victimize students. Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, describes the misery the Federal Government's well-intentioned student loan program has caused many of the poor in her Los Angeles district: they enroll at for-profit, fly-by-night trade schools using Federal loans, get no useful training, cannot find jobs and wind up defaulting on the loans, ruining their credit rating and their hopes of escaping poverty. And it is the taxpayer who foots the bill for those defaulted, federally guaranteed loans.
Yet even now, as the Education Department issues regulations intended to improve oversight, forces are at work in Washington that threaten the biggest effort in years to revamp its loan program and main scholarship program, the Pell grant. Last year, 4.4 million students, most with family incomes below $25,000, received Pell scholarships of up to $2,300 each.
The Clinton Administration is talking tough on enforcement, but because of budget priorities, no growth in staff is expected at the Education Department, a place with a longstanding reputation as an understaffed, bureaucratic dumping ground. Trade school lobbyists have recently won passage of an amendment that will weaken one of the department's stronger enforcement tools. And the nation's major colleges are threatening a lawsuit over a new Federal law that expands states' regulatory authority.
As the lobbyists jockey in Washington, prosecutors across the nation try to put out the fires. "In these programs there's a naive presumption of honesty on the Government's part," said Larry H. Colleton, the United States Attorney in Orlando. "When Congress opened the doors of opportunity to benefit students, it really opened the door for cons."
The Government's system for distributing $6 billion in Pell grants annually to schools or colleges is essentially a system of trust. A school tells the Education Department how many students it has qualifying for scholarships, and the department electronically wires that money straight to the school's bank accounts. The school then has nearly two years to justify its requests, and it is during that time that money is easily defrauded by school officials.
Whether it is a Pell grant or a loan, students typically don't even touch the money -- they are given a tuition credit. The Education Department's inspector general, James B. Thomas Jr., does not pursue fraud by individual students any more. "We don't have time to do that," he said. He is too busy trying to make a dent in his backlog of 300 cases involving for-profit trade schools and colleges suspected of misusing Government money.
 
Small-Scale Loss
Dollars Disappear At a Trade School
 Two Florida cases, one small and one large, illustrate the difficulty the Education Department has had trying to police these programs and how far Federal aid to higher education has strayed from its original mission.
Case No. 1. In the late 1980's, Earl Shomber, a salesman with no experience in education, decided that a for-profit trade school would be a nice investment. Mr. Shomber, whose criminal record includes convictions for auto larceny, burglary and indecent exposure, opened PRS Career Academy in a cinder-block building along Highway 434 in Longwood, Fla., offering classes in word processing, "travel agency" and other vocational trades.
It was slow going at first, but once his school was accredited, and therefore qualified for Federal loans and Pell scholarships, "business picked up," Mr. Shomber's lawyer, Steven Mason, said recently. "You need that Government money to get the students in."
Soon, that Government money began disappearing into someone's pocket at PRS. Exactly who was responsible is not clear. According to court documents, Mr. Shomber told Federal investigators he did not take it; he said his financial aid officer did. When investigators asked why he had not reported the man, Mr. Shomber explained that he was afraid to, because, he said, the financial aid officer belonged to a motorcycle gang.
Federal prosecutors concluded that the school's directors had falsified documents, including filing loan forms for former students, to obtain $107,000 unlawfully. Though the case was small, prosecutors needed two years to ready it for a grand jury.
 
Forms in Order, Yet. . .
 "It was a disaster," said Mr. Colleton, the prosecutor. "Education made so many screw-ups." The Education Department had required the school to file reams of paperwork, he said, yet no one reviewed it. "This school's 1990 recertification paperwork looked perfect on the face of it," the prosecutor said. "Yet not one student listed was eligible for aid, and Education never picked it up."
Several months ago Mr. Shomber pleaded guilty to one felony count of a 21-count indictment. The Government is unlikely to recover its money; he has filed for bankruptcy.
This is not unusual. In 1993, Federal audits of student aid programs verified $480 million in refunds that schools owed the Government; $29.8 million was recovered in 1993.
When student-aid fraud is mentioned, many people think of selfish students walking away from their financial obligations. But students are the least of the problem.
"Some of the biggest abuses within the Pell grant program are being perpetrated not so much by dishonest students, but dishonest schools," said Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat, who is chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He has led several hearings on the abuses in recent years and plans more this year.
The for-profit trade schools are the main problem, a target of three-fourths of the department's enforcement activity, said Dr. David Longanecker, an Assistant Education Secretary. In the last three years, these schools, also called proprietary schools, received 25 percent of Federal student loan revenue, but they accounted for 76 percent of defaults.
 
Large-Scale Loss
One School Sees Its Fortunes Jump
 When the Government Student Loan Program was begun in 1968, 90 percent of the money went to four-year colleges; 3 percent went to trade schools. In recent years, trade schools have collected as much as 36 percent of all loan revenue and last year received 19 percent. About 5 percent of the United States' 15 million students in higher education attend trade schools.
Which brings up Case No. 2. The centerpiece of 1990 Senate hearings on Federal student-aid abuses was American Career Training Corporation, or A.C.T., a residential and correspondence school based in Pompano Beach, Fla., for training travel agents and secretaries.
Students, employees and investigators testified at the Senate hearing that the main goal of A.C.T.'s owners was to maximize Federal student loan revenue. They said the school employed only 23 instructors but 70 loan processors and 109 commissioned salespeople, who frequented welfare and food stamp offices to recruit students.
They also testified that the year before qualifying for Federal loans, A.C.T. lost $91,000, while three years after being certified, the school was collecting $46 million in Federal loan money annually for 18,000 students. Its owners, Joseph and James Calareso, paid themselves over $1 million apiece in yearly salaries.
And, they said, only 10 percent to 20 percent of A.C.T. students actually found jobs in their fields. When Federal guaranteed loans came due, regulators could not find a large percentage of the school's students because many loan forms listed phony addresses, like "403 Cant Read, Pritchard, Ala."
At the time of the 1990 hearings, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began a criminal inquiry, renting three trucks to haul away files from A.C.T.'s Pompano Beach campus.
Four years later, the inquiry continues, with no charges yet filed. A crucial reason, law-enforcement officials agree, is that the Education Department's inspector general could not free up the staff to investigate even such a high-profile case. "They're just getting back to it now," said David Buckley, a Senate investigator. "It's pathetic. This case has floundered."
Even Rebekah Poston, a defense lawyer who until recently represented A.C.T., was surprised by how poorly the Education Department has run the investigation. "It was not the amount of manpower I would have expected," she said. The school's current lawyer, Greg Baldwin, would not comment on issues raised at the hearing, except to say that witnesses had serious credibility problems. At the hearings, Joseph Calareso cited his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.
Stephen Blair, who as president of Career College Association is the main lobbyist for trade schools, says significant efforts have been made in recent years to correct problems like those at A.C.T. and many of the worst offenders are now out of business.
 
Little Oversight
Fraud Rampant In System of Trust
 The Education Department in recent years has heavily relied on default rates as a sign of trouble, singling out these schools for more frequent reviews. But Mr. Blair says this is unfair because the higher default rates may not actually reflect corruption, but rather a school's willingness to take a chance on a poor, high-risk, inner-city population.
Government officials say there is no way to calculate what percentage of student loan defaults is due to fraud and what is a result of legitimate risk taking.
In 1993 student loan defaults cost the Government $2.5 billion, down from a high of $3.6 billion in 1991, but still alarming enough to motivate Congress and the Clinton Administration to revamp the program. Since the student loan program's inception 25 years ago, $22 billion has been lost in defaults, $14 billion of it in the last five years.
Mr. Thomas, the Education Department's inspector general, estimated that additionally "several hundred million dollars" a year is being defrauded from the $6 billion Pell grant program, and Senator Nunn said, "Based on what we've seen, if it's that amount we're fortunate."
No one knows the true figure. The taxpayers' guardians are outgunned. There are 7,400 schools certified for Federal student aid programs; the inspector general's office audited just 25 in 1993. When a case is identified as high priority, Mr. Thomas said, "it means we hope to get to it in the next year or two."
The schools presenting the biggest problems, department officials say, get almost all their revenue from these Federal aid programs and spend a fraction of that money on education, enabling their owners to walk away with large profits.
 
Opening the Coffers
 Sara Schenirer Teachers Seminary in Brooklyn is one of 21 Orthodox Jewish schools in New York State suspended from student aid programs after Senate hearings last fall. In 1991 the school collected $3.2 million in Pell grants for 1,500 students, more than doubling its enrollment in a year. It spent $21,000 on educational materials and supplies that year, according to its tax returns.
To obtain grants and loans, students send financial aid statement to a Federal processing center, which determines the students' economic need, and then notifies the school. In the case of loans, the school contacts the student's lender, which transmits the loan revenue to the school. The problem is that the lender does not have much incentive to worry about whether the student or the school is a good risk, since the Federal Government guarantees to make good on any defaulted loan.
Once a school is certified for the Pell program, it is given a "PIN" number and obtains money much the way a bank customer does from an automatic teller machine -- except in this case the bank is the Federal Government. The system has a few computer triggers to identify questionable withdrawal patterns, but it is a system based on trust; the school is wired the money up front and then has up to 21 months from semester's end to complete the paperwork justifying its withdrawals.
When auditors from the Education Department's program-review section finally arrive on the campus of a problem school, what they sometimes find is files of fictional students and fabricated biographical information, created years earlier to keep that automatic teller machine producing cash.
For some it is a way to rob a bank without a gun.
Gerardo Tirado Torres, owner of Advanced Business College in Puerto Rico, and his top officers used the school's PIN number to make at least seven improper Pell grant withdrawals totaling $3.3 million and then bought several Mercedes-Benz cars, a Volvo, a Peugeot, new businesses and real estate. Miguel Prendes, owner of Michigan Paraprofessional Training Institute, used some of the $1.1 million in Pell and loan money he stole to travel to Miami, Mexico and Europe.
An administrator in the University of Miami's athletic department, Anthony Russell, falsified Pell grant applications worth $220,000 and spent his share on a $100-to-$200-a-day crack cocaine habit. At one point, the line of swimmers, football and tennis players outside Mr. Russell's office door waiting for grant applications grew so long, extra chairs had to be placed in the hallway.
Mr. Torres, Mr. Prendes and Mr. Russell each pleaded guilty to Federal fraud charges. Mr. Torres and Mr. Prendes are serving prison sentences; Mr. Russell is to be sentenced on Feb. 18. The student athletes who lined up outside his door -- 63 of them -- were placed in a community service program and will not be charged with a crime if they complete the service.
 
Sudden Wealth at Religious Schools
 Still under investigation by Federal prosecutors are two dozen Jewish religious schools in Brooklyn and upstate New York, the newest wave of suspected abusers of Federal student aid. The schools were described in last fall's Senate hearings as "Pell mills" that siphoned off much of their student-aid revenue to pay for the Orthodox Hasidic sects' religious operations here and in Israel.
In the 1988-89 school year, Sara Schenirer seminary received 51 Pell scholarships worth $105,000. That year on its Federal income tax return, in the section that asks for names of all employees earning more than $30,000, the school listed no one. By 1991-92 Sara Schenirer had jumped to $3.2 million in Pell grants and could list four officials' salaries on the tax form, including the director, Rabbi Michael Meisels ($69,000), and his wife ($42,400). It also listed $1.3 million in mutual funds. And the school, which specializes in religious education courses, was able to pay off its $650,000 mortgage.
The school is appealing its suspension from Federal programs. Michael Goldstein, its lawyer, said that once a school is approved for Pell grants and provides the coursework, Federal law does not restrict how it invests its money or pays its staff. "As the institution grew," he said, "administrative complexity grew, and people involved were paid a wage commensurate with their responsibilities." It was not necessary to spend more than the $21,000 on school supplies in 1992 because larger investments had been made in earlier years, he said.
Bais Fruma, another Brooklyn school, offered independent study courses with no classrooms, teachers, books or supplies, Senate witnesses said. In 10 years the Brooklyn school collected $22 million in Pell grants; in 1992, 97 percent of its 2,000 students received Pells. Alan Edelman, a Senate investigator, testified that Bais Fruma's treasurer and financial aid director filed 700 currency transaction reports reflecting bank withdrawals and deposits of over $10,000 each in the last five years.
"We cannot explain these transactions at this time," Mr. Edelman said. "However, we do feel that they are very unusual transactions for employees of a nonprofit tax exempt religious organization."
Calls to the school were not returned. Bais Fruma was recently terminated from Federal aid programs.
 
Easy Target
'Invitation' to Take Federal Money
 At the hearings on the Pell program last fall, Senator Nunn commented to the inspector general, "It is a program that is almost an invitation for people who are not honest to rip it off, isn't it?"
"That is right," answered Mr. Thomas.
Once a problem school gets its privileges to withdraw money from the Government, the chances of the Government's recouping its money are slim.
In 1987, the Education Department began investigating Continental Training Service, a national trucking school chain based in Indianapolis. Virtually all the school's $64 million annual budget came from Federal scholarships and loans. In 1988, the department filed a lawsuit alleging that Continental's training programs were of poor quality, were justified with falsified documentation and should never have qualified for the $117 million in Federal aid the school received. The lawsuit sought $360 million in refunds and damages.
In December 1992 the department settled its $360 million case with Continental, by then in bankruptcy, for $50,000.
Dr. Longanecker, a Clinton appointee who last June became the assistant secretary overseeing student aid, says he believes that the worst of these problems are in the past. He points to the decrease in student loan defaults, to $2.5 billion from $3.6 billion over the last two years.
Major gains will be achieved by making better use of computer monitoring, he says, adding that the department will take advantage of new enforcement tools provided by the 1992 Education Act, like more stringent standards for new schools wanting to participate in aid programs and tougher oversight by state regulators.
Senator Nunn agrees there have been improvements but said, "The default rate is still way too high." At the hearings, Mr. Thomas, who has been inspector general since the Education Department was elevated to Cabinet level in 1980, was asked whether he was skeptical of the new Assistant Secretary's assessment. "Absolutely," he answered.
Mr. Colleton, the Orlando prosecutor in the case involving the school with the motorcycle-gang member as a financial aid officer, said: "The Government's being had. And the public doesn't understand what's going on."
The owner of that school, Mr. Shomber, told investigators that his financial aid officer suddenly disappeared on May 8, 1990. Prosecutors have not been able to locate the gentleman either, and he has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Mr. Shomber hired another financial officer, but it turned out she was wanted by the police on a charge of passing bad checks. "One day she was arrested out in the school parking lot on an outstanding warrant," said Mr. Shomber's lawyer, Mr. Mason.
The 66-year-old Mr. Shomber was sentenced to three years probation last summer and ordered to make restitution. His lawyer describes him as a decent man who got in over his head. "He's completely out of the education business now," his lawyer said. "This has been hard on him. He had to sell his home. He's in bankruptcy. I think all he has is the '76 Cadillac I see him driving around town in."

Graphs: "Breaking Down the Default Rate"
 Defaults are the largest single are of losses on the Guaranteed Student Loan program. Out of 2.4 million borrowers scheduled to begin repayment in 1991, 18 percent entered default. The graph also shows default rates at different types of institutions during the same year; "A High Cost" tracks the cost of Guaranteed Student Loans entering default each year since 1980.

HEADLINE: CLINTON REPORTED TO BE READY TO END VIETNAM EMBARGO

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton plans to lift the 19-year trade embargo on Vietnam within a few days, senior Administration officials said today.
While the President has not yet formally signified his assent, a senior Administration official said Mr. Clinton had concluded that the time had come to begin normalizing relations with Vietnam by taking the highly sensitive step of resuming trade. Mr. Clinton's avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War adds to the political peril. 
 A second senior official said: "It's a done deal. The President has made up his mind."
It could not be learned whether the United States had informed the Government of Vietnam of its decision.
 
No White House Confirmation
 The President is also expected to approve the opening of a formal liaison office in Hanoi to help American business ventures there, a senior State Department official said. The United States has only a very low-level diplomatic office in Hanoi now and a recently opened military mission to deal with the issue of service personnel missing since the Vietnam War.
White House aides refused to provide confirmation of the end of the embargo, and other Administration officials said there was a reluctance to make an announcement until veterans' groups and others opposed to the decision had been briefed.
John Sommer, executive director of the American Legion, called the impending decision a betrayal of Mr. Clinton's past promises to veterans and family groups.
 
A Betrayal, Legion Says
 "If the President decides now to lift the trade embargo on Vietnam," he said, "he will have broken the promises made to the American Legion, the family members of missing servicemen and other Vietnam veterans, and he will have betrayed those who are missing and their families.
"As a candidate for President, he told the delegates to the 1992 national convention of the American Legion, in essence, that he would not lift the embargo or move toward normalization until the fullest possible accounting of our P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s had been received."
 
Announcement Within Days
 Administration officials said tonight that Mr. Clinton hoped to make his announcement by the end of the week. But they cautioned that it could slip until early next week, depending on how long it takes to consult with opponents of the move.
"It's just a timing thing," an Administration official said.
The reported decision follows months of debate within the Administration on whether Vietnam had cooperated fully in determining the fate of more than 2,200 United States service personnel who are still officially listed as missing in the war, which ended in 1975.
At a meeting at the White House in late December, senior officials reached a broad consensus that the embargo should be lifted. But Mr. Clinton held off making a final decision until his Administration could take the political temperature of Capitol Hill and public opinion.
 
Senate Resolution Helped
 Mr. Clinton's decision was made much easier when the Senate voted Friday, at the Administration's urging, to ask that the embargo be lifted. The vote was 62 to 38.
After an emotionally charged debate about the lessons of Vietnam and the fate of the missing, a majority agreed with the bill's chief sponsor, John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and Vietnam veteran, that it was time "to put the war behind us."
Although the resolution is not binding, it enjoyed broad bipartisan support and gave the President sufficient political cover to close a chapter on the war, in which more than 58,000 Americans died.
Mr. Clinton, who has made the economic security of the United States a pillar of his foreign policy, had come under increasing pressure from business executives to end the embargo so they can compete with Europeans and Japanese who have been scrambling to secure business in Vietnam.
 
'Time to Move Forward'
 Senator John S. McCain, an Arizona Republican and a navy pilot who was shot down over Vietnam and imprisoned for almost six years, said tonight that ending the embargo would be "a natural consequence of the vote in the Senate, which gave the President sufficient political cover to move forward."
"And I think it's appropriate," Senator McCain went on. "I think it's an appropriate time to move forward and I think it's in the United States' national interest to have an economically strong Vietnam as a counterweight to the growing economic and military strength of China.
"I think it will help rather than hinder our efforts to obtain further accounting of the M.I.A.'s. And more importantly than that, perhaps, the Vietnamese are in compliance with the road map that the Bush Administration laid down for them."
 
'It's Wrong'
 But Senator Robert C. Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who has made the cause of the missing service personnel the focus of his Senate career, said it was wrong to lift the embargo.
Mr. Smith, one of the most outspoken Senators on the issue, said: "We do not have a full accounting, we have not been provided all the information that the Vietnamese can unilaterally provide us. Now it's 'lift and hope,' hope that the Vietnamese by their good graces will give us that answer. I do not agree with that.
"I just think that it's wrong to reward the Vietnamese for the 20 years of intransigence, when they have grudgingly given us 200 sets of remains, when all the intelligence we have shows that they're holding back. I just don't think that the Vietnamese should be rewarded for that.
"He wanted to do it all along," Mr. Smith said of the President. "Now he has the political cover.
"I think it's a mistake and I regret it, but I lost the fight and I know when I'm whipped. The only problem is I think the families lost as well."
 
Political To and Fro
 After the Senate vote, it became only a matter of time before the President would make the announcement.
The Administration had debated lifting the embargo since Mr. Clinton came into office. During the debate, the Administration offered Vietnam incentives to for its cooperation on the M.I.A. issue, while pressing for still more assistance in finding air crash sites, remains and documents related to the missing.
For weeks, White House officials have made no secret that Mr. Clinton was leaning toward lifting the embargo. But they had also expressed concern about opposition from veteran's groups, and acknowledged that Mr. Clinton's avoidance of military service could leave him open to particularly harsh criticism.
But the mood changed sharply after Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, returned from Vietnam in December with a favorable report on Hanoi's increased cooperation.
In a Dec. 21 briefing, a senior State Department official said Mr. Lord's trip had proved that "Clinton's policies have paid off and we have made progress."
 
A Year's Worth of Pressure
 Referring to the situation since Mr. Clinton came into office, the official added, "We have had a high degree of cooperation from Vietnam, whether it is measured in the numbers of remains returned, which is about the third-highest since the war; the documents that we have been provided, the files we haven't gotten to before."
While some officials urged that the White House take more time in sounding out likely critics, the stronger view among Mr. Clinton's advisers was that he should move quickly.
Among the gestures Mr. Clinton made toward Vietnam was ending Washington's opposition to development loans by the World Bank and modifying the embargo to allow United States companies to bid on projects.
Even after the Senate vote, in which 42 Democrats and 20 Republicans voted to end the embargo, the White House was cautious on predicting what the President would decide.
 
Always, the M.I.A. Issue
 Asked about the vote last week, Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said, "We welcome the Senate's sentiment on that," but added that the Administration was still considering whether Vietnam had made sufficient progress toward providing information about M.I.A.'s.
And Mr. Clinton put himself into a political box by telling family members of service personnel still unaccounted for that their fate was a "moral" issue.
As recently as Dec. 10, Mr. Clinton wrote to Senator Smith, the New Hampshire Republican, that he was "deeply committed to resolving the cases of all personnel missing since the Vietnam war."
"For this reason," the President wrote, "I have made achieving the fullest possible accounting for our P.O.W./M.I.A.'s the test of our relationship with Vietnam. Like you, I seek an honorable solution to this issue."
But that was before Mr. Lord made his tide-turning trip to Vietnam.
 
A Final Warning
 A senior Administration official cautioned that the lifting of the embargo did not mean that Washington would rush to restore diplomatic relations, which he said would not enjoy widespread domestic support and would not be an appropriate signal to send to the Vietnamese.
"No one is talking about normalization,"the official said.
The United States imposed the embargo against North Vietnam in 1964 and extended it to cover all of Vietnam after the fall of the South Vietnamese Government on April 30, 1975. The President of the United States has always had the authority to lift it by executive order.

HEADLINE: Clintons Campaigning to Scuttle Endorsement of Rival Health Plan

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Senior Administration officials started an intense lobbying campaign today, including a White House meeting between business leaders and Hillary Rodham Clinton, to derail a potentially damaging show of support for a health care plan competing with their own.
While President Clinton met today with hospital officials and governors to promote his plan, his top aides sought to persuade members of the influential Business Roundtable not to back a less comprehensive one sponsored by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee. The Cooper plan, unlike the President's, does not require employers to pay any of the costs of their employees' health insurance. 
 The policy committee of the Roundtable is scheduled to vote on the competing health care plans on Wednesday. The Roundtable, established in 1972, consists of chief executives from 200 companies, including A.T.& T., I.B.M. and Pepsico.
The White House charge is being led by Mrs. Clinton, who has been meeting with business leaders for weeks. She has been joined by Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff; Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary; Robert E. Rubin, the chairman of the National Economic Council, and Alexis Herman, who runs the White House Office of Public Liaison.
Executives of large corporations have objected to the breadth of the Clinton proposal, which they say could slow the economy because of its high cost and could give the Government too big a role in the private health care system. They have also been skeptical of its financing, which would rely on taxes and savings from a predicted reduction in the growth of Medicare.
"We're not asking them to endorse our plan," said a senior Administration official who took part in the White House meeting today, which was attended by about a dozen members of the Business Roundtable. "We're asking them to keep their powder dry. That's it."
White House officials are hoping to keep the business leaders neutral in the health care battle so they will not devote resources and political muscle to portraying the Clinton plan as unworkable.
"We're simply saying that it is too early to engage the dialogue of one bill over another bill," a White House official said. "We want the Congressional process, which is just getting started, to have time to lay our course."
As officials worked the phones today, several others, including Harold M. Ickes, the deputy chief of staff; George Stephanopoulos, the senior policy adviser, and Pat Griffin, the Congressional liaison, went to Capitol Hill for a dinner meeting with business leaders arranged by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee.
Among those chief executives at the afternoon meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House were Edgar S. Woolard of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, Robert L. Crandall of American Airlines and Joseph T. Gorman of TRW.
"They're all making tactical decisions," the official said of the executives. "I don't think any of them want the Cooper plan as it is. They're trying to figure out whether it's tactically intelligent to start there."
The White House offensive underscores the delicacy of the moment for President Clinton, who is trying to shore up support among his natural allies and dampen any opposition before it has a chance to solidify. Business groups have proved to be a valuable ally for the President on issues like deficit reduction but they could support an expensive campaign against him if they chose to.
A spokeswoman for the Business Roundtable would not comment on the organization's position today, but in meetings over the last several weeks, several business leaders whose companies already provide generous benefits to their own employees have told Administration officials that they are troubled by the Clinton plan's approach. They say it relies too heavily on Government regulation and bureaucracy and might prove too costly for businesses.
In a preliminary tally last month, the policy committee of the Business Roundtable, which has the final say on policy for the group, voted 45 to 14 to support the Cooper bill as "the starting point for health care reform."
 
Provisions of Cooper Plan
 Mr. Cooper's plan would establish purchasing cooperatives to reduce the cost of insurance coverage but would not require employers to pay for it. Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, introduced a companion bill in the Senate.
"They've got the big guns," Mr. Cooper said. "I don't even have a pea shooter in this debate. All I've got is a good bill."
In response to such arguments, Mr. Clinton has sought to emphasize that his plan is not a Government solution, that alternatives will cost state governments more and that those who have suggested that a health care crisis does not exist or must be solved incrementally are out of touch with reality.
"You know that the most complex system that could ever be designed is not the one in the Administration's bill," Mr. Clinton said to a meeting of the American Hospital Association. "It's the one you're living with right now."
Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, said the meeting today was part of an effort to sway business leaders on elements of the health care plan. But the Administration has stepped up its efforts to signal compromise. Governors who met with Mr. Clinton on Monday said he had suggested that he was willing to relax provisions that call for the establishment of regional purchasing alliances.
Those signals irked even some of Mr. Clinton's most loyal supporters. Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, a West Virginia Democrat who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said that Mr. Clinton's comments, as relayed by governors leaving the meeting, were "not particularly helpful."
But Mr. Clinton is playing on a bigger stage these days, engaging in an escalating war of words with members of Congress, including Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, and Mr. Cooper, over the scope of his health care plan.
"Our approach is not to tell you how to deliver health care, not to build barriers or bureaucracy," Mr. Clinton told the American Hospital Association today. "What we want to do is establish a framework in which people are covered, provide the right incentives, help to remove the barriers to access and get out of the way."
 
'Tinkering' With Reform
 In his public remarks today, Mr. Clinton dismissed many of the disputes that have sprung up around his health care plan as "linguistic battle" and an effort for less courageous politicians to "tinker at the edges" of reform.
But Mr. Clinton is reassessing some of his language as well, emphasizing the need for "guaranteed private insurance" instead of "universal coverage." Last week, Mr. Clinton vowed to veto any health care bill that did not provide universal coverage, and his opponents have suggested that the White House is promoting a complicated and bureaucratic Government remedy.
Mr. Dole, who has aimed many of the harshest broadsides at the Administration plan in recent weeks, sounded distinctly more conciliatory today. Speaking to the National Governors Association meeting before Mr. Clinton arrived, he said there was a "growing consensus" among Republicans and Democrats about the need for a restructured health care system.
On Monday, the governors endorsed a proposal that falls short of the Administration's plan. While calling for core benefits to be made available for employees who wish to buy insurance coverage, the governors could not agree on whether employers should be responsible for paying part of that cost.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. HEAD DEFENDS RUSSIA LOAN POLICY AGAINST CRITICISM

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The head of the International Monetary Fund complained today that his institution was being made a "scapegoat" by the Russians, Western governments and various experts for Russia's faltering economic reform effort. He said the responsibility lies with the Russians themselves.
In a rare public defense, the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, summoned reporters to deliver a feisty rebuttal to charges that his organization has been unrealistic or too slow in negotiating with the Russian Government the terms for more Western aid. 
 The Fund, which has provided Russia with $2.5 billion in loans since 1992, has been holding up an additional $1.5 billion loan until Russia adopts more measures to control inflation and the runaway Government budget.
 
A Lack of Basic Data
 Mr. Camdessus insisted that the I.M.F. has bent over backward to maintain a constant dialogue with Moscow. The problem, he said, is with Russia's leaders, who too often have not been willing to impose the sort of basic economic policies that would justify further I.M.F. assistance or even to show up at meetings with the most basic economic data needed to negotiate loans.
If the amounts of promised Western aid have fallen short of the amounts actually delivered, said Mr. Camdessus, "it is essentially because Russia has not been in a position to deliver the policies Russia has committed to adopt."
Critics of the I.M.F. say otherwise. After the Russian elections in December demonstrated the strength of anti-reform forces, Vice President Al Gore lambasted the fund for being too tough on the Russians and thereby helping to bring about a nationalist backlash.
 
Criticism by Sachs
 Jeffery Sachs, a Harvard economist and a former adviser to the Russian Government, published several criticisms of the I.M.F., saying that it has been far too timid, averse to risk and just plain slow in mobilizing aid for Russia to bolster the reformers. And on Monday, Administration officials said that the I.M.F. had not met regularly enough with Russian officials.
"We have not engaged enough the Russian authorities?" asked Mr. Camdessus, with more than a hint of exasperation. "This is the latest of the criticism I hear about, and I see that criticism change according to the circumstances. From time to time I ask myself: 'Which will be the next one in order to kill the scapegoat?' "
"We have been permanently in dialogue with the Russian authorities, taking every occasion to exchange information with them.
"One of our frustrations," added Mr. Camdessus, "is that in many, many occasions our invitation to the dialogue has been just turned down or the basic data which were needed to discuss seriously were just not provided" by the Russians.
"How can you discuss the balance of payments of 1994 when you don't have the balance of payments of 1993?" he asked. "I don't want to harshly criticize the Russian authorities. We are possibly more knowledgeable than many commentators of their difficulties, because they just don't have the administration, the people, the basic knowledge."
"But to tell us that we have not worked with them is to ignore the reality in Moscow," he said.
 
First Major Loan
 Much of the I.M.F.'s initial $2.5 billion in loans was delivered almost immediately after Mr. Yeltsin won a referendum on his presidency in April 1993 and started speeding up the privatization of the Russian economy.
What is now being asked of the I.M.F. is to provide Russia with another $1.5 billion promised by the Group of Seven industrial democracies to help the Government there stabilize the ruble, pay for imports and restructure some antiquated industries. The big Western democracies use the I.M.F., which they control, to provide the jumbo loans to Russia that their individual governments would not want to undertake on their own.
The I.M.F. and the World Bank have been entrusted with negotiating with Moscow the conditions for the disbursal of about half the $28.4 billion in grants and loans pledged by the Group of Seven for Russia last July.
Mr. Camdessus said that the I.M.F. would not back down on its conditions for providing latest $1.5 billion installment. Those terms include Russia getting its inflation rate down to about 10 percent a month, half the current level. The I.M.F. also insists on a reduction of government subsidies to inefficient state industries, a phase-out of price controls, privatization of state companies and a reduction of the budget deficit, now running around 8 percent of Russia's gross domestic product.
 
'Appropriate' Policies
 Mr. Camdessus said that according to its bylaws, the I.M.F. can "only extend financing conditional on appropriate economic policies." If there is a desire to "provide assistance unconditionally," he added, Governments can do that directly on their own, but "for us, the amount of assistance will depend on progress with economic reforms."
A new I.M.F. mission began work in Moscow today to hammer out with the Russian Government the economic policies that would enable the fund to grant the pending $1.5 billion. But Mr. Camdessus said he is not optimistic given Moscow's willingness to print more money to support state-owned industries and to tolerate an inflation rate of about 20 percent a month.
"What we hear from the new Government -- and every day we have new statements of one or the other -- seems somewhat new or distanced from the course of reform on which we agreed with the previous government," he said. "But we are of an open mind to address these issues."
If there is one reason for the failure of reform in Russia so far, Mr. Camdessus said, it is the absence of "that basic minimal consensus" between the Russian Parliament and Government over how to proceed.
 
Stabilizing the Ruble
 "We all know that without adequately strong monetary and budgetary policies," he said, "no efforts to reduce inflation and stabilize the ruble will be successful for long."
The Russian Government provides huge subsidies to state-owned industries, in part because they provide social services, health care and even clothing for their workers. The Government is afraid to take away the subsidies because it does not want to leave the public without a social safety net and because these state-owned industries are a powerful lobby. The I.M.F. is urging Russia to halt the subsidies, use some of the savings to close the budget deficit and use the rest to assist the jobless with unemployment insurance, pensions and job retraining funds.

HEADLINE: Economic Quarrels Retake the Spotlight in Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Japan's Government pulled itself back from the brink last week by passing landmark political reform legislation after a bitter five-year struggle, but the success only cleared the way for a battle on a potentially even more complex and divisive issue -- reviving the economy.
Some top Cabinet members have already clashed over the matter, with the Prime Minister scolding his chief Cabinet secretary in public on Monday in a dispute over tax policy. 
 Adding to the problems is the fact that the Clinton Administration has taken sides, making it clear that it favors strong action from Tokyo to pull the economy out of its worst recession in the postwar era. A recovery would be likely to reduce Japan's trade surplus, which has soared to record levels in the last two years, straining Tokyo's relations with Washington.
 
Heading for Washington
 With Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa scheduled to meet President Clinton in Washington on Feb. 11, and trade likely to dominate their talks, there is a great sense of urgency to the debate that is expected to unfold over the next 10 days.
While the list of difficulties is a long one, the stock market expressed its delight that at least the Government was finally addressing the economic slowdown after months of neglect.
In the first two days of the week, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks jumped a total of 1,658.46 points, or 8.8 percent. Monday's gain for the Nikkei was its fourth-highest on record in terms of percentage, an extraordinary rise of 1,471.24 points, or 7.84 percent, to 20,229.12. Some profit taking set in today, traders said, and the Nikkei closed down 166.31 points, or about eight tenths of 1 percent, at 20,250.03.
The Government has lost no time in setting out the battle lines. Nearly everyone agrees that a huge emergency package of tax cuts and public- works spending is required. The news media have been filled with reports that the total package could amount to as much as 16 trillion yen, the equivalent of $146 billion -- which would come on top of $260 billion of similar emergency packages enacted over the last 18 months.
But there is little agreement yet on how to finance such a package. The more conservative members of Mr. Hosokawa's coalition Government have insisted that any income tax cut must be offset by an increase in the 3 percent national sales tax, perhaps after a delay of a year or so.
 Behind this approach is a fear of running up large Government budget deficits, a concern that is prevalent at the Finance Ministry.
The Socialists, the largest party in the coalition, have insisted that a big sales tax increase would fall disproportionately on salaried workers, and that the Government should just incur a deficit to be covered by the sale of bonds.
The United States has said there should be no increase in the sales tax, or at least not an immediate increase, because that would all but negate the benefits of the income tax reduction. The Americans say that since the Japanese Government has been running budget surpluses in recent years, there is plenty of room to use deficit spending to stimulate the economy.
The Finance Ministry issued a lengthy statement to foreign reporters on Monday to counter Washington's arguments, point by point.
 
Reworking the Numbers
 It argued, for instance, that Japan only had a budget surplus if contributions to its social security fund were added in -- something the United States Government does not do in its accounting. Without those funds, Japan actually has a proportionally larger budget deficit than the United States, the ministry said.
Japan's deficit will equal 5.5 percent of the gross domestic product this year, the ministry said, compared with 3.6 percent in the United States.
"They don't appreciate the extent of the deterioration of Japan's fiscal balance," a senior ministry official said, referring to American officials.
The official, who insisted on anonymity, acknowledged that the ministry had been wrong in its forecast that the economy would begin to recover last spring or summer.
But, he said, in a sort of trial run of what the Government was likely to be explaining to President Clinton on Feb. 11, the fiscal package being discussed should be sufficient to finally get economic growth back on track.

HEADLINE: Ecuadorean Nominated as U.N.'s New Human Rights Chief

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali today nominated Ecuador's representative, Jose Ayala Lasso, to be the first United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, a post created by the General Assembly last year.
But his choice dismayed several American human rights monitoring organizations who said Mr. Lasso lacked experience and served as Foreign Minister under the repressive military Government that ruled Ecuador in the late 1970's 
 "The challenge for Ayala Lasso will be to prove he can overcome his past as an official of an abusive military government and become a forceful advocate for human rights" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of the Human Rights Watch, based in New York.
Charles Norchi, director of the International League for Human Rights, also drew attention to Mr. Lasso's service under Ecuador's military government and said he must be "a vocal champion in the cause of human dignity otherwise the office of High Commissioner will become marginalized."
 
'Denigrated Human Rights'
 Reed Brody of the International Human Rights Group in Washington who was spokesman for over 3,000 private human rights groups at the United Nations World Human Rights Conference in Vienna in 1992, which called for the post's creation, said the Secretary General has "denigrated human rights by appointing someone who will need on-the-job training" because the General Assembly resolution requires him to nominate someone with human rights "expertise."
But the United States Representative to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, supported the choice, saying that as chairman of the General Assembly's Third Committee, which deals with human rights issues, Ambassador Lasso played a key role in crafting the resolution that created "this vital position" and repeatedly demonstrated his "commitment to the protection of universal human rights."
The Clinton Administration, she said, will give him "our full cooperation and support."
As first High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Lasso faces a difficult task because the United Nations showed during last year's General Assembly debate that it is deeply divided over what the job should be.
 
Powers of Office Debated
 Many developing world governments, already angered by the West's growing insistence that they meet its standards of human rights and democracy as the price for economic assistance, sought to limit his powers to initiate independent inquiries saying he should only carry out tasks given him by United Nations organizations on which they are represented.
But human rights advocates and most Western governments want the new High Commissioner to play a more active role, investigating alleged abuses on his own initiative in between the annual sessions of the Human Rights Commission and pressing offending governments to mend their ways.
In a news conference today, the Secretary General also said he was appointing Hans Axel Valdemar Corell, a Swedish lawyer, as his legal adviser and named a French officer, Gen. Bertrand Guillaume de Sauville de Lapresle, as new commander of the peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia. But he has not yet found a successor for Jan Eliasson of Sweden, who resigned last week as the United Nations' first relief aid coordinator, or for the American official Melissa Wells, whom he fired as his director of management and budget after a year on the job.

HEADLINE: In Mexico's Poor South, Coffee Now Blights Lives

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EL NUEVO MOMON, Mexico

 BODY:
Across the remote highlands of Mexico's deep south, where pine trees seem to snag the clouds and Indian rebels maintain a stronghold, unharvested coffee berries are turning wine dark and rotting.
The coffee is a casualty of the violent uprising that began in Chiapas State on Jan. 1. Poor farmers have been too afraid to enter their fields to harvest the crop and some have even fled the wooden shacks they call home. 
 "We had to sacrifice everything -- our pigs, our chickens, our coffee," said Misael Perez de Leon, who has taken refuge in a coffee warehouse in Comitan, near the Guatemalan border, with his wife and six children.
 
An End to Controls
 But coffee growing in this region, which once offered the promise of a better life, has in recent years made life hard for the peasants. Their anger and frustration contributed to the rebellion.
As recently as five years ago, international coffee prices were rising and the Mexican Government encouraged the people of the region to move into the forests and plant thousands of coffee bushes. The future looked so assured that in 1989 the Government dismantled its huge system of controls, saying it no longer needed to be involved.
But within months prices collapsed and the people here suddenly felt abandoned.
"They have hardly helped us at all," said Humberto Velasco, a 25-year-old coffee farmer in El Nuevo Momon, 40 miles east of Comitan, asserting further that the Government was indifferent to most needs of the poor. "The schools, the medical care, everything is less than we need. And now practically the entire harvest is lost."
 
Victims of the Changes
 Many of the Indians who took up arms in January are believed to have come from the dirt-poor regions that were encouraged to plant coffee and then were left on their own. They view themselves as victims of the very economic changes that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had once pushed to help them.
Other Government policies, which were intended to make it easier for the wealthier people to accumulate land and grow coffee and other products more efficiently, also caused economic anxiety here. But the way coffee has raised expectations and dashed hopes may be the best example of why the people here have directed their anger at the Salinas administration.
The economic pressures have made life in the isolated coffee-producing communities a constant struggle. Some field-workers joined the revolt to fight for a better life. Some stayed, giving their sympathies to the rebels. Still others packed their few belongings and headed down the road, refugees from violence and deprivation.
Even the Government's top officials now concede that coffee is in crisis. Some experts estimate that 20 to 30 percent of this year's crop has been lost because of the war. If the conflict drags on, and more producers abandon their crops, it could be worse.
Corn is the staple of the Mexican diet, but in Chiapas coffee has been the crop of dreams, encouraged by land and credits made easily available by the Government.
 
Most Live in Poverty
 Chiapas is Mexico's poorest state and also its leading coffee producer. Sixty percent of the 72,000 coffee producers in Chiapas are Indians and as many still live in extreme poverty.
One of those facing difficulties is Mr. Perez de Leon, a 35-year-old coffee grower with six acres and 3,000 coffee plants, who contends that coffee is still a good crop, better than any other for making money.
But last year was a very bad year. After all costs were accounted for, he ended up making just 1,000 pesos -- about $320, or less than a dollar a day. By the time he harvested his coffee the money was already gone; he had taken out credits on his crop earlier in the year to buy food.
He lives about 60 unpaved miles from Comitan in San Jose de la Revancha, a community of field-workers called an ejido that is a legacy of the land reform goals of Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican revolutionary leader. After the revolution, the Government promised to break up large landholdings and give small parcels to poor farmers, a process that has been going on for 50 years.
But in Chiapas large landholders have managed to keep control, and this has led to endless conflicts and periodic violence, of which the uprising in January was the latest chapter. About 30 percent of the unresolved land disputes in all of Mexico are in Chiapas.
[In a communique from the delivered to reporters on Feb. 1 in San Cristobal de las Casas, rebel leaders said that peace talks were imminent but that neither a time nor a place had been set.]
 
 
Small Plots in a Harsh Land
 Despite their dreams, few if any peasants have ever made much money growing coffee. Another harsh reality of Mexican agriculture saw to that: most of the land is hilly and unproductive, and most farms are small. More than two million people in Mexico grow coffee and most barely make a living. Seventy percent of coffee producers have less than four acres of land each and produce only about 30 percent of the yearly crop of 275,000 tons. Larger, more efficient farms produce the rest.
Still, the poor somehow scraped by, encouraged by a Government that viewed coffee as an export crop that could bring in foreign exchange -- nearly $600 million in 1989. Forested land was turned into ejidos and given to poor coffee producers, and later the Government pushed organically grown coffee, for which buyers pay higher prices.
The dismantling of controls in 1989 was part of a much-applauded effort by Mr. Salinas's administration to sell off state-owned businesses and end Government intervention in the economy.
For the previous 30 years, the Mexican Institute of Coffee had warehoused, processed and merchandized the farmers' coffee, and since 1973 had also provided credits and loans. After 1989, most of those functions were ended or turned over to the private sector.
Few people mourned the institute's demise because Government agents had often cheated small farmers. But people suffered because of the loss of safeguards as the privatization took place and coffee prices tumbled.
The Government did not completely abandon the poor farmers. But the few programs that replaced the Mexican Institute of Coffee -- including part of Solidarity, Mr. Salinas's cherished antipoverty program -- provided only a small percentage of what had been available before.
 
Away From the Violence
 People are leaving because life is bleak and the violence has been uncomfortably close. Candido Santiz Lopez took his wife and family away from his communal farm at El Nuevo Momon after he heard bombs dropping and his three children crying.
Even though his wife, Zenaida, was almost ready to give birth to their fourth child, he still thought it best to go. They walked west, away from the deep forest, hoping to find help. After camping on the side of the road for three days, a truck took them to the same warehouse in Comitan where Mr. Perez de Leon and more than 100 other coffee growers and their families have sought refuge.
Last Wednesday, after 15 days at the warehouse, Mr. Santiz Lopez and his wife returned to El Nuevo Momon, carrying the 4-day-old baby girl who had been born in the coffee warehouse and still did not have a name.
Expressionless except for the deep fatigue of the dislocated, he walked down the rocky path to his mother's house. He had no money, not a centavo, and the only food he had was a few packages of pasta and a sack of animal-shaped cookies given him by a relief agency.
 
'Everything Else Is Good'
 His coffee beans were rotting in the fields -- the rains had seen to that. Someone -- rebels belonging to the Zapatista National Liberation Army? Federal soldiers? Resentful neighbors? He does not know -- had stolen a pig, a few chickens and a corn-grinding stone.
"But everything else is good," he said. "It's good. Now I want to have something to eat."
Every one of the 117 families in El Nuevo Momon lives on coffee. By this time of year, when the afternoon sun warms the air to 75 degrees or more, blankets of beans should be drying on every porch or on top of the concrete patios made for that purpose. Mr. Santiz Lopez's brother Mario has managed to pick half a small basket, but when army helicopters buzz overhead, looking for guerrillas, everyone hurries home.

HEADLINE: State Dept. Castigates China on Rights Record

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The Administration issued its long-awaited critique of China's human rights record today, painting a grim tableau of political prisoners, torture and forced confessions. The report outlined a long road that it said Beijing must travel to have its preferred trading status renewed this year.
As expected, the State Department's annual review found that China's "overall human rights record in 1993 fell far short of internationally accepted norms as it continued to repress domestic critics and failed to control abuses by its own security forces." 
 Department officials had made it clear weeks ago that the report would be highly critical. But although the report found that China had made some progress, the criticism was even tougher than many human rights experts had expected. Some said it left President Clinton little room to renew China's trade status, a step that has been advocated by some in the Administration.
 
'Much More Is Necessary'
 The 3,000-page report, which is not yet available to the public, surveys 193 countries. But State Department officials acknowledged that they had paid special attention to China because one of Mr. Clinton's most important foreign policy decisions this year -- whether to renew China's preferred trading status -- turns on whether Beijing shows significant progress on human rights.
Pointing out that Beijing has freed some political prisoners, Timothy E. Wirth, State Department Counselor, who oversees human rights policy, said: "Limited progress was made in 1993. More progress was made in early 1994." But, he added, "much more significant progress is going to be necessary."
The report and the official comments appeared to be intended in part to turn up the heat on China to improve its human rights performance before the President decides in June whether to extend its most-favored-nation trade status. Some senior officials worry that denying Beijing the trade privileges would be an economic disaster for China and the United States alike.
 
Tying Rights to Economics
 In recent weeks members of the Administration and Congress who are alarmed at the prospect of sanctions against China have suggested that the annual review of its trade status be dropped, breaking the link between human rights and economics.
But Administration officials, noting that the report looked only at last year's events, were quick to assert that the jury is still out, especially in light of some of Beijing's recent moves. China recently promised to release two Tibetan political prisoners and to let the Red Cross visit jails and labor camps.
Assuming the role of watchdog for human rights around the world, the State Department had lots of criticism for dozens of other countries, including Mexico, Israel and Saudi Arabia. The report was highly critical of Syria and especially Iraq and Iran.
"Iraq's abysmal record on human rights did not improve in 1993," the report said, in describing mass executions and the widespread use of torture. The report said Iran's Islamic Government continues to reinforce its hold on power through arrests, summary trials, executions and assassinations.
 
A Look at Bosnia
 This year's report, like last year's, condemned Serbs for pursuing their policy of "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia, and included lesser criticisms of the Croatian and Muslim factions in the Bosnian war.
Accusing the Bosnian Serbs of "acts of genocide," the report lambasted them for fire-bombing mosques, raping and threatening to rape Muslim women and killing and mutilating civilians.
But some foreign policy experts criticized the report for describing the Bosnia situation in less urgent terms than were used in last year's report.
"This is nothing short of a political dodge by the Administration," said Marshall Freeman Harris, executive director of the Action Council for Peace in the Balkans. "It hopes the genocide and horror in Bosnia will simply go away." Mr. Harris resigned from the State Department in August to protest its policy in Bosnia.
 
Other Key Areas
 Other sections of the report dealt with these countries:
MEXICO The State Department said that while human rights violations had declined, the security forces "continued to commit serious human rights violations," with numerous prisoners killed in custody. Security forces torture prisoners with beatings, asphyxiation and electric shocks, but the National Commission for Human Rights is working, with mixed results, to end these violations, the report added.
ISRAEL The State Department said there were credible reports that Israel had mistreated and in some cases tortured Palestinians during interrogation, and had used undercover units disguised as Palestinians to kill 27 Palestinians last year. Pointing to some improvement in human rights, the report noted that 49 Israeli soldiers and civilians had died in attacks in the territories.
SAUDI ARABIA Reports continue that Saudi authorities torture and abuse detainees, including some women. Defendants are tried in closed courtrooms, without lawyers. "The Government's failure to punish human rights abuses is a salient factor in the climate of impunity that prevails," the State Department said.
SYRIA The Government is holding thousands of political detainees and has engaged in arbitrary arrest and systematic torture, the report said. But it praised Syria for granting exit visas to most of the nation's Jews.

HEADLINE: No. 2 Official Is Resigning From the Fed

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The vice chairman of the Federal Reserve announced his resignation today, giving President Clinton a rare chance to fill two seats on the seven-member board within several months.
The vice chairman, David W. Mullins Jr., said in a statement that he would leave on Feb. 14 to join a new money management firm led by John Meriwether, a former vice chairman of Salomon Brothers who was forced out for his role in a Treasury bond scandal in 1991. 
 Mr. Mullins and Wayne D. Angell, another governor who will be leaving the board on Feb. 9 because his term has expired, will not take part in the Fed's review of monetary policy on Thursday and Friday.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said she did not think Mr. Mullins's departure would affect Fed policies. "I really don't anticipate much of a shift in policy," she said by telephone. "On the other hand, I think it's a wonderful opportunity for the Administration to name two members to the Federal Reserve board."
The departure will allow Mr. Mullins to sharply increase his current $123,100 salary. But Mr. Mullins said his resignation was not motivated by personal gain or policy differences.
Mr. Mullins, a 47-year-old former finance professor at Harvard Business School, said he thought that the country had emerged from a series of financial crises in the late 80's and that it was time for him to pursue an entrepreneurial career and "return to my financial economics roots."
Mr. Meriwether's firm, Long-Term Capital Management, is raising several billion dollars. It will use complicated, computer-driven trading techniques designed by Mr. Mullins and others to seek arbitrage profits from discrepancies among interest rates and currencies in financial markets.
Mr. Mullins said he did not see a conflict in joining Mr. Meriwether's firm, despite Mr. Meriwether's difficulties in the Treasury bond trading scandal. After he was forced out of Salomon, Mr. Meriwether paid a $50,000 fine to settle a civil complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he did not report to the Government his knowledge of phony bids in Government bond auctions. Mr. Mullins said he was satisfied with Mr. Meriwether's integrity.
The effect of the absence of Mr. Mullins and Mr. Angell from this week's Fed policy review is unclear.
Mr. Mullins, and particularly Mr. Angell, have developed public reputations for supporting higher interest rates to fight inflation. Indeed, Treasury bond prices fell and yields rose slightly after Mr. Mullins's resignation was announced this morning, although the link between the two events was uncertain.
But a senior Fed official said recently that both men had been less aggressive in the privacy of board meetings, neither pushing for higher short-term rates to prevent the rekindling of inflation nor resisting higher rates to protect economic expansion.
Mr. Mullins said he did not expect any changes in American monetary policy as a result of his departure. "We have a pretty broad consensus here," he said today, while declining to discuss when the Fed might make a widely expected move to nudge up short-term interest rates.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, strongly implied during Congressional testimony on Monday that the central bank would raise rates before signs of a revival in inflation became clearly visible.
 
Talks on a Successor
 Ms. Tyson said she would be meeting with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Robert E. Rubin, the head of the National Economic Council, to decide on whom to recommend the President should nominate to succeed Mr. Angell. She declined to discuss what qualities the Administration would be seeking.
Another senior official said no one should assume that the Administration would look for someone to keep inflation rates down. "We're looking for people who have outstanding reputations, believe in the independence of the Fed," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Ms. Tyson, Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Rubin have already recommended that President Clinton appoint George L. Perry, a Brookings Institution economist, to replace Mr. Angell, but Mr. Perry has not been nominated. Officials are trying to determine whether the work of his wife, Dina Perry, as a mutual stock fund manager, poses a conflict of interest.
The Administration has signaled that it may not object to an increase in short-term interest rates, the area over which the Fed has most control. Such an increase could lower investors' expectations of longer-term inflation and, same economists think, hold down long-term interest rates.
Mr. Bentsen said early in January that Administration interest-rate forecasts included a rise in short-term rates, possibly during the first quarter. Ms. Tyson summarized interest-rate comments by President Clinton on Monday as meaning that "there is room in the yield curve for an increase in short-term rates without causing a change in long-term rates." The yield curve shows the relationship of yields on debt securities to the amount of time until the securities mature.
Mr. Greenspan hinted at a similar view in his testimony Monday, saying that because of lingering expectations of inflation, long-term rates are still higher than they might be.
Wall Street experts, who have predicted that the Federal Reserve would nudge interest rates slightly higher, said today that they did not expect Mr. Mullins's departure to affect monetary policy. "I think it means very little," said Robert T. Falconer, an interest-rate analyst at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "I don't think his absence or Wayne Angell's absence is going to make any difference at the meeting this Thursday or Friday." Other Fed governors said they did not see signs of a policy split in Mr. Mullins's resignation.

HEADLINE: Forget Vietnam? No. Forgive? Perhaps.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Leo Thorsness spent six years inside a prisoner of war camp in North Vietnam. Now he is building a home on Puget Sound in a state whose leading industries are poised to make billions of dollars trading with the former enemy.
If anyone seemed likely to be angry over lifting the two-decade-old embargo on trade with Vietnam, it would be Mr. Thorsness, a former Air Force fighter pilot. But he favors dropping the economic barriers. 
 "The passion is gone," Mr. Thorsness, a conservative leader of this state's Republican Party, said earlier this week. Last year he returned to Vietnam with five other former prisoners of war. And, like many visitors, he was astonished by the rush to capitalism there.
Twenty-one years after the Paris peace accords ended the United States's involvement in Vietnam, the question of whether Americans can do business seemed ripe for resolution even before reports that President Clinton would life the trade embargo in a few days. To some, Vietnam is the century's last gold rush, a potential mother lode of American prosperity. To others, it is a storehouse of shame, duplicity and secrets that have haunted families for more than a quarter of a century.
 
Big Untapped Market
 Last week, in a surprisingly strong bipartisan vote of 62 to 38, the Senate passed a nonbinding resolution favoring an end to the embargo.
In this state -- whose economy depends on exports and which is home to a large retired military community and the national headquarters for an influential P.O.W. support group -- all the major political forces in the debate are clashing in what may be the final days of the final conflict over Vietnam.
The Boeing Company, America's leading exporter, says it could reap $3 billion to $5 billion in passenger aircraft sales to Vietnam, enough work to sustain up to 50,000 high-paying jobs here on factory lines and in support services elsewhere.
The company lost a deal to sell four 737 passenger jets to Vietnam last fall when rumors that the embargo would be lifted proved false. Now Vietnam's airline, Hang Khong Vietnam, could become one of the major carriers in Asia, said Rob Laird, a Boeing sales director.
 
Healing Effect of Time
 East of the Cascade Mountains, the farmers who grow more than 60 percent of the nation's apples look on Vietnam as one of the last big untapped markets for American fresh fruit.
But this state, which has tied its future to expanding Asian trade, is also the national headquarters for the strongest opponents of lifting the embargo, the families of P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s.
Volunteers at the headquarters of the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen, in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, were alerting veterans groups around the country this week.
The vote in the Senate last week "betrayed the wishes of all the nation's major veterans groups," said Dolores Apodaca Alfond, the group's national chairwoman. "Shame on the U.S. Senate; they put business before morality."
But business, and the softening effects of time, appear to have priority.
 
Political Cost Diminishes
 Ms. Alfond's brother, Maj. Victor Apodaca of the Air Force, was shot down in North Vietnam in 1967. His remains have never been found, and he is one of more than 2,200 American servicemen listed by the Pentagon as missing or unaccounted for.
If Ms. Alfond's efforts to influence her senior senator are any indication of the power of the P.O.W. movement here and in the other Washington, then lifting the embargo would not appear to be much of a political liability.
Senator Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican who is considered one of the nation's most vulnerable incumbents, voted to push for an end to the embargo. If the vote had happened a year ago, he would probably have gone the other way, he said.
But the issue has lost much of its political power, he said. Before the vote, Mr. Gorton was lobbied by Ms. Alfond and veterans groups. After the vote, he said, there was very little reaction, which surprised him.
 
Poll Shows Support
 A supporter of the American war in Vietnam and a proponent of veterans causes, Mr. Gorton said he believed that most Americans were ready to normalize relations.
"Having American business there now is more likely to accelerate the original reason why Americans were there to begin with," he said. "We have gotten everything we are going to get by not normalizing relations."
A New York Times/CBS New Poll conducted two weeks ago indicated that while 57 percent of those surveyed believed that some American soldiers missing in action were still alive, ending the embargo was favored by a slim margin. In the poll of 1,146 adults interviewed by telephone from Jan. 15 to 17, 46 percent favored an end to the embargo, while 40 percent wanted to keep it. The poll had a margin of sampling error of three percentage points.
Over the weekend, Mr. Gorton attended a celebration of the Vietnamese New Year in Tacoma. Washington has the largest Vietnamese population, by percentage, of any state -- with nearly 20,000 people who moved here from Vietnam since 1975. But no one at the festival voiced an objection to Mr. Gorton's vote, he said.
 
'No-Holds-Barred Campaign'
 For President Clinton, his biggest problem in relaxing the trade embargo may be with the nation's 27 million veterans, many of whom are suspicious of him for his lack of military service and his opposition to the war.
In the last month, veterans groups turned up the heat. Bruce Thiesen, national commander of the American Legion, which has more than three million members, called on veterans to wage "a no-holds-barred, call-in-every-chip, twist-every-arm campaign" to prevent lifting the embargo.
"American veterans aren't going to forgive or forget about the businesses that put their profit margins ahead of the interests of our P.O.W.'s and their families," he said in a statement.
But random interviews with other veterans here before the reports of Clinton's decision reveal more diverse feelings. In part, that may explain why senators like Mr. Gorton have not felt a strong backlash from their vote.
"We should learn to forgive and forget," said Wayne Collie, a retired Army sergeant who lives among thousands of retired military officers south of Tacoma. "I don't see anything wrong with starting new."
 
Making It an Issue
 No matter how many Senate investigations or official inquiries of the M.I.A.'s are conducted, a small percentage of veterans will not be satisfied, said Sherwood Dickie, leader of a Seattle charity group for Vietnam veterans. Mr. Dickie served in Vietnam and now works as a police officer.
"I think the majority of veterans groups that are not active in P.O.W.-M.I.A. campaigns will be supportive" of lifting the embargo, said Mr. Dickie.
But Ms. Alfond, with her photographs of the men who never came back, has vowed that she will make it an issue in the fall, for Mr. Gorton and anyone else who voted to normalize relations.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Baybanks Is Bouncing Back, And Takeover Talk Can Only Help.

BYLINE: By Saul Hansell

 BODY:
IF you've never been to Boston, it is easy to overlook Baybanks. With less than $10 billion in assets, Baybanks is only the country's 56th-largest bank. In New England, it is fourth after Fleet Financial, the Bank of Boston and Shawmut National.
And Baybanks' stock certainly would not have attracted any attention. The stock collapsed in 1989 and 1990, along with the New England economy. It rebounded in 1991 and 1992, moving from about $10 a share in January 1991 to more than $40 two years later. But for the rest of 1993 it reached a plateau, trading between $42 and $50. 
 Yet to anyone who has ventured within the confines of Route 128, Baybanks' cash machines are nearly as ubiquitous as the Celtics' leprechaun-and-clover logo (and both, not so coincidentally, the same shade of green). For 15 years, Baybanks has pursued the area's affluent and educated consumers with aggressive marketing and extensive deployment of 1,000 automated teller machines.
In Boston and its suburbs, 25 percent of families say Baybanks is their primary bank, more than Fleet, Bank of Boston and Shawmut combined.
"Baybanks ranks with Wells Fargo, Bank One and Barnett Banks as one of the top retail banks in the country," Thomas McCandless, an analyst with Paine Webber, said.
So, finally, a growing number of analysts are paying attention. And they say the company is poised to complete its recovery, paving the way to its eventual acquisition at a premium that reflects its dominant retail franchise.
The company earned $67.7 million, about $3.57 a share, in 1993, up 14 percent from 1992. But three-quarters of the 1992 earnings were one-time securities gains, so the actual operating earnings more than tripled last year. The stock closed unchanged yesterday in Nasdaq trading at $53.75 a share.
Dennis F. Shea, the regional bank analyst for Morgan Stanley, has made Baybanks his top recommendation and estimates that earnings will rise to more than $6 a share by 1996.
That increase is largely predicated on the continued improvement in the bank's loan portfolio. Not only is the New England economy rebounding, but Baybanks has also moved to avoid future problems by centralizing its credit approval function.
The bank has also continued to increase its market share. It has very successfully offered 24-hour customer service with sales spurred by an L. L. Bean-style catalogue of financial services.
Moving beyond traditional banking, Baybanks has used its marketing muscle to gather more than $1 billion in a family of no-load mutual funds. And unlike its hometown rival Fidelity Investments, Baybanks will let customers buy mutual funds at 1,000 automated teller machines.
For now, Baybanks stock represents a good way to bet on the recovery of the Boston area. "Economic activity is showing signs of springing to life in Boston, and Baybanks is a pure play on the region," Mr. McCandless of Paine Webber said.
The bigger opportunity for investors, however, would come if and when Baybanks is acquired by another bank. Until now, the bank has stood curiously apart from the industry's merger mania. Its last merger was in the 1960's.
As with most banks, the fate of the company rests as much with the personal preference of the chief executive as with its financial condition.
The bank's crusty and driven 60-year-old chairman, William M. Crozier Jr., who has served in that position for 20 years, has consistently rejected acquisition proposals. In particular, he has spurned overtures from Shawmut and the Bank of Boston because such a combination would put many Baybanks employees out of work.
Analysts said Mr. Crozier had recently expressed interest in being acquired by an out-of-state institution once the bank fully recovered from its loan problems. This could make Baybanks an attractive outpost for expanding regional banks like PNC Financial, Banc One, Norwest or Nationsbank, analysts said.
If Baybanks was acquired by such a bank, which could cut its expenses by 15 percent, it could pay $75 to $85 a share, Thomas F. Theurkauf Jr. of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods estimated.
"I don't think that a takeover of Baybanks is imminent," he said, "but over the next three years, any bank that has national aspirations will have to look at it."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Plan Seeks to Raise Productivity

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is to unveil a fiscal plan today that calls for substantial increases in worker productivity and government efficiency, with a large portion of the money saved to come from the Sanitation Department.
Administration officials said the Sanitation Department would be called on to achieve about $45 million of the expected $300 million in productivity savings, which would probably require sanitation employees to cover longer routes and to work full eight-hour days. Now, sanitation workers are often able to finish their routes in as little as six hours. 
 The productivity measures are the third leg of a strategy of pressure on the municipal work force, which has emerged over the last few days, with the Giuliani administration also planning to eliminate up to 18,000 jobs over 18 months. The administration is calling as well for $200 million in benefits concessions, intended to make the benefit packages of city workers commensurate with those of state employees.
 
'Test' for Union Members
 Aides to Mr. Giuliani said the four-year fiscal plan would be filled with hard choices for the municipal unions, in which they can work more and make concessions to protect jobs or else face even greater job reductions and possibly outright layoffs.
"The test for union membership is, 'Do you want to have more people working or have fewer people better paid?' " said John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development.
Mr. Giuliani, the first Republican Mayor of New York in a generation pledged repeatedly during the mayoral campaign to reduce the scope of the city's vast municipal government and to cut certain taxes in an effort to stimulate the private sector of the economy. Despite a $2.3 billion budget gap projected for the fiscal year that begins in July, his proposal would make good on those pledges, aides said.
 
To Dismantle a Department
 The plan will outline the consolidation or elimination of numerous small offices and agencies that have sprung up over the years, including moving the school safety force of the Board of Education under the jurisdiction of the Police Department, administration officials said. The Taxi and Limousine Commission would also be merged into the Police Department, officials said.
The Consumer Affairs Department would be dismantled, with its functions distributed to other departments. The Department of Records and Information Services is to be rolled into the Department of General Services.
In other areas of city government, the Mayor's plan will call for initiatives to contract out more government work and to increase competition among agencies and the private sector, yielding $65 million in savings in the next fiscal year.
Mr. Giuliani will also call for $35 million in cuts in the city's hotel occupancy tax and the commercial rent tax in the coming fiscal year. And officials said the four-year plan anticipates reductions in tax revenues to reach nearly $800 million by the end of his term, when he will be up for re-election.
The most significant cut envisioned would come in the 1997 fiscal year, when the city would allow the expiration of a personal income tax surcharge that amounts to about a 12.5 percent tax increase for most residents except those in the lowest income categories. The expiration of the tax would ultimately amount to $400 million in annual tax reductions. The fiscal plan also will offer a proposal to end the city's 4 percent sales tax on clothing purchases of under $100 in October 1995, just as the Christmas shopping season begins.
 
Reaction From Green
 Although the full fiscal plan will be disclosed today, the lobbying against it has already begun. Mark Green, the Public Advocate, who had formerly been the Consumer Affairs Commissioner, held a news conference in the rotunda of City Hall yesterday along with members of the City Council to denounce the plans to dismantle the Consumer Affairs Department, arguing that it actually makes money for the city by collecting fines and licensing fees. "Don't mess with success," Mr. Green said.
The Institute for Puerto Rican Politics released an analysis arguing that the elimination of up to 18,000 jobs would "disproportionately impact" Hispanic residents, an important constituency for Mr. Giuliani.
Quick confrontations were also expected with the municipal unions, with a big test looming with the sanitation workers, whose contract has already expired and who are being asked to make productivity changes. During the campaign Mr. Giuliani often said the city might turn to private companies to handle some of the sanitation routes if the union does not agree to eight-hour days.
 
'Just Small Talk'
 The president of the sanitation workers union, Peter Scarlatos, said yesterday that he had already had a one-hour meeting with the new Labor Commissioner, Randy L. Levine, but described it as "just small talk" and would not elaborate. He said he had not been told of the fiscal plan's call for productivity savings.
"I haven't the slightest idea until I hear of it from the Mayor," he said. City officials said that if the union would not meet the productivity goals, the savings would have to be found another way, and they pointed out that more than 1,000 jobs could be at stake.
Other union leaders were also waiting to see the full budget plan. But Stanley Hill, executive director of the city's largest municipal union, District Council 37 of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, has already warned that "we're not going to take the whole brunt here of balancing the budget."

HEADLINE: New York City Women Edge Closer to Men in Pay

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
Women in New York City came a lot closer to matching the earnings of men during the 1980's than elsewhere in the nation, according to a new study released yesterday.
The study, which covered New Yorkers over 25 years old, found that except for women who lacked a high school diploma, working women gained on men of comparable education during that decade. And those income gains are likely to continue in the 1990's, experts said, although probably at a slower pace. 
 In New York, women who worked full time in 1989 earned 77.5 cents for each dollar earned by men -- up from 71 cents on the dollar in 1979. Comparison with men's earnings is considered the most basic measure of women's status in the work force.
What's more, at the end of the 1980's women had become a majority in the city's labor force for the first time. Many more women went to work full time rather than part time than did so a decade earlier.
"I think that New York is an easy place for a woman to get a job," said Christina Lind, who assists a research analyst at C. J. Lawrence, a Wall Street investment firm. "But it is still difficult to get the job you want."
Ms. Lind, who is 27, wants to become an analyst herself. "Women have gone a long way on the upper levels," she said, "and once a woman reaches the middle, her talent can bring her to the highest levels. But it is very difficult to get to that middle."
 
Among the Economic Winners
 In 1989, American women in general were paid only 66 percent of their male counterpart's earnings, according to Census data. For the previous three decades that level had hovered around 60 percent.
Indeed, despite a common contention that the 1980's represented a backlash against women in society and in the workplace, the evidence is strong that women, particularly those who are well educated, were among the major economic winners of the 1980's expansion.
The research, conducted at Teachers College of Columbia University, was based on United States Census data gathered in 1980 and 1990. Other experts on labor markets said the Columbia findings were consistent with recent studies showing strong economic gains for women in the 1980's. But they cautioned that some conclusions about New York City may be less reliable because of the difficulty of gathering hard data about incomes, particularly among poorer people.
"The gender gap in New York narrowed considerably in the 1980's," said Dr. Francisco L. Rivera-Batiz, author of the new study. Dr. Rivera-Batiz is director of the Institute for Urban and Minority Education at Teachers College. And more recent evidence, while not as detailed, indicates "that these changes that occurred during the 1980's have not been reversed by the impact of the recession."
Women who work in New York City fared better than most women elsewhere largely because the jobs so numerous here -- white-collar, professional and managerial service-sector employment -- tend to be much more open to women. At the same time, the sharp decline in manufacturing jobs in the city, much greater than in the nation generally, tended to hit men harder than women.
Beth Gordon, executive vice president and director of media services at N. W. Ayer, a New York advertising firm, typifies the women whose careers leaped ahead in recent years.
"Advertising has been a field more open to women in New York than many others," she said. "I would say that in the publishing world, you are dealing with more and more women. In our industry, women have learned to work well as equals. In New York and in advertising, I think we've come a long way."
Nevertheless, researchers say women still face substantial obstacles to achieving full equality with men.
"The world of work in the 1990's is geared to the world of the home of the 1950's and the 1960's," said Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist and author of a leading work, "Understanding the Gender Gap: An Economic History of American Women." "If you want to make partner in the law firm, for instance, you are supposed to work 70 hours a week or more in your 20's and early 30's. If you have a wife, you can have both a career and a family, but not many women do."
Younger women and well-educated women fared exceptionally well. In New York, those aged 25 to 34 in 1989 earned 88.3 percent of what men of the same age were paid. And women between the ages of 35 and 44 made the greatest strides, raising their earnings from 69.5 percent of the men's wage to 79.3 percent, according to the Teachers College report.
Women who graduated from college earned 25.4 percent more, adjusted for inflation, at the end of the 1980's than they did at the beginning of the decade. Their average earnings in 1989 amounted to $35,677, up from $28,451 in 1979. Similarly educated men saw their average earnings rise by 21.9 percent to $42,057.
Poorly educated women and immigrants, however, did not share so much in the progress of other women.
Women in New York who never graduated from high school actually lost ground, according to the report, with their incomes slipping 4 percent. By contrast, similarly under educated men saw no gain or loss. High school graduates achieved marginal gains, with women reporting a 4.8 percent gain in real income while men showed a 2.1 percent increase. All these changes lagged well behind those enjoyed by their better educated counterparts.
Women from minority groups, who often find it easier to get jobs than their male counterparts, fared much better than the men did. Real incomes of black women rose 20.8 percent compared with a 9.8 percent rise for black men's pay. Hispanic women gained 24.7 percent; Hispanic men, only 13.7 percent.
And neither did as well as non-Hispanic whites. Among that group, women reported income gains of 37.7 percent over the 1980's while men's incomes rose 28.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Asbury Park Mayor Held On a Drug-Buying Charge

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK, N.J., Feb. 1

 BODY:
In recent months, Mayor Dennis Buckley has been a regular at the Tap Room. And for nearly that long he has been watched. On Monday, in the early afternoon, Mr. Buckley's regular visit took a decidedly irregular turn when he was arrested and charged with buying cocaine at the bar across the street from his office at City Hall.
The Mayor's arrest, a blow for any city, was particularly bad news for this one. Once a jewel of the Jersey Shore, it has struggled for decades to rejuvenate its beachfront, now filled with rundown rooming houses and few tourist attractions. 
 Mr. Buckley, 42 years old, took office July 1 after winning a Council seat with a reform platform in a nonpartisan election, and being named Mayor. His arrest resulted from a joint effort of the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Tactical Narcotics Team, the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration as part of an continuing narcotics investigation, the Prosecutor said.
"Our information tells us he has been a cocaine user for five years and has been buying it at this location since taking office," said the Prosecutor, John Kaye. Mr. Buckley was questioned by investigators for two hours after his arrest, Mr. Kaye said.
 
Both Sad and Shocking
 For Asbury Park, which has been in decline since racial disturbances tore the city in the 1960's, and which later was associated with Bruce Springsteen, the rock star, the word of Mr. Buckley's arrest was as sad as it was shocking.
City Manager Alan Feit, released a statement saying the city was "saddened by what has happened and knows how badly the Mayor feels."
Mr. Buckley is a former president of the local Chamber of Commerce. His family owns a local funeral home.
Like his predecessors, Mr. Buckley was confronted with the nagging problems of moving this city of 17,000 out of a three-decade rut of unemployment and decay, crime and the loss of white, middle-class residents as well as businesses. He succeeded Tom Smith, a Republican Assemblyman, who gave up his city job to concentrate on state issues.
 
'Great Guy, a Proud Guy'
 "The man is a great guy, a proud guy," said Henry V. Vaccaro, who was a partner in an attempted $500 million-plus project to redevelop the city's 1.2-mile oceanfront in the 1980's. That project, like many other plans to reclaim the old resort's "Gem of the Jersey Shore" reputation from its glory days of a half-century ago, sank in a whirlpool of bankruptcies and litigation.
"I think he took the job of redevelopment so seriously it started to destroy him," said Mr. Vaccaro, who described himself as a friend and political supporter.
Mr. Buckley had also been outspoken as Mayor against drugs, Prosecutor Kaye recalled. "He was elected on a strong law-enforcement platform and he cooperated with us to get our tactical narcotics squad into Asbury Park," he said.
That same squad, the Prosecutor continued, was tipped by the F.B.I. and Federal Drug Enforcement agents involved in continuing narcotics investigations: word on the streets of Asbury Park was that Mr. Buckley had a personal cocaine habit.
 
'Make His Weekly Buy'
 Agents had sat with a cocaine dealer in the Tap Room for the better part of four days waiting for the Mayor "to come in and make his weekly buy," the Prosecutor said. In exchange for $50, Mr. Buckley was given two packets of a substance that resembled cocaine, Mr. Kaye added.
Mr. Buckley's wife, Catherine, 38, who had accompanied him into the bar, was also arrested when agents found about 2 grams of cocaine in her purse, the Prosecutor said at a news conference today in Freehold, the Monmouth County seat.
The Mayor was formally charged with possession of cocaine and conspiracy to possess cocaine. Mrs. Buckley was charged with possession. Although the charges each carry a possible penalty of three to five years in prison and a $7,500 fine, the Prosecutor said it was highly unlikely that first offenders, like the Buckleys, would be jailed if convicted.
 
Office Lost on ConvictionXxx
 Conviction, however, would automatically cost the Mayor his office under state law, Mr. Kaye said.
After being questioned in Freehold on Monday, the Buckleys were released on their own recogizance, the Prosecutor said. The Buckleys could not be reached for comment today.
"This man has a serious addiction problem and needs treatment," Mr. Kaye said. A hearing is likely later this month, he said, and the matter will be presented to a grand jury.
But at least one town resident today was questioning the motives of conducting such a long investigation to catch one alleged drug user -- even if it was the Mayor.
"It stinks," said William T. Murray, a private land surveyor. "The Mayor was elected to try to keep this town from going down the tubes. He may have been a party-going kind of guy, but if he ran for office tomorrow, I'd vote for the guy."

HEADLINE: Stocks Retreat on Interest Rate Concerns

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
After four days of record-setting highs, stock prices turned down yesterday as weakness in the bond market raised investors' concerns about interest rates and their effect on corporate profits.
Hugh A. Johnson, the chief investment strategist for First Albany, said it was normal to expect some profit taking after a big move in the market. But clearly, he added, "the big reason was the decline in bonds prices and the rise in interest rates." 
 The price of the 30-year bond was down a full point, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 6.31 percent, from 6.23 percent on Monday.
Higher interest rates on fixed-income securities can draw investor cash away from the stock market, traders said. In addition, higher interest rates can cut profits by raising a company's debt-service payments.
Most of the selling pressures were reflected on the broader market indexes like the Nasdaq composite, which was down 3.23 points, to 797.24. Traders said the decline in the Dow Jones industrial average was not steeper because the main market index included several cyclical stocks that resisted yesterday's selling downdraft. The index closed down 14.35 points at 3,964.01.
Volume on the New York Exchange was heavy at 322.5 million shares, and off only slightly from the strong 322.9 million pace set on Monday, when the markets hit new highs all across the board.
Losing issues outnumbered stocks showing gains in trading by 1,148 to 961. The only index to cross into positive territory was the American Stock Exchange composite, which was up 0.31 point, to a new record close of 485.99.
Analysts at MMS International said the flow of bullish economic data had been well received by the market to date. But the outlook could change in the near future if traders and investors begin to worry about the warning on interest rates given by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, on Monday. Mr. Greenspan said the central bank would probably raise short-term interest rates even before it was readily apparent that inflation was on the rise again.
Mr. Johnson of First Albany said the decline in bond prices was fueled by a report from the National Association of Purchasing Management for the month of January. The report, which is a measure of manufacturing activity, said that activity rose to 57.7 in January, from 57.1 in December, when most economists had expected it to register a decline, to 56.6.
In addition to the rise in the overall index, Mr. Johnson said the report showed other signs of strength, including the change in vendor performance, which measures the percentage of purchasing managers who are experiencing slow deliveries. This measure rose to 55 percent from 51.7 percent.
Mr. Johnson said some bottlenecks in distribution might develop, which would create shortages and exert upward pressure on prices.
Another disturbing part of the report, Mr. Johnson said, was the increase in the percentage of managers who have seen higher prices. That index jumped to 59.8 percent from 51.3 percent, the largest monthly increase since January 1990.

HEADLINE: Donors Respond to Reports of Lag in Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
With less than four weeks remaining in The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund's 82d annual appeal for donations, hundreds of donors have responded to reports that the campaign is lagging dangerously behind last year's.
But despite the additional giving -- which has come from the corporate world, from repeat donors, from first-time donors and even from the unemployed -- the fund still needs more than $130,000 just to maintain the assistance it provided last year for services such as medical examinations for children and emergency rent help for immigrants and single mothers. 
 While the average individual donation has been higher than ever before, the campaign is still suffering because fewer people have contributed this year -- 10,478 compared with 11,705 last year. Additionally, gifts from 205 estates and trusts, the same number that gave last year, have declined by about $90,000. The appeal ends Feb. 28.
 
Moved by Disasters
 Those who have given in the last two weeks to help reduce the shortfall are a testament to the compassion and responsiveness that New Yorkers often show in a crisis. One, Senior Judge Bernard Newman of the United States Court of International Trade, wrote to apologize that he had forgotten to give in a flurry of contributions to other charities.
"As I look back, I recall having contributed to your splendid fund but once or twice in the past," Judge Newman wrote. "However, I solemnly promise to contribute to The Times Neediest Cases Fund annually and without deviation." He sent a check for $100 and promised to send another before this year's campaign is over.
His check and all other donations go directly to support seven social-service agencies in the city because The Times pays the administrative costs of the campaign.
Another donor, Lynn Oberlander, an attorney in Manhattan, decided to give for the first time to help out. "I've been thinking about giving for so long," Ms. Oberlander said yesterday. "And when I read that the fund was behind, I decided that this was definitely the year to sit down and write a check."
She said she was also moved by stories of suffering after the earthquake in Los Angeles and, along with her $100 check to the Neediest Cases Fund, gave a donation to the Red Cross. "I guess you'd say I was feeling lucky on that particular day."
Other people, like Carol Karasick of Manhattan, have continued to pitch in even as they find themselves decidedly down on their luck. "As one who joined the ranks of the unemployed this year, I give this 1993 donation with a new sense of empathy for the needy," Ms. Karasick wrote, sending a check for $250. "Though my employment prospects may be bleak, I do not have to worry about housing or other necessities."
Donna L. Lavins of Manhattan also found herself out of work but believed her situation made it more imperative that she continue her tradition of giving to help others. "As I am temporarily not working, I cannot match my former years' contributions," she wrote. "Nonetheless, I welcome the opportunity to share the good fortune I continue to have."
Even contributors who are generally thought too young to read the newspaper every day, such as 9-year-old Nicholas Lawrence of Manhattan, are aware that additional help is needed to fill the gap.
"I read the article on the Neediest Cases Fund and how this year people didn't donate a lot of money," Nicholas wrote. "So I want to donate some of my savings account." He sent $75 along with his letter.
"These people need this money more than I do," he added. "I want to see these people living in houses, have new clothes and also these children going to school. So please help these people."

Treasury Bonds Take Sharp Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday on evidence that the robust economic expansion of late 1993 continued into 1994.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond dropped 13/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, jumped to 6.31 percent, from 6.23 percent on Monday. Short-term maturities fell 1/8, and intermediate maturities fell 13/32 , the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported yesterday that its monthly index of manufacturing activity surged to 57.7 percent in January from 57.1 percent in December. It was the highest level since a 58.2 percent reading in July 1988. An index reading of more than 50 shows that manufacturing is expanding.
 
Strong Survey Results
 William Dudley, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he was surprised by the strong survey results considering January's harsh weather, which was expected to hamper manufacturing activity.
Particularly worrisome to fixed-income investors was the potential for higher inflation in the survey, which found that the rate of manufacturers' price increases rose in January for the second consecutive month to the highest level since November 1990.
That hinted of higher prices trickling down to consumers in coming months.
Bond investors worry about inflationary conditions because higher prices in the economy diminish the value of long-term bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return.
The market's skittishness was particularly evident after Monday's Congressional testimony by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Mr. Greenspan reiterated the Fed's willingness to raise short-term interest rates to keep inflation pressures from worsening. Higher rates on new securities would hurt the value of short-term government securities that are already sold.
The fall in bond prices also came after the news of the unexpected resignation of David W. Mullins Jr., the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Mullins was viewed as an anti-inflation hawk, meaning he championed reduction of inflation as a primary goal. Another hawk, Wayne D. Angell, a Fed governor, had previously announced plans to leave shortly after the end of his term, which expired Monday.
Both moves could have indirect implications for Treasury market prices, possibly as early as tomorrow and Friday, when the Federal Open Market Committee meets to set monetary policy.
If the the committee decides against favoring higher short-term interest rates as a way to curb inflation, that could help the value of shorter-term maturities.
But a less aggressive inflation-fighting posture by the Fed could also hurt the value of long-term bonds.
 
3-Month Bill Yields Up
 Yields on three-month Treasury bills issued at Monday's auction rose to 3.08 1/2 percent as the discount gained 0.04 percentage point, to 3.03 percent. Six-month yields issued at Monday's auction rose to 3.29 percent as the discount gained 0.04 point, to 3.20 percent. One-year yields rose to 3.55 1/2 percent as the discount rose 0.05 point, to 3.43 percent.
The rise in Treasury bill yields can reflect market expectations about the near-term prospects of rising short- term interest rates. Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the interest at which they are sold.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10414/32 , down 9/32 from late Monday. The average yield to maturity was 5.43 percent, down from 5.45 percent.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Activity Reported Up in January

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The National Association of Purchasing Management, whose monthly surveys reflect trends among the nation's manufacturers, reported yesterday that manufacturing activity continued to expand in January, for the fifth consecutive month, but not as rapidly as in the fall.
A separate index measuring the prices that purchasing managers pay for materials and supplies used in manufacturing jumped to 59.8, from 51.3, the highest level since November 1990. The jump, mainly a result of rising steel prices, prompted Wall Street traders to drive up interest rates. That is the usual Wall Street response when traders interpret a new piece of data as signaling inflation. 
 In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose in December for the eighth consecutive monthly gain.
The American economy's surprisingly strong fourth-quarter growth has been largely a manufacturing phenomenon and the association's overall index has reflected this. It has risen by roughly two points each month since September, reaching 57.1 in December, and then 57.7 in January.
The January rise, small as it was, still came as a surprise to many economists, who had predicted that the index would fall, not rise, because of the subfreezing January weather that slowed auto production, among other problems.
 
Upswing in G.D.P.
 "It is a better number than we had expected, suggesting that the economy won't slow down as much in the first quarter as we had thought," said David Wyss, director of research at Data Resources Inc., an economic consulting firm.
The gross domestic product, representing the dollar value of all the goods and services the nation produces in a given year, rose at an annual rate of 5.9 percent in the fourth quarter, a huge upswing from last year's first three quarters. Mr. Wyss said he had expected economic growth to slow to an annual rate of less than 3 percent in the first quarter, but now he and others are raising their forecasts to 3.5 percent. They noted the rise in the association's index as a reason for their optimism.
"What we are seeing in the index is a surge of orders to replace merchandise and supplies that were depleted as a result of the heavy consumer buying in November and December," said Robert J. Bretz, the purchasing manager for Pitney Bowes and the chairman of the association's business survey committee. "The question is, will this buying be sustained in March and April? I will be very surprised if it is."
 
A Key Measure
 The association's monthly survey, covering 300 purchasing managers in 20 industries, is the first big statistical measure of economic activity in a given month. Any index reading of more than 50 denotes an expanding manufacturing sector, and the readings have been higher than 50 since August, with the January reading of 57.1 being the highest level since July 1988.
According to the survey, the big January jump came mainly from substantial rises in new orders placed with manufacturers, in backlogs of unfilled orders and in longer periods needed for deliveries -- all signs of strong factory activity.
Inventories declined, which means new orders are likely to be filled from new production rather than from supplies on the shelves. Employment at manufacturing companies continued to decline in January, reflecting layoffs. But the decline in employment was at a slower rate than in the fourth quarter.
The Commerce Department's construction report said spending in December rose 2.6 percent, to an annual rate of $513.1 billion. Big spending on housing, evident since last summer, has spread to public buildings, schools, factories, highways and sewers.
 
A Different Conclusion
 Many economists and forecasters say the nation's strong economic growth in the fourth quarter cannot be maintained in the first quarter, although the slowdown probably will not be as great as it was a year ago, when strong fourth-quarter growth in 1992 -- reaching nearly 6 percent -- turned into economic growth of less than 2 percent in the first half of 1993.
But the Purchasing Managers' report for January does not support this conclusion. While stronger than expected, the January jump in the index was not nearly as big as the one in January 1992, when the index reached 57.3, from 55.1 in December 1992 -- only to lose nearly seven points by April.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Retrofitting Old Cars With Driver's-Side Air Bags

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Auto manufacturers are luring buyers into showrooms by offering air bags. But what about people who would like air bags but are not ready to replace their cars?
A large maker of air bag components has begun offering an "after market" driver's-side air bag -- actually, a replacement steering wheel that contains an air bag. The company, Breed Technologies Inc. of Lakeland, Fla., says that the technology it is using in its used-car version represents an advance that may eventually be adopted for new-car air bags. 
 In new cars, the crash sensors -- of which Breed is already a leading supplier to Detroit -- are in several places under the hood. This forward placement of the sensors gives the air bag as much warning as possible that a crash is occurring, but the complex wiring needed to link the sensors to the air bag makes it difficult to install after-market air bags.
 
Available for 26 Models
 That's why the Breed air bag, which is available for 26 car models produced in 1987 or later, is self-contained, with the sensor housed in the same steering-wheel compartment as the bag itself.
Richard M. Stolbach, executive vice president of the company, conceded that the bag was not quite so good as the factory-installed bag that comes in a new American car. Because the sensing equipment must be crammed into the steering wheel, too, the bag itself is only a little more than half the size of a factory-installed bag. As a result, the use of a combination lap and seat belt is even more crucial with the after-market bag than with the factory-installed versions, Mr. Stolbach said.
 
To Reduce Facial Injuries
 But even the smaller bag, when used with a seat belt, would help reduce facial injuries, Mr. Stolbach said. He expects anyone safety-conscious enough to install such a bag -- at a cost of $700 to $900 -- would also wear seat belts.
The company says it has had "several thousand" orders so far through its two main distributors: Applied Safety Inc. of Ventnor, N.J., and Wynn's Climate Systems Inc., an air- conditioner maker, of Fort Worth. Installation of the bags is being done at new- or used-car dealerships through companies like the Auto Action Group in Union, N.J.
In a frontal collision at 35 miles an hour the driver hits the steering wheel about 100 milliseconds -- one-tenth of a second -- after impact. Engineers figure they have about 50 milliseconds to get the bag inflated before the driver begins to move toward the wheel. Because inflation takes about 20 milliseconds, the air-bag system has only the first 30 milliseconds to sense the crash and decide to inflate the bag, and that is why factory-installed units rely on sensors near the front of the car.
 
Mechanical Sensor Used
 Breed, however, uses a single mechanical sensor in the steering wheel that senses the abrupt stop of a head-on crash. When that happens, a ball is jolted loose and rolls down a tube to trigger a firing pin, inflating the bag with the same type of mini-explosion used in factory-installed air bags.
Breed contends that its sensing system would be superior for original equipment, too, because there is no under-hood wiring to be damaged by the heat, gravel and other insults of daily operation, and no electric signal is required for the air bag to inflate.
But auto makers still tend to favor the advance-warning feature of the underhood sensors, which allows the bag to be inflated a bit more slowly, to avoid punching the driver in the face.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Follows Bonds Down After a Fed Official Resigns

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar eased against other major currencies yesterday, following United States Treasury bonds lower in reaction to the resignation of an important Federal Reserve official.
Treasury bonds fell after the news of the resignation because the official, David W. Mullins Jr., the vice chairman of the Fed, was perceived as a hawk on inflation. 
 Dealers worried that his departure could make the central bank less vigilant about inflation. That could lead to easier credit, which would make the dollar less attractive compared with other currencies.
The dollar has firmed recently amid growing expectations the Fed will soon tighten rates to fight inflation. A growing sense that higher rates may be delayed, however, held sway in the currency market.
Dealers also fretted about tomorrow's meeting of Germany's central bank, although few expect the Bundesbank to cut rates to stimulate the economy.
"All eyes will be on the Bundesbank meeting," said Angelo Evangelista, dealer with the Bank of Boston, adding that he expected the German central bank would refrain from cutting rates until strikes at 600 industrial companies in Germany had been settled.
Nearly 150,000 industrial workers across Germany walked off the job yesterday to protest calls for a wage freeze and cuts in holiday bonuses.
Gold bullion rose $2.50 on the New York Commodity Exchange, where the most-active April contract settled at $386.10 an ounce. A late quote from the Republic National Bank put spot gold at $384.25, up $2.50 from Monday.
Gold for February delivery settled at $384.10 an ounce, up $2.50 from Monday. Gold prices rose sharply on Monday after bouncing back from a two-month low. Silver prices also rose yesterday.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 107.66 yen, from 108.55 yen late Monday. The dollar rose to 1.7338 German marks, from 1.7330 marks on Monday. The British pound fell to $1.4995, from $1.5065 on Monday.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
A new subcompact car from Kia Motors in South Korea is happy to play follow the leader.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE newest nameplate in the American automotive market is more than willing to have Honda or other rivals declare themselves "a car ahead," as long as it can be perceived as following closely, and doggedly, behind.
In Las Vegas, Nev., and Portland, Ore., Kia Motors America, a unit of the Kia Motors Corporation of South Korea, will begin advertising tomorrow for the first cars sold under its name in the United States. A print, broadcast and dealer-showroom campaign, produced by Goldberg Moser O'Neill Advertising, uses humor and whimsy in seeking to create an image for the newcomer as both affordable and reliable, characteristics that might seem mutually exclusive in a four-door sedan starting at $8,495. 
 The strategy to establish a populist persona for Kia that would combine spunkiness with thriftiness is typified by a television commercial from the introductory phase of the campaign, which carries the theme "It's about time everyone had a well-made car."
"We were obsessed with building a car that's as well made as the Honda Civic," an announcer says, "so we actually followed a Civic around for 100,000 miles." Filmed and videotaped footage shows a Civic pursued cross-country by a Kia Sephia, a front-wheel-drive model that is Kia's initial American entry.
Only when the Civic drives through a tall, imposing gate does the Kia stop playing shadow. Kia "followed the Civic everywhere," the announcer declares, "except into the neighborhood of $12,000." At that, the Kia's driver brakes and waves.
"The typical way others would have done it would have been to put their car in front and have the Civic try to keep up," said Mike Moser, a partner and co-creative director ofGoldberg Moser in San Francisco.
"Well, we're not the leaders," he added. "We're basically the little car that could, not another blowhard trying to tell people how great we are."
Necessity was the mother of that invention.
"Consumers told us quite clearly, 'If you come from Korea, you've got a lot to prove,' " Dick Macedo, the marketing director for Kia Motors in Irvine, Calif., said.
"We started out with a campaign that addressed durability, but people could care less," he added. "What they were concerned about was a high-quality, reliable, dependable car at a low price."
So the campaign emphasizes those issues, using Japanese automobiles as a point of reference. A series of teaser ads, showing a giant reptile from a Japanese monster movie, asserted: "There's only one thing more frightening to Japan. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! A well-made car for under $9,000."
"What people are really looking for is an economy car that will not make their neighbors giggle or their mechanic rich," Mr. Moser said.
"You have to get realistic," he added. "If money wasn't an issue, people would buy a Civic and we wouldn't have a place in the American market. We have a place because there's a hole left there" by the recent steep price increases in models built in Japan, he said.
Even so, the client and agency confront daunting challenges. The economy subcompact market is extraordinarily competitive. Consumers are unforgiving and fickle; witness how they dispatched makes like Daihatsu and Yugo and sent sales of makes like Hyundai rising and plunging.
And competition is intensifying as American auto makers re-enter the market. The Chrysler Corporation poses a significant threat with a new subcompact, the Neon, to be sold by Dodge and Plymouth dealers at prices starting at $8,975.
Sometimes, though, a giant stumbles, as Chrysler did with its Neon commercials during the Super Bowl last Sunday. Rather than giving the fledgling model a sweeping send-off before the game's record estimated 134.8 million viewers, Chrysler ran two short, lackluster spots. (The rest of Neon's introductory campaign, by BBDO Worldwide in Southfield, Mich., will be described tomorrow at a news conference in New York.)
Another factor favoring Kia Motors is its track record with American drivers through the Festiva, a two-door subcompact it has manufactured for the Ford Motor Company. (Ford is replacing the Festiva with another Kia-built model, Aspire, in two- and four-door versions.)
Kia Motors plans to spend $30 million a year on advertising through Goldberg Moser, which in July was awarded the account -- its first automotive assignment -- after a 13-month review. The company has mapped out a region-by-region rollout: 11 Western states by the end of 1994, the Southeast and East next year, and the Midwest in early 1996. By the end of 1996, it hopes to be selling 250,000 units annually in three model lines, including a four-door sport-utility vehicle called Sportage.
Audaciously ambitious plans, to be sure. Perhaps overly ambitious. But Kia Motors is trying to keep its perspective.
"I wouldn't put us down as the high-technology comer of the world," Mr. Macedo acknowledged. "But we're a very good company with a very good price advantage."

Crude Prices Move Higher As Oil Inventories Slip a Bit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Crude oil prices surged to their highest levels in more than two months yesterday on expectations that the longest cold snap in the United States in 15 years is finally eating into stockpiles.
Stockpiles of distillate fuels, which include home heating oil, have fallen 11 percent in the last four weeks. Stocks are now almost 10 million barrels below their levels a year ago.
 
'It's Been Cold'

 
 "The spark still comes from heating oil," Jerry Samuels, a trader with Arb Oil in Los Angeles, said. "Everybody knows it's been cold and everybody's impressed with the draws in stockpiles." 
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for March delivery soared 73 cents to settle at $15.92 a barrel, while March heating oil jumped 2.28 cents, to 51.83 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline rose 2.33 cents, to 45.55 cents a gallon.
Despite yesterday's surge, crude oil prices are still 20 percent cheaper than last year, when crude traded at about $20 a barrel, and heating oil is still 8.5 percent less than last year, when it was trading at about 56.6 cents a gallon.
"The prices aren't as high and this year's cold hasn't been as damaging as 1989, but the demand for heating oil sure is there," a British Petroleum trader said.
Cold weather has returned to the East Coast, with snow falling in New York City yesterday. Temperatures in the East are expected to drop as low as 25 degrees below normal by Monday.
The rally in crude oil may taper off in the next few sessions. Traders said expectations about lower supplies were already reflected in yesterday's price rise and supplies of crude oil and gasoline remained high.
Late yesterday after trading ended, the American Petroleum Institute issued its weekly report on inventories. "There's plenty of crude oil around, and while that may not be significant, eventually we'll have to deal with it," Al Levine, an oil economist with Smith Barney Shearson in Maryland, said.
Gasoline prices also surged, as traders bet on a seasonal increase in prices before the summer driving season begins in June.

The Business District in Wilmington, Del., Is Reviving, With Commitments From Four Companies

BYLINE: By Maureen Milford

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del.

 BODY:
WEAKENED by corporate cutbacks and a flat economy, the business district here is bouncing back, thanks to some help from the city government.
The year-old city administration under Mayor James H. Sills Jr. won commitments from four companies last year to bring their operations to the downtown office center. 
 One new arrival will be the MBNA Corporation, a big credit card company. The company announced late last year that it would build a 350,000-square-foot building on a corner of Rodney Square.
MBNA, a large Delaware employer, has never before had a presence in the state's largest city. MBNA is based in suburban New Castle County, near Newark.
Work has begun on the nine-story building. The construction managers, the Bellevue Holding Company of Wilmington, expect the project to be completed by late this year.
Designed by Heery International Inc. of Washington in conjunction with Homsey Architects Inc. of Wilmington, the building's neo-classical style was chosen to blend with other buildings on the square.
Long considered the most desirable site in the central business district, Rodney Square is home to the headquarters of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the chemical giant, and the Delaware Chancery Court, where many corporate takeover battles are fought.
When MBNA completes the building, it will house 1,500 to 2,000 workers in individual banking and support operations. Its headquarters, however, will continue to be in New Castle County.
The credit card company was able to move so quickly with construction plans in part because of Wilmington 2000, a downtown-development group made up of representatives from the area's most powerful businesses.
Tax-abatement programs have been the centerpiece of the city's economic recovery efforts. But in the case of MBNA, the city had an additional sweetener.
Part of the package put together for the company included the donation of $6 million in land on Rodney Square or about two-thirds of the building site.
The city had become the reluctant owner of the land after another publicly backed real estate deal involving a Wilmington savings institution went sour in 1990. Land had been assembled and buildings razed in the late 1980's to make room for an office tower, but with the downturn in the economy the institution abandoned its plans, leaving the city and another public agency with an expensive and embarrassing hole.
When MBNA went looking to expand operations, the city saw the land giveaway as a way to recoup some of its financial losses and bring in much needed jobs for disadvantaged city residents. The city even offered to buy the remaining third of the building site from the savings institution for $4.2 million. But Charles M. Cawley, president of MBNA, refused, insisting the credit card company buy it privately.
Other enticements for MBNA included a five-year tax abatement on the real estate; an additional five years of real estate tax relief of 50 percent, and a five-year break on the head tax, a city tax on employers, which is assessed at $6 an employee a month.
Even with the tax cuts, the Sills administration estimates the city will realize a $900,000 net gain over the next 10 years from the deal.
There had been concerns the city central business district would go the way of other deteriorating midsized industrial cities. With vacancy rates in downtown Wilmington at 24.7 percent, the fear was that business would look to other more vigorous markets outside Delaware.
"We just can't stand by and let the city go backward," said John E. Stapleford, director of the Bureau of Economic Research at the University of Delaware. "It's all to our benefit to see this sort of thing happen. This influx of jobs into downtown is very, very important for everybody."
Du Pont announced in November that it would bring 1,500 jobs to its downtown buildings. The Beneficial Corporation, a giant lender that had been based in New Castle County, decided in May that it would relocate its headquarters in a city-state redevelopment project, the Christina Gateway. The American Express Centurion Bank also moved its headquarters from near Newark to the Christina Gateway.
All three benefited from the head-tax abatement, since any employer who creates at least 100 new positions in Wilmington gets a five-year break on the tax.
As part of its deal, MBNA also insisted on a commitment by the city that it would move forward with the creation of a business improvement district, similar to those in Manhattan, Baltimore, Philadelphia and other cities. In such a district, property owners agree to assess themselves to pay for supplemental services like extra security, sanitation and marketing. The businesses in the district determine which extra services are necessary. Wilmington 2000 is now working to have the district in operation by this summer.

HEADLINE: Kitchen Computer: Promising Steak, Serving Burgers

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
MY computer is talking to me.
"Now this recipe has been a secret for years," it says. 
 Imagine my excitement.
Up pops Martha Stewart's recipe for a salad of bibb lettuce, garlic, olive oil, lemon and pepper.
Imagine my disappointment.
Welcome to the world of CD-ROM cooking disks. When plugged into personal computers, these compact disks can present reams of information complete with videos and music. They are the latest effort to take recipes out of cookbooks and put them into the modern language of multimedia communications. Cooking videos, the previous effort, were a flop. Not many kitchens are equipped with VCR's and there has been no rush to put computers in the kitchen, either. For now, the printed page has nothing to worry about. But what does the future hold?
CD-ROM's (ROM stands for "read only memory," meaning the disk cannot be changed) take the idea of the cooking video a step further. The screen of a computer with CD-ROM capabilities and speakers can not only display written recipes but also provide oral directions while visually showing how to truss a chicken; it can provide a menu for serving the chicken and print out a shopping list for the meal, all of this with background music. One disk can hold the contents of hundreds of cookbooks without photos or videos, or the recipes of a large cookbook complete with photographs and video.
But so far, the voice that promised me so much and delivered a lettuce salad is in pretty exclusive company. A foray into the world of electronic cooking has produced only seven CD-ROM's that work with I.B.M.-compatible computers. A couple of others are for the Apple Macintosh only. The disk with the lettuce recipe is from Robin Leach, who has turned "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" into a CD-ROM cookbook. The others span the spectrum of cooking styles, from a disk with more than a million recipes, where Velveeta and canned mushroom soup run rampant, to "The New Basics Electronic Cookbook," a CD-ROM version of the cookbook from the "Silver Palate" duo, Sheila Lukens and Julee Rosso.
These are a taste of what may lie ahead. Last year, 4.8 million CD-ROM computer drives were sold worldwide, and 1.5 million were sold in 1992, said Patty Chang of Dataquest, which tracks the high-technology industry, in San Jose, Calif.
Dan Norton-Middaugh said, with the enthusiasm appropriate for his job as marketing manager of Multicom Publishing, a Seattle company that produces CD-ROM disks: "Everyone will have a CD-ROM in the next five years. We are moving toward something that will have real utility for a broad spectrum of people. We are making an investment now, coming up a steep learning curve, for a time when the equipment will be more ubiquitous. We are tapping into visual responses, but whether it's for the novelty or real utility, I don't know."
Putting aside the question about the practicality of setting up a computer, even a laptop, in the kitchen, where it might become a convenient receptacle for sauces, salad dressings and cake batter, why would the cook want one? What indispensable help does an interactive CD offer that an ordinary cookbook can't?
Recognizing that I am skeptical of technology's ability to make everything easier, I decided to speak to the most likely audience for these disks. A colleague in the office electronically posted questions about the value of CD-ROM cookbooks to users of the Internet, the global labyrinth of computer information networks.
Among the information exchanges on the Internet are electronic bulletin boards for people interested in food, in which users post questions (tahini: can it be frozen?) and ask for recipes (low-fat cookies, Chinese steamed buns). All eight people who responded had yet to use a CD-ROM cooking disk, which is probably because so few have been sold. Companies declined to supply exact figures on their disk sales, but none claimed to have sold as much as 25,000.
But some people who market the disks have also used them. "The Better Homes and Gardens Healthy Cooking CD Cookbook," produced by Multicom, has Mr. Norton-Middaugh enthusiastic. "The disk has both photographs and recipes," he said, "and that allows me, as a relative novice, to browse for inspiration. The computer does the initial sorting for me. I had a lot of zucchini this summer, and I could ask for the recipes using zucchini. I also sort by preparation time. I don't want anything that takes more than half an hour."
One man who replied through the Internet does have a computer in the kitchen and uses a Mangia software program, which performs many of the same functions of a CD-ROM but with no pictures or voice. He said it was a "fairly painless way to locate recipes, scale amounts, prepare shopping lists, etc."
Scott Fisher, who has written a book on programming CD-ROM's, "Multimedia Authoring," to be published by AP Professional, and also writes about food for The San Jose Mercury News, said, "The biggest downside, of course, is that pouring sauce Espagnole into your Macintosh is unlikely to improve either the sauce or the Mac."
Another Internet respondent said that he thought a CD-ROM would be useful if it offered advantages that a book did not, like cross indexes, the ability to search, color photos of ingredients, video for unusual techniques, the ability to make and organize notes, a section with descriptions of ingredients, suggestions on accompanying dishes and drinks, the history of a dish, the capacity to add recipes and comments, and the ability to print out recipes.
Is it significant that seven of the eight people who responded are men? The woman who responded said, "I prefer being able to curl up with a stack of cookbooks rather than sitting down at a computer."
Women cook while men compute?
After watching hours of CD-ROM cooking disks, punctuated with frequent calls to the technical experts in my office to fix this or that, I'm with the curler-upper. For now, at least. Never mind that a $2,000 piece of equipment is needed to play the disks, and that the disks list for $30 to $70. When the disks are able to do all the wonderful things that potential users would like them to do, then they will be useful. Mr. Fisher agrees that there are too many glitches. "It will be quite some time before they make economic sense," he said. "No one has bothered to do it properly."
David Pogue, who has written two books about computers and is a contributing editor of Macworld, the Macintosh publication, agrees. "CD-ROM is very, very hot," he said. "They are being gobbled up by millions, and that has been an incentive of software companies to put together something as quickly as possible -- shovelware -- just to get something on the market. Cookbooks still beat them."
Technically speaking only -- never mind the recipe content -- the cooking disk that comes within hailing distance of its potential is the BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS HEALTHY COOKING CD COOKBOOK.
It searches, it scales recipes up and down, it provides nutrition information, it prints out a shopping list. There are videos of techniques, but does the cook learn anything about separating yolks from whites when computer shows an egg separator and says, "Buy an egg separator"?
There's music, but it can become tiresome. The biggest drawback, though, is the length of the transitions from one subject matter to another. This program is slow. The screen goes black for a long time between searches.
COOKBOOK U.S.A. , on the other hand, doesn't sing or dance. But it has amillion recipes, lots of them with Velveeta and canned chicken soup. Does anyone really need 8,882 recipes just for brownies? Based on the contents of 4,000 cookbooks, the disk seems to be thrown together without much thought. The differences among recipes under a title may be no more than the amount of salt.
There are plenty of glitches. How, for example, did a recipe for cream-cheese brownies end up under appetizers? The most annoying feature is the program's inability to search properly. Ask for rice pudding under the recipe search function and nothing comes up. Ask for rice pudding by listing the ingredients it should contain and 443 recipes come up. Then go back and ask for rice pudding under recipe search and voila! -- it comes up with 443 recipes.
The computer specialists I consulted were not able to install THE NEW BASICS ELECTRONIC COOKBOOK so that it worked completely. It was possible to use the recipes, but my technical experts were not able to get the user guide or the video demonstrations to function. The disk offers the same recipes that have appealed to hundreds of thousands of people who have purchased the "Silver Palate" cookbook. But in an effort to differentiate the CD from a book, to jazz up the product, it provides some silly pictures with each recipe. Does anyone really need to see what a bag of sugar or an egg or a carton of milk looks like? And searching for recipes is time consuming.
The minute that serious cooks look at DIGITAL GOURMET, which has no pictures or sound, they are likely to be turned off: the ingredients in each recipe are listed in run-on fashion, not individually. Lots of molded salads and maraschino cherries do not make this program any more winning. But one appealing features is its ability to combine all the ingredients on the shopping list and alphabetize them so that if onions, for example, are called for in two recipes, the onions are listed next to one another.
JOHN SCHUMACHER'S NEW PRAGUE HOTEL COOKBOOK is simply the printed pages of a cookbook about Mr. Schumacher's restaurant in New Prague, Minn., transferred to a disk. A few pictures are thrown in, including one showing a visit to the restaurant by the former Czechoslovak leader Alexander Dubcek to the restaurant; there is also the voice of Mr. Schumacher explaining why he became a cook.
THE HEALING FOODS COOKBOOK , which surprisingly includes no sound or video but has "100 delicious recipes with curative power," is another disk that needs to go back to the drawing board. It supplies no more than is found on the printed page.
For those who love to hear Robin Leach talking about Elizabeth Taylor's wedding or want to watch Ivana Trump cavorting on a fashion runway, LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS COOKBOOK is a must. And at last, the secret of Miss Taylor's ability to remain full-figured is revealed: the disk offers recipes for four dishes from the wedding feast at her marriage to Larry Fortensky, and all of them contain cream.
As an alternative, if you want to organize your recipes electronically and you own a Macintosh, try the Mangia software. It has its own set of faults, but none as annoying as those on the CD-ROM.
For those who are not 100 percent computer literate, stick with the printed page. You can buy a lot of cookbooks for $2,000.

HEADLINE: It's Not Yellow Journalism, but Red, White or Rose

BYLINE: By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG

 BODY:
JOHN PAUL of Dundee, Ore., thinks wine is a laughing matter. In Bung, the newsletter of Cameron, his winery, he mimicked a supermarket tabloid. "Exclusive!" shouted a page 1 headline. "Bill Clinton Drank Pinot Noir in College! 'I Never Swallowed,' He Now Claims."
By contrast, a whiff of academe greeted subscribers to the sophisticated Simi News, published by the Simi Winery in Healdsburg, Calif. The main article: "Wild and Cultured Yeasts in Wine: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." 
 The simple Rooster Tales from Sakonnet Vineyards in Little Compton, R.I., peddled America's Cup Red and Spinnaker White.
And a recipe for tournedoes of venison served with Norton wine, made from America's most underappreciated red grape, tantalized readers of the untitled publication of the Stone Hill Winery in Hermann, Mo.
These newsletters and hundreds of others (some drenched in prose as purple as grapes) form a backwater of wine journalism known by the industry's hoariest pun, the wine press. The quarterlies, semi-annuals, seasonals and every-so-oftens are informative, gossipy and entertaining in content, as well as formal, old shoe or whimsical in style.
They are free. Labels carry a winery's hometown and often list its phone number and address. If a winery has a newsletter, a phone call or postcard can put the customer on the mailing list.
"The highest use of the newsletter is to communicate the personality of the winery -- its values, its wines -- in a way that goes one-on-one with the customer," said J. William Moffett, editor in chief of Vineyard & Winery Management, a trade publication.
In an industry besieged by health issues, labeling rules, so-called neo-prohibitionism and Darwinism in a shrinking marketplace, the economics of survival focus on making wine daily fare. Thus, recipes abound.
Fetzer & Food, published in Emeryville, Calif., offered features like "Marrying Chilies With Wine" and "Enjoy Wine With Salad." Eric Miller, the wine maker at Chaddsford Winery in Chadds Ford, Pa., gave readers of his unnamed newsletter an intricate chart that matched wines with foods by leaning heavily on dominant flavor characteristics.
For those craving relief from chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon, the vanilla and chocolate of wines, the Latah Creek New-News Letter in Spokane, Wash., recommended alternatives: muscat canelli and lemberger.
The harvest is usually the year's top story. In Bethel Height-Lights, Terry Casteel, the wine maker at Bethel Heights Vineyard in Salem, Ore., analyzed grape-growing problems frankly: "Many people are not psychologically capable of thinning grapes. To a grower, a large crop . . . is like money in the bank."
Since newsletters promote current releases and prices, medals are a staple. The 1990 chardonnay "Grabs Gold & Double Silver at International Competition," said a headline in the Cinnabar Winery Press from Saratoga, Calif.
Technical-minded customers snacked on rootstock, vine spacing and trellis-management data in the Sutter Home Newsletter from St. Helena, Calif., and on an explanation of dosage (the sweetening of sparkling wine) in the untitled publication of Glenora Wine Cellars in Dundee, N.Y.
To read David Ramey on sauvignon blanc, barrel aging and fermentation in Chalk Board, published by Chalk Hill Winery in Healdsburg, Calif., is to appreciate the subtlety of a virtuoso wine maker.
Noshers have a newsletter, too: the Quady Dessert Wine Digest. Quady, a Madera, Calif., winery, specializes in ambrosias confected from black and orange muscat grapes, and in ports. Even the printer's ink used to report a Quady contest's prize-winning recipe -- chevre fromage blanc tart with summer fruits -- seemed caloric.

HEADLINE: Despite Successes, Kirov Opera Finds Reasons for Gloom

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Before the Kirov Opera made its much-admired visit to New York in the summer of 1992, the company seemed suffused with a kind of guarded optimism. Yes, the Russian economy was in disarray. But changes were in the works, and in the meantime the company's performances were at a high level of achievement and freedom promised much for the future.
Today, as the Kirov begins a weeklong Rimsky-Korsakov Festival here that has attracted many Western critics and visitors, that optimism seems frayed. Both Valery Gergiyev, the artistic director of the opera and music director of the Maryinsky Theater, which also houses the Kirov Ballet, and Anatoly F. Malkov, the administrative director of the theater, sounded grim and pessimistic compared with their mood in 1992. But they were hardly ready to give up the fight for artistic quality and financial independence, a fight that has solidified the Kirov Opera's reputation as Russia's best. 
 "There is bigger freedom, much bigger than even two years ago," said Mr. Gergiyev (pronounced GAIR-ghee-yev) on Monday before a performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's opera "Sadko." "Some parts of the economy are slowly improving. But it is much more difficult for us now than in 1992. It's almost impossible to expect serious financial support from the state. What we must count on is our own energy, our own ability to create something that will support our artistic plans."
 
Sources of Income
 Mr. Malkov agreed. "I can't see now any stability or improvement in the financial situation in this country," he said. Eighty percent of the theater's income is from outside the traditional Russian state-support system, he added, most of it from the West. He cited audio and video recording arrangements with Philips Records in the Netherlands, NHK in Japan and the BBC in Britain; co-productions with European and American companies; tours (including the company's first to Japan, last year) and lowest on the list, corporate and private sponsors both Western and Russian.
He said that in addition to three wage increases last year to keep pace with Russia's runaway inflation, the theater's 1,240 employees had gained a 50 percent raise in real terms when the Maryinsky Theater was named to the short list of Russian cultural treasures by President Boris N. Yeltsin, with an increased subsidy to match.
The company's artistic accomplishments since Mr. Gergiyev, now 40, took over in 1988 are internationally recognized. Its production of Prokofiev's "Fiery Angel," seen in New York in 1992, was voted best opera production in Japan for 1993, Mr. Malkov said. Mr. Gergiyev received Russia's highest musical honor from President Yeltsin on Dec. 29. He was named conductor of the year at the Classical Music Awards in London on Jan. 21. And the company's audio and video recordings have been highly regarded by critics and the public.
 
A Heavy Schedule
 The ambitious Rimsky-Korsakov Festival, which began with a concert on Sunday night, seems to be stretching the theater's hard-working staff to its limits. Within one week there will be four operas by Rimsky-Korsakov: "Sadko," "The Maid of Pskov," "Kaschey the Deathless" and a new production of the monumental "Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh."
"Kaschey" is being paired with his tone poem "Scheherazade," and there are four other concerts, some of Rimsky-Korsakov alone, some offering his orchestrations of other composers and some intended to place the composer in the context of his predecessors, contemporaries and successors, including Stravinsky, Debussy, Ravel, Respighi, Prokofiev and Messiaen. Mr. Gergiyev said his next festival would be devoted to the music Stravinsky composed while still in Russia.
The current festival, which follows similar celebrations of Mussorgsky in 1989 and Prokofiev in 1991-92, has attracted several star Russian singers who have active careers in the West. They include the soprano Galina Gorchakova, who has just flown in from a run of "Fiery Angels" at La Scala and who will sing the leading roles in both "Kitezh" and "The Maid of Pskov."
"The more the importance of our projects, the more chances are that major singers will want to come here," Mr. Gergiyev said. "Importance" includes, of course, the opportunity for audio and video exposure; Philips is recording the entire festival for possible future release.
 
Keeping Audience Russian
 Still, the constant struggle for money sometimes seems to wear down both Mr. Gergiyev and Mr. Malkov. Especially when Western sponsors and artists are frightened by the country's political turmoil.
"People could be scared off by the political tension," Mr. Gergiyev worried. "Not to speak of tanks in the streets of Moscow."
A major concern is keeping ticket prices within reach of the increasingly impoverished Russian public; by one international estimate, 40 percent of all Russians are now below the poverty line. As in all major Russian theaters, tourists are expected to pay $50 and more for their tickets, while comparable seats sell to Russians for less than $3 at current black market exchange rates.
"It's a moral issue," Mr. Gergiyev said. "We could raise prices and play for foreign tourists and the new rich, which is a new class here, although they are not all serious music lovers. But our public can't afford any more; even $3 is a lot for them."
Despite Mr. Gergiyev's assurances that the Rimsky-Korsakov Festival is proceeding exactly as he planned it, some recent Kirov stars are absent, and Mr. Malkov admitted that money was a problem.
Without specifically conceding the issue, Mr. Gergiyev had a veiled warning for his missing stars. "Singers know that if they are too often absent here, that empty places must be filled," he said. "We had wonderful singers, and it looked as if they were irreplaceable. But there are superb young voices, and no one is irreplaceable."
Unable to afford the regular fees of Western artists, Mr. Gergiyev hopes to win them through personal contacts and the pleasure of working with his forces in this opulent, acoustically flattering theater. Placido Domingo, whom Mr. Gergiyev will conduct in Verdi's "Otello" at the Metropolitan Opera in March, has already been here for the same opera and is president of the international Friends of the Kirov Opera.
 
The Company's Mission
 Mr. Gergiyev said he wanted to persuade Mr. Domingo to appear in Verdi's "Forza del Destino" and Wagner's "Parsifal," the latter linked with "Lohengrin" in one abstract production. He said he would also like James Conlon, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Christian Thielemann to conduct here, either at the opera or as part of the White Nights music festival from May through July, which Mr. Gergiyev took over as artistic director last year.
For all the explorations of Italian and German repertory, the Kirov remains a Russian company, the primary preserver and revitalizer of the Russian operatic tradition. In his frequent excursions to the West, Mr. Gergiyev seeks to assert his company's claims on that repertory and not to succumb to Western promoters' insistence on the same tired round of war horses: "Boris Godunov," "Eugene Onegin" and maybe "The Queen of Spades."
"You can't let commercial concerns overcome artistic priorities," he said, speaking obliquely of the many Russian performing institutions that have done just that. "I had to fight to get Paris to accept 'Kitezh.' The promoters are right: they want to sell tickets. But I am right, too: we can't always do the same things."
A judgment of the Rimsky-Korsakov Festival, reflecting both the current state of the Kirov company and the long-suffering reputation of Rimsky-Korsakov as a composer, must await its conclusion this weekend.
"When it's over, we can all together decide if it was really needed," Mr. Gergiyev said. "Then, the importance of this festival will become clearer."

With Perfect Timing

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
Bill Clinton gives a good speech. There is in him a bit of the preacher, some of the earnest high school orator, a little carnival barker and some door-to-door salesman. You could tell how well his State of the Union address played by how fast his political opponents rushed to judge it empty rhetoric.
Before, the Gallup poll found that 67 percent of those they surveyed thought the President was on the right track. Afterward the number rose to 85 percent. 
 And that wasn't only because Mr. Clinton can deliver a speech as though he were the Fuller Brush man and you were out of dusting rags, or because he sometimes sounded more Republican than Bob Dole, with a million times the charm. It's that his timing's right.
Let's go back to George Bush's first State of the Union, and to Ronald Reagan's too, 12 years ago. Mr. Reagan's proposal for a New Federalism -- remember that? -- made only a casual and condescending mention of the growing deficit. "Raise present taxes to cut future deficits, they tell us -- well, I don't buy that argument," said the man who would preside over Jurassic deficit, huge and out of control.
Here's a blast from the past: The first big applause line in Mr. Bush's first State of the Union was "Panama is free!" He went on to devote five sentences to the deficit, and informed the American people that the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be studying the subject of "the quality, accessibility and cost of our nation's health care system."
But before Bill Clinton even gave his first official State of the Union Message last week, he'd given two other substantive, nationally televised speeches, one on deficit reduction and the other on universal health care. Mr. Clinton's opponents will say these issues are straw men, tell you that the economy will take care of the deficit, and that the health care system has problems but no crisis.
But they cannot use charts and statistics to will away the fact that millions of Americans, even those who don't fully understand Federal spending or managed competition, have come to perceive both deficit reduction and health care provision as long-overdue areas of reform.
They can't will away the fact that, by the time Governor Clinton became President Clinton, both government and health care spending had become so monumental that the time was precisely right to showcase both. And Mr. Clinton did just that.
Some of Mr. Clinton's greatest failures have come when, as with gay men and lesbians in the military or an end to the H.I.V. exclusion for immigrants, he's been challenged to be an unreconstructed liberal on social issues. Now reconstructed, he came down heavily on crime and welfare reform in his first State of the Union.
He's too smart to think either issue is as simple as people would like or as he made them sound. For a start, you can't reform welfare unless you reform child care. And mandating sentences without addressing the root causes of crime just guarantees that America's biggest growth industry will be the manufacture of felons.
But violent crime and welfare dependency have become problems so pressing that the time is right not only for a President to attack both, but for a Democratic President to do so, co-opting Republicans. And without reprisals from the usual suspects. Liberals will never be swayed by either "two years and out" for welfare or "three strikes and you're out" for felons. But the timing is bad to restate bromides about the cycle of poverty, even if they happen to be true.
Mr. Clinton's first State of the Union was a little like the story of the blind men and the elephant, in which each man feels the animal and then constructs something wildly different, in his mind's eye, from disparate parts: part new Democrat, part old Republican, part progressive and populist and Perot. Vision as Chinese menu, column A and column B.
But maybe the timing is right for that, too, for the President who insists that pragmatism is the only useful ideology. Now there will be negotiations, and concessions, and horse-trading, and in the end reducing the deficit and providing universal health care and crafting a crime bill and reforming welfare may owe at least as much to Republican legislators as to Democratic policy wonks.
But no one will remember that. Bill Clinton named and claimed them. His timing was impeccable. And in politics, as in so much else, timing can be everything.

HEADLINE: Powerful Business Group Backs Rival to President's Health Plan

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The Business Roundtable, representing about 200 of the nation's largest companies, struck a blow against President Clinton's health care plan tonight by endorsing a rival proposal that would not guarantee universal insurance coverage.
Despite urgent last-minute lobbying by Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, the policy committee of the Roundtable voted to treat the rival bill as a "starting point" for legislation on health insurance. 
 The rival bill, sponsored by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, is the only major health care measure with the support of Democrats and Republicans alike.
 
Hopes for Competition
 John Ong, who is the chairman of the influential Roundtable and the chief executive of the B. F. Goodrich Company, said the policy committee preferred Mr. Cooper's plan because it believed that his proposal would foster competition and bring down the cost of health care.
The White House expressed disappointment over the vote, although its effect on Capitol Hill was uncertain. While the endorsement is bound to help Mr. Cooper, his supporters and opponents alike said the vote would hardly be decisive in the swirling legislative journey that awaits the health care issue.
"I am humbled by their support," Mr. Cooper said of the business group's decision.
Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said: "We're disappointed but not surprised. We think it's a mistake, obviously. But they say it's a starting point, and we look forward to a constructive debate about it."
Mr. Ong said the Cooper plan had been approved by "a significant majority" of the committee, "but I won't give you the specific vote."
Despite the endorsement, Mr. Ong said business was wary of a feature in the plan denying employers tax deductions for anything beyond the cheapest health insurance.
The Roundtable made it clear that it liked Mr. Cooper's approach of creating cooperatives so small businesses could join in buying insurance, saying this would foster competition. Under the Cooper plan employers with fewer than 100 workers could join cooperatives and would have to offer their employees insurance but would not have to pay for it. Bigger companies would not have to join alliances but would have to make insurance available to their employees.
Under the Clinton plan, all employers would be required to pay most of the cost of such insurance.
The Clinton plan would also limit how fast health insurance premiums rise, aiming to reduce increases to no more than the nation's overall rate of inflation. That position is opposed by the business group.
Mr. Cooper argues that his plan would offer all Americans access to insurance and would lead to universal coverage without costing jobs, as he argues that Mr. Clinton's plan would.
The President, who has said access to insurance coverage is insufficient, has threatened to veto any plan that does not provide universal coverage.
Mr. Ong said the Clinton plan had "the potential, if enacted in its current form, to create additional unfunded, off-budget entitlement programs." Mr. Clinton has proposed creating a prescription drug benefit for the elderly under Medicare and some long-term care guarantees.
"It also seeks to control costs, which is a very worthy objective," Mr. Ong said, "but to do that not through harnessing market forces but rather through Government regulation of the health care industry and what are in effect price controls."
 
Bipartisan Support
 The Cooper plan is sponsored by 30 other House Democrats and 26 House Republicans, as well as three Democrats and one Republican in the Senate. While three other alternative health care measures have more supporters, the bipartisan character of the Cooper camp gives the plan's supporters a tactical advantage beyond their numbers.
The Roundtable brings together chief executives of the nation's largest companies like General Electric, General Mills and General Motors. The head of its task force on health, welfare and retirement income, which drew up the position before it was voted on by the policy committee, is Robert C. Winters, chief executive of the Prudential Insurance Company of America.
The Roundtable, meeting here, would not make Mr. Winters available to reporters. But Mr. Ong said there was no conflict of interest for the insurance executive.
"We try to take a broad view that emphasizes the health of the nation's economy and the overall competitiveness of U.S. industry," Mr. Ong said. "We try to ignore as much as we can the interests of our companies. I don't think there is any merit in supposing that Mr. Winters or anybody else had any bias or prejudice."
 
Reaction in Congress
 Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, the West Virginia Democrat who has been the Administration's chief liaison with business on the health care issue, took a different view. He said the most active members of the task force came from the insurance and drug industries.
"They don't want the people to get insurance at a better price," Mr. Rockefeller said. "I think business did themselves a disservice in this. I think they let their peers in the insurance industry snooker them."
Mr. Rockefeller said big business liked Mr. Cooper's plan "because he does not change the status quo." The Senator said big business was so conservative that if the Administration had won its support "it would have been the upset of the decade."
Mr. Rockefeller's view that the Roundtable decision did not matter much was shared by one of Mr. Cooper's allies, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, who is the plan's leading backer in the Senate.
"I don't think it makes a lot of difference," Mr. Breaux said. "We've got to have 60 votes, and the only way we're going to get it is through a realistic compromise."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Cooper had a harder time with his colleagues on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the committee, as well as Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who heads the health subcommittee, led a critical questioning of him. The session focused on the absence of any guarantee of universal coverage in his bill.
Mr. Waxman said the measure offered a "hollow promise" of access to health insurance that would be meaningless to people who could not afford it.
Mr. Cooper's chief co-sponsor, Representative Fred Grandy, Republican of Iowa, said, "Mr. Cooper and I use a different mechanism than the Administration to achieve universal coverage, but I believe we share the same underlying goal."
 
Seeing Savings for States
 The Clinton Administration, in defense of its plan, made public today a study showing that reduced spending for Medicaid, the government health program for the poor, would save the states $47 billion from 1996 to 2000, and that in their role as employers they would save $6 billion more.
The study was not broken down by state.
At a panel discussion on health care here, sponsored by American Health Line, a political information service and two foundations, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 Republican in the House, put distance between himself and the Republican camp that contends that there is no crisis in the nation's health care system.
Referring to health care, Mr. Gingrich said, "I think it's silly to describe it as anything other than a very serious problem."
But he went on to attack the Clinton plan as one that would lead to a huge Government intrusion into the health care system. He said Republicans were willing to work with the Administration and Democrats on producing a bipartisan bill, but he said the Administration would have to set aside the premium price controls and mandatory alliances in its plan.
David R. Gergen, counselor to the President, was also on the panel and characterized Mr. Clinton's position in these words, "The President believes that his way is the best, but he is willing to listen and talk to people who may have better ways."
He said the Administration would continue to have reqular discussions with Mr. Cooper and Mr. Breaux.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI OUTLINES A BUDGET TO CUT GOVERNMENT SIZE

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Saying New York City faced "a fiscal emergency," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani outlined a budget plan yesterday that would reduce the city's spending for the first time since the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, eliminating at least 15,000 municipal jobs, consolidating departments and slashing agency budgets by more than $1 billion.
The Mayor's cuts would fall heavily on the city's Department of Sanitation, on social services and on the school system, which alone would face a reduction of 2,500 jobs, or more than half, from its administrative staff. 
 Overall, in those departments and others, the plan would have the greatest impact on the city's unionized work force, which the Mayor plans to cut over the next 18 months by 15,000 people, or 7 percent, through attrition, severance packages, or if they fail, layoffs. Mr. Giuliani warned the unions that they would face even more cuts by layoffs if he does not win concessions on health benefits and productivity gains totaling about $500 million.
 
Wide Range of Cuts
 And while the Mayor and his aides say they have attempted to produce a financial plan that would minimize pain, it includes a wide range of cuts that will be felt by many New Yorkers, including less money for museums, fewer pickups of recyclable trash and delayed renovations of subway stations. [Page B3.]
The plan, a preliminary version of the budget he is to submit to the City Council in April, highlights the new Mayor's campaign pledge to create a leaner, more efficient government that lives within its means and provides essential services -- all without tax increases for businesses or the city's seven and a half million residents.
"We are going to cut the size of government so that we live within our means," the Mayor said in a speech broadcast on radio and television last night.
Arguing that the government had in fact grown so large that it was strangling an economic recovery, Mr. Giuliani included tax cuts that would total $783 million over the next four years -- despite his facing an immediate deficit of $2.3 billion for the fiscal year that begins in July.
 
Two Tax Reductions
 He said he would reduce two taxes -- the commercial rent tax and the unincorporated business tax-- to help businesses, especially those in the city's neighborhoods beyond Manhattan. He also promised to cut the city's tax on hotel rooms by December and the city's sales tax on clothes under $100 by next year as a way to stimulate the economy.
The Mayor's plan also detailed the first steps of his effort to "reinvent government" by turning over some city services to private companies or by trying new approaches now used in other cities. For example the administration hopes to save $7 million next year and $88 million each year after that by fingerprinting recipients of public assistance to reduce fraud and waste, a program that the Mayor said has had success in Los Angeles and in a pilot project in Rockland and Onondaga counties.
The reaction to Mr. Giuliani's plan varied widely. Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the Financial Control Board, the state agency that oversees the city's fiscal management, called it "bold and courageous." Richard P. Larkin of Standard and Poor's Corporation, a bond rating agency, described it as "a good start" that needed "the test of time."
But others, from elected officials to union leaders to advocates of particular programs argued that the cuts would fall hardest on those who could afford it least. Una Clarke, a City Council member from Brooklyn who is a member of the Council's 22-member black and Hispanic caucus, said the preliminary budget plan would create not "a leaner city, but a meaner city."
"As this plan is presented," she said, "the poor will bear the brunt of it."
The plan, which Mr. Giuliani outlined for elected officials and reporters at City Hall yesterday, is required by law to show that the city's budgets over the next four years are balanced. While it offers a broad strategy, it is not the Mayor's budget, which he will present on April 26.
Mr. Giuliani said that between now and then he would put into his budget any "better ideas than those proposed" to help close the deficit or make the city more efficient. "This is the beginning, not the end of the process," he said.
Many of his proposals require approval from the City Council or the State Legislature, many of whose members owe a great deal to the unions that Mr. Giuliani intends to take on.
The Council's Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, responded positively to the budget proposals, though he said there were some concerns, particularly with the depth of the cuts at the Board of Education. The council's black and Hispanic caucus opposed the cuts in the schools budget unless a thorough review of the impact on children was conducted.
In fact, the Mayor's cuts at the Board of Education could prove the most controversial. While the city provides $3.5 billion, a little less than half of the board's total budget, the seven-member board has final say over how to use it. Mr. Giuliani's proposal would cut the board's budget by $291 million, primarily through the reduction of 2,500 administrative positions.
Through a spokesman, the Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, signaled the board's unhappiness, saying the Mayor's proposal included "many unrealistic assumptions and appears to take a scattergun approach to the budget problems."
It also remains to be seen whether other assumptions in the Mayor's plan, including the receipt of about $400 million in added state or Federal aid, will come to pass. In addition, the Municipal Assistance Corporation has not yet decided whether to approve the use of a $200 million surplus fund to pay for severance packages for workers asked to leave their jobs.
 
Union Leader Is Opposed
 And still other proposals require at least some agreement from the unions, which have vowed to fight. "He can't just come in here and tell us, 'We want to take your benefits.' " said Stanley Hill, the president of District Council 37, the city's largest municipal union. "I can't negotiate that way."
The budget for next year is expected to total $31.2 billion, a reduction of $516 million from the current year's budget of $31.7 billion. The decline in revenues reflects a drop in the value of the city's real estate, on which the city bases property taxes, the largest share of the city's revenues.
That decline in value -- nearly $200 million -- reflects the lingering effects of the recession on the city's real estate markets. Mr. Giuliani's revenue estimates for coming years are based on expectations of an economic upturn, including modest increases in sales, banking and personal income taxes, which fiscal monitors said were realistic estimates.
Still, the Mayor went to lengths to say that he would not simply use future increases in revenues to raise the city's spending again. He argued that the size of the city's government started to climb again after the fiscal crisis, when the city slashed its work force and spending after flirting with bankruptcy.
Mr. Giuliani said the growth of government had stalled the city's economic recovery; as the city lost jobs due to recession, he said, more of the burden fell on taxpayers and businesses, forcing even more to leave the city.
"We have budgeted on the theory that we were unique for the last 10 or 15 years," he said, "that we could just increase spending and that we didn't have to take into account the tax burden, the fee burden, the fine burden we were placing on businesses, including small business."
Mr. Giuliani's plan identifies only 4,089 of the jobs it plans to reduce through the severance package, as well as the 2,500 cuts it proposed for the Board of Education. The administration plans to eliminate an additional 9,600 by June 1995 through a combination of severance, attrition and, if necessary, layoffs.
In the case of the Department of Sanitation, he said, layoffs could be avoided if the city wins concessions on the amount of garbage sanitation workers collect each day. Of the jobs already identified for elimination, almost 1,500 fall in that department.
"It's an offer to sanitation workers and everyone else in this city," Mr. Giuliani said of his plan. "Help us to make you more productive. If you do, then this massive change doesn't have to take place. If you don't then the massive change is inevitable."
The Mayor's plan also detailed the first steps of his effort to restructure the city's agencies -- for a savings of $28 million next year, with larger savings in the future.
He said he would consolidate the functions of the Department of Consumer Affairs, the Human Rights Commission, the Taxi and Limousine Commission and other smaller agencies into other departments. And he said he would also merge the Board of Education's security division into the Police Department.
The plan also called for competition in government services, allowing companies to bid for some functions including street resurfacing and the water pollution control plants.
Under the plan, the administration would also eliminate services it no longer considered essential, selling for example, 85 of the city's 500 gas stations. It also calls for selling either all or part of WNYC, the city's radio and television stations, as well as selling the city's parking garages and the land under the U.N. Plaza Hotel on First Avenue across from the United Nations.
While these steps would save the city only $28 million next year, they are symbolic of the administration's belief that it can continue to offer essential services for less money.
"The city cannot be in every business," he said. "We cannot afford it."
Mr. Giuliani's supporters said that the Mayor's plan addressed the city's real problems -- its recurring deficit because of increases in spending -- without resorting to fiscal gimmickry or one-time revenue proposals that the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins used.

HEADLINE: Taking On the Unions;
With Few Debts to Labor, Giuliani Offers Budget Plan With Cutbacks in Work Force

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York City's first Republican Mayor in a generation, swept into office last November with less support from municipal unions than any other mayor in recent memory. Most of the city's labor movement backed David N. Dinkins. The teachers remained neutral. Only the firefighters, correction officers and police rallied to Mr. Giuliani's side.
Now Mr. Giuliani has shown what it means to owe few debts to labor. For his fiscal plan makes quite clear that the new Mayor intends to force down the size of the city work force by 15,000 employees from what he calls a "historic high" and also to wrest productivity savings, new work rules and benefits concessions from the workers who remain. 
 "He's clearly targeted the municipal employee unions," said Raymond D. Horton of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group, "and he's constructing a political strategy designed to put as much pressure on them as possible."
Mr. Giuliani's $31.2 billion budget plan offers most of the unions a series of hard choices. They can agree to accept severance packages as buyouts for up to 8,000 workers that Mr. Giuliani wants off the payroll by July, or face layoffs. They can make $200 million in benefits concessions, or face more layoffs. They can agree to millions of dollars in productivity savings -- everything from smaller bridge repair crews, to fewer guards in some parts of the prison system, to longer workdays and routes for sanitation workers -- or take more layoffs.
Posing the severance package as the alternative to layoffs, Mr. Giuliani said, "We're very hopeful that this will work. We think this is the best way to do it. We think it's the most humane way to do it. But if the end result is that we have to do it the other way, I'm prepared to do it."
 
An Uncomfortable Position
 Mayors have talked tough like this before. In the depths of the city's recession, Mr. Dinkins made threats to lay off 11,000 workers, and ultimately in one year the work force did drop by about 12,000, but only about half of that reduction came through layoffs.
But such actions always left Mayor Dinkins in an uncomfortable position, caught between the constraints of a tight budget and the debts owed his allies in the labor movement.
As soon as times got better, the city staffing levels climbed up again. And Mr. Dinkins was generous at the bargaining table. He negotiated a high -- and widely criticized -- wage settlement with the teachers in 1990. And in 1993, despite tough talk of productivity, he reached a settlement with a coalition of the city's largest nonuniformed municipal unions that granted a modest wage without winning any direct productivity gains or work-rule changes.
Mr. Giuliani has made clear that he is a different man with a different constituency and agenda. Though he promised to minimize service reductions, he has no ideological or political commitment to expansive government. Yesterday he made impassioned arguments that the city work force must shrink, that New York City employs more workers than the states of California and New York.
Even as he called for layoffs, he also proposed nearly $800 million in tax reductions by the end of the fiscal year of 1998, a move he said would assure that the city did not have the revenues to allow the work force to creep up again.
While he urged the unions yesterday to negotiate with him and to choose productivity gains and cooperation, Mr. Giuliani has signaled in many ways that he would stand up to a confrontation. He often cites Philadelphia's Mayor, Edward G. Rendell, as a model. And Mr. Rendell is best known for staring down his once powerful unions and winning concessions despite a brief strike.
 
'On the Backs of City Workers'
 Some of the unions yesterday indicated that they saw the budget plan as a virtual declaration of war. "Especially when you look at proposals as they reflect on our colleagues in the Sanitation Department, I think this is being balanced on the backs of city workers," said Arthur Cheliotes, president of Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, which represents administrators throughout the city government.
And union members expressed frustration that Mr. Giuliani did not seem to appreciate their work.
"He just doesn't understand what we do," said Nicholas D. West, an assistant principal at A. Philip Randolph High School in Harlem, responding to Mr. Giuliani's call to cut the administrative staff of the school system by more than half. "He is advocating reducing the number of administrators and support people in the schools, but he just doesn't understand how much that will hamper meeting the needs of the students. It's just not a good idea."
A sanitation worker saw in Mr. Giuliani, the Federal prosecutor turned Mayor, a deep-seated bias against all city workers except those in law enforcement. "For him, it's easier to get on the Sanitation Department's case than the police," said Charles Amoraso, a sanitation worker, speaking at a department garage in Maspeth, Queens. "If I were a politician, I'd do the same thing."
 
'Too Much at Stake'
 Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said the Mayor was inviting a confrontation by calling publicly for vast concessions and changes in working conditions that challenged the existing contracts. "He's saying to hell with your contract," said Mr. Hill, who heads the city's largest municipal union. "He can't operate this way. We won't allow it. There's too much at stake."
A confrontation between Mr. Giuliani and the unions does pose some risks to him. If Mr. Giuliani is forced to turn to layoffs, the work-force cuts could be less controllable under union rules, leading to even more noticeable reductions in city services. It is also not clear how long New Yorkers would endure, say, a garbage strike without blaming the Mayor.
But Mr. Giuliani's financial plan presents at least as much of a challenge to the municipal unions and a test of how much clout they still have. The fiery personalities and iron-fisted bargainers who reigned in the 1960's and 1970's are long gone.
Would the municipal unions' many allies in the City Council support them if it meant the Council had to call for tax increases to save jobs? Would workers follow union leaders if confrontations loomed? In a time when unions are being forced to give back hard-won gains at bargaining tables across the country, would New Yorkers sympathize if the municipal unions didn't bow to the same trend?
The first test could come with the sanitation workers' union, which has been working without a contract since October 1991 and has been singled out for many of the layoffs and productivity gains in Mr. Giuliani's budget plan, even threatened with privatizing of routes in future years.
Yesterday, Peter Scarlatos, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, was being cautious. "The biggest thing is sitting at the table," he said. "I'm not getting overexcited now. I'm ready to sit down and talk."

Special interests on the attack. In this case, they're beekeepers.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
TO bee or not to bee: That was the question facing Congress last fall when it dropped subsidies for domestic honey producers, sacrificing the most easily lampooned symbol of profligacy in the Federal budget. But do not underestimate the political tenacity of America's 2,000 commercial beekeepers. They are now asking the White House to substitute hidden subsidies, collected directly from consumers, for the traditional kind dunned from taxpayers.
The question is whether President Clinton will risk the wrath of E. (Kika) de la Garza, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and loyal friend of the honey makers, by saying no. The more important question, perhaps, is whether Washington can stand up to special interests, or will simply pass the buck. 
 Uncle Sam got interested in bees during World War II, when beeswax was in military demand and everything sweet was considered a morale booster for the boys at the front. After the war the habit stuck: Congress enacted a price support system to insure a steady supply of the bee's precious bodily fluid. Happily, the program cost little since the free market price of honey rarely fell below the support price.
That changed in the 1980's, however, with the arrival of lower-priced imports. From 1980 through 1988, Washington spent $525 million buying up surpluses -- and in the process warehoused enough honey to supply the nation for two full years in the event of nuclear war. Since then, both the cost of the program and the embarrassment of the Federal honey glut have been eased by a combination of higher world prices and a shift from price guarantees to direct subsidies.
The world may not long remember the fate of the honey money: The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the total savings from eliminating supports would amount to a mere $60 million over the next five years. But the small number of beneficiaries and the frivolous nature of the product made the program a perfect foil for politicians seeking to prove that this time they meant business about deficits. After the requisite jokes about sweet deals that stung the taxpayers, Congress axed all honey subsidies from the 1994 budget.
That, however, is not the end of the story. On Sept. 20, 1993, President Clinton wrote to Representative de la Garza to make amends. In the letter he acknowledged the industry's "grave concerns" about the adverse impact of honey imports from China, inviting an investigation of same. And last month the United States International Trade Commission (a Federal agency with close ties to Congress) recommended that the beekeepers be given relief under a cold war statute allowing the President to reduce imports from centrally planned economies that "disrupt" the American market.
Just how much the stiff tariffs recommended by the commission majority would affect average honey prices is unclear since China shares the world export market with Mexico and Argentina. What is clear, though, is that China is the world's low-cost supplier of the lower-grade honey going to industrial uses for products like cookies, breakfast cereals and cough drops. And the American companies that process industrial honey are worried that in the face of prices raised by tariffs, buyers will switch to corn- or fruit-based sweeteners.
Economists have broader complaints. For one thing, tariffs are widely seen as a more pernicious way to aid domestic producers than direct subsidies because they distort prices and production, rather than simply transferring money from one pocket to another. For another, tariffs appear in no Government budget and are thus far less likely to be scrutinized in the future than taxpayer outlays. "If we are going to help honey producers at all, surely subsidies are better than import protection," concluded Lynn Daft, a Washington consultant who served as President Jimmy Carter's adviser on agriculture.
Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics offers yet another concern. The logic behind Section 406 protection, he notes, is to prevent state-dominated industries from trashing their American counterparts. But there is little reason to believe that China's beekeepers are dancing to Beijing's tune. Last year the United States Department of Agriculture's representative in the Chinese capital reported that "the general honey policy of the central Government is to let the market set the price."
Hence the impact of restricting imports of Chinese honey could be perverse, at least from the perspective of foreign policy. "It would invite China to impose bureaucratic controls," Mr. Hufbauer said -- controls that set back the process of decentralizing the Chinese economy and weakening the power of its authoritarian elite.
President Clinton is not obliged to follow the trade commission's recommendation; he could just decide to leave the bees out in the cold. But don't bet on it. As Representative Harris W. Fawell, an Illinois Republican, put it during the Congressional debate: "If one dies and goes to heaven and wants to come back to earth and have eternal life, come back as a Federal program."

HEADLINE: Japan Socialists Threaten to Quit Coalition in Dispute Over Taxes

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa pushed his governing coalition toward collapse today by announcing that he would only reduce income taxes to revive Japan's stalled economy if the cuts were offset by an even larger increase in sales taxes in three years.
While the decision touched on arcane issues related to tax policy, it quickly created a political crisis that could affect Washington as well as Japan. 
 The Socialists, the largest party in the coalition, have fought the sales tax increase and threatened to quit the Government this morning. It was the second time in a week that policy differences have left the frail coalition divided.
The Government was forced to reconsider its decision only hours later because of the Socialsts' threat. "If the Socialists' stance stays unchanged today, I am afraid the situation will be serious for the ruling coalition," said Masayoshi Takemura, the chief Cabinet secretary, who added that the Prime Minister might still be flexible.
 
Victory for Finance Ministry
 The announcement was a major victory for the bureaucrats of the Finance Ministry, who with conservatives in the Government were the principal backers of the sales tax increase. They say that without it the Government will run huge budget deficits.
The Socialists favor a big income tax cut to try to jump-start the Japanese economy, which is caught in its worst recession in the post-war era. Mr. Hosokawa said this morning that he wanted to reduce income, business and local taxes by the equivalent of $55 billion. Some of those reductions would be retroactive to Jan. 1. That would be part of a larger package to revive the economy, including as much as $82.5 billion in increased public works spending and low-cost Government loans to businesses.
But Mr. Hosokawa said the sales tax would be increased by an even larger amount, beginning in 1997. The Socialists adamantly oppose such a big increase, arguing that it will fall disproportionately on salaried workers, whose overall tax burden has been climbing in recent years.
The Clinton Administration has also argued for a big tax cut to stimulate the economy, since rapid economic expansion would attract more imports and reduce Japan's huge trade surplus. Some American officials have suggested that a coordinated increase in the sales tax might negate the positive effects of the income tax cut and thus do little to adjust the trade surplus.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen issued a statement in Washington describing the proposal as "a step in the right direction," but he also said he needed more details before making a final judgment.
 
A Tax by Any Other Name
 Mr. Hosokawa said the current 3 percent sales tax would climb to 7 percent, as of April 1, 1997, and be renamed a national welfare tax.
The name change was intended to convey the idea that the tax was needed to cover some of the growing social welfare costs the Government is facing as Japanese society ages. The percentage of the population 65 years or older is expected to more than double, from 12.1 percent in 1990 to 25.5 percent in 2020, according to Finance Ministry figures.
However, Mr. Hosokawa refused a Socialist demand that he write into the law a clause requiring that all the tax be used for social welfare programs, such as pensions and health care. That means, in effect, that the money would be used for whatever the Finance Ministry deems appropriate.
The increase is expected to generate the equivalent of about $73.4 billion a year in new revenues. That would more than offset the proposed reductions in income taxes.
 
Bureaucrats Win Again
 Mr. Hosokawa had hinted at times in recent months that he was willing to reduce income taxes as a way of igniting the economy without the sales tax increase, because individual consumers would benefit most from such a policy. But this morning's announcement made it clear that the Finance Ministry had won.
Tomiichi Murayama, the Socialist Party chairman, said his party was considering pulling its six ministers from Mr. Hosokawa's Cabinet and voting against the new tax proposals when they come up in Parliament. That could force the whole Cabinet to resign.
Just last week the Government was also threatened over the divisive issue of reforming the electoral and campaign financing laws. In that case, too, the Socialists lost the struggle, but decided to remain in the coalition in hopes of winning the tax battle.
"I told the Prime Minister that his administration should include wording in the new tax legislation that would obligate the Government to use all the revenue from the new tax for expenditures related to welfare," Mr. Murayama said. "However, the Premier turned a deaf ear to our party's request."

HEADLINE: Report Finds Pills Cost More in U.S. Than Britain

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Top-selling prescription drugs typically cost much more in the United States than in Britain, where drug company profits are limited as part of a national health insurance program, the General Accounting Office said in a report today.
Drug company executives challenged many of the findings, but members of Congress cited the report as evidence that the Government should impose some restraints on drug prices, as President Clinton has proposed. 
 The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said factory prices for 77 frequently dispensed drugs were 60 percent higher in this country than in Britain in 1992. For 47 of these drugs, it said, prices in the United States were more than twice as high as those in Britain.
Auditors and economists from the accounting agency said the price differentials were smaller for new drugs than for older products. In bringing new drugs to market in recent years, manufacturers say they have tried to set similar prices in all the industrialized countries.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, said Britain's experience showed it was possible to have lower drug prices and a "thriving research-based pharmaceutical industry." Mr. Waxman, a California Democrat, requested the study.
Drugs in the study were chosen from a list of the 200 prescription products most frequently dispensed in the United States in 1991. The auditors focused on 77 products available in the same form and strength in Britain and the United States. They compared prices charged by manufacturers to wholesalers for drugs distributed to consumers at retail pharmacies. These consumers account for most prescriptions but generally do not benefit from discounts, the report said.
The main yardstick used by the accounting agency did not measure the effect of drug discounts available to big buyers like hospitals, some health maintenance organizations and mail-order pharmacies. Nor did it measure the effect of generic drugs, the low-cost copies of brand-name products whose patents have expired.
But the investigators concluded that the large differences between American and British drug prices "persisted even after accounting for generic drugs and manufacturers' discounts."
In an interview last month, Dr. Sheldon G. Gilgore, chairman of G. D. Searle & Company, who is also chairman-elect of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, said: "The fact of the matter is, prices in the United States are higher than in the United Kingdom or France or Germany or Italy or Spain. We cannot deny that they are higher. But you cannot fuel the research engine that discovers and develops new drugs on the profits that you make in countries outside the U.S."
Joseph E. Smith, a vice president of the Warner-Lambert Company, said the G.A.O. had overstated the differences in American and British prices because it did not take into account the discounts available here.
The accounting agency said there were generic equivalents for 21 of the 77 drugs in its study. Even if American consumers purchased generic drugs whenever available and British consumers purchased brand-name products in all cases, the study said, the market basket of 77 drugs would still cost 50 percent more in the United States than in Britain.
Likewise, the auditors said, when they took account of the discounts available to hospitals and H.M.O.'s, they found that manufacturers' prices were, on the average, still 51 percent higher here than in Britain.

HEADLINE: North Korea Threatens to End A-Arms Talks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 2

 BODY:
North Korea threatened today to break off its talks with the United States over nuclear inspections, asserting that the Clinton Administration had shown in recent days that the talks were only "a pretense for strangling" the Government of Kim Il Sung. The statement was the latest in a series of increasingly belligerent warnings.
North Korea also said Washington's proposal to deploy Patriot anti-missile batteries in South Korea, combined with the recent visit to Seoul by R. James Woolsey, the Director of Central Intelligence, was evidence that the United States has moved to "the full-scale stage of the war preparations." 
 American and South Korean officials said they were concerned about the tone of the North Korean dispatches, which were broadcast today and also handed over to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. Some suggested that the North was trying to use the missile deployment as its newest reason for refusing go along with any detailed inspection of its nuclear installations. The North is suspected of being near construction of a nuclear weapon.
"Sometimes they are bluffing and sometimes a steady buildup in the rhetoric indicates we have a real problem on our hands," a United States official who monitors the North said today. "Frankly, this time we can't tell."
In recent days American, South Korean and Japanese officials have said they would give North Korea until Feb. 21, the start of a meeting of the I.A.E.A.'s board, to allow international inspectors to resume their visits to Yongbyon, North Korea's nuclear complex. If there is no progress by then, a senior Japanese official said today, "I think everyone is now ready to move to the United Nations Security Council for sanctions." A formal deadline has not been presented to the North.
The statement came a day after the United States Senate adopted a non-binding resolution urging President Clinton to take a harder line with the North. North Korea has not yet responded to that resolution.
Only a month ago, the Administration exuded optimism about the progress it appeared to be making. In late December it struck an agreement with the North to resume high-level negotiations on the nuclear issue. At those talks the United States was to cancel its annual military exercise with South Korea and offer diplomatic and economic incentives to the North. In return, North Korea was to agree to regular nuclear inspections.
But so far Mr. Kim's Government has refused to agree to inspections, which are intended to make sure that no nuclear material has been diverted to military projects since inspectors were last permitted in last summer. The automatic cameras and other security devices at seven sites in Yongbyon have run out of film and batteries.
In its statement today, North Korea's Foreign Ministry denounced the I.A.E.A., accusing it of conspiring with Washington to force North Korea into far more intrusive inspections.
The international agency, saying its reputation for thoroughness and integrity is at stake, has refused to negotiate over the terms of its inspections. "There is a fundamental disagreement between their side and what we heard from the United States" on inspections, said David Kyd, the agency's spokesman. "We have told them that a limited inspection is not enough. We can't just look over the fence."

HEADLINE: Disney Seals Times Square Theater Deal

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company, the giant of family entertainment, will introduce Mickey, Goofy and lots of surprises to a street with a reputation as perhaps the nation's sleaziest.
Government leaders immediately hailed Disney's announcement yesterday that it will rehabilitate and reopen the landmark New Amsterdam Theater in September 1996 as a major push to reinvigorate the long-stalled effort to revitalize 42d Street in mid-Manhattan. They promise other announcements soon. 
 "If a match were made in heaven, this is it," said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who predicted that Disney's move would "jump start" the redevelopment project.
"You're going to get rid of the filth," said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who called 42d Street a sewer. "It's the beginning of a whole new era."
The deal, which has been under negotiation for several months, calls for the city and state to lend Disney $21 million at 3 percent interest, and to receive an undisclosed share of the profits. Disney has agreed to spend $8 million of its own to renovate the 10-story Art Nouveau theater.
 
Other Companies Express Interest
 Vincent Tese, chairman and chief executive of the State Urban Development Corporation, said many other entertainment companies had expressed interest. Asked whether one of them was Time Warner, he called that suggestion "not far from wrong." He said talks with Tussaud's Group of London to install a 1990's version of its wax museum were moving rapidly.
"By this time next year, all the deals will have been made," he said. "Forty-second Street has the potential to be a major, major tourist attraction in the United States."
Already the Victory Theater, across 42d Street from the entrance to the New Amsterdam, is being readied for opening as a children's theater, the first of nine historic theaters to be renovated. A New York Information Center with the latest on sightseeing tips, theater openings, museum exhibitions and the like will be created from space in two or three of the theaters.
But the Disney move has rekindled a debate that has simmered since the collapsed market for office space led a private developer in 1992 to delay plans for four huge new towers. The developer has invested more than $250 million to retain the right to build when the real-estate market allows. This money has already been spent on buying condemned buildings, among other things.
 
Some Doubt Need for Towers
 But some people contend that the Disney and other deals have now made the towers, which depend on city and state tax abatements whenever built, unnecessary.
"Today's reality is that you can do it without the office towers," said Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society. "There is no more powerful magnet than Disney for bringing other entertainment uses to 42d Street."
In an interview, Mr. Tese strongly disagreed, saying, "It's a little absurd to say we don't need them anymore and they can leave. We have not only a contractual obligation, but a moral obligation."
Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, said the office towers and entertainment work together because office workers supply more audiences for theaters and more customers for retail stores. "This is a step in the process," she said.
But Mr. Tese did point out the Disney deal gave him leverage in negotiations with the developer. He said the developer had declined to sign a final deal because of disputes over a number of issues, including signs that the state wants to require on the buildings. He said the developer has until August to make a deal before losing its right to build on the sites, which are owned by the state.
The developer, Times Square Center Associates, a private real-estate partnership of Park Tower Realty and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, said through a spokesman that it "has invested substantial sums in the project, has agreed to do an interim plan and hopes to finalize its agreement shortly."
 
Out of the 'Cocoon'
 Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief executive of Disney, appeared to enjoy being treated as a hero in his hometown, calling the occasion "a thrill." For all their enthusiasm, however, the various dignitaries declined to wear the Mickey Mouse ties that Mr. Eisner had thoughtfully supplied.
Mr. Eisner said Disney was moving beyond the concept of people sitting on couches being entertained by increasingly sophisticated electronic systems, "a cocoon in the house," in his phrase. He said, "We are going to go the other way and bring people outside of their homes and be part of an urban community."
The New Amsterdam, which opened in 1903, has a luxurious interior of marble and classical friezes that was legendary even by the standards of the Broadway theaters of the time. The roof garden was turned into the Midnight Frolic supper club by Florenz Ziegfeld in 1915. In 1937 the theater was converted for movies and used that way until 1982.
"It is the crown jewel of all the theaters in the city," said Laurie Beckelman, chairwoman of the Landmarks Commission. "Nothing was left to chance -- here was fantasy all around you."
 
Promises of Assistance
 Disney's live shows at the New Amsterdam will include both adaptations of Disney movies and original productions for the stage.
But Mr. Eisner specified that Disney could not have proceeded without the public loans. Both Mr. Tese and John S. Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, said similar packages would probably be available for other companies.
Already, owners of Broadway theaters have won a promise from city and state governments to assist in refurbishing their houses, though details remain to be worked out. Ron Silver, who as president of Actor's Equity Association was active in that battle, hailed the Disney deal yesterday as "a much-needed public-private initiative to revitalize our commercial theater."
Preliminary studies indicate that the renovation could generate 490 jobs, $16.8 million in wages and salaries and $1.8 million in city and state tax revenues. After the theater opens, the studies suggest, 385 jobs will be generated, 185 of them at the theater.
Total economic activity from the theater is estimated at $53.1 million annually, plus money spent for shopping and dining nearby. Projections show the theater generating $4.1 million a year in city and state taxes.
Ms. Beckelman called the New Amsterdam "one of the most astounding monuments we've ever built to entertainment."

HEADLINE: Vietnam and U.S. Businesses Eager to Trade

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Welcoming reports that the 19-year-old United States trade embargo against Vietnam is nearly over, Hanoi joined with American businesses today in predicting a surge of new investment in a nation that is growing rapidly economically but still suffering from the effects of the Vietnam War.
In Hanoi, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said it had not received any formal notification from Washington, but the Government's chief spokesman said in a statement that the lifting of the trade embargo would be "good news not only for the two peoples -- the Vietnamese and the Americans -- but also for the world community." 
 "We welcome American companies and companies from all countries that want to do business and invest in Vietnam," the spokesman, Ho The Lan, said.
Reports that President Clinton would lift the embargo within the next few days circulated quickly in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, with Vietnam Government officials and the representatives of American corporations sharing faxes and telexes carrying the latest news and rumors from Washington.
The reaction to the reports from American businesses was one of relief that they would finally be able to enter one of the world's fastest-growing markets, one that their Asian and European competitors have been able to exploit for years.
As Communism was collapsing in Eastern Europe in the late 1980's, Hanoi abandoned Marxist economic theory and embraced the free market. Although Vietnam is still regarded as a poor country, the economy has enjoyed something of a boom since the economic switch, growing last year alone by 8 percent.
"This will be an excellent development for the United States and for Vietnam," said James Rockwell, managing director of Vatico, a Hanoi-based consulting concern that represents the Chrysler Corporation and other large American companies who are expected to seek a market in Vietnam.
"The timing is good," Mr. Rockwell said. "The Vietnamese like and respect Americans. I don't know why. It's just a fact. They see us as fair and trustworthy and they want to do business with us. But if the embargo had gone on another six months to a year, there would have been trouble. Americans would have been very, very small players in Vietnam."
The Hanoi representative of Citibank, Frank Hawke, said that while some American investors seemed to believe that they had already "missed the boat" because so many competitors had already moved into Vietnam, the truth is that "there are lots of boats out there -- some of them missed, some of them not."
"The Vietnamese are emphasizing key infrastructure areas such as petrochemicals, telecommunications, transportation and power generation, all areas where U.S. companies excel," Mr. Hawke said.
 
Embargo Began in 1975
 The United States imposed an economic embargo on Vietnam in 1975, when the American-backed Government of South Vietnam was toppled by the invading North Vietnamese Army. Washington has since used the embargo as a way of persuading the Vietnamese to cooperate in the effort to determine the fate of more than 2,200 Americans missing from the war.
As Hanoi has expanded its cooperation to account for the missing, the United States has gradually eased the embargo, most recently last July, when President Clinton lifted an American veto that had blocked billions of dollars in loans and aid from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
While American corporations are now allowed to open offices in Vietnam and to bid on large infrastructure projects underwritten by the World Bank and the I.M.F., they are still barred under the embargo from selling their products in Vietnam and from conducting other types of business.
The many American products that do reach the Vietnamese market -- from Coca-Cola to Apple Computers to American Tourister luggage -- are sent in by foreign middlemen who rake off profits that would otherwise go to American manufacturers.

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
Clinton Is Still Tiptoeing Round the Vietnam Mines

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
If anyone had forgotten just how skittish Bill Clinton can be when it comes to Vietnam, there could be no better evidence than his public insistence today that he has not made up his mind on whether to lift the American embargo on Hanoi.
It has been more than a month since his top deputies signed off on a recommendation to restore trade relations with that former enemy, a step they would never have taken without a keen sense of the boss's wishes. Aides had been saying for weeks that he was moving irrevocably in that direction, and they said Tuesday and again today that there would be no turning back. 
 In addition to a vague yet pervasive sense in Washington that the embargo has lasted long enough, Mr. Clinton has been driven to this point by cold political calculation. He and his aides know a healthy economy is crucial to his political health. A healthy economy requires the creation of more jobs, and that in turn requires expanded foreign trade. So the President backed the North American Free Trade Agreement and extension of the world trade pact and he will open the potentially rich Vietnamese market to American business.
 
A Very Cautious Approach
 Still, he has moved exceedingly cautiously.
A refrain common to every White House press office is that no decision has been made until the President announces it. By today, however, when news reports quoted senior officials saying the end of the embargo was a done deal, most other administrations would have conceded the impossibility of protecting what was no longer a secret.
But Mr. Clinton's wariness of giving ammunition to those who will not forgive him for having avoided the draft in the Vietnam War era has left him determined to make no commitments until he must. Even as his aides planned quietly today for an announcement by the end of the week, Mr. Clinton stuck to his plan to line up support and assuage critics before he himself takes a public stand.
At a photo session this morning, he would say only that he would reach a decision "in the next couple of days." But later he dropped a less than subtle hint of where he was heading, noting that many prominent veterans favored ending the embargo.
The White House has long known that an announcement of an end to the embargo would infuriate the American Legion and other groups whose criticism of his conduct in the Vietnam era helped to make his path to the presidency so treacherous.
 
Soothing the Critics
 But rather than confront the issue head on, Mr. Clinton and his aides have counted on others to do it for them, relying in large part on the Senate vote last week recommending an end to the embargo to make the case to the American public.
"What's being decided now is how they do it and who meets with whom," a White House official said today of the scramble to soothe the most likely critics, who include the families of those still missing in action from the Vietnam War.
As the White House had feared, the national commander of the American Legion dispatched a letter to Mr. Clinton angrily warning that the step would amount to a betrayal of American veterans. Separately, the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Vietnam urged Mr. Clinton to postpone any decision until it could determine whether its Government had indeed made progress in providing information about missing Americans.
White House officials said tonight that Mr. Clinton was determined at least to explain to those groups the reasons for his decision before announcing it publicly.
A White House official said tonight that it was likely that Mr. Clinton would meet with some of the critics on Friday before announcing his decision on Saturday at a ceremony to be attended by veterans who support his action.
 
An Unpleasant Prospect
 What leaves his aides most anxious, of course, is the prospect that an announcement by Mr. Clinton calling an end to the embargo will call attention to the steps he took to avoid the draft and to his college-age protests against the war.
Bruce Thiesen, the American Legion national commander, did not make that point directly in his letter to Mr. Clinton. But the strong language he employed made clear that he and other critics regard the decision as one involving much more than the President's judgment on whether Vietnam has made sufficient progress in aiding the United States with information about P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s to be rewarded with restored trade ties.
"If you decide to lift the embargo this week as is rumored," Mr. Thiesen said, "you will have not only broken your promise, but you will also have betrayed the missing servicemen, their families, members of the active military services and millions of Vietnam veterans who feel very strongly about their brethren who have not been accounted for."

HEADLINE: Nominee Seeks Strategist's Role In Pentagon Job

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
In three hours of generally friendly questioning today, William J. Perry, President Clinton's nominee for Secretary of Defense, sought to portray himself as not just a talented technocrat but as a global strategist and a forceful leader, saying the United States would seek to contain North Korea's nuclear program and support Russia's economic and political reforms.
Mr. Perry, who would succeed Defense Secretary Les Aspin if confirmed, appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will vote on Thursday on whether to recommend him for confirmation. A full Senate vote is expected soon after. 
 Mr. Perry, a 66-year-old former engineering professor at Stanford University, is widely respected as a manager and an expert on high-tech issues. But some lawmakers have raised doubts about his ability to step up from his current position as Deputy Defense Secretary into the Pentagon's top job, where he would confront broader international security issues and a looming military budget crisis that could imperil the combat readiness of American forces.
In response to friendly questioning from Democrats and Republicans on the panel today, Mr. Perry gave clear and careful answers to issues ranging from America's role in international peacekeeping operations to revamping the cumbersome system the Pentagon uses to buy $50 billion in new weapons every year.
 
Quick Confirmation Predicted
 Mr. Perry won nearly universal praise in the relatively short hearing, and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the committee's chairman, predicted that the full Senate would confirm Mr. Perry by week's end.
Weighty issues aside, the nominee also flashed a glimpse of the wry humor his close friends attribute to him. "The press has observed that a principal deficiency I had for this job was being soft-spoken, and I will work very hard to overcome that problem," Mr. Perry said.
Mr. Perry, who is no stranger to the panel, noted that this appearance was his fourth before the committee for confirmation -- twice for Pentagon jobs in the Carter Administration and again for his current post. But today he clearly tried to dispel any notion that he is a novice on foreign affairs or broader leadership challenges.
Much of the hearing focused on North Korea's nuclear program, and Mr. Perry reiterated the Administration's aim to encourage North Korea to comply with international monitoring of its nuclear sites. Most American intelligence analysts say there is a better than even chance that North Korea already has nuclear weapons.
 
Nuclear Arms Race Feared
 "We are very concerned about the possibility that North Korea has even one nuclear weapon," Mr. Perry said, because it could set off a nuclear arms race among Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. "We see a very dangerous proliferation ahead of us."
Responding to what were some of the only pointed questions of the session, from Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, Mr. Perry said the United States should pursue "aggressive diplomatic means" that would use "both carrots and sticks" to persuade North Korea to negotiate inspection procedures with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Mr. Perry said he would not object to offering North Korea economic incentives to end the impasse, and added, "I'm not anxious to precipitate the use of sticks."
He said he concurred with the recommendation of Gen. Gary E. Luck, the senior American commander in South Korea, to send Patriot antimissile batteries to troops there. The President has signaled that he will send the Patriots, and Mr. Perry said the decision could be reached soon.
The nominee told the committee that he planned largely to follow the course set by Mr. Aspin, who coaxed Mr. Perry into joining the Pentagon team after Mr. Clinton's election. "It's fair to say our management styles are different because our personalities are different," Mr. Perry said. "But our philosophy and objectives are very similar."
Mr. Aspin, who resigned under pressure in December, stayed on as the President nominated Bobby Ray Inman, a retired admiral and former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. Mr. Inman withdrew last month.
 
Policy Shop Shake-Up
 Mr. Perry did identify one area for a shake-up: Mr. Aspin's vaunted policy shop, headed by Under Secretary of Defense Frank G. Wisner, that is responsible for the Pentagon's contributions to policy debates on Haiti, Bosnia and Somalia.
"We have some outstanding people in that area, but we have an ineffective organization," Mr. Perry said.
Senators also bored in on Mr. Perry's acknowledgement that the Pentagon faced a $20 billion shortfall in its long-term budget from 1996 to the year 2000, and attributed it to inflation estimates. The nominee said there was no problem in the budget for the fiscal year 1995, which the Administration will make public next week. The Pentagon will review the long-term shortfall later this year, he said.
Mr. Perry, who has founded or advised several high-technology companies and military contractors, said he had severed ties with the companies and sold stock he held in them when he became Deputy Secretary. He promised to recuse himself from any decisions involving Stanford University, where he plans to return after his Pentagon service, and a handful of small, privately owned companies.
"I have no conflicts of interest which would in any way inhibit my ability to do this job," Mr. Perry said.

France Pledges Subsidy To Aerospace Group

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The French Economy Ministry said today that it would pump two billion francs -- $341 million -- into the money-losing, state-owned aerospace group Aerospatiale.
The decision to increase the capital of Aerospatiale S.A., which has been losing money for two years because of falling commercial-aircraft orders and declining military contracts, appeared likely to renew the debate between the United states and Western Europe on subsidies in the commercial aircraft business. 
 Aerospatiale owns 37.9 percent of the European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie, a leading rival of the Boeing Company. The Clinton Administration says the subsidies give Airbus an unfair advantage.
The last time Aerospatiale received an injection of French Government money was in 1987, when the Government pumped 2.5 billion francs into the company.
Andre Bloch, a spokesman for Aerospatiale, said the company was pleased with the Government's decision. He disputed reports that Aerospatiale had asked for three billion francs, or $512 million.
 
French Rationalization
 A statement from Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery and Defense Minister Francois Leotard said: "This decision by the state will allow Aerospatiale to benefit fully from a gradual recovery in aerospace markets, notably through new projects like the Airbus A330 and the Airbus A340."
Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's chairman and chief executive, said last month that while the company had hit the "bottom of the wave" after two years of losses, he did not expect it to be profitable in 1994. In the first six months of 1993, Aerospatiale lost 870 million francs, after losing 2.38 billion francs in 1992. The company said last month that it expected to return to profitability by 1995.
The center-right Cabinet of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has suggested that it would like to privatize the company, but this notion is regarded as farfetched as long as Aerospatiale continues piling up losses.
Mr. Bloch, the Aerospatiale spokesman, said part of the new state funds would be used to reduce the company's debt, which now stands at about 13 billion francs, or $2.2 billion. The rest would be invested across the range of the company's activities to help prepare for privatization.
The Airbus A330, a large, wide-bodied, twin-engine plane that carries about 300 passengers, is a rival to Boeing's new wide-body 777. The first delivery of the new Airbus was made in December to Air Inter, the French domestic airline, part of the Air France Group. But the plane has been grounded because the main landing gear failed several times to retract after takeoff. The first A340, a long-haul, four-engine plane, was delivered to Lufthansa a year ago.
The statement by the ministers underscored that the French Government is providing money to help Airbus programs that are directly competitive with Boeing and other United States aircraft manufacturers. Airbus says Boeing and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation benefit from indirect subsidies in the form of Pentagon and NASA contracts.
The argument between Airbus and Boeing was eased by an agreement reached in 1992 limiting both direct and indirect subsidies, but bickering has continued. Last year President Clinton called on European governments to "quit subsidizing" Airbus.
John Dern, a spokesman for Boeing, said, "Any infusion of state aid must conform with the 1992 agreement." The accord said direct government aid for any aircraft program must be limited to 33 percent of development costs, and indirect support held to 4 percent of the sales of any aircraft company.
Aerospatiale also builds missiles and satellites, assembles the Ariane satellite launcher and is a partner in a European helicopter concern.

HEADLINE: In Overhaul Effort Clinton Seeks 'One Stop' Assistance Centers for the Jobless

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Calling for a major restructuring of the nation's unemployment and welfare systems, President Clinton said today that he would ask Congress to consolidate scores of benefit programs and create "one-stop-shopping" centers where unemployed workers could pick up assistance checks and receive job training and placement help.
Courting an audience of about 300 job-training specialists and graduates of some of the nation's most innovative jobs programs, the President smiled and joked, hoarsely, with several people who shared stories about moving from the unemployment lines back into the work force. He then dismissed the existing system, saying it was weighted down with "yesterday's programs" and needed an overhaul. 
 "The welfare office ought to be a work office," Mr. Clinton said. "It ought to be the job-training office."
The President pledged to eliminate at least 100 Government programs and make cuts in at least 300 more to "squeeze the money" needed to retrain unemployed workers and move them toward new jobs in business and industry. He said he would propose these cuts in the budget that will go to Congress on Monday. But Labor Department officials said they did not expect the budget to include specific linkages between changes in the welfare program and any overhaul of the unemployment system.
Proposed cuts are likely to focus on job-training plans that cover only small segments of the work force, short-term training that the Labor Department says has not helped disadvantaged young people, and a jobs program that gives tax credits to employers. Labor Secretary Robert B.. Reich has dismissed such credits, which took effect in 1982, as a misguided plan that rewards employers for hiring workers they would likely hire anyway.
Warning that welfare itself will need to be changed, Mr. Clinton today expanded on a refrain from his State of the Union Message, saying the Government must replace hand-out programs with local programs that can find jobs, provide training and then get jobless people back to work.
 
Reich Commands the Stage
 The President's comments came at the close of a daylong conference and panel presentation in which Secretary Reich combined the stage skills of Oprah Winfrey, the evangelical fervor of Buckminster Fuller and the oratory of a small-town preacher to sell the message that the nation can stop a "downward trajectory" among the unemployed only by combining aid with hope.
Despite a general brightening of the employment picture, which has included the creation of 1.6 million jobs in the last year, "we are not out of the woods at all," Mr. Reich said.
The conference, held to showcase Mr. Reich's plan to transform the unemployment system and provide a human frame for the President's proposed changes, dwelt on the successes achieved by several privately backed job programs. Those that work, several panelists said, combine practical job training with essentials like baby-sitting, transportation, letter- and resume-writing and, sometimes, a helping hand with the purchase of a pair of shoes or a new outfit to wear to job interviews.
Mr. Reich began the program with a catalogue of failures. Using charts and a CBS News television segment that dubbed the unemployment system a "Byzantine nightmare" he outlined an unwieldy if well-intentioned program that had grown too large and too complex to work.
"Everybody," he said, "is caught in the same web."
To illustrate those points, Mr. Reich picked out panelists and members of the audience, as members of his staff moved up and down the aisles with microphones while video cameras caught the speakers' slightest facial expressions.
 
Job Success in Louisville
 Turning to a panelist who had lost a $26,000-a-year job and then found herself unable to support her family, the Labor Secretary said: "Now, let me be clear about this. How much time did you have before you lost your job?"
The woman thought a moment and then said with a shrug, "About 60 seconds."
Mr. Reich rocked forward and then lifted his microphone to reply: "Wow. A whole 60 seconds so you could formulate your strategy."
Both the second panel and a third one presided over by the President dwelt on programs that work.
Alma Willis, a 31-year-old clinic worker who was helped by a Louisville, Ky., program called Job Link, said she lost her car, her telephone and almost her house before finding help.
"I had a problem," Ms. Willis said. "My husband wouldn't let us go onto food stamps. But I couldn't qualify if we weren't on food stamps, so I went behind his back."
Once in the program, she said, staff members provided her with a telephone, helped her write letters of application and even bought her a dress. She found a job after telling the clinic staff she would work without pay for a month, just to prove that she could do the job.
She did not have to do that. "They said they really liked my letter," Ms. Willis told the audience. "Now, I'm missing two days of work to be here. And they said that was O.K. But I had to be here. I think this is really fantastic."

HEADLINE: Scam Artists Turning Cold Into Profits

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Feb. 2

 BODY:
With icy Arctic air threatening to make this one of the coldest winters on record, state consumer protection officials warned today that a variety of scam artists were at work, including bogus oil-burner repairmen who prey on the elderly.
In the last few weeks, officials said, several young men posing as oil company repairmen have approached elderly homeowners on Long Island, entered their basements, taken apart their heating-oil burners and demanded cash in advance for unnecessary repairs. 
 The bogus repairmen have also been helping themselves to pocketbooks, loose cash and other items in the homes of their victims, all of whom are 80 years old or older, said Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board.
"These men are predators, preying on innocent consumers, and they seem to have a special affinity for senior citizens," Mr. Kessel said.
 
Call Dealer First, State Says
 "If someone at the door says they have come to service your heating system, we recommend that you don't open your door unless you call up your oil dealer and confirm the repairs are legitimate," he said.
Mr. Kessel said the scheme was this winter's worst example of unscrupulous people's taking advantage of customers as a result of the cold weather. He said his office was also checking on complaints about price gouging for rock salt and antifreeze, and excessive charges by plumbers to repair frozen or burst pipes.
In Connecticut, consumer protection officials said they had been flooded this winter by complaints from automobile owners whose car batteries failed and who were then told by mechanics that they needed to replace not only the battery but several other parts.
Despite such complaints, customers are receiving a break in one area. A generous supply of home heating oil has served to keep prices relatively steady, said Kevin Rooney, executive director of the Oil Heat Institute of Long Island.
 
Oil Supply Is No Problem
 He said this was the case throughout the New York metropolitan area, where the price of fuel delivered by a full-service dealer has remained at $1.14 a gallon.
"Even with the increase in demand, the supply has never been a problem," he said. "And if you look at the entire heating season, we tend to forget the fact that October, November and early December were actually warmer than normal."
And since more people are staying at home keeping warm by the radiator, there are fewer drivers on the road. As a result, the American Automobile Association reports a lower demand for gasoline. This in turn has driven gasoline prices down.
The association says prices for self-serve regular unleaded gasoline averaged $1.06 a gallon nationwide on January 19, compared with $1.10 a gallon a year ago. The auto club says that when inflation is taken into account, gasoline has not been this cheap in 20 years.
 
Flowing From Siberia
 Winter, however, is far from over, and the colder-than-average weather is expected to continue through February, said Lee Grenci, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. "And February is traditionally a fairly active month."
"Right now, the pattern still continues to be air flowing from Siberia, across the North Pole and Canada and into the continental United States," Mr. Grenci said.
"We expect to experience another big blast of Arctic air beginning in the middle of next week, and it could rival the last record outbreak," he said.
This morning's lows ranged from 3 degrees Fahrenheit in White Plains to 17 degrees at La Guardia Airport.
Mr. Grenci said that the figures were not yet in for January, but that preliminary indications were that when temperatures and snowfall were combined, "it may rank as one of the coldest, if not the worst January on record."

HEADLINE: Global Issue By China

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
China issued $1 billion of its first global bonds yesterday, and they were snapped up as analysts endorsed the country's economic reform efforts.
"The People's Republic of China's borrowing is a signal that they are moving more toward integration of the world economy," one bond market participant said. 
 The 10-year bonds, guaranteed by the Chinese Government, were selling well in the United States, Europe and Asia, according to a Wall Street official who co-managed the offering with Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 6.5 percent bonds were priced to yield 6.583 percent, or 85 basis points more than 10-year United States Treasury securities. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent. Proceeds will be used to finance infrastructure projects and other Chinese Government spending.
Fitch Investors Service rated the bonds investment grade, at A-, while the Standard & Poor's Corporation assigned a BBB rating.

HEADLINE: Havana Journal;
On the Street, Cubans Fondly Embrace Capitalism

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA, Jan. 27

 BODY:
Less than a year into major economic changes that have opened the way for foreign investment and freed many Cubans to work for themselves, life in this city is being transformed by a new ethic: the frantic search for dollars.
Although Cuba's Communist leadership has often sought to rein in the changes, repeatedly reminding the people that it has not chosen capitalism as a solution to the country's grave economic problems, almost everywhere one looks these days private enterprise is filling voids left by an exhausted Government. 
 In special shops once reserved for diplomats, Cubans with dollars earned in small private businesses or sent by relatives abroad line up to buy basic imported goods, from bath soap to over-the-counter medicines, that failing Government enterprises can no longer supply.
Although these shops are owned by the state, and therefore are not examples of private enterprise, echoes of capitalism can be heard in the hum of activity around them.
Each of the diplo-tiendas, as the special stores are known, has spawned an outdoor market where, from the paid bicycle parking lot and carwashes to the fevered trading in home-grown produce, clothing and handicrafts, Cubans who have abandoned Government jobs now fend for themselves.
 
Embargo Limits Americans
 While capitalism is most evident in the street-corner flowering of petty commerce, Havana's biggest moves toward it involve foreign investors. At the International Center of Havana, a private business consulting concern that opened last fall, each month brings a handful of new European or Latin American companies hoping to get in on the ground floor of the transformation of a Cuban economy with enormous needs but also considerable potential.
Because of a 33-year-old United States embargo on trade with Cuba, which was recently toughened to prevent even foreign affiliates from doing business with the country, American companies have been limited to informational missions.
"Things here are changing month by month," said Arturo Rodriguez, the Cuban director of the center and a former economics professor, referring to Cuba's economy and business climate. "Sometimes it can seem like watching a television serial. Each episode closes leaving you in suspense until the next week's show."
Foreign business people here say the most important changes are in the attitudes of Cuban officials toward international investment.
"When I came here in 1990, things were still very closed and officials looked askance at foreign business people with the idea that they had come to exploit the country," said Carlos Lluna, a Spaniard whose company, Intectur Holding, is involved in sectors ranging from computer consulting to construction. "Today, it is almost a complete turnabout. The Cubans are showing enthusiasm toward us, and reaching agreements on terms has become vastly easier."
 
'We Need Partners'
 The Cuban Government refuses to give the volume of foreign investment in the country, saying only that there are currently 120 joint ventures with foreign companies and that more are being signed by the month.
"The investments which meet our needs are the ones we will greet," said Reynaldo Taladrid, deputy minister of the state committee that oversees new private investment in Cuba. "We need partners and we need foreign exchange."
But even as they have opened the door to foreign capital, Cuban officials, fearful that things may be getting out of hand, have recently stepped up warnings that the Communist Party leadership, far from embracing capitalism, intends to retain a Communist economy.
At a year-end session of the National Assembly at which the Government pulled back from some of the changes that allowed Cubans to work for themselves, President Fidel Castro made this point energetically, calling his feeling for capitalism "a loathing."
On the street, this ambivalence has meant increasingly halting steps in opening up new sectors of the economy to Cuban entrepreneurs. Five months ago the Government began to reverse a 1978 decision that nationalized virtually all economic activity in the country by allowing practitioners of dozens of small trades, from tire patchers to restaurateurs, to set up their own businesses.
The response, so enthusiastic that it caused serious absentee problems in state jobs and clogged downtown streets with petty merchants, persuaded the National Assembly to pare down the list of authorized trades. Each afternoon on the streets of central Havana the police can now be seen rounding up those believed to be engaged in unauthorized activities.
 
A Pragmatic Approach
 Experts in Cuban economic matters say the hesitation in opening up the economy reflects a continuing debate among leaders over how to steer the economy out of a crisis caused by the sudden disappearance of more than 80 percent of its foreign trade, brought on by the collapse of the Soviet Union and Communist governments in Eastern Europe.
"There is agreement among the leadership that things must change, but that they must not change in a disordered way," said Pedro Montreal, an economist with the Center for the Study of the Americas, a Cuban research group. "There is a good deal of uncertainty about the future shape of the economy. There are all kinds of proposals going around."
Ultimately, business executives and economic experts here say, Cuba will be guided by pragmatism. In November, the Government invited a two-member team from the International Monetary Fund to advise it on transformations under way in Eastern Europe and to make suggestions on Cuba's own changes.
According to the fund's summary report on the visit, the Government has concluded that without major changes the economy will inevitably collapse, "with all the accomplishments of Cuba's political and social model disappearing in the wreckage."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Transcript of Giuliani Budget Speech

 BODY:
The following are excerpts from a transcript of the budget statement by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as recorded by The New York Times:
To restore balance to city finances we need to act. We need to confront our budget crisis head on. Simply put, the crisis is this: as of July 1 New York City doesn't have enough money to meet its expenses. Our expense budget is short by $2.3 billion, arguably the biggest deficit any administration has ever inherited. 
 Without decisive action now, that gap will grow to $3.4 billion by 1998, which would be a calamity for the people of New York City. I don't intend to let this happen.

 	 	 		. . .	 	First, we're going to cut the size of government so we live within our means. For the first time since the 1970's we'll propose an expense budget that actually decreases spending in real dollars.
Second, we're going to cut taxes to attract jobs so our people can work.
Third, we're going to consolidate or eliminate city departments and introduce competition with the delivery of services as part of our program to reinvent city government.
And finally fourth, we're going to work with Governor Cuomo and the State Legislature to assure that the city gets a fair share of state revenue.
The biggest part of our budget reform, however, is payroll reduction. Right now city government is too big.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Our first sign of friendship is to join with Governor Cuomo to reduce the hotel occupancy tax, the tax that drives away tourists and depresses economic activity. I'm also calling for reduction of the commercial rent tax.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We've begun the process already of restructuring the way the city delivers services. Some confusion has arisen about this, especially in regard to city-owned hospitals.
We are not significantly reducing the spending for our hospitals and we are not closing hospitals. What we're doing instead is trying to improve the delivery of health-care services to those who can least afford it. New York City taxpayers are the most generous in providing health care for the indigent. Yet too often the service provided is grossly inadequate. Over the last 4 years, 5 of the 11 New York City acute-care hospitals have lost some accreditation or been placed on partial suspension or suspension.
 
. . .
 New York City will continue to provide service to its poor. But it will provide that service more efficiently, using good management techniques as its guide.
This is the kind of innovation and boldness I expect from all city agencies. Where agencies are performing overlapping functions, we're going to have the courage to combine them.
In other instances, the city will competitively bid out services formerly delivered only by government.
The city will also get out of businesses where the city has no rational connection. Would you believe that the city now owns and operates more than 500 gasoline stations, only a portion of which are used to fuel emergency vehicles? To start with, we're going to close at least 85 of them.

 	 	 		. . .	 	To show that responsibility starts with me at the top, I've cut the budget of the Mayor's office by more than 15 percent. I'm not asking any department or agency to take a cut as deep as the one I've imposed on the Mayor's office in this fiscal year.

 	 	 		. . .	 	This budget will allow New York City to again claim its title as business center of the world and give New Yorkers jobs and opportunities that have long eluded them.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Plan Could Curb Services, as Well as Deficit

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Although Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has promised to avoid painful service cuts in his overhaul of New York City government, the financial plan he laid out yesterday includes some bitter medicine that the average New Yorker would feel immediately, from shrinking money for museums to fewer pickups of recyclable garbage to delays in the renovations of subway stations.
And if a financial plan reflects a Mayor's vision and priorities, then Mr. Giuliani's plan envisions a hard-bitten but financially solvent city where welfare recipients are fingerprinted to avert fraud, where streets are allowed to be a little dirtier and where the city spends less to create new housing. 
 The Mayor's plan calls for cuts to programs aimed at stopping lead poisoning and controlling pests. He proposes to eliminate programs that help the indigent obtain food stamps and that provide legal advice to the disabled, people with AIDS and people facing eviction.
He also wants to stop city contributions to Headstart, a Federal program that provides day care to poor toddlers. Officials contend that because more Federal subsidies are available, day-care centers will not be hurt, but day-care advocates are worried that the extra Federal money will not materialize.
 
Dozens of Small Cuts
 These cuts would occur while the Police and Fire Departments continue to grow to record levels. The growth in the Police Department was required by a 1991 state law earmarking some property taxes.
Saying New Yorkers were overtaxed and losing jobs, Mr. Giuliani has put his faith in about $35 million in tax cuts in the fiscal year that begins in July, predicting this supply-side approach will stimulate the local economy and raise tax revenues. But in the short term, his plan includes dozens of small cuts to services that, taken together, represent a significant shift from the liberal vision of government that characterized the previous administration.
"We have got to realize we are in a different era, a different period," Mr. Giuliani said. "We have this city on the path of financial disaster."
"The economy is finished if the only growth we show is in government employment," he added.
Some of Mr. Giuliani's heaviest cuts would fall on the Board of Education, where he has proposed cutting 2,476 positions, including half of the full-time administrative employees, a quarter of assistant principals and part-time workers.
 
'A Scattershot Approach'
 Calling the school bureaucracy "bloated," the Mayor maintained that the cuts, which total $291 million, will not affect teachers or classes. But even some critics of the unwieldy bureaucracy worried that the cuts would be too deep, too fast. Yesterday opposition to the cuts was already building within the school system, which has final say over what it does with the city's contribution to its budget.
Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines said through a spokesman yesterday that the plan rests on "unrealistic assumptions and appears to take a scattershot approach to the budget problems."
Union leaders predicted that the cuts would spill over into the classroom. "There is certainly a lot of top-heaviness in the administration, but with the magnitude of this cut there is no way it will affect only administration," said Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers.
On another front, Mr. Giuliani's call for a sharp cut in the city's contribution to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's capital budget brought sharp criticism from the authority's chairman, Peter E. Stangl. The Mayor has said the city would give the authority only $250 million by 1996, a quarter of what was originally promised. The capital budget is financed through the sale of bonds, but by avoiding additional debt, the city frees up tax money for other purposes.
"While I understand that the city is facing budget problems, I cannot accept a proposal that threatens to put the T.A. back in the cycle of disinvestment that brought the system to the brink of ruin," Mr. Stangl said.
In two other cuts to the capital budget, Mr. Giuliani has imposed a moratorium on a planned reconstruction of Kings County Hospital Center, which was to cost $887 million, and has canceled a plan to spend about $250 million to build a new police academy in the Bronx, beginning in 1996. Instead, Mr. Giuliani has proposed a renovation of the old academy in Manhattan in the next fiscal year.
Another proposed reduction seemed to run counter to the Mayor's statement that he considers the arts an economic engine vital to the city's recovery. Mr. Giuliani has suggested trimming 5 percent of the $88 million budget of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which would mean the city's subsidies to more than 430 museums, theaters and other groups would decline by $4.1 million.
The reduction would affect funds for cultural programs as well as the money used to maintain the city's museums, zoos and botanical gardens. Seeking to urge greater contributions from other sources, Mr. Giuliani has said in his plan that he will restore the subsidy if the cultural institutions can raise $15 million in private donations or additional state aid.
Some advocates for the homeless were disappointed by the Mayor's plan to reduce capital spending for the Housing Preservation and Development Department's loan program that creates housing for single adults. Mr. Giuliani has cut the amount available for loans from $121 million annually to $75 million, which would mean 932 fewer units of housing would be built than projected.
In the Department of Social Services, Mr. Giuliani has also proposed several cuts that upset advocates for the poor. Among them are plans to cut a $400,000 program that finds people who are eligible for food stamps and tells them how to apply for the program, and a $1 million legal services fund for people being evicted, the disabled and people with AIDS.

Bonds Rally Despite Inflation Hints

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Long-term bond prices rallied yesterday, shrugging off possible hints of future inflation that normally hurt bonds and instead found fresh buying ahead of tomorrow's report on employment in January.
There was some speculation that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates if the report was particularly strong. But many economists doubt the Fed will act, since the employment figures are subject to revision and might be skewed by unusually cold weather in much of the country and the California earthquake. 
 A number of economists expect the Labor Department to announce that the unemployment rate in January was around 6.9 percent.
 
Increase in Rates?
 The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, indicated on Monday that the central bank would take pre-emptive steps to thwart inflation in the economy, which many bond strategists interpreted as signaling a looming increase in short-term interest rates.
Many economists expect the Fed will wait until the spring before pushing short-term rates higher, although its policy-making body -- the Federal Open Market Committee -- is scheduled to meet today.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond finished 16/32 of a point higher, or about $5 for every $1,000 in face value, while its yield fell to 6.28 percent, from 6.31 percent on Tuesday.
Economic data released yesterday included few surprises, with the index of leading economic indicators rising seven-tenths of a percent in December and new-home sales gaining 11.4 percent in December.
The signs of economic growth could have been interpreted as a signal of looming inflation, but bond traders plowed ahead and bought long-term securities.
 
Size of Auction Set
 Also, the Treasury announced the size of next week's quarterly refunding auction. The Government plans to issue $17 billion in new 3-year notes, $12 billion in 10-year notes and $11 billion in 30-year bonds.
The size of the refunding was largely within expectations.
Short-term Treasury securities were unchanged to 5/32 of a point higher, while intermediate maturities rose 6/32 to 7/32 of a point.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.57, to 1,308.76.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose three basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.06 percent. The discount rate on six-month bills rose one basis point, to 3.21 percent. And the discount rate on one-year bills also rose one basis point, to 3.44 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10413/32 , down 1/32 from Tuesday. The average yield to maturity was 5.43 percent, unchanged from Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Who's Afraid of the Fed?;
Prospect That Short-Term Rates May Rise Is Being Accepted With Absence of Alarm

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The prospect that the Federal Reserve may nudge up short-term interest rates soon has captured headlines, but the people who usually complain about such a move -- auto dealers and home builders whose customers commonly rely on borrowed money -- are uncommonly relaxed.
"If this is a tempered move to keep inflation at or below 3 percent, this is probably a positive event," said James R. Irvine, a home builder in Portland, Ore.. "I'm not saying I'm applauding this, but I don't have the concern." 
 Dave Arnolds, the general manager at the ABC Nissan car dealership in Phoenix, is equally unworried. "The rates are so low now, the confidence is so high," he said. "A quarter percent really wouldn't have a real impact."
The absence of alarm reflects a common assessment among economists and business executives that when the Fed does decide to tighten monetary policy, possibly at a meeting here on Thursday and Friday, it will increase the shortest-term interest rates that it controls, but not by much. Rates on medium-term debts, like car loans, do not vary much with the so-called Federal funds rate, for money lent overnight between banks.
The broad consensus of economists now seems to be that the Fed will raise the target for the Federal funds rate by an eighth or a quarter of a percentage point in the coming weeks or months. The Fed's target has been 3 percent since September 1992.
Andrew F. Brimmer, a former Fed governor, said that such changes in the Federal funds rate were aimed mostly at reassuring financial markets that the Fed was still fighting inflation.
"Symbolically, it's important, but it carries very little importance in the short run as far as the real economy is concerned -- it's more than smoke and mirrors, but not much more," he said.
Small increases in the Federal funds rate might actually hold down or even reduce interest rates for long-term debts, like home mortgages -- if lenders view them as a sign that the Fed will not allow a revival of inflation.
President Clinton and his aides have indicated repeatedly in recent weeks their willingness to accept a small increase in short-term rates so as to keep long-term rates low. Small increases now could also forestall the need for politically difficult increases shortly before the 1996 elections.
Such amiability has been rare in past administrations. "I cannot recall the White House and Fed ever before being so in touch and in agreement on conservative policy prescriptions," said David C. Munro, a Manhattan economist, in his daily credit market newsletter.
Over the course of many months, changes in the Federal funds rate can have some effect on the economy by limiting the availability of bank loans and raising interest rates slightly for these loans. This effect will be felt first by such borrowers as stores that take out short-term loans to stock their shelves and repay the loans with the proceeds from the sales.
Interest rates for Treasury securities with a maturity of several years, which influence car-loan rates, already appear to anticipate a change in the Federal funds rate and have not moved much. "I don't think that will have any big effect on car sales," said Martin B. Zimmerman, the chief economist at the Ford Motor Company.
Fewer and fewer Americans finance their homes with one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, choosing fixed-rate mortgages instead that are not affected by changes in the Federal funds rate, said David F. Seiders, the chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "If it's gradual then we're going to be fine," he said. "In the past, any thought of Fed tightening would have sent the guys through the roof."
But some people dissent from the general optimism about the effects of a rate increase.
"Sure, it would hurt," said John Rank, the vice president at Rank & Son Buick in Milwaukee. Very cold weather severely hurt the dealership's sales last month, he said, and he fears that higher interest rates might scare away customers.
Some academic economists contend that a small move in interest rates would make a difference because it could signal the beginning of a series of similar moves. "By itself, a quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate means little unless it signals the beginning of a larger turn in monetary policy, in which case it would be quite significant," said Michael J. Boskin, who was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Bush Administration.
But he said that few people seemed to expect a long series of rate increases right now, so investor reaction to an initial increase would likely be muted.

HEADLINE: Family Values as a Las Vegas Smash

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev.

 BODY:
Spencer and James Betz of San Diego have been coming to this gaudy gambling mecca for years, but their most recent trip was different from all the rest.
This time they brought their newborn daughter, Jamie; they brought their nanny, Yada Lopez, and they left their bankroll at home. Because, while the Betzes did find time to play the slots, they were heading to the MGM Grand Hotel and its "Wizard of Oz" theme park, one of three newly opened mega-hotels that are bringing a family touch to the gambling Strip. 
 "Yada's eyes were like saucers when we walked into the Emerald City at MGM," Ms. Betz said. "She even sang the words to 'We're off to see the wizard' as we walked down the Yellow Brick Road. That's why we came."
Asked why they are spending billions of dollars to build theme park attractions that have nothing to do with the slot machines and craps tables that are the foundation of this city's success, developers of the three new hotels just point to families like the Betzes.
Investors, backing a new wave of resort and theme-park construction here, are wagering that family entertainment will draw crowds to Las Vegas now that the proliferation of casinos around the country offer Americans other opportunities to gamble much closer to home.
Early results indicate that the bet is paying off. The number of visitors to Las Vegas increased 7.3 percent, to 23.5 million in 1993, compared with 21.9 million in 1992, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. That tops the 2.3 percent growth from 1992, to an estimated 13.5 million people, at Orlando, Fla., home of Walt Disney World, or the 2.3 percent decline in visitors, to an estimated 30 million, at Atlantic City.
 The new hotels that opened on the Strip during the fourth quarter are: Circus Circus Enterprises' Luxor, a 357-foot black glass faux-Egyptian pyramid; Mirage Resort's Treasure Island, styled as an 18th-century pirate village, and the MGM Grand, the world's largest hotel, with 5,005 rooms.
The three projects added a combined 10,500 rooms to the Las Vegas market, now the largest in the world with 87,000 rooms, surpassing Orlando, which has 81,000. All three resorts, and most of Las Vegas for that matter, have been booked solid since the first of the three, the Luxor, opened Oct. 15. Room reservations at the three hotels are running 65 percent of capacity for the rest of 1994.
"Gaming has become mainstream in America with the proliferation of state lotteries and other gambling outlets, like Indian casinos and riverboats," Terrence Jicinsky, research coordinator for the convention and visitors authority, said. "When you combine that with the new theme parks and attractions that are being built here, Las Vegas can't help but come out a winner."
Gaming industry analysts agree and say that Las Vegas has only scratched the surface of an expanding market. They estimate that only 15 percent of all adults in the United States has ever visited Las Vegas.
"I am not the least bit concerned that these new Las Vegas properties will continue to draw in large numbers of customers and yield a big payoff," Dennis I. Forst, a leisure industry analyst for Sutro & Company, said. "The only question is how big will it be?"
Some travel agents say that more families are heading to Las Vegas. "In the past year, we have received a lot of inquiries from families who say they are interested in Las Vegas because there's so much for the kids to do there now," Raschinna Findlay, an agent for Travel Store Inc. in Beverly Hills, Calif., said.
Despite early signs that the new mega-resorts are a hit, some industry experts say it is too early to declare the Las Vegas expansion a success.
"There is a tremendous optimism, an almost arrogance that we can't do anything wrong in Las Vegas, but there may be some folly in this," said William Eadington, an economics professor at the University of Nevada. "I'm too much of an economist to accept on face value the notion that the more we expand this market, the more it will grow."
 
The Threat to Atlantic City

 
 Mr. Eadington said that as gaming activities spread rapidly across the country, the market was likely to become saturated at the expense of older, traditional gaming centers -- like Las Vegas and Atlantic City. But he said that Las Vegas was thriving partly because it had diversified into convention and nongaming activities, while Atlantic City was struggling because gaming remained its primary enterprise.
Most casinos in Atlantic City have shown only modest revenue growth. Last year, revenues at Atlantic City casinos grew 2.7 percent, to $3.3 billion, compared with $3.22 billion in 1992.
Recognizing expanding competition from Indian tribes and other gaming activities, Atlantic City is rebuilding its infrastracture in an effort to attract more convention business, city officials said. A new convention center is under construction and the airport is being refurbished.
"The general consensus here is that Atlantic City has to reinvent itself and focus more on conventions and the family market," Michael Pollock, a spokesman for the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, said. Still, Mr. Pollock said he knew of no plans for developers to build MGM-style theme parks.
There are also concerns about Las Vegas. Beyond the ballyhoo of the biggest, brightest hotels, industry analysts are worried about the impact the sudden surge in new gaming and hotel capacity will have on older properties and whether Las Vegas itself is equipped to handle the traffic that such phenomenal growth brings.
 
Older Hotels at Risk

 
 After the last major Las Vegas expansion in 1989, which added the Mirage and Excalibur casinos, several hotels like Main Street Station, the Dunes and El Rancho closed. Others like the Riviera and Maxim filed for bankruptcy but recovered.
Hotels at greatest risk today are the older ones that have not undergone major renovation, analysts said. Among these are the Sahara, Aladdin, Sands and Riviera hotels. "The real question is what is the appeal of these properties in a town that has a number of must-see hotels and amusements," Mr. Eadington said.
Officials at the new mega-resorts maintain that while some hotels are likely to close because of the competition, older, peripheral properties will serve an "overflow" role for consumers who want to visit the theme parks and attractions but cannot afford to lodge there. The Betz family, for example, played at MGM, but stayed at the Tropicana, one of the older hotels.
"This town seems to follow its own rules of economics, namely that demand follows supply," Robert Maxey, president and chief executive of MGM Grand Inc., said.
"No matter how many rooms and how much casino footage is added, visitors seem to just keep coming. I believe we will run out of infrastructure and resources long before we run out of customers."
In a recent study, the investment banking firm Salomon Brothers found that the new amusements in Las Vegas are activities unto themselves and that while they may draw customers to the casinos, the attractions are profitable on their own. The study also found that the attractions extend the average length of a visitor's stay.
Indeed, the interactive game rooms at the Luxor were packed almost to capacity at 10:30 on a recent evening. Many patrons said they were staying at other hotels but had wandered over to play the games.
"In the past, we were afraid to open Las Vegas up to families because we thought it would detract from the parents' time at the gaming tables," a Mirage spokesman said. "The approach is different today in that we want to provide visitors with a number of venues they can explore."

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Jump; Leading Indicators Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Fresh reports reinforced rosy predictions for the reviving economy today. New-home sales surged to an eight-year high and the Government's forecasting gauge turned in its best five-month showing since the country was pulling out of recession a decade ago.
The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators rose for the fifth consecutive month, including an advance of seven-tenths of 1 percent in December.
 
Best Showing Since 1983
 The cumulative increase for the five months was 2.5 percent, the best showing since a rise of 6 percent over seven months in 1983, when the country was emerging from its worst slump since the Great Depression. 
 Three consecutive moves by the index in one direction are considered a good -- though not foolproof -- sign of where the economy will be moving in the next six to nine months.
While the latest index figures matched economists' projections, the figures for new-home sales exceeded most forecasts.
The Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said new-home sales jumped 9.7 percent in 1993, and ended the year by soaring 11.4 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 862,000. That rate was the best monthly showing since an 880,000 rate in March 1986.
Yearly sales totaled 669,000, the highest since 676,000 in 1988.
Almost all the economic news lately has been good.
Last week, the Government reported that the economy had expanded in the last quarter of 1993 at a brisk annual rate of 5.9 percent. Many analysts say the pace will slacken this year to the 3 percent range.
The gross domestic product, which measures all goods and services produced in the United States, was up 2.9 percent for all of 1993, the strongest performance in five years.
There could be a pause in the advance because of the harsh January weather and the California earthquake. "But that shouldn't take away from the fact that the economy seems on much more solid footing now" than it was early in 1993, when growth came to a near standstill, Laurence H. Meyer, the head of a St. Louis economic forecasting service, said.
 
'Surge in Consumer Expectations'
 Eight of the Commerce Department's forward-looking indicators rose in December, two fell and one was unchanged.
"It is particularly gratifying that the largest component of the index was a surge in consumer expectations," Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said. "Consumer optimism is beginning to grow once again."
Other components leading the advance included an increase in raw material prices, suggesting stronger demand; a decline in weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance; an increase in applications for building permits; an uptick in orders for consumer goods; slower business delivery times, a sign of increased orders; an increase in the inflation-adjusted backlog of orders at factories for durable goods, and rising stock prices.
The only drags on the index were a decline in orders and contracts for new business equipment and plants, and a drop in the money supply. The average workweek was unchanged.
The various changes left the index at a seasonally adjusted 100.3, up 1.1 percent from a year ago and 1.4 percent from three months ago.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mostly Off as Japan Proposes a Modest Tax Cut

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most leading currencies yesterday on views that a long-awaited Japanese tax cut is too small to stimulate the Japanese economy and help trim Japan's large trade imbalance with the United States.
Gold rose 40 cents on New York's Commodity Exchange, where the most active April contract settled at $386.50 an ounce. 
 The 5.3 trillion yen ($49 billion) income-tax cut proposed by the Japanese Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, fell below forecasts.
"The tax cuts are less than expected and some people feel it won't stimulate the Japanese economy enough to trim the deficit," said Richard Koss, director of sales for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. "They think we might get strong yen rhetoric from the U.S."
In seeking to pare the large trade gap with Japan, American officials have pressed Tokyo to increase domestic demand and support a stronger yen. That would both lift demand for American products and make Japanese products less attractive to American consumers.
Dealers said the dollar's reaction was muted as it absorbed the news and as the market braced for more details about Japan's stimulus package, which are expected to be disclosed today. The dollar barely budged, to 107.9 Japanese yen, up 0.24 from Tuesday.
Currency markets were also gearing up for a Bundesbank council meeting today. The market is clearly split on the possibility of an easing of rates at the meeting that would be likely to take the mark down if it occurred.
Others said they were waiting for the release tomorrow of key nonfarm payroll data for January for further direction.
The dollar fell to 1.7328 marks in late afternoon New York trading, from 1.7338 Tuesday. In London, it ended at 1.7338 marks, up from 1.7293.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4965, down from $1.4995 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4498 Swiss francs, down from 1.4500; 5.8815 French francs, down from 5.8850; 1.3280 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3298, and 1,688 Italian lire, up from 1,686.

HEADLINE: Mr. Hosokawa's Next Challenge

 BODY:
Japan's Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, has partly delivered on his pledge of political reform. Though he had to compromise with the opposition Liberal Democrats, those reforms that could most benefit relations with the U.S. got through.
One reason Mr. Hosokawa decided to compromise was Tokyo's need to proceed to other business -- stimulating Japan's stalled economy and addressing tough trade demands from Washington. The U.S. Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, is now in Tokyo pressing for agreement before Mr. Hosokawa's Feb. 11 summit meeting with President Clinton. Both sides agree that Japan's huge trade surplus with the U.S. is politically untenable. But they differ sharply over how to reduce it. 
 On one big issue, Tokyo has the better case. Washington wants to set numerical targets to measure U.S. import gains in specific industries. For years Japanese governments have promised much and delivered little on removing bureaucratic obstacles to imports. Washington is understandably impatient for measurable results. Mr. Clinton ran for President on a promise of more aggressive economic diplomacy, and the Japanese trade surplus is the most prominent target.
Economists argue that trade imbalances between countries are not important; but politicians are acutely sensitive to their impact. Still, there is only so much governments can or should do to manage private trade. The Hosokawa Government is already doing many of the right things. It has begun an ambitious deregulation program. And it is preparing a tax-cutting budget aimed at stimulating consumer demand.
Tokyo accepts the goal of reducing its surplus but draws the line at setting numerical import targets for particular industries, like auto parts. It argues, rightly, that that would be a step back toward Japan's market-rigging arrangements of the past. Washington counters that even under this Government, Japan's trade surpluses keep increasing. Tokyo replies that almost every country swings into surplus when it is in a recession, and Japan is now in the fourth year of its worst postwar slump.
At next week's meeting, Mr. Clinton needs to find a graceful way to back off from his rhetorical excesses on numerical targets. In return, Mr. Hosokawa should help Mr. Clinton meet his political needs in more constructive ways, with further deregulation and strong and effective fiscal stimulus.

HEADLINE: A First Deep Cut

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's budget plan for New York City is a stiff dose of what he promised. While the plan is not the actual budget, which comes in April, it foretells tough, mold-breaking measures to balance city spending and revenues over the long haul.
Mr. Giuliani used a few bookkeeping gimmicks and overly optimistic revenue assumptions, but he has relied on them less than his predecessors did. Over all, the plan represents a thrust in new directions that will enrage the old order and cheer Mr. Giuliani's supporters. 
 The problem he confronts, head on, is the prospective $2.3 billion gap in a budget of roughly $31 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The city is living beyond its means. Its bloated public payroll will continue to grow unless City Hall applies some brakes. Mayor David Dinkins tried and then faltered. Mr. Giuliani looks determined.
Tough negotiations will now take place with unions, politicians, bureaucrats and everyone else who wants a bigger slice of pie. But given such a large budget gap and an economy that is still ailing, the city has little choice. It must dispense bitter medicine. The issue is not how much, but how best to distribute it, taking care not to hurt the truly needy.
City employees pay nothing toward their health insurance. Mr. Giuliani rightly wants them to pay as much as state employees do. The Mayor also targets productivity, most usefully on those sanitation workers who get a full day's pay for less than a full day's work. Police productivity can also be improved by his plan to fold administrative functions of the housing and transit police forces into the Police Department. That would free hundreds of uniformed office personnel from desk jobs.
Mr. Giuliani's plan to shrink the overall public payroll is less drastic than he sounded during the election campaign, but no less convincing. He aims to cut the head count by 15,000 this year and next, and hopes to do it by offering severance pay to selected employees. The offer does not need union approval, but he is sensibly seeking union advice on how to shape it. Indicating that he means business, Mr. Giuliani intends to make the offer next month -- and if the response is inadequate he says he will resort to layoffs.
There are soft spots in his plan. He is counting on more state and Federal aid than he seems likely to get. He proposes "tort reform" -- sensible restrictions on damage claims against the city -- that will have tough sledding in Albany. He relies further on questionable one-shot devices, such as withdrawing funds from pension reserves and resorting to the discredited device of borrowing against future tax collections, which actually costs the city more in the end.
Tax cuts in Mayor Giuliani's plan are modest and gradual. He would do well to leave them that way while he proceeds with the tougher task he has cut out for himself -- a genuine, overdue shake-up in the city's finances.

HEADLINE: Chinese Economy Threatens to Pull Ours Down

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The concern for improvement of human rights in China has allowed the erroneous argument to flourish that keeping the status quo with China is important for the United States economy. I would like to discuss China's real economic structure and its meaning for the American economy. 
 The market economy of China is formulated on the so-called Taiwan model. China opens her vast, cheap-labor market and allows outside enterprises to bring in their own capital, equipment and technological know-how to set up factories for export-oriented products. The low-cost, labor-based exports earn China a large sum of foreign currencies. China, in turn, uses these earned foreign currencies to subsidize its ailing but vast state-owned industries.
The subsidies are given in two forms. One is to import equipment and technologies to update inefficient state-owned industries. The other is to subsidize those industries outright to keep the living standards of their workers somewhat in line with counterparts in the private sector.
An important measure in this Chinese structure is to close domestic markets to the private industries, so that the inefficient state-owned sector will not be wiped out by the competition, and the Communists will not lose an all-important political base of survival. Even the recently announced Chinese plan to reform the financial and tax bases seems mainly aimed to gather more resources into the hands of the central government, so that it can subsidize the state-owned sector more generously, and thus prolong the "proletariat dictatorship."
Japan and Europe have carefully guarded against the inflow of the products of this low-cost, labor-based sector, whether it has been based mainly in Taiwan and Hong Kong or, as now, in China. The major outlet of those low-cost products is traditionally the United States. Exports from China to the United States, including the ones that flow through Hong Kong, totaled about $27 billion in 1993.
Unfortunately, when China buys low-level and medium-level technologies to update its state-owned industries, it turns to Japan. When Taiwan and Hong Kong enterprises open factories in China to manufacture export-oriented goods, they buy machines and other things from Japan.
When the Chinese want quality electronics and cameras, they turn to Sony, Matsushita, Canon and Nikon. Even when the newly rich of China want to drive luxury cars, and Hong Kong-China undergrounds steal for them from Hong Kong the favorite cars of Hong Kong yacht people, they get Mercedes-Benzes and BMW's, not Cadillacs and Lincolns.
As a result, the United States exported to China only about $4 billion, and ran a trade deficit of $23 billion with China last year.
However, this flawed setup cannot continue long. If China tries to use this Taiwan model to modernize, but with such a heavy burden of state subsidies in addition to a population of more than one billion, it will cause the United States economy and China's to tumble down the hill together.
In 1992 and 1993, the Chinese economy grew about 13 percent annually. In both years the United States trade deficit with China grew at the rate of 60 percent a year. Even if Chinese growth slows down to 10 percent a year from now on, the Chinese trade surplus with the United States needs to expand at the rate of 50 percent a year to sustain its growth under the current model. Thus, by the year 2000 the United States trade deficit with China will grow to $300 billion a year!
If China wants to continue growing, it must abandon this impossible Taiwan model, and grow by releasing the productive and entrepreneurial potential of its own populace. That means Beijing must relinquish control and subsidies over state-owned industries, let free competition also reign in domestic markets and immediately establish private ownership rights over lands and other properties for China's own populace (not just for foreigners and Taiwan and Hong Kong Chinese, as now). China cannot wait another five or seven years.

HEADLINE: I Know You're Out There; I Can Hear You Breathing;
Would-Be Standup Comics in Search of Live Audiences, as Clubs Weather Hard Times

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Dentist by day, standup comic by night, Michael S. King has performed before audiences of two, and half that when one of them went to the bathroom. But there are some things he won't do. "I won't perform before none," he insists. "I draw the line somewhere."
Mark Cohen, too, knows the ignominy and loneliness of the long-distance comic. He has performed before none. He's been at clubs where there were no customers, so the waitresses, serving nothing to nobody, were pressed into service as the audience.
 
'The Next Robin Williams'
 Happily for the two comics, those days are mostly past them now as they join a select company of featured performers who regularly harvest laughs at the handful of live comedy clubs around town, Mr. Cohen as a wacky improviser who has been touted as "the next Robin Williams" and Mr. King as a nerdy loser who goes to a discount psychiatrist to talk about other people's problems. 
 But for many others, and some of the clubs themselves, the state of live standup comedy in New York City and elsewhere is no laughing matter, performers and club owners say. Battered by recessionary pressures and undercut by television shows that have saturated the market with standup comedy, clubs are feeling the pinch.
One fixture, the Improv, which practically invented the comedy venue for amateurs and would-be headliners 30 years ago, abandoned its longtime location on 44th Street and Ninth Avenue last summer for shared quarters and a reduced four-night-a-week schedule on West 34th Street. Another well-known East Side Manhattan club, Catch a Rising Star, recently closed down after having gone bankrupt, although some in the field blame management problems. Suburban clubs, long a more lucrative showcase for aspiring talent, have not escaped the downturn.
"Right now we're hurting," acknowledged Estee Adoram, manager of the Comedy Cellar in Greenwich Village, who estimated that business has dipped 15 percent during the last two years, and was 30 percent off this snowy winter. She attributed the trend largely to "overexposure" from cable television comedy shows "which are terrible," she said. "Audiences are simply oversaturated."
 
Blaming Television
 Silver Saundors Friedman, owner of the Improv, also blames television. "You can stay home and see all the bad comedy you want," she said. "They demystified it. They made it common."
"I may sound like I'm discouraged," she said. "I am."
Her ex-husband, Budd Friedman, who runs a chain of Improvs around the country from a base in Los Angeles and broadcasts a cable show, Evening at the Improv, on the A&E cable network, says business is off everywhere but not necessarily because of television. Nearly a quarter of the patrons at his live shows in Las Vegas were drawn by television, he said.
Fewer New Yorkers are going out late, he says, recalling days when he would leave the New York Improv at 6 A.M. and there would still be patrons waiting to enter. He said he was baffled by the downturn. "New York is a conundrum," he said. "I don't know what the problem is."
But if audiences are thinning, there is no shortage of comics themselves, or at least people who think they are funny. There are so many of these "showcasers" willing to perform for free that the Comic Strip on the East Side holds a lottery three times a year to set tryouts for the 150 or so chances to perform over the next four months. Other clubs have similar procedures to screen what Mr. King, the dentist-comic, calls "New York City's eight million class clowns."
 
Working for Cab Fare
 The aspirants keep flocking, drawn not by lucre -- for they stand to earn no more than cab fare, $10 or $20 an appearance, if that -- but by the chance to try out material and, with great luck, become "headliners," attracting the attention of a scout or an agent who might pave the way to Hollywood or David Letterman, a path blazed by Jerry Seinfeld, Eddie Murphy, Sandra Bernhard and other comedy stars cradled in the clubs.
"We have to find the tiny niche of people with talent before they become megastars," said Caroline Hirsch, who founded Caroline's Comedy Club, one of the city's leading laugh emporiums where a lantern-jawed beginner named Jay Leno broke them up a dozen years ago.
"It's like panning for gold," Ms. Hirsch said. "Years ago the real talent was huddled together. Now it's harder to find gems, but they're there."
One of them, club owners say, is Mr. Cohen, a frenzied 33-year-old actor-musician who may have established some kind of record a few years ago when he crisscrossed Manhattan to perform nine sets at four clubs on the same night.
While he no longer needs to be quite that active, he still likes to do three or four sets in different clubs on a Saturday night, a feat that is possible thanks to owners' willingness to bend schedules around his availability.
"He's wonderful, one of the top five comics in the city now," said Joe Falzarano, manager of Caroline's and former manager of the Improv. It was there that Ms. Friedman bannered Mr. Cohen as "the next Robin Williams."
"His clock is a little off," Ms. Friedman said. "He should have been discovered by now."
Mr. Cohen can only agree. Born in Springfield, Mass., he came to the city at 17 to study acting, won some bit parts on stage and began performing in a small club. "I got no money but the owner started giving me half his sandwich," Mr. Cohen said.
 
Empty Houses
 He tried out at suburban clubs where, he said, bookers told him to "send in a head shot of your car." Maybe, they said, he could drive the headliner home. Some nights he performed to empty houses but at least the waitresses laughed. They helped spread the word, and he has been cracking up audiences ever since.
On a typical Saturday night during which he crossed paths with Mr. King, Mr. Cohen started off with an early set at the Comedy Cellar at 117 McDougal Street in Greenwich Village. Although he carried a list of 34 joke titles printed out by his home computer, on which he writes his material, he didn't stop to consult it, even when he momentarily forgot a joke. He was moving too quickly, juggling parodies ("Fiddler on the Rap": Tevye with an attitude), equal-opportunity ethnic insults, a new version of "At the Hop" ("I just got off the train/And someone bashed me on the brain/Up in the Bronx"), the Bobbitt trial and, of course, sex.

 To a patron in a loud shirt, he said: "You wearing a condom, sir, or you just wearing that outfit for protection?" Then he was on to the latest auto race, the New Jersey 500: "It has tolls in it. It was so boring. You knew the guy with exact change would win."
A lot of his act left room for improvisation, "riffing off the crowd," as he calls it. "Is that your boyfriend, miss?" was one starting point. When a young woman hesitated and said, "I don't know," Mr. Cohen announced: "There's a guy who's feeling comfortable right now. Hey sir! Don't pay the check!"
His next stop was the New York Comedy Club on Second Avenue at 49th Street, where Mr. King was on, complaining sorrowfully about his love life. "I had a blind date with a psychic," he says. "I pick her up for the date. She told me she didn't want to see me any more."
"I took this young woman out a few times. She said, 'You can sleep with me but we can't have sex.' I said, 'Fine, I'll take you out to dinner, but no food.' "
 
Material From Life
 The 43-year-old pediatric dentist with a practice on Park Avenue at 36th Street has been doing comedy for a dozen years and takes it seriously enough that he says he might give up dentistry if he got a real break. He gets his material from his upbringing. His mother, he says, used to address him in multiple choice: "Are you stupid, or what?" His social life as a bachelor also helps. "If I start dating someone new," he says, "it really stimulates things."
Applauding Mr. King, Mr. Cohen bounded up to the mike, also urging patrons to put their hands together for the mistress of ceremonies, "a very funny lady in a couple of years."
The house was a little thin and Mr. Cohen pointed out a sign limiting occupancy to 177 people. "Luckily," he said, "that's throughout the year."
One woman laughed hysterically. "If you ever get a sitcom," she shouted out, "I hope you'll hire me for the laugh track."
"I sure will," Mr. Cohen said. "I'll hire this whole audience. That's how little respect I have for myself."
When he finished his set, he hopped a cab to the Comic Strip on Second Avenue at 82d Street, where he was quickly ushered on. A woman in the front caught his attention. "You got a sweater on your shoulders," Mr. Cohen said. "It didn't come with instructions?"
In the back, two people stood up to leave. "There's a couple going to the bathroom together," he said. "You don't get that often."
He turned to a young woman in the front: "You Irish, miss?"

HEADLINE: OPENING TO VIETNAM;
CLINTON DROPS 19-YEAR BAN ON U.S. TRADE WITH VIETNAM; CITES HANOI'S HELP ON M.I.A.'S

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
President Clinton today ordered an end to the trade embargo on Vietnam, casting away a central remnant of one of America's most divisive wars and opening a potentially lucrative market to American goods.
After nearly two decades of a bitter peace, Mr. Clinton said it was now time to acknowledge the cooperation Vietnam has shown in the search for evidence of the 2,238 Americans still officially listed as missing from that conflict, which ended in 1975. He said opening the door to trade would benefit that still-unfinished search. 
 At a White House ceremony this afternoon, Mr. Clinton said he was lifting the trade embargo "because I am absolutely convinced it offers us the best way to resolve the fate of those who remain missing and about whom we are not sure." [Excerpts, page A8.]
 
Allowing Liaison Offices
 The step taken by Mr. Clinton stops short of restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam. But it will allow the United States and Vietnam each to open a liaison office in the other's capital, the highest level of ties between them since the long and painful war that left more than 58,000 Americans dead before the United States withdrew from the conflict in 1973.
The United States informed Vietnam of the decision this afternoon, and the White House said trade between the two countries would resume as soon as the Commerce Department could draft the necessary regulations, probably within the next several weeks.
The idea of reaching out to Vietnam had been vigorously opposed by the American Legion and others among the nation's leading veterans' groups, making the decision a sensitive one for Mr. Clinton. He had to overcome criticism from them during his presidential campaign for having avoided the military draft during the Vietnam War.
 
Bid to Avoid Political Attacks
 In an effort to avoid a new round of damaging attacks, Mr. Clinton announced his decision this afternoon only after meeting privately with representatives of veterans' organizations. The White House also released a sheaf of endorsements from distinguished Vietnam-era commanders, including Gen. William C. Westmoreland, the former commander of United States forces in Vietnam, and Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, the Navy's top officer in the final years of the war.
But Mr. Clinton appeared determined to show no great pleasure in his decision, which he announced by reading a passionless statement in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.
To Mr. Clinton's immediate right was Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Others positioned next to the President were Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who served in Vietnam as a civilian assistant to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, and Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, who volunteered for service in Vietnam as a young diplomat. In the audience were Democratic Senators John F. Kerry of Massachussetts, a veteran who had called for an end to the embargo, and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who lost a leg and won the Medal of Honor for his heroism in Vietnam.
While Mr. Clinton has spoken repeatedly of the importance that expanded trade holds for the United States economy, he insisted today that the potential for American economic gains played no part in his decision. But it was greeted with delight and relief by American businessmen who had complained that an anachronistic policy was denying them a share of the Vietnamese market that advocates say could be worth up to $6 billion a year in trade involving American companies.
The plan to lift the embargo had been unanimously recommended several weeks ago by Mr. Clinton's top Cabinet officers and by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But aides said the President calculated that his position would be strongest if he waited for the endorsement that the Senate provided in a vote last week before making his decision public.
 
'Get It Over With'
 As late as this morning, White House officials had said that Mr. Clinton had not made up his mind about the embargo and that he would not announce his decision before Saturday. But Administration officials had long since made clear that his commitment was irrevocable, and aides said he had wanted to "get it over with" once he finally initialed his approval.
Officials said Mr. Clinton had not made his decision until he reviewed a final packet of information about the search for American prisoners of war and those missing in action, but they would not be more specific.
In explaining their decision to go ahead now, Mr. Clinton and his top deputies praised Vietnam today for having been more cooperative last year than in any year since the end of the war in the effort to resolve the mystery about those who are still listed as missing.
 
Some Remains Returned
 Since July alone, Vietnam has returned to the United States the remains of 39 individuals believed to have been American personnel, bringing to 67 the number of sets of remains handed over in 1993. Only three of those sets have so far been conclusively identified as the remains of United States servicemen. Vietnam has also provided new help in investigating claims of live sightings of missing Americans, and in sharing wartime documents.
Mr. Clinton, who eased some sanctions against Vietnam on two occasions last year but refused to lift the embargo, said today that the progress met the conditions he had set for a restoration of trade. Without fully explaining his reasoning, he said he had also concluded that an end to the embargo represented "the best way to continue getting information" about those Americans who are still missing.
But that argument has found little resonance among the nation's largest veterans' groups, including the American Legion, whose national commander warned Mr. Clinton in advance of the decision that it would be regarded as "a betrayal" of veterans, the missing and their families.
 
Meeting With Veterans
 In a sign of how important the White House regarded their reaction, the veterans' representatives invited on short notice to the White House this afternoon were briefed not just by Mr. Clinton, but also by Mr. Christopher, Mr. Lake, General Shalikashvili and Mr. Aspin. Both sides described the discussion as cordial, but the veterans said later that it had done nothing to change their minds.
Larry Rivers, executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said he and others had told Mr. Clinton that they intended "to keep him at his word to keep Vietnam accountable." Ann Mills Griffiths, who heads the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, chose not to attend the meeting and said she believed Mr. Clinton had "clearly broken his promise" to maintain pressure on Hanoi.
But relations between the White House and veterans remain so delicate that even John Wheeler, who led fundraising efforts for the Vietnam Memorial and helped Mr. Clinton during his presidential campaign to deflect criticism from Vietnam veterans, combined his statement of support with one chiding the President for "an embargo on vets" within the Administration. White House officials said they could not dispute Mr. Wheeler's assertion that only 8 percent of the men among Mr. Clinton's senior appointees are military veterans.
With the directive he issued today to the Departments of State, Treasury and Commerce, Mr. Clinton set aside the embargo the United States imposed against North Vietnam in 1964 and extended to cover all of Vietnam after the fall of the South Vietnamese Government on April 30, 1975.
 
Other Restrictions Remain
 Administration officials emphasized tonight that the lifting of the embargo would not spell an end to other restrictions imposed by Congress against Vietnam, which will continue to prohibit sales of weapons and some high-technology goods. In an odd twist, they also said the Trading with the Enemy Act would be left in place, although only to insure that Vietnamese assets frozen by the United States remain in American control until the two countries can agree on their disposition.
The officials also strongly rejected characterizations that the step represented a reward for Vietnamese cooperation, and spoke with some lingering bitterness at a briefing today of the years in which Vietnam had confounded rather than helped the American search for the missing.
Mr. Clinton, who took extraordinary steps to avoid military service in Vietnam, was in the odd position today as Commander in Chief of marking an end of sorts to a war in which he, unlike many of his contemporaries, did not take part. But he insisted today that his decision had not been complicated by that fact.
"Everybody my age, whether they were in Vietnam or not, knew someone who died there, knew someone who was wounded there," the 47-year-old President said. "And I think people in our generation are perhaps more insistent on trying to get a full accounting, more obsessed with it, than perhaps people who are younger and people who are older, except those who had children."

HEADLINE: OPENING TO VIETNAM;
A Passion Spent, Finally

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE, Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
It was Lyndon B. Johnson's war, though the initial commitments were made by John F. Kennedy. The peace, such as it was, was the handiwork of Richard M. Nixon, but that was tainted by the stench of defeat.
Now, irony of ironies, fate has chosen Bill Clinton to lead the nation in consigning the whole sad, ugly ordeal to the dim recesses of memory -- the same Bill Clinton who, like Dan Quayle and many other privileged members of his generation, managed to avoid service in the rice paddies of the Mekong Delta or the jungles of the Central Highlands, on the carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin or the choppers of the First Cavalry Division. 
 Some organizations that represent veterans of the war protested bitterly even before President Clinton announced the lifting of the 19-year embargo this afternoon. No doubt a spirited scrap will ensue. But many voters, if the polls are to be believed, agree with Mr. Clinton and with the Senate, which voted overwhelmingly last week to end the embargo.
 
Tragedy to Opportunity
 Trade follows the flag, it is said, and mutual diplomatic recognition between Hanoi and Washington is not likely to be delayed many years more, though the President specified that it would have to wait upon "a full and final accounting" of America's losses.
Slowly, almost imperceptibly, Vietnam has turned from a tragedy into an opportunity. Having watched their German and British counterparts making large investments there, having pondered the prospects of turning the one-time enemy into the next Thai- or Malay-style success story, American businessmen have pushed relentlessly for today's change.
But it took more than that; it took a political strategy. That was cobbled together largely by Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, who persuaded Hanoi to provide enough answers to the vexed question of prisoners of war and servicemen still missing to enable Mr. Clinton to win the support of important public figures who had the credibility on Vietnam that he did not.
Among those, by far the most important were a pair of Senators -- John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who won the Silver Star as a patrol-boat commander in the Delta, and John McCain, an Arizona Republican, the son and grandson of admirals, who bailed out of his naval attack plane after it was hit over North Vietnam and spent five and a half years in an enemy prison camp.
"I feel we are finally putting this war behind us, as we have put every war behind us," Senator McCain said by telephone from his home in Phoenix. "A nation must do that, and I am grateful to have survived to see it, when so many of my friends did not. I feel it is in our interest to have a strong counterweight to China, the growing military and economic power in the region, and I feel this will help us a lot economically."
Another who served in Vietnam emphasized the geopolitical aspect.
"We really need to have a relationship with these people, not for the past but for the future," said Frank Wisner, a career diplomat, now a senior Defense Department official, who served as a provincial adviser in the Highlands. "Vietnam is a key actor along the Pacific Rim as we, they, the Chinese and others in the area head into the next century."
 
A Cultural Benefit
 A scholar who studied American troops during the war and has studied them since foresaw another benefit.
"Not many people realize it yet," said Charles Moskos of Northwestern University, one of the country's leading military sociologists, "but this will do what the peace treaty never did. More Americans will go to Vietnam. They will see how much the Vietnamese people like Americans, and how many supported the American intervention. That will redound to the credit of the Vietnam veterans and of the serving military today."
If so, the President's action will truly represent the closing of a chapter in American history.
The war and its aftermath helped to shape American public life for three decades. Even when the shooting stopped, the United States found it agonizingly difficult to follow Lincoln's injunction to "bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and for his orphan." The anguish of the families of the P.O.W.'s and the M.I.A.'s, the travail of the boat people and the devastation wrought by defoliants on the landscape of Indochina all kept the pain alive in peoples' minds.
 
Political Waves and Ripples
 The war forced President Johnson into retirement, almost certainly cost Hubert H. Humphrey the Presidency, planted the seeds of doubt and discouragement about government in the minds of the electorate and the news media and helped keep the Democrats out of the White House for most of the 1970's and 1980's. The image of the last CH-46 helicopter lifting off the roof of the United States Embassy in Saigon on April 30, 1975, burned a hole in the national psyche.
"After that," said the novelist Ward Just, who worked as a war correspondent in Vietnam, "I thought we'd be better off without each other for a while. Vietnam had a bad effect on us, and, God knows, we had a terrible effect on Vietnam. Now I think it's time to see whether we can't all behave like grown-ups. I think most people feel that way, actually."
Like the Vietnam War memorial, like the end of the war itself, today's decision has been a long time coming.
 
A Decade of Agony
 Thirty-one years ago, in January 1963, the weakness of the American-advised South Vietnamese troops was revealed to an American officer named John Paul Vann and, through him, to many others, in the debacle at the hamlet of Ap Bac.
Twenty-six years ago, on Jan. 31, 1968, the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong launched the Tet offensive, attacking on many fronts at once, capturing the old capital of Hue and penetrating Saigon itself.
Twenty-one years ago, on Jan. 27, 1973, a peace treaty was signed in Paris by the United States, the South Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong. The next day, a cease-fire took effect.
Those events are almost as distant from today as the battles of World War I were from those of World War II. Many who took part in them or witnessed them have retired or died, and new generations have grown up for whom names like Ia Drang and Parrot's Beak seem as remote as Belleau Wood or Iwo Jima.
In a sense, time was Bill Clinton's ally. Fewer and fewer people cling to the past. And even for many of those who do, as Leo Thorsness, a former Air Force P.O.W., said this week, one day "the passion is gone."

HEADLINE: GROCERS CHALLENGE USE OF NEW DRUG FOR MILK OUTPUT

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
A day before the introduction of a genetically engineered growth hormone designed to boost milk production in dairy cows, some of the country's largest food companies and distributors took measures yesterday to restrict the use of the animal drug.
Among the companies moving to keep their dairy suppliers from using the gene-altered drug, the first important product of agriculture biotechnology to be used to produce food, were the Kroger Company, the nation's largest supermarket chain, the Southland Corporation, owners and franchisers of 7-Eleven convenience stores, and Pathmark Stores Inc. 
 But three of the New York metropolitan region's largest supermarket chains, A.& P., Shoprite and Foodtown, said they would continue to buy milk from their distributors much as they have in the past. The chains say that while they are worried about how their customers will react, they cannot pledge to ban milk produced by cows that are given the drug because it is difficult for them to insure that individual dairy farmers are not using it.
 
F.D.A. Guidance Sought
 Some companies and several states also have asked the Food and Drug Administration for guidance on how to label milk and dairy products to alert customers that they do not contain milk produced with the genetically engineered hormone.
Jim O'Hara, the F.D.A.'s chief spokesman, said the agency was considering the requests, but he declined to discuss what the F.D.A. was considering or when any guidance documents would be issued.
Along with safety issues, critics of the hormone contend that by increasing milk production, it could cause a reduction in prices paid to farmers and force thousands out of business, an assertion that was confirmed in part by a White House study issued last month.
 
Milk Termed Indistinguishable
 The company-imposed restrictions came despite years of review of the drug by the F.D.A., the National Institutes of Health and the American Medical Association, all of whom have said the genetically engineered hormone is safe. The food and drug agency has said that milk produced with the genetically engineered hormone is indistinguishable from milk that is not.
In large measure, the companies are responding to the Pure Food Campaign, a coalition of farmers, consumer groups, animal welfare organizations and others opposed to the hormone. The campaign, which carried out protests that included the symbolic dumping of milk in New York and several other cities, is directed by Jeremy Rifkin, a Washington-based critic of biotechnology.
Mr. Rifkin said in an interview on Wednesday that the campaign's success in convincing companies to restrict the use of the drug illustrated the public's concern over an artificially produced hormone, which he said had not been adequately studied by the Government. "We believe this product is a hazard to health," he said.
But Jeffrey Nedelman, a spokesman in Washington for the Grocery Manufacturers of America, which represents the $400 billion food manufacturing industry, said the Government had thoroughly studied the drug and declared it safe for people as well as cows. Mr. Nedelman said consumers and food companies were being misled by Mr. Rifkin's "theatrics and scare tactics."
Kraft , McDonald's and Land-O-Lakes are among the companies that have been targeted by Mr. Rifkin's campaign, but they have not issued any directives to their milk suppliers, according to Mr. Nedelman.
 
Nervous About Reaction
 Nevertheless, Mr. Rifkin's campaign appears to have made enough consumers worried about the drug that some companies felt they had to respond. In almost every case, the companies and food distributors said they were taking action to ban the hormone in their milk and dairy products, not because they believed it was dangerous but because they were nervous about how their customers would react.
"Food is an emotional issue," said Cecilia Norwood, a spokeswoman for Southland. "We felt a responsibility to take this action because of concern expressed by our customers."
Never in the long history of technological innovation in American agriculture, from the invention of the cotton gin in the late 18th century to the introduction of chemical pesticides 50 years ago, has the advent of a new farm technology stirred such a reaction.
Supporters of agricultural biotechnology say the hormone will help usher in an era of greater efficiency and environmentally safer practices on American farms.
Jim Winkel, a dairy farmer in Vogel Center, Mich., said yesterday that he was anxious to test the hormone in his herd of 340 cows. "We are a business," he said, "and if it helps us become more efficient and competitive, that's the name of the game."
Gerald Moore, a spokesman for the New York State Commissioner for Agriculture and Markets, which helps regulate the testing and supply of milk, said he believed that many dairies, especially smaller ones, would bow to economic pressures and use the drug to increase productivity.
 
10-Year Government Review
 The genetically engineered hormone, known as bovine somatotropin, is produced by the St. Louis-based Monsanto Company, which will market the drug, beginning today, under the tradename Posilac.
Karen Marshall, a Monsanto spokeswoman, said it would be several days before the first farmers received Posilac, and it would not begin to be used on farms until next week.
The drug was made by isolating a gene that produces natural growth hormone in cows and inserting it into bacteria. The drug has been under review by the Government since 1984, and last November the F.D.A. approved its commercial use.
The F.D.A. has noted on the label for the drug that studies have identified potential problems in cows, including infections of the udder and difficulty in getting cows pregnant. But it also said these problems could be solved by improving the care of the cows.
A 90-day moratorium on the sale of the drug, imposed by Congress after the F.D.A. action, expired yesterday.
The stakes in the debate are significant, not only for the companies that have invested billions of dollars in new agricultural biotechnology products, but also for the technology's critics, especially Mr. Rifkin, who has vowed to stop agricultural biotechnology by halting the hormone, its first important invention.
In the interview, Mr. Rifkin said the campaign had 18 full-time workers and was spending roughly $100,000 a month.
"The American consumer is moving away from high-tech foods, away from hormones and chemicals and additives and processed foods," he said. "The wave in food production is toward a natural, sustainable agriculture. Monsanto and the grocery manufacturers who support this product have grossly miscalculated the trend."
 
Unenforceable Restrictions
 Even as they moved to restrict the drug, companies that have taken the action acknowledged they had no way to enforce their restrictions. All milk contains detectable levels of the growth hormone naturally, and the man-made hormone is indistinguishable, said the F.D.A. Thus, the Kroger Company said that while it has told its milk producers that it "prefers" that they not use the drug, which is sometimes referred to as BST, they also said they could not "guarantee" that farmers would comply.
"It's our conviction this is not a safety issue," said Paul Bernish, a Kroger spokesman. "By the same token, consumers may be unsure about BST and we are concerned that they might overreact and stop buying dairy products."
A spokesman for the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, which operates about 300 A.&P. supermarkets in the New York area, said it was surveying its dairy distributors to find out if they plan to use the drug.
"But that's as far as we've got," said William Vitulli, an A.&P. vice president. "Right now we're not prepared to come forward and say that all our milk will be hormone-free. We can't."
Mary Ellin Gowin, a vice president of the Wakefern Food Corporation, the distribution arm of Shoprite supermarkets, said: "If we had our own herd and were responsible for the management of cows of our own, then we could say for sure that all the milk was from regular cows. But we're not in that position."
The company, like many other supermarket chains and cooperatives, buys its dairy products from large dairy distributors that in turn buy the milk from hundreds of individual dairy farms. Because the protein hormone is produced by a cow's pituitary gland and is already present in some quantities in milk, it is impossible for distributors or their buyers to test for it.
Wakefern, following the lead of Safeway, Giant and other nationwide chains, has asked its distributor, Readington Farms in New Jersey, not to accept milk from dairies that use the hormone. But Readington is under no legal obligation to do so; thus, Wakefern cannot guarantee, at least for now, that its milk is produced by cows free of the hormone.
 
$300 Million Research
 Monsanto, which last year earned revenue of nearly $9 billion, has spent at least $300 million developing Posilac, which serves as the foundation of the company's aggressive research effort in agricultural biotechnology.
Any introduction of a new product is difficult, and perhaps no new product in agriculture has faced such opposition. Along with the safety issues, Monsanto's new drug has long been the focus of additional concerns about the economic effect the drug might have on small farmers.
After the drug was approved in November, the White House and officials in seven Federal agencies began a systematic review of "the most reliable professional analysis and judgment on major topics associated" with the use of the hormone. The intent of the study was to determine the drug's "implication for U.S. consumers, the dairy industry and the economy."
Last month the group finished its work and issued a report saying that "there is no evidence that BST poses a health threat to humans or animals."
The study also concluded that use of BST will increase milk production, leading to a 2 percent decrease in milk prices paid to farmer over the next six years. That, in turn, will lead to a 1 percent decline in dairy farm income over the next six years, including $546 million drop in 1999.
 
Higher Price Supports
 The report said that consumer concern might lead to lower milk consumption. That, coupled with increasing milk supplies, could increase Federal spending on dairy price supports by $300 million to $500 million over the next six years.
In a statement, Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who has long been an opponent of the hormone, said the White House study confirmed his worst fears. "This product will result in significant loss of income in the dairy industry and drive dairy farmers, many of whom are already barely surviving, out of business."
The White House study said, though, that the the trend to fewer farms producing more milk would continue with or without the hormone. The study's authors said that introduction of the hormone would be a important lift for the biotechnology industry in the United States, which is the world's leader in developing genetically altered products.

HEADLINE: Overhauling School Grants: Much Debate but Little Gain

SERIES: Looting Student Aid: The Political Umbrella -- Last of three articles

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Last fall, during Senate hearings on the abuses of student financial aid programs by colleges and trade schools, the senators were quizzing Education Department officials about ways to reduce the billions of dollars in annual losses, when the subject turned to political interference.
"Every Congressman I have talked to wants us to manage this program more tightly," said Dr. David Longanecker, the Assistant Secretary of Education responsible for higher education aid. "On the other hand, when it comes down to an institution that happens to be in their general jurisdiction, it is a different story. That is obviously a more legitimate institution than the others we should be shutting down." 
 There was a burst of laughter in the Senate hearing room -- some of it nervous.
 
A Question of Will
 After five hearings in the last four years exposing misuse of Federal student-aid money by colleges and for-profit trade schools, the Education Department has a good idea of what needs to be done to regain fiscal control. The tougher question is, does Congress really have the political will to let the agency do the job?
It has not until now. And as happens in Washington, it is no one's fault in particular that student aid programs are losing $3 billion to $4 billion annually to defaults, fraud and waste. A favor for the Congressmen from New York and Michgan; an amendment for that trade school lobbyist; a lawsuit by a college association; a piece of regulatory legislation that is quietly postponed from 1993 to 1995 -- and bit by bit the Education Department's enforcement powers are nibbled away.
The Senator from Michigan nibbles. For years Senator Carl Levin has successfully pressed the Education Department to let Jordan College in Cedar Springs, Mich., remain eligible for the $6 million in student aid it receives annually. Senator Levin, a Democrat, points out that Jordan serves 2,000 mostly poor, minority students. It is also a school with a student loan default rate that has reached as high as 51 percent, that cannot post the $3 million bond the Education Department is seeking, that is not accredited and runs programs with graduation rates of 7 to 25 percent, according to department officials.
The New York Congressional delegation nibbles. For 20 years Federal regulators tried to ban several Jewish religious schools in Brooklyn from student aid programs, arguing that these Hasidic yeshivas did not provide degrees or vocational training and were not licensed by New York State. And for 20 years, at crucial junctures, members of New York's delegation rallied to the yeshivas' defense, starting with Senator Jacob Javits in 1974 and continuing up to the current Senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, and Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, last year. The grateful Hasidic leaders have supported these politicians at the polls, and in some cases, with campaign contributions.
 
Lobbyists With Friends
 Then last fall in hearings before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investiations, witnesses testified that many of these same yeshivas offered cursory courses and siphoned off student aid to pay for the Hasidics' religious operations here and in Israel. The Education Department decided to suspend 21 schools from the Federal program, but the schools had already collected $300 million in Pell grants over a decade.
The education lobbyists in Washington nibble, too. The nation's student aid programs were created in the 1960's with traditional four-year colleges in mind. But through the years, these programs have been squeezed, bent and amended to take in education as diverse as Duke University, hairstyling schools or courses in prison. Efforts to create separate aid programs have been resisted by the for-profit trade schools and their allies in Congress, like Representative William D. Ford, Democrat of Michigan, the House Education Committee chairman who once attended a trade school himself. They point out that about a third of the trade schools offer degree programs of two years or longer, and they say it would be elitist to differentiate.
 
Delaying Regulation
After Passage, Postponement
 As might be expected, when someone tries to write a law broad enough to regulate both Duke University and the Tulsa Academy of Hairstyling, it is not completely suited to either. And so, Duke sends its lobbyists into the Congressional trenches to nibble off parts of the law and the hairstylists send their lobbyists, and by the time they are all through, the law has large loopholes.
Consider the attempts to regulate something as basic as the number of years a student can qualify for a Pell grant, the Federal Government's major scholarship program. In 1976, on the heels of student aid scandals during that period, Congress passed antifraud legislation limiting eligibility to five years. Just as that law was to take effect in 1980, Congress repealed it. In 1986, Congress again passed legislation, and again, as it was to take effect in 1992, it was repealed over Education Department protests.
As a result, in the last decade, 162,576 students have received Pell grants for 6 to 10 consecutive years, worth $1.6 billion. Since 1975, 4,100 more students have received grants for 11 to 17 years -- and Pells cannot even be used for graduate education.
Who was responsible for undoing the regulatory legislation? Lobbyists for the major trade school group, the Career College Association. They argue that if a person studies several years for a technical degree, goes to work in his field and then, because of shifts in the economy, is laid off, he should be able to get more Pell aid for retraining.
Or consider the fate of a basic piece of consumer legislation entitling students to find out the graduation rate of a college or trade school they are thinking of attending. The Education Department tried to enact right-to-know regulations in 1986 but was blocked in Congress, which eventually passed a watered-down Student Right-to-Know Act in 1990. Just as the law was to go into effect in 1993, it was postponed until 1995.
Who was responsible? The lobbyist for the colleges and universities, the American Council on Education. "We urged a postponement," says Robert Atwell, the president. While he acknowledges "we are not graduating enough of our entrants," he says calculating graduation rates is a "very complicated issue" and could penalize colleges with many part-time or evening students.
In both these cases Representative Ford of the House education panel agreed with the lobbyists' positions. And all this is done soquietly in Congressional committees, even Education officials have trouble tracing just who has done what. Asked who was behind delaying the right-to-know-legislation until 1995, Dr. Longanecker, the Assistant Secretary, said: "I don't know where it came from."
 
Eroding Regulation
Schools Amend Potent New Law

In some respects this is a hopeful period for those favoring tougher regulation of the 7,400 colleges and trade schools participating in these aid programs. President Clinton's appointees are acting more aggressively than any education leaders in years. They plan to add several hundred staff positions to the financial aid section, create the department's first training program for auditors and triple to 1,000 the number of schools that are placed on a strict reimbursement schedule for their Federal aid grants.
They have also started taking advantage of new tools in the 1992 Higher Education Act, the most ambitious attempt by Congress in a long time to cut waste and abuse.
For example, that law allows the Education Department to give provisional approval to new schools seeking to participate in financial aid programs. In the first two years, these schools can be immediately terminated from aid programs with virtually none of the appeals that usually stymie the department. About 160 schools were given provisional approval last year.
But the history of Federal student aid programs is that time works against stricter regulation. Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Investigations Subcommittee, held hearings on trade school fraud in 1975; by the mid-80's, he said: "It all reoccurred. It takes constant monitoring."
The trade schools worked hard last fall to amend the 1992 law to their liking. "We did have several substantial successes," says a recent Career College Association newsletter sent to 1,300 member schools.
The trade schools' biggest victory was amending the department's procedures for using student loan default rates as an enforcement tool against problem schools -- typically trade schools, which have a default rate six times higher than public four-year colleges.
 
The Loan-Default Rule
 Since 1991, the Education Department has had the authority to terminate a school from the loan program if more than 30 percent of the school's students defaulted for three straight years. It is one of the department's most effective tools and has been partly responsible for a decline in loan defaults, from $3.6 billion in 1991 to $2.5 billion last year. Some of the worst abuses in recent years have involved trade schools that signed up any warm body they could find for Federally guaranteed student loans, ultimately leaving the Government stuck with the bill when the students defaulted on the loans.
Last fall at the Senate hearings, Dr. Longanecker, the Assistant Secretary, asked for Congressional support on the trade schools' attempt to weaken this enforcement tool. He did not get it.
In November, the education committees in Congress approved a measure, now signed into law, that gives a school the right to challenge a default rate before the department publishes it. Moreover, it gives the school an additional ground for appeal after publication, the right to challenge whether loans were properly serviced.
Stephen Blair, president of the trade school association, says his schools' default rates are higher because they give opportunities to poor inner-city students. He points out that the trade schools have won several legal challenges to the Education Department's calculation of rates, and that the new appeal procedure is necessary to guarantee that Government default rates are accurate.
But, says Dr. Longanecker of the Education Department, "Everyone appeals."
Describing one school that could have been "kicked out two years ago," he said education officials had calculated its default rate at 53 percent. After the school appealed, the rate was recalculated to be 51, "and it's still going on," he said. (He refused to identify the school.)
 
Lobbying by Schools
Laws Mean Well, But Don't Sit Well

The trade school lobbyists are still working on modifying the new "85-15" rule in the 1992 Higher Education Act, which is scheduled to go into effect next fall. The rule says that if a school is to qualify for Federal student aid, no more than 85 percent of its revenue can come from Federal student aid programs. It was sponsored by Representative Maxine Waters, a Democrat whose California district is the poor, heavily black core of Los Angeles,and who wants to insure that these schools are good enough to attract students willing to invest their own money.
Representative Waters says the poor are too often victims of trade schools that get virtually all their money from Government grants, offer worthless courses and skim student aid money, leaving students unqualified for jobs and entangled with legal problems because they cannot repay the loans.
The trade school lobbyists say that if the 85-15 rule takes effect, two-thirds of their schools will be harmed and many in urban areas will be forced to close. Mr. Blair has started lining up support, including Representative Dale E. Kildee, Democrat of Michigan.
"Congressman Kildee, a senior member of the House education and labor committee and nine other committee members have also pledged to help us with this issue," says Mr. Blair's newsletter. "Keep up the pressure on your members of Congress."
According to its latest available tax return, the trade school association spent $1.9 million on its lobbying and advertising in 1992.
A spokesman for Mr. Kildee said the Democrat's district in Flint, Mich., includes several trade schools that serve the poor and would be hurt by the amendment.
College and university lobbyists plan a busy spring, too. To supplement the Education Department's meager enforcement staff, the 1992 law creates a formal partnership between Federal and state regulators. The idea is to stretch resources and minimize regulatory duplication. The new effort, the State Postsecondary Review Program, lets state regulators audit a college's management of not only state, but also Federal aid programs, giving states the power to take enforcement action for state or Federal violations. The law also gives states $22 million in Federal money for extra enforcement workers.
Dr. Longanecker strongly supports the new law, but predicts "we'll get a lot of pressure and we may get efforts to change the law."
In the first week of January, representatives of 20 major universities, including Georgetown, Duke and Ohio State, visited Education Secretary Richard W. Riley to voice their concern that the law could be misused by states to go beyond financial aid issues and politically interfere with university policies. Dr. Atwell, president of the universities' lobbying groups, warned in a recent newsletter of the possibility that "we will seek legal redress."
Dr. Longanecker believes the law would survive a legal challenge; but he also knows what a legal challenge can do to enforcement. "The law is unambiguous," he said. "They won't win litigation on it. But as we've found, litigation is a wonderful way to make more money. If you can stay in, ripping people off, you can make more money."
 
Lobbying by Politicians
Mighty Friends For Weak Schools
 Hardly a day goes by when someone does not seek extra consideration from Dr. Longanecker, Deputy Secretary Madeline M. Kunin or Mr. Riley -- sometimes the very people preaching fiscal control. "The phone rings the minute you clamp down," said Ms. Kunin.
Mr. Levin of Michigan sits on the Senate subcommittee that has been exposing the regulatory failures in the Education Department's student aid programs since 1990. On Oct. 5, three weeks before the panel's most recent hearings, he held a lengthy meeting with Mr. Riley about keeping Jordan College eligible for Federal aid. Ten days after the hearings, on Nov. 6, the Senator held a meeting in his office with Dr. Longanecker and top education staff members on behalf of Jordan.
In 1991 and 1992, Mr. Levin won assurances from the Bush Administration that it would keep Jordan eligible, and in an Oct. 6, 1993, letter to Mr. Riley, he sought similar assurances, asking "no adverse proceedings against Jordan."
Education officials say Jordan would probably have been barred from aid programs years ago if not for the Senator's efforts. The Department has calculated Jordan's most recent annual default rates as 35 percent, 51.7, 46, 58 and 46. Jordan has appealed the two most recent rates.
Mr. Levin's letter to Mr. Riley says that for 1991-1993, "the college balanced its operating budget." Dr. Longanecker says recent department reviews show Jordan "running a very substantial deficit." He adds, "Without doubt it's a marginal institution."
Education regulators want Jordan to post a $3 million bond to guarantee the $6 million a year in aid it receives. Mr. Levin asked Secretary Riley to reduce that to $300,000.
 
Worthy Cause, Weak Financing
 Mr. Levin stresses the good record that Jordan graduates have in finding jobs. Recent Federal audits indicate graduation rates between 7 and 25 percent. When asked about Jordan's accreditation, he answered, "My understanding is that it's been accredited."
Jordan is not accredited, said Dr. Steven Crow, deputy director of North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.
Senator Levin says this is a school with a mission to help the disadvantaged, where 60 percent are poor, minority students, manysingle mothers. "You can't treat a school like this nonprofit as a profit-making school," the he said. "Staff has mortgaged its own houses, not taken salaries at times to carry out an idealistic mission."
Dr. Longanecker says Jordan's leaders appear to be "principled, well-meaning folks having a difficult time bringing their ideas into practice." He also says he has a responsibility to taxpayers and students whose education may be jeopardized if a school is not financially viable. And he notes that other nearby public colleges serve poor and minority students and are viable.
Last December, after more meetings with Senator Levin's staff, Dr. Longanecker gave Jordan another extention, 60 extra days to respond to the Federal auditors' latest review. The college is trying to raise $3 million from eight corporations to enhance its financial stability; Jordan's president, Lexie Coxon, said she got the first company to commit last Friday.
"The Secretary thinks a great deal of Senator Levin personally," says Dr. Longanecker, who adds: "We're running up against the time deadline and should know soon. We have to do what we have to do."

HEADLINE: Japanese Premier Is Forced To Drop Plan for Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Facing the harshest personal attacks of his tenure, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa suffered a humiliating blow this morning when he was forced to abandon a plan for a $55 billion cut in income taxes and an even larger increase in sales taxes after three years.
Ichiro Ozawa, the strategist behind Mr. Hosokawa's increasingly frail coalition Government, brought the governing coalition back from the brink of a split when he said at a news conference that efforts to find a compromise tax plan had failed and that the coalition parties had decided to start over. 
 But the battle over the plan, which was intended to pull the economy out of a deep recession and rebalance the tax system, has clearly left Mr. Hosokawa badly damaged just a week before he is scheduled to have a critical meeting with President Clinton in Washington.
The United States and Japan remain far apart on a range of trade issues, and Mr. Hosokawa's defeat today is likely to reduce his power to hammer out a compromise with Washington.
Although Mr. Hosokawa reportedly apologized to his Cabinet today, saying he had failed to maintain "sufficient contact among the Government ruling coalition parties," the anger did not subside, either within the coalition or outside it.
Mr. Ozawa's comments this morning left it unclear when a new plan would be announced, which could anger businessmen and financiers anxious about the fragile state of the economy.
 
A Day and a Half to Forget
 The news capped about the worst 36 hours of Mr. Hosokawa's time as Prime Minister.
The normally superbly controlled and highly visible Prime Minister stumbled through a news conference at 1 A.M. Thursday when he announced the proposals. He then all but disappeared as business leaders and politicians, including some from his own party, took turns lambasting the plan and his leadership.
A number of Cabinet members had threatened to resign, to fight the upcoming budget in Parliament, and to push the Government toward collapse.
"Everyone makes mistakes, but then we have to admit it and correct them," said Masayoshi Takemura, the chief Cabinet secretary and head of the Harbinger Party, one of Mr. Hosokawa's staunchest supporters.
In addition, some economists have warned that even with the huge size of the stimulus measures, the economy has grown so weak that the package might simply halt the deterioration rather than bring a healthy rebound.
"This plan would simply help avoid negative growth," said Hirohiko Okumura, of the Nomura Research Institute. "At best, we'll start to see some improvement in the economy toward the second half of the year."
Mineko Sasaki-Smith, the economist here with Morgan Stanley Japan, said that by her estimates only about half of the income tax reductions would be spent, with the rest likely to be saved by consumers. That could make the subsequent increase in sales taxes even more burdensome and reduce the overall benefits to the economy.
Mr. Hosokawa apparently took some members of his coalition Government by surprise when he announced Thursday that he had decided on a $55 billion reduction in income and local taxes, most of it retroactive to January.
The tax cut was part of a huge economic stimulus package that was also expected to include about $83 billion in public works, low-interest loans to businesses and other spending increases.
The economic package was supposed to have been announced Thursday afternoon, but the release was delayed because of the uproar over taxes.
The delay could also strain already difficult relations with the United States, which has been pushing for a big stimulus plan as a means of drawing in more imports and reducing Japan's trade surpluses.
The economic stimulus plan was intended as the one unequivocal sign that the Japanese government was serious about reducing the trade surplus.
What angered many political and business leaders was the fact that Mr. Hosokawa rejected the advice of his own coalition partners and accepted the arguments of Finance Ministry bureaucrats in insisting on the increase in sales taxes to cover the loss of income tax revenues.
The conservatives in the coalition support the Finance Ministry bureaucrats and argue that without the tax increase the Government's budget deficits would rise dangerously.
Most members of the coalition, including the most outspoken opponents of Mr. Hosokawa's proposals, agree that some measures must be taken to prevent deficits from mounting. But they say that since such an increase is likely to be immensely unpopular and since it is likely to fall hardest on low-income people, more time must be set aside for debating the issue and preparing the public for the blow.

HEADLINE: Reagan Birthday Is a Gift to His Party

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Ronald Wilson Reagan, now almost 83 but still as ruddy-cheeked as if he had just finished clearing brush, showed up in town tonight to talk up America and poke fun at liberals for 2,500 well-dressed Republicans.
The excuse for the party was Mr. Reagan's birthday, which is Sunday, but that was the thinnest of veneers for the real purpose, to raise money for the Republican National Committee's political operations. 
 It was the committee's 1994 Annual Gala, a mildly deceptive title since, as the party's spokesman, Chuck Greener, noted, "This is the first event of this kind the Republican National Committee has held in 12 years."
When Mr. Reagan and George Bush were President during that span, such morale-boosting events were unnecessary, and money flowed in nearly as fast as the thousands of bottles of Renaissance Vineyard wines, donated for the occasion, flowed tonight.
 
Vintage Reagan
 As spotlights raked the vast pillared hall of the National Building Museum and Doc Scantlin and his Imperial Palms Orchestra made mood, Mr. Reagan delivered a half-hour of unalloyed boilerplate from his eight years of President. He called America "a bright beacon of hope and freedom," cursed "the shackles of too much government," hailed "the collapse of imperial Communism" and recalled the Democratic years of "rampant inflation and crushing interest rates -- when hope was scarce."
He made the requisite joke about his age. "As most of you know, I'm not one for looking back," he said. "I figure there will be plenty of time for that when I get old."
As seen on four minivan-sized screens hung from the balcony, Mr. Reagan's wife, Nancy, looked on adoringly. Lady Margaret Thatcher, the former British Prime Minister and Mr. Reagan's ideological soul mate in the 1980's, shared the dais and provided a reading of the former President's best speeches.
There was a heart-tugging video: Ronald Reagan at the cliffs of Normandy; Mr. Reagan with Mother Teresa; Mr. Reagan receiving the bodies of slain soldiers. The effect was a mild case of slipping back in time, as if Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey donned shorts and began sinking push shots at a Knicks game, or Bob Hope and Brooke Shields appeared on an aircraft carrier before a crowd of sailors.
 
The Crowd Loved Him
 Those who flew in from around the nation and paid $1,000 a seat for the show, basked in the afterglow and roared when their hero cocked his head and said: "With all that's going on right now, I'm afraid I'm not going to run for President in '96. However, I have not ruled out the possibility of running again in 2000."
And they burst into cheers when he added: "I hesitate to ask. But if I did run, could I count on you for your support?"
Mr. Reagan's political legacy has picked up a few dings in recent years. A November 1991 poll by The Los Angeles Times said a majority regarded him as only an average or below-average President.
But tonight Mr. Reagan, considerably grayer and slower-paced, but otherwise pretty much as the public left him five years ago, was aggressively burnishing his record. He accused Mr. Clinton of "grand larceny," saying the President had aped his rhetorical skills and his positions on crime and other issues for his State of the Union address.
 
A Weeklong Celebration
 "In the end, it all comes down to leadership," he said. "That is what this country is looking for now. Great nations have responsibilities to lead and we should always be cautious of those who would lower our profile, because they might just wind up lowering our flag."
It appeared to be red meat for the tuxedoed and spangled crowd, which Republican officials said had given $5 million to the cause during this week's Reagan birthday promotion.
This week because Mr. Reagan's birthday party has been going on in Washington since Wednesday morning and won't wind up until Friday. According to a schedule provided by the party, that is when the Eagles, a group of $15,000-a-year donors (or $20,000 if spouses are included) and the Chairman's Advisory Board ($5,000) arrived at the city's Mayflower Hotel for a round of receptions, sitdowns with Senate and House Republican leaders and hospitality sessions.
Team 100 ($25,000 a year) members flew in today to the Ritz Carlton, barely in time for lunch with Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, and high tea with Mrs. Thatcher.
This may sound very Republican, and, indeed, tonight's gala featured more fur coats than will ever be seen at any Democratic function. But the Democratic Party also has been doing this sort of thing for years and has been dangling an even bigger prize before its big donors -- time in the same room as the President -- since they retook the White House.
That said, the festivities did underscore one deep and basic difference between the parties. Except for a brief joke, Mr. Reagan stuck to his prepared text almost word-for-word, and finished his remarks in about a half-hour. Mr. Clinton, in contrast, peppered his State of the Union speech with diversions and off-the-cuff monologues -- and ran about twice as long.

HEADLINE: OPENING TO VIETNAM;
Sense of Relief, and One Of Betrayal, Are Evoked

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
For some, the announcement of economic coexistence with Vietnam was greeted with a sense that, finally, peace was at hand. For others, it seemed a final betrayal by the Government.
Bitterly denouncing the President's decision were some former prisoners of war and those who believe American troops listed as missing in action may still be alive. They said any accommodation with Vietnam would be wrong until a final accounting. 
 "All of us who were held as P.O.W.'s in Vietnam know first-hand that there are no limits to what the Vietnamese will do to show they are 'cooperating' with the United States to account for our missing comrades," a group of 70 former prisoners of war, including James B. Stockdale, a retired Navy admiral and Ross Perot's running mate in the 1992 election, said in a letter sent to President Clinton today.
In a fierce attack, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, called the embargo's end "the wrong decision at the wrong time for the wrong reason."
 
U.S. Can 'Move Forward'
 Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, said the decision "guarantees we keep faith with the veterans and families but that we continue to move forward."
"We have the most exhaustive, painstaking accounting in place in the history of warfare and I think we ought to be proud of that," Mr. Kerry added.
Addressing the disbelief and anger among the families of the missing, Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who lost a leg in Vietnam, said there had been "a great deal of lying on everybody's part in the 1970's. The families of the P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s are anguished because the government hadn't told them the truth. Now the Government is telling them the truth."
Senator Larry Pressler, a South Dakota Republican and Vietnam veteran, simply said, "The Vietnam War is finally over."
 
'A Few Pieces of Silver"
 For some families of the missing, "President Clinton has sold the morality of the American people for just a few pieces of silver by lifting the trade embargo and abandoned the leverage we had for gaining information on our loved ones," said Dolores Apodaca Alfond, who leads the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen, based in Seattle.
But for another set of families, Vietnamese who came to America seeking freedom and whose families remain there, the end of the embargo offered the hope of long-awaited reunions.
"It's time, you know -- there is no way to avoid it," said Thiep Le, who fled Vietnam in 1979 and is now a restaurateur in suburban Washington.
 
'Easier to Breathe' in Vietnam
 "Depending on whether the Vietnamese Government can exploit the opportunity positively, it will be a little bit easier to breathe for the ordinary people in Vietnam . If normalization is coming in the near future, people can go back and forth from here to Vietnam. My mother is still there, my sister's still there, but I've dared not to go back. In a few years, I can hope to go and come back safely."
Truyen Swinger, a Vietnamese woman married to an American doctor, said the decision made her "really happy" and gave substance to her dreams of starting a business in her homeland. "I'm thinking of opening a sewing factory in Vietnam," said Ms. Swinger, who runs a New York clothing design and manufacturing firm.
For Mimi Tran, one of four sisters who run Cuisine de Saigon at 154 West 13th Street in Manhattan, "there's a sad side, but there's a happy side, too" in the decision.
"There are lots of people who are stranded in the refugee camps in the Philippines -- I don't think they can gain entrance to the U.S. anymore," said Ms. Tran, who is 35 years old and came to the United States in 1968. "The happy side is we hope we're able to travel freely."
There is no such happiness for the groups demanding a final accounting of those missing in Vietnam -- and in Laos and Cambodia, where the United States conducted secret missions to root out Communist forces. They have found it hard to accept the official Government position that much has been accomplished and not much more can be done to trace those who disappeared in the war. Many of the groups contend that some of the missing are still alive, but White House and Pentagon officials say no credible evidence supports that belief.
 
'A Growing Cooperation'
 Noting that 78,000 soldiers remain listed as missing in action from World War II, Senator John Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, said Vietnam has shown "a growing cooperation" on the issue in recent years and has granted American military emissaries "complete access to go anywhere in Vietnam" in order to bring the number of unresolved cases down to a few hundred.
Official United States figures list 1,647 servicemen missing in Vietnam and a total of 2,238 unaccounted for in various areas of Southeast Asia. An additional 505 remain unaccounted for in Laos, 78 in Cambodia and 8 in China. The remains of 344 Americans have been returned and identified since the war, leaving 1,894 cases unresolved.
Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and former Navy flier who was a prisoner of war for more than five years, called again for a continuing efforts to trace those lost troops and added: "Beyond even that most important priority, the President has decided today to move the nation toward closure of a chapter in our history that has divided us for too long. I commend him for that decision, as would my comrades who did not come home."

HEADLINE: Nominee for State Department Job Faces Mideast Questions

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
American Jewish organizations and Republican senators have raised questions about the writings of Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State-designate, on Israel, which some say reflect at best ignorance, at worst hostility.
Two Jewish groups have gone on the offensive, sending excerpts around town from two columns that Mr. Talbott wrote for Time magazine and calling on President Clinton to withdraw his nomination. Mr. Talbott, who has been a close friend of Mr. Clinton since they were roommates at Oxford University, is now the State Department's ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union. 
 By contrast, other Jewish organizations have chosen to engage in a discussion with the nominee, although even they contend that he has a lot of explaining to do. Lester Pollack, the chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, and Malcolm Hoenlein, the director, met with Mr. Talbott for 90 minutes today.
"We communicated fully our concerns about some of the things he had written," said Mr. Pollack, whose organization is an umbrella for the country's 50 main Jewish groups, in a telephone interview. "These issues will be fully explored in the Senate hearings and he will have a chance to articulate his views."
 
Assurance by Christopher
 Mr. Hoenlein added that Secretary of State Warren Christopher assured them in a separate meeting that "this appointment would be consistent and in conformity with the policies of the Clinton Administration."
Senate Foreign Relations Committee members and their staff said that for the moment, Mr. Talbott is expected to win approval when he comes before the committee next Tuesday. Israeli officials have no problem with his nomination, saying that the Clinton Administration's support for both Israel and a comprehensive peace in the Middle East is stronger than ever. Mr. Talbott was preparing for his hearings and was not taking calls today.
Mr. Talbott made his reputation as a specialist on the Soviet Union as a correspondent and columnist for Time magazine. He has written little about the Middle East and what he has written is open to some interpretation. Nowhere is there any written or oral record of an animus toward Israel.
In a column entitled "How Israel is like Iraq" in October 1990, more than two months after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Mr. Talbott wrote that the Likud Party's claim, rooted in history, to the occupied territories "does indeed have something in common" with Iraq's territorial claim to Kuwait.
 
Talk of Greater Israel
 He added that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's "talk of 'greater Israel' is as ominous for the prospects of there ever being real and lasting peace in the region as Saddam's militant nostalgia for Nebuchadnezzar's Babylonian empire."
In a column nine years earlier, Mr. Talbott said Israel was "well on its way to becoming not just a dubious asset but also a downright liability to American security interests." He added that the close identification of the United States with Israel "has impeded American attempts to coordinate diplomacy with the European Community and it has complicated U.S. relations with most Third World countries and virtually all Islamic ones."
As is usual with high-level appointments, Mr. Talbott's nomination initially was praised widely in Washington but now has entered a more critical second stage, as questions have arisen not only about the columns but also about his judgment as a senior Government official. His confirmation hearings have taken on added importance since he is regarded as a potential candidate for Secretary of State some day.
 
Reversal on Russian Economy
 In Congressional testimony last week, Mr. Talbott renounced his eminently quotable, and much-criticized, remark that Russia's economy needed "less shock, more therapy," calling gradual reform a "prescription for hyperinflation and economic collapse."
Senator Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican, faults him for accommodating Russia too much by promoting a policy that did not offer a concrete timetable for NATO expansion.
Both the Zionist Organization of America and the National Jewish Coalition distributed excerpts of Mr. Talbott's writings. The Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, in its own news release, said that anyone who advocates such views "should be disqualified" from occupying such a post.
But some leaders of other Jewish organizations praised Mr. Talbott and criticized the campaign against him. "The very groups that are attacking him are the ones who consistently opposed the peace process, and they should not be allowed to derail the nomination on that basis," said Linda Heller Kamm, co-President of Americans for Peace Now.

HEADLINE: U.N. Security Council Warns Croatia on Troops in Bosnia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council warned President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia today that his country may face an economic embargo unless he withdraws the estimated 3,000 to 5,000 Croatian Army soldiers he has sent into Bosnia and Herzegovina to help Bosnian Croats resist Muslim attacks.
In a statement, the Council strongly condemned Croatia for this "serious hostile act" against another member state. It called for the withdrawal of all Croatian troops from Bosnia and Herzegovina and asked Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to report in two weeks on whether the forces have departed and removed their weaponry and other equipment. 
 If the Croatian soldiers have not withdrawn by then the Council warned Croatia that it "will consider other serious measures," a reference to the possibility of trade sanctions.
 
Compromise on Warning
 The final text represented a compromise between the Security Council's third-world members, who sympathize strongly with the Bosnian Muslims and wanted a specific threat of economic sanctions if the Croatian forces have not withdrawn by Feb. 10, and other members who favored a more cautious approach.
The Bosnian Government's mainly Muslim army has been fighting Bosnian Croat forces for nearly a year, and in recent months has been taking territory from them. In response, Croatia has sent units of the regular Croatian Army to assist the Bosnian Croats and to form a new alliance with Serbia, apparently directed against the Muslims.
In a letter to the Council on Wednesday, Mr. Boutros-Ghali estimated the number of Croatian Army troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina at between 3,000 and 5,000, or the equivalent of roughly three brigades. He said they have brought in heavy artillery and rocket launchers.
 
Council to Decide on Embargo
 The Secretary General said it would now be up to the Security Council to decide whether to impose a trade embargo on Croatia similar to the one it imposed on Serbia and Montenegro for supplying the Serbs fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Bosnian Foreign Minister, Irfan Ljubljankic, told a news conference on Wednesday that he believes as many as 20,000 regular Croatian troops are fighting in the country, backed by heavy weapons and aircraft.
The Secretary General's letter said the Croatian Army has provided manpower for the Croatian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina "for some time," although initially this support was limited to "individual and small sub-units, many of them volunteers."
As Bosnia's Muslim forces increased their offensive against the Croats in recent weeks, however, the Secretary General said "the numbers of Croatian soldiers appears to have increased."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Aide Says U.S. Ignores Genocide
 WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 (Special to The New York Times) -- In a scathing criticism of United States policy on Bosnia, a State Department official has accused the United States of deliberately ignoring "genocide" by Serbian leaders against Bosnian Muslims.
"Senior U.S. government officials know that Serb leaders are waging genocide in Bosnia but will not say so in plain English because this would raise the pressure for U.S. action," Richard Johnson, head of the State Department's Yugoslavia desk from 1990 to 1992, wrote in a paper prepared last month at the National War College.
The paper, which has been circulating in Washington for several weeks, says President Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and senior State Department officials have played down evidence that the so-called "ethnic cleansing" of Muslims in Bosnia constitutes genocide -- the systematic killing of a people -- under international law.
Mr. Johnson, who is still employed by the State Department, is the fifth official there to speak out against American policy toward the former Yugoslavia. The other four dissenters have resigned in protest during the past six months.
State Department officials declined comment on Mr. Johnson's paper.

Serbs Remove a Roadblock
 SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Feb. 3 (AP) -- Bowing to a United Nations threat of force, Serbs removed a roadblock today and gave peacekeeping troops access to Sarajevo.
The United Nations action was the first since the new peacekeeping commander in Bosnia, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, arrived last week.
General Rose was about to send a platoon of British soldiers and Warrior armored vehicles to the checkpoint on the road between Sarajevo and Kiseljak, west of the city, when Bosnian Serb militiamen reopened it, said a United Nations spokesman, Maj. Jose Labandeira. The platoon had been ordered "to press for the right of freedom of movement by negotiation initially, and by force if necessary," Major Labandeira said.

HEADLINE: G.M. Environmental Pact

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation, the world's largest industrial company, has agreed not to damage the environment.
The auto maker said yesterday that it would uphold the Ceres principles, once known as the Valdez principles. The standards are a code of conduct created by environmentalists and investment groups after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill on Alaska's coast. 
 Ceres, an acronym for Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, includes the Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation and the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility.
In return for support of the coalitions' principles, Ceres endorsed G.M.'s own environmental principles as "consistent with the goals of the Ceres principles." G.M.'s principles outline the company's commitment to reduce waste and develop technology for minimizing pollution.
John F. Smith Jr., the president and chief executive of G.M., based in Detroit, called the agreement "a successful case of two cultures coming together to find areas of agreement." He added, "We want to show that economic growth, technology and environmental quality can be compatible."
Denis Hayes, co-chairman of Ceres and head of the team that negotiated with G.M., said that although environmentalists still disagree with G.M. over such issues as electric vehicle mandates, the G.M.-Ceres agreement "will continue to be a forum for discussion."

HEADLINE: First Big Space Rocket Is Launched by Japanese

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Feb. 4

 BODY:
In a declaration of independence from the United States space program, Japan today launched its first large rocket built solely with its own technology.
The H-2 rocket, with "Nippon" painted on its side, blasted off at 7:20 A.M. from Tanegashima, an island in southern Japan. The powerful but complex first-stage engine, which was dogged during its development by explosions, fires and faulty welds, appeared to perform flawlessly, although complete data for evaluation are not yet available. 
 Japan, which did not launch its first satellite until a year after the United States landed on the moon, now boasts one of the world's most modern and powerful launching vehicles, albeit one of the most expensive.
 
'World-Class Level'
 "After 10 years of development, we see the launch has been safely completed," Takashi Matsui, vice president of the National Space Development Agency of Japan, said at a news conference at the agency's headquarters here. "At last, we have reached world-class level."
The 164-foot rocket is the first one made by Japan that can lift large communications and Earth-observing satellites into orbit, and will be used to hoist an unmanned space shuttle that might be completed by early in the next century.
Moreover, freed from restrictions that came from relying on the United States for rocket technology, Japan will be able to compete in the commercial satellite-launching business. It will also be able to orbit its own military reconnaisance satellites, an idea it has begun considering again recently so that it does not have to rely solely on the United States for information on crises like the threat from North Korea's nuclear program.
With so much riding on the H-2, Japan could ill afford a failure today. An accident would have damaged the credibility of Tokyo's budding space program for a long time.

 Still, for all the nail-biting by Japan's space authorities, the public hardly seemed excited. The morning news showed live coverage of the liftoff for only a few minutes, paying far more attention to a broiling political controversy over proposed tax changes.
After a two-day delay in the launching caused by bad weather and another one-day postponement because of a minor technical problem, this morning's liftoff was delayed for 20 minutes because a fishing boat was under the rocket's flight path.
While this was treated with some humor, the fishermen of Tanegashima are actually a big headache for the space program. Because launchings interfere with fishing, the space agency will effectively be limited to only two H-2 launchings a year. That is one of the factors that are raising the costs of the rocket and will make it extremely difficult for Japan to compete in the commercial satellite-launching business.
Within half an hour of liftoff, the H-2 released its cargo of two test spacecraft.
 
Landing in the Pacific
 One of them, known as the Orbital Re-entry Experiment, or Orex, is designed to test ceramic tiles and other items that will be used to prevent Japan's space shuttle from burning up as it re-enters the atmosphere. The Orex, which resembles a small flying saucer, circled the earth once and then successfully splashed down into the Pacific Ocean, surviving the heat of re-entry. Agency officials said they still must analyze how well the ceramic tiles performed.
The other craft is a test satellite that will operate only for about 100 hours, basically to confirm that the H-2 is capable of putting a satellite into orbit. The Vehicle Evaluation Payload, as it is called, entered into an elliptical "transfer" orbit that is used to move satellites from low Earth orbit into geosynchronous orbit, 22,300 miles above the Earth. A satellite in such an orbit remains in the same position relative to the earth.
Development of the H-2, which cost about $2.4 billion, represents the culmination of years of effort by Japan's space agency to wean itself from reliance on the American technology used in previous generations of rockets.
"If we have no vehicle, it is like a navy without ships," said Shigebumi Saito, former high commissioner of Japan's Space Activities Commission.
For the first stage of the rocket, Japan decided to develop a staged-combustion cycle engine using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as fuel. The technology, also used in the engines that launch the American space shuttle, provides great lifting power but is extremely complex.
The H-2 can deliver a 4,400-pound satellite into geosynchronous orbit, 22,300 miles above the equator, or a 22,000-pound payload into low earth orbit, about 155 miles from the surface.

HEADLINE: Bond Buyers Bet $1 Billion on China

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS

 BODY:
The Chinese Government and Merrill Lynch & Company patted themselves on the back yesterday after successfully completing a $1 billion offering of 10-year bonds. But a number of money managers who sat out the offering questioned whether investors might be at substantial risk because they became caught up in the excitement of the Communist giant's inching toward a market economy.
"Many people are eager to be involved with the Chinese," said James Calmas, a vice president of Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston, which did not buy the bonds. "And there's clearly plenty of economic growth to be had, but I don't know if you're being paid to take the political risk. What if China falls apart? What if we have another Tiananmen Square?" 
 Indeed, the sale came just a day after the Clinton Administration reiterated its criticisms of China's human rights policies and said Beijing had a long way to go to earn a renewal of its special trading privileges with the United States. The loss of these trade concessions would be a serious blow to the Chinese economy.
 
12% Annual Growth
 The bonds, offered at 6.5 percent, were priced Tuesday at $99.406, to yield 6.582, 85 basis points more than a 10-year Treasury note. At the heart of the prospectus prepared for the offerings, and clearly on the minds of many investors, is the fast-growing Chinese economy, which has expanded at a rate of 12 percent annually in the last two years.
Mr. Calmas noted that South Korea's debt had a higher credit rating than China's and its economic fundamentals are sounder, yet South Korean debt trades at 100 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, above United States Treasury securities.
Thomas G. Wolfe, director of fixed-income research at Neuberger & Berman, was another skeptic who passed on the deal. "Our feeling is that the political risk in China is difficult to quantify, and the bonds just don't provide value at that level," he said.
In his firm's view, he continued: "You can't just look at the financial numbers; you've got to look at the political risk. How do they work through a financial revolution without changing the political system at all, with a small dictatorship running the country?"
And Robert Citrone, portfolio manager of Fidelity Investments' New Markets Income Fund, said: "We think the fundamental levels are improving in China, but we're much more interested in buying Mexico, at about 160 basis points. And on the higher-quality side, we can buy Thailand and Malaysia for 70, 75 points. We feel that's better value than China at plus 85."
Yet a billion dollars' worth of investors clearly did not agree. Winthrop H. Smith Jr., the chairman of Merrill Lynch International, said at a news conference at Merrill Lynch's headquarters in lower Manhattan that there was "considerable interest on the part of retail investors." He said that he did not have final figures from the syndicate that joined in underwriting China's offering but that Merrill Lynch's share was placed 60 percent with American investors, 20 percent with Europeans and 20 percent with Asians.
"I'm very pleased this issue has been a great success," Jin Renqing, China's Vice Minister of Finance, said at the news conference.
Both men said the global offering, which was preceded by a financial review that led to higher ratings for Chinese debt from two agencies, would pave the way for additional bond and equity offerings. Mr. Jin declined to provide any details, saying they awaited Government decisions in March.
Mr. Jin said the $1 billion raised this week would be used to improve China's energy, transportation and communications systems. Asked if the rapidly expanding economy, and the infusion of cash, raised a specter of inflation, he said, no, the bond offering "will help keep the momentum in the economy."
Mr. Smith of Merrill Lynch noted that energy supplies, railways and roads and telecommunications were all "bottlenecks in the Chinese economy." Easing the problems, he said, would help combat inflation by lowering the cost of goods produced.
Mr. Jin said China currently carried about $70 billion in debt.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans Expanded Trade Zone

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is drafting a plan that would create a Western Hemisphere free trade zone in 10 to 15 years and, as a first step, add Chile to the North American Free Trade Agreement by late next year, Administration officials said today.
The plan not only responds to clamoring by Latin American countries to join the North American free trade club that now includes Mexico, but also recognizes that removing trade barriers can be a boon for Washington because the Latin American region is an enthusiastic, fast-growing market for United States exports. 
 With trade rather than aid as the centerpiece of his Administration's Latin policy, President Clinton is likely to unveil the free trade plan at a meeting of 34 of the hemisphere's leaders that is tentatively scheduled for the spring, Administration officials said. The plan, some officials say, could dominate the hemisphere's economic and political agendas in the next decade.
American policy makers say many details remain up in the air. For example, they have not decided whether the hemispheric trade zone should be put together by adding one country at a time to the North American agreement or by adding clusters of countries, like the Andean group of Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.
 
A Vision First, Washington Says
 Whatever is ultimately decided, the important thing, Administration officials say, is to provide Latin and Caribbean countries with a road map detailing what steps they must take -- like deregulating their financial markets -- to qualify for the free trade zone.
"It's important to articulate a vision," a senior official said, adding, "and when we do that, we need to make sure other countries will see some light at the end of the tunnel."
With many Latin American countries forming small regional trade zones with three, four or five members, American officials say it is up to Washington to be the catalyst to weld these smaller zones together into a single tariff-free market of 750 million people.
Administration officials say it is certain that Chile will be the next country allowed to join the Americas trade grouping. Negotiations with Chile are expected to begin this spring, with some officials predicting that it will be admitted to Nafta 15 to 18 months later.
Some officials argue that the Administration should not rush ahead with an expanded regional free trade plan because its trade team has its plate full with carrying out the North American accord, getting the new world trade pact ratified, and resolving disputes with Japan and China.
But others say that the meeting of Western Hemisphere leaders that Mr. Clinton is organizing will fall on its face unless he offers Latin and Caribbean leaders what they want -- a vision and a detailed plan of how hemispheric free trade can be built.
"All these countries are waiting for some leadership from the United States on how to proceed on this whole process," said Renato Tovar, a senior trade official with the Organization of American States.
 
Various Approaches Considered
 United States officials are looking at three ways to form a hemispheric free trade zone.
First, one by one. Countries would negotiate one at a time with the North American pact members -- the United States, Mexico and Canada. Chile, which has progressed furthest on market reforms and bringing down inflation, would be admitted first.
Then, Administration officials see a second group entering three to five years later: Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, Costa Rica and perhaps Bolivia. Brazil, with more than 150 million people, could be part of this second group if it seriously attempts market reforms and anti-inflation measures.
The other Latin nations might join in a decade or so, assuming that they do more to deregulate their economies, reduce inflation and otherwise make themselves more competitive.
The second approach would be to organize cluster by cluster. Regional free trade groups like Mercosur -- which consists of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay -- would negotiate to enter all at once. Other such regional organizations include the Andean Group, the Caribbean nations and the Central American Common Market. Some officials say it would be awkward negotiating with such groups, but they think this approach could be effective in pushing several nations at once to undertake market-oriented changes.
Finally, there is the building-block approach. All the regional trade groups would take coordinated steps to harmonize their economies, with the goal of creating sufficient cohesiveness to allow for a trade zone. Among the suggested steps would be adopting similar product standards, investment and intellectual-property rules, and setting minimal environment and labor standards.
 
Some Resistance Expected
 "All this is not going to happen overnight," said Jeffrey Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. "It is not going to be easy for many countries to meet our thresholds for qualification."
In both the United States and Latin America, there could be a backlash against a trade zone. Unions and some industries fought Mexico's joining the North American trade zone, and opposition to admitting other nations can be expected.
But Administration officials express confidence that the opposition will be far less intense because these countries are farther away than Mexico and do not seem to be the same sort of competitive threat.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
One contrarian favors investing in 'things' rather than 'paper.'

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
IT takes a brave person to republish his past market predictions. James Grant recently did just that, in a book with footnotes on how things turned out.
Currently, with stock prices soaring and bond prices stable, he is showing more fortitude still in arguing against securities and for commodities -- preferring "things," as he puts it, to "paper." 
 Paper, in the form of stocks and bonds, has for him become too expensive, and too vulnerable to both the early stirrings of inflation and rising interest rates in a reviving economy. Some of his favorite things include gypsum wallboard, nickel, soybeans, coffee, cement, drilling rigs and platinum. He favors a few commodity-based stocks, offshore oil and natural gas drillers among them. But he suggests that large, aggressive investors short some commodity stocks and buy the commodities.
Mr. Grant's contrarian scent, and a good whiff of eccentricity, wafts from nearly every page of his book, "Minding the Market," and his newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer. "I am almost physically incapable of lining up with a consensus," he writes in his book. "Agreement inflames my native obstinacy."
Given Wall Street's mission to merchandise stocks and bonds, Mr. Grant naturally tends towards pessimism -- though with enough self-consciousness to sell ties decorated with bears in barrels.
His subjects are rarely the stuff of Letterman monologues. But if you ever want to say something snappy about nickel or linerboard prices, Mr. Letterman, call Jim Grant.
"Now that the price of nickel has vaulted by 30 percent in a matter of weeks, the world would like to know if global industrial recovery can be far behind," Mr. Grant recently wrote. "Another question: If recovery is not in the wings, what does the market think it's doing? Also, is now the time to buy the very metal in which so many bottom fishers have lost line, bait, lunch and boat?"
 His cautious case for commodities comes from low prices, tight inventories, reviving demand, new markets in developing nations and investors' assumption that inflation is dead.
For a leveraged bet on natural gas prices, he recommends companies that lease their rigs out for exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. Cold weather has already diminished natural gas supplies, with several wintry weeks left.
The Chiles Offshore Corporation of Houston has improved its efficiency enough to be turning some profits even with depressed lease rates, Jeremy Diamond, the Grant's newsletter publisher, said. Its stock, which closed yesterday at $5.375, sells at an especially steep discount to the cost of replacing its fleet with new -- but not used -- rigs.
As for platinum, Mr. Grant figures that with a price no higher than gold right now, disruptions in South Africa and any renewed global demand could cause a squeeze. Stock investors wanting to bet on platinum, however, have to search out such exotic South African companies as Rustenburg and Impala. Otherwise, he reckons that many commodity-related stocks are overpriced relative to things.
Although gold stocks have dipped recently, he still prefers the metal itself. And while Starbucks might seem like more of a "Sleepless in Seattle" life-style play than a commodity bet, Mr. Grant finds better value in bulk coffee beans than publicly traded espresso bars.
Even Mr. Grant says that it's too early to predict more than a gradual acceleration in commodity prices. But, as his book records, he was also early in warning about deflation a few years ago when leveraged real estate (see Trump and the Reichmanns) seemed the way to make inflation pay.
He was quick to sniff out the risks of over-leveraged airlines and junk bonds in general, but derided some deals, like Safeway, that have worked out -- for investors, if not employees. And so far, stock and bond investors have ignored his warnings that President Clinton is no friend.
In the current cycle, however, leverage and real estate are winning some converts, among them Mr. Grant. At current interest rates, better to be a borrower than a lender, or bond buyer, he says.

HEADLINE: A Little Law School Does Battle With the A.B.A.

BYLINE: By MARGOT SLADE

 BODY:
Last year a young law school in Massachusetts failed to win accreditation from the American Bar Association.
If that occurrence seemed entirely unremarkable at the time, the same cannot be said now. In fact, it may prove to have been the flashpoint of an uprising that, in the extreme, could ultimately cripple the association's 70-year-old authority to accredit American law schools. 
 The spurned institution, the little-known Massachusetts School of Law, in Andover, has only 800 or so students but responded to the rejection like a behemoth. It filed an antitrust suit that challenges the A.B.A.'s accreditation process, charging that a select group of association insiders acts as a kind of cartel by imposing costly and unnecessary standards that protect the financial interests of professors, law librarians and standardized-test services.
The cost of this protection is shouldered largely by students, the suit argues, because they are frequently denied a solid legal education placing emphasis on practice -- rather than on theory -- that they could acquire from innovative law schools that see the folly of the association's standards and are unwilling or unable to abide by them.
 
A Rise of 'Vital Issues'
 "If the bar association loses the suit, the whole house of cards falls apart," said Colin S. Diver, the dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
Like most other law school deans interviewed, Mr. Diver said he knew little about the Massachusetts School of Law and had "no opinion of whether it is any good or deserves accreditation." But the school's broadside, he said, has "raised vital legal and philosophical issues" about the association's power over legal education.
The association's accrediting officers and their supporters are less impressed, particularly with the suit's argument that the standards discriminate against innovative schools.
Henry Ramsey Jr., dean of the Howard University Law School, who is former chairman of the A.B.A.'s accreditation body, stressed that the standards were nothing other than minimum requirements, then added:
"Once you meet them, you can go ahead and be as innovative as you want. I don't think any fair-minded or objective person looking at legal education can say that the accrediting criteria stifle innovation. Just look at the schools that are innovative and have been accredited."
 
Attack on Two More Fronts
 While the suit begins making its way through the pipeline of the Federal courts, the Massachusetts School of Law has not stopped there. It has also asked the United States Department of Education to strip the association of all accrediting power. And next Tuesday in Kansas City, Mo., it will go over the head of the A.B.A.'s accrediting arm -- the 18-member Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar -- and appeal directly for approval from the policymaking House of Delegates, meeting in convention. After a floor debate on Tuesday morning, the delegates are scheduled to vote to either grant or deny accreditation.
Certainly the association's leadership cannot relish either prospect. By accrediting the school, the delegates would be overturning the decision of the legal education section, a public slap at the accrediting arm that would apparently be without precedent.
But by rebuffing the school, the delegates would be inviting a continuation of the antitrust case, its outcome uncertain.
The suit contends that within the legal education section, a small group of law school deans, professors, law librarians and practitioners have controlled accreditation for the last 20 years, rotating among formal positions on committees, councils and boards that deal with law school practices.
By enforcing its own standards on matters like student-teacher ratios, the number of hours professors may teach, even faculty salaries and the books that a school must purchase for the library, this group illegally controls competition among law schools, the suit says.
 
Longtime Authority
 At stake in the outcome is the system that has governed American legal education for three-quarters of a century. The A.B.A., now recognized by the Department of Education as an accrediting agency, has had such power as a practical matter since 1921. It was then that the states' highest courts, which control admission to the practice of law, granted the association supervisory educational authority.
In 42 states, graduation from an A.B.A.-accredited school is now a prerequisite for taking the bar examination. "Obviously this makes it difficult for us to attract more students," said Lawrence R. Velvel, the dean of the Massachusetts School of Law. "Right now our students can take the Massachusetts bar exam, since we are accredited by the state. But they cannot practice in most other states, and they cannot transfer to or do postgraduate work at A.B.A.-approved law schools."
James P. White, who as the A.B.A.'s Consultant on Legal Education is a central member of the small group that the lawsuit portrays as a cartel, declined to speak of the suit in detail. But, like Mr. Ramsey of Howard University, he dismissed any notion that the standards had been a negative influence on education.
Mr. White also noted that since 1973, when the association adopted its current standards, it had accredited 25 new law schools, more than 80 percent of the schools that had sought approval during that period. There are now 176 A.B.A.-accredited law schools in the United States, he said.
Among the association's standards is a requirement that the ratio of students to full-time faculty be no more than 30 to 1. The association also requires that faculty members be paid salaries comparable to those at competing schools, and, for the sake of research and classroom preparation, it limits the average number of hours that a professor may teach (10 a week), as well as the number of months (nine a year).
"Many of the standards are too detailed, too specific," said Lance Liebman, dean of the Columbia University Law School, "like the number of chairs you have to have in your library, the number of books on the library shelves, which doesn't make sense at a time when students can get much of this information electronically on computer."
 
The Cost of Education
 Mr. Velvel, the dean at the Massachusetts School of Law, argues that "the current accreditation criteria strike at the very heart of our mission, which is to provide affordable, high-quality legal education to people from less-than-privileged backgrounds." These, he said, include "minority members, white ethnics, middle-aged people changing careers and members of the working class -- people who cannot afford the prevailing law school tuitions that run from $15,000 to $20,000 a year."
Tuition at his school is $9,000 a year, Mr. Velvel said, a result, in part, of using a large number of adjunct professors active in the practice of law, rather than a requisite number of full-time academics, and of relying on electronic data bases and interlibrary loans instead of "expensive hard-cover volumes of statutes and court decisions that the A.B.A. wants to see on our library shelves."
The association's officers say that the current standards have been under review for months and that new ones will probably be drawn up in the next year. "That includes the library standards, which should take account of modern technology," Mr. White said.
But he and other current and former A.B.A. officials reject the suit's contention that innovation has been stifled. Mr. Ramsey, for example, cited accredited schools like the City University of New York Law School, which has a "heavy emphasis on clinical education and service in the public sector, very different from mainstream law schools"; the Vermont School of Law, with its emphasis on environmental law, and George Mason Law School, "which certainly marches to a different drummer" by emphasizing law and economics."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Did Fed Tighten? Opinion Is Split

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The financial markets swirled with speculation yesterday that the Federal Reserve Bank had nudged short-term interest rates higher, reversing a three-year trend toward lower rates.
But some economists strongly disagreed, saying the nation's central bank would be unlikely to signal a tightening in credit conditions before its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, completes its two-day meeting today. 
 In the credit market, interest rates roses. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/32 , while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.30 percent, from 6.28 percent on Wednesday.
Increases in short-term yields were even sharper because of the speculation that the Fed would move soon to push interest rates higher. For example, the yield on the two-year note rose to 4.27 percent from 4.18 percent.
 
Fed Expected to Act
 Financial and economic experts widely expect the Federal Reserve to tighten short-term interest rates sometime this year to help contain nascent inflation pressures growing out of the economic recovery, which accelerated last quarter.
Such a move could have enormous implications for an array of interest rates in the economy -- everything from home mortgages to savings accounts -- and for the pace of economic growth.
But some experts said yesterday's speculation was a better indicator of skittishness in the financial markets than Federal Reserve monetary policy.
"I don't think the New York Fed desk would do anything right now, in the middle of the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis.
Stirring the debate was the Fed's unexpected failure to add reserves to the banking system shortly before noon yesterday. The Fed had been expected to add reserves, as it routinely does, to help set the Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks. The perceived target for the rate has been 3 percent since September 1992.
 
Failure to Intervene
 Since the Federal funds rate rose as high as 3 1/2 percent yesterday morning, up from 3 1/4 percent late Wednesday, the Fed's failure to intervene was seen as a sign that it wanted to push up the rate a quarter percentage point to 3 1/4 percent.
The Federal funds rate ended the day at 31/16 .
Among those believing the Fed was sending a tightening signal was David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company.
"I think they tipped their hand that they are in the process of a tightening step, which will be officially confirmed tomorrow," Mr. Jones said.
Mr. Jones said the Fed would have been sure to intervene yesterday if it had no intention of tightening, in order to allay concerns at a time when the financial markets are so sensitive to the possibility.
A Fed spokesman had no comment on the subject, reiterating the central bank's policy of not immediately commenting on possible monetary policy changes.
Lending to the market's skittishness was Congressional testimony early this week by the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, in which he said he expected rates to rise. However, he did not specify a timetable.
 
Overreaction Seen
 Scott Winningham, chief market analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J., said the bond market overreacted to the perceived tightening by the Fed.
"For that inaction to have had any policy implications, it would have meant that Greenspan and the staff at the desk decided, hours before the full committee was to vote, to make the first change in policy in three and a half years," he said.
Alan Levenson, money market economist at the UBS Securities unit of the Union Bank of Switzerland, agreed. "I'm squarely in the camp there was no tightening action today. We're on the cusp of a trend reversal in interest rates. The Fed isn't going to be ambiguous about this," he said.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 4.06 to 1,304.70.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10412/32 , down 1/32 from late Wednesday. The average yield to maturity was 5.52 percent, up from 5.43 percent.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Jumped 13.8% Last Month

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 3

 BODY:
United States automotive sales surged 13.8 percent in January, despite the effects of the Los Angeles earthquake and severe winter weather, suggesting that the demand for new cars and light trucks is outpacing bullish forecasts.
Car buyers seem to be moving up their purchases of new cars faster than auto makers and economists had expected. The reasons for this are the high average age of cars and trucks on the road, as well as increases in employment, personal income and consumer confidence. 
 The gains have led some analysts to predict that there may soon be shortages of certain models. The strong demand has also resulted in smaller discounts and lower rebates, enhancing dealers' profits.
 
 
 
'Can't Get Enough'
 "The biggest problem is not the economy or the environment," said Roger Williams, president of Jack Williams Automall in Fort Worth. "It's that we can't get enough Chevrolet trucks and Jeep Cherokees to sell."
Mr. Williams said the demand had pushed up the price of used cars, and he expected his inventory of new vehicles to remain slim until at least March.
Al Rivera, a manager of Eger Subaru in Bridgeport, Pa., said he expected sales to remain strong through February because "many people had their cars damaged or totaled" in winter storms and would need replacements.
One factor in the sales surge is the high average age of cars and trucks on the road. The average has risen to nearly eight and a half years, the highest since the Korean War, according to estimates by Dean Witter. In addition, the median family income was $37,232 in the third quarter of 1993, compared with $36,088 a year earlier.
 
 
 
Beyond Expectations
 In recent weeks, investors have been reacting to a growing consensus among investment professionals and economists that the United States is firmly in the midst of a cyclical automotive recovery that could last through 1996.
"No one thought the numbers would be this strong," said Joseph S. Phillippi, automotive analyst for Lehman Brothers in New York. "If this is for real, you have to scratch your head and wonder whether the suppliers will have enough parts for all the cars that are going to get built."
Reacting to the sales report, the stocks of the biggest American auto makers rose sharply in heavy trading today, with shares of the General Motors Corporation hitting an all-time high of $63, up $1.50. Shares of the Ford Motor Company jumped $1.625, to $69.375, and Chrysler stock rose $1.25, to $62.50.
Total light-vehicle sales for the month were 1,024,678, compared with 900,357 in January 1993. Car sales rose 8.1 percent, to 611,714, while sales of light trucks, which include mini-vans, utility vehicles and pickups, rose 23.6 percent, to 412,964.
The Big Three auto makers grabbed a bigger share of the automotive market -- 74.1 percent, compared with 72.5 percent last January -- while the share of the Japanese auto makers dropped to 21.9 percent, from 22.4 percent a year earlier.
The reason is twofold. Domestic models are regarded by consumers as better values because the strong yen has driven up the price of Japanese models. And the market for light trucks, a segment in which domestic manufacturers are stronger than their Japanese competitors, has been the nation's fastest growing.
 
 
 
Dealers Are Pleased
 Many retail dealers were ecstatic about the increases in volume and higher selling prices.
"Considering we lost one week of sales, we still did pretty good, equal to our projections," said Chris Wright, the owner of Wright Motors Cadillac-GMC in Evansville, Ind., referring to bad winter weather.
Car sales at G.M. rose 13.6 percent for the month, to 211,701. Light-truck sales rose 21.7 percent, to 135,065. Sales of G.M. cars built in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which are considered domestic production, rose 14.8 percent, to 208,476.
Car sales at Ford rose 1.2 percent, to 133,650, from a year earlier; light-truck sales rose 34 percent, to 127,286. Sales of Ford cars built in North America were up 3.6 percent, to 132,353.
Car sales at Chrysler rose 1.3 percent, to 60,667; light-truck sales rose 18.2 percent, to 97,612. Sales of Chrysler's domestic cars were up 6 percent, to 58,356.
Toyota's imported and domestic car sales fell 4.1 percent, to 45,760; light-truck sales rose 17.2 percent, to 21,539. Honda's imported and domestic car sales rose 14.2 percent, to 47,873. Nissan's car sales fell 4.2 percent, to 31,529; the company's light-truck sales rose 33.5 percent, to 16,041.

Dollar Gains on Speculation About a Fed Rate Increase

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose against other leading currencies yesterday on speculation that the Federal Reserve may soon nudge up interest rates.
The speculation heightened after the Fed allowed the Federal funds rate -- the interest rate on short-term loans between banks -- to rise above 3 percent. 
 The target for the rate, which is closely guided by the Fed, is perceived to be 3 percent but Fed officials have warned a possible tightening may be coming.
 "The Fed didn't do anything, so people are taking it as a signal of a tightening," a dealer at a major European bank in New York said.
The market was particularly jittery because the Federal Open Market Committee -- the policy-making board of the central bank -- began a two-day meeting in Washington.
After hitting an intraday high of 1.7455 marks, the dollar ended at 1.7412 marks in late New York trading, up from 1.7328 marks on Wednesday.
Trading quieted down in the afternoon, however, as dealers awaited today's employment report for January. Traders said an especially bullish report, showing a further pickup in the economy, could cause the Fed to tighten.
"If they don't add money on Friday, some people will take it to mean the Fed is signaling that a tightening is taking place," Tom Benfer, senior marketing representative with Bank of Montreal, said.
Higher American interest rates add strength to the dollar because they make investments denominated in dollars more attractive.
The dollar only moved a little against the yen, despite the troubles of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan in ushering trough an economic stimulus package or wrapping up a trade deal with the United States.
The dollar rose to 108.23 Japanese yen in late New York trading from 107.90 yen on Wednesday.
Mr. Hosokawa is due to meet President Clinton next Friday, but Government officials on both sides of the Pacific have said the chances of an overarching pact by then were slim.
Meanwhile, gold prices rose, with gold for February delivery gaining $2.60, to $387.30 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4880, down from $1.4965 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: For Some Retailers, a Rough January

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Cold weather in the Northeast and the earthquake in California took their toll on retail sales last month, with some companies reporting sharp declines from figures a year earlier. But several analysts viewed the setback as temporary and said the industry's outlook remained strong for coming months.
Two big retailers that saw significant declines in January sales at stores open at least a year were the Limited Inc. and Charming Shoppes Inc., with sales down 9 percent at each company. January sales at the Mercantile Stores Company fell 7.6 percent from the comparable period last year. 
 Harsh winter conditions through much of the eastern half of the United States kept shoppers away from stores, as did the California earthquake, which also jarred the operations of some retailers in that state. Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., based in Los Angeles, reported a drop of 3.9 percent in January sales. Several of the company's stores remained closed for much of January because of earthquake damage.
Same-store sales are generally regarded as the best measure of retail performance because they exclude new stores that often do well but have not demonstrated sustained performance.
 
Small Gain for Retail Index
 Salomon Brothers said its retail index, a weighted average of monthly comparable-store sales of 22 large retailers, rose a disappointing 3.5 percent last month, compared with 4.3 percent in December and 5.4 percent in the comparable period a year ago.
"Weather distorted the January results," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retail analyst with Salomon Brothers. He added that sales growth in goods like television sets and electronic products had remained steady, while apparel sales had slowed because of a lack of fashion changes.
Traditionally, January is a slow time for department stores and other retail outlets, which use the month to dispose of merchandise that did not sell during the holiday season.
Still, there were some improved results. Sales at Sears, Roebuck & Company climbed 7.9 percent from the comparable period a year ago, while sales at J. C. Penney stores rose 4.6 percent.
Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group, which is based in New York City, credited strong advertising campaigns for part of the sales growth at the two retail chains. Mr. Barnard said both companies also continued to benefit from strong sales of home furnishings.
"The home has become the center of life again and that is where people are spending money," he said.
January sales at the Gap Inc. grew 3 percent, slightly below projections, Mr. Feiner said. The Woolworth Corporation also performed below expectations last month, with sales up 2.2 percent.
Mr. Feiner said that given the continuing growth in the economy and consumer confidence, he expected strong retail sales to resume this month and to continue through the first quarter.
Comparative results should also be strong because sales grew slowly during the early part of 1993, Mr. Barnard said.

HEADLINE: Orders Up A 5th Month At Factories

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Orders to factories rose for a fifth consecutive month in December, leading economists to predict a strong showing for manufacturing in 1994, but one that might not immediately help the jobless.
Orders to United States factories rose 1.2 percent in December, and helped drive up orders for the year by 5.9 percent, the Commerce Department reported today. It was the longest string of advances since a 10-month stretch from late 1987 to mid-1988. 
 Analysts said the length of the current rise was heartening, suggesting the expansion would sustain itself.
 
 
'Getting Somewhere'
 "We're getting somewhere," said Priscilla Trumbull, an economist with the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
But they were less optimistic about the prospects for reducing unemployment because much of the rise in factory orders is for new and better business equipment that increases productivity and may actually cut the work force.
"Manufacturers have had to invest to cut costs," Ms. Trumbull said. "The pattern has been to cut back on labor. It's painful for the workers."
While factory orders fell in five of the first seven months of 1993, the subsequent rebound has led to the best annual rise in five years.
The increase in 1993, to $3.1 trillion, was the second consecutive yearly advance and the largest gain since a jump of 8.4 percent in 1988. Orders rose 3 percent in 1992.
Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits rose by 59,000, to a seasonally adjusted 422,000, the highest level since July 25, 1992. But analysts said the figures might be distorted by unseasonably cold weather and other statistical glitches.
In December, factory orders totaled a seasonally adjusted $266 billion, up from $262.8 billion the previous month. Orders have risen every month since a decline of 1.9 percent in July.
 
 
Durable Goods
 Orders for durable goods, including items like cars and home furnishings, rose a revised 2.1 percent in December, to a seasonally adjusted $142.7 billion, also the fifth consecutive monthly increase.
The department initially estimated that durable goods orders rose 2.2 percent in December. For the year, they were up 8.7 percent, to $1.6 trillion.
Orders for nondurable goods like food and fuel increased two-tenths of 1 percent in December, to a seasonally adjusted $123.4 billion, the third increase in the last four months. For the year, they were up 2.9 percent, to $1.4 trillion.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Fines Goldman

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs & Company agreed today to pay a $250,000 fine to settle allegations of Federal securities law violations in the trading of United States Government bonds.
The Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Goldman of prearranged purchases and sales of United States Treasury securities with Salomon Inc. and other brokers in 1985 and 1986, mostly as a way of accumulating losses for income tax purposes. Securities law bars noncompetitive, prearranged trades without an element of risk. 
 The S.E.C. contended that Goldman realized a total of $36.6 million in losses as a result of the trades.
The S.E.C. complaint also accused the investment firm of falsely recording the trades on its books as bona fide market transactions.
Goldman settled the administrative action without admitting or denying wrongdoing. In a statement, the firm said, "All the trades were done at prevailing market prices, and thus the losses reflected actual economic declines in the value of the firm's positions in the securities it held." Goldman said it had "fully cooperated with the S.E.C.'s investigation."

HEADLINE: Arab Concern's Penalty Lifted

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The United States has lifted the sanctions on Arab Financial Services, a Bahrain-based company in which Libya has a minority stake, a company spokesman said today.
Arab Financial, owned by 56 Arab banks and financial institutions, had a growing business issuing traveler's checks and credit cards, but the dominant dollar side of the business was frozen when Washington imposed the sanctions in December over the destruction of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. 
 The action came after lobbying in Washington by Bahraini officials, and the top management of Arab Financial, financial sources said.
Last year, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ruled that Arab Financial was a Libyan company and froze its United States assets in line with a United Nations resolution on the Lockerbie bombing.
The decision forced Arab Financial to halt most of its operations, including sales of dollar-denominated traveler's checks and operations on its Visa credit cards.

The Economic Motive

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
"Like everything else," Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said, "the economy is a matter of psychology." And the psychology of peace, he said -- the belief that the conflict between Israel and its neighbors is at last coming to an end -- has set off an Israeli economic boom.
"Israel is going through one of its best periods economically," Mr. Peres told a press breakfast in Boston. "It has 7 percent growth, I think the best figure in the West. The impact [of peacemaking with the P.L.O.] has been very positive." 
 Reports from Israel confirm the picture of a boom. Business people there, and investors, had reckoned that Israel could never be a real part of the new world economy without stability in the region around it. Now a stable region seems possible, and investors are responding.
But what are the prospects for the current negotiations with the P.L.O.? reporters asked Mr. Peres. The breakthrough last September was supposed to lead to a detailed agreement by December, but the talks are still going on.
"Most of the complicated issues are behind us," Mr. Peres said. But it is a difficult negotiation, involving as it does "Palestinian dignity and Israeli security. And what we call security they call dignity."
He ducked a question about whether a final agreement could be reached by next week. But whenever it was, he said, it could be carried out quickly. The original target was for implementation by April, with the Palestinians then taking over administration of Jericho and the Gaza Strip.
Mr. Peres's tone was optimistic, more upbeat than I have ever heard him. He foresaw great changes in the Arab world, with countries moving toward more modern economies and more open societies.
"Dictatorship is a tremendous waste of money," he said. "Only rich countries can afford it."
Among the costs of autocracy he listed censorship, the cutting down of individual enterprise, corruption and the maintenance of the cult of personality. He said people everywhere were less willing to pay the price, and to live in misery, because they now could see how others in the world live.
"What brought down the Soviet Union was not a political party or a military coup but the winds of information. And that is happening everywhere."
One reason President Hafez al-Assad has moved, he said, is that Syria has an emerging middle class and has young people who see television and compare their lives with others'. The other reason is that the Soviet Union is gone, and President Assad needs new relationships.
"I wouldn't say that he's drawn all the necessary conclusions," Mr. Peres said; that must be tested in the resumed talks between Syrian and Israeli negotiators.
The problem for Israelis and Arabs and everyone, he said, is the psychological one of adjusting to a new world. "People usually prefer to remember than to think."
He rejected what a questioner said was strenuous opposition from some Orthodox Jews to the idea of peace with the Palestinians. We are determined, he said, "not to become a dominating nation -- something we have never been in history."
Readers of the Bible might raise an eyebrow at Mr. Peres's history, since many passages celebrate military victories. But what matters is the attitude of the present Israeli Government. "We must decide on our destiny," he said, "and the Palestinians on theirs."
He said Israel was trying to "build a regional economy, one that will help Arab countries even more than us." Israelis understand, he said, that poverty is destabilizing.
Mr. Peres mentioned one concrete example of regional cooperation that he said had already been agreed: a plan by Jordan, Israel and Egypt to connect their electrical grids. That could save the three countries billions of dollars in generating facilities because their peak hours of energy use are different.
The vision of peace may still founder on the rocks of memory. But the import of Mr. Peres's words is that peace has something stronger than hope going for it now. That is expectation. People on all sides will surely struggle to keep alive the vision on which they have begun to build.

HEADLINE: Vietnam Welcomes U.S. Decision on Embargo

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Feb. 4

 BODY:
In the crowded streets of a city still better known to the world as Saigon, there was a sense today that the war was finally over, the last battle concluded half a world away in the corridors of the White House.
The news that President Clinton had decided to lift the American trade embargo against Vietnam reached here today shortly before dawn, and by breakfast it was the only topic of conversation to be found in much of Ho Chi Minh City, the city that the Americans had to flee in humiliation a generation ago. 
 "A heavy burden has been lifted," said Lam Thanh Sy, a 38-year-old high school mathematics teacher who recalls the boyhood terror of rushing into a bomb shelter with his parents. "We in Vietnam have felt that we were not allowed to participate in the world as full citizens because of the embargo. Now at last we are allowed to forget the war."
 
A Matter of Perspective
 He was standing in the shadow of a large statue of Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese revolutionary leader, in a small, well-tended public park near city hall. A few feet away, a photographer, Hoang Hon Thanh, was snapping pictures of happy families posed beneath the statue.
"Me? I'm happy too," he said. "And I'm happy for a simple reason. Five years ago, I bought a Polaroid. Now that the embargo is lifted, I can finally buy some film for it."
The Vietnamese Government said in a statement released in Hanoi today that it was thankful to President Clinton for his decision to lift the embargo. The statement by Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai pledged Vietnam's continued cooperation in determining the fate of 2,200 Americans still missing from the Vietnam War, the issue most often cited by the United States in keeping the trade embargo in place for so long.
"This decision meets the desire of the American and the Vietnamese peoples," Mr. Mai said, praising the President for having opened "a new page in U.S.-Vietnam relations." He called on Washington to consider establishing full diplomatic relations with Vietnam.
 
Fast-Growing Market
 American corporations have been planning for years for the moment when they would be allowed back into Vietnam, a market of nearly 71 million consumers that even with the American embargo in place has emerged as one of the fastest-growing and most dynamic in Asia.
And so only hours after they heard the announcement from Washington, Americans began marching back onto the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, this time armed with checkbooks and marketing plans and wearing suits and ties.
Vietnam remains one of the world's poorest countries, with a per capita annual income of less than $500, but economists agree that with its diligent, well-educated work force and untapped natural resources, Vietnam has the potential to catch up with its booming Southeast Asian neighbors.
In a country where smuggled Coca-Cola is the most popular drink, Pepsi was the first to act. This morning, Pepsi began legitimate distribution for the first time since the 1970's, handing out bottles free to passers-by. This weekend, Pepsi says, television viewers here will see a new commercial featuring Miss Vietnam, 18-year-old Ha Kieu Anh, one of Vietnam's most popular celebrities.
Other American companies were not far behind in the battle to make their presence felt here. Coca-Cola announced that it would spend $45 million in Vietnam over the next five years. American Express said that Vietnam's foreign trade bank had agreed to accept the American Express charge card, making it the first American card to return to Vietnam since 1975. United Airlines reported here that it would soon begin service to Ho Chi Minh City from Los Angeles under a route authority it purchased in 1986 but, because of the embargo, had not been able to use.
In the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, many Vietnamese reacted to the lifting of the embargo with a sort of giddy excitement. There was for some the thought of renewing ties to an old, prosperous friend, the United States.
"My mother told me that when the American soldiers were here, there was lots of candy and many television sets and nice cars," said Tran, the 8-year-old son of a factory worker. "I think it will be fun to have the Americans here."
The end of the American embargo only made worse the usual crush today at the international airport in Ho Chi Minh City, once the American-run Tan Son Nhut Air Base.
 
Anxious to Return
 Nineteen years after they joined the panicked evacuation out of what was then Saigon, large American corporations were struggling today to get their salesmen and marketing executives on the first flights heading back into the city.
John R. Guy, director of international sales at Briggs & Stratton Corporation, a Milwaukee-based manufacturer of gasoline engines, arrived in Ho Chi Minh City on a flight from Bangkok, Thailand, and went immediately to work. He is here to search for a Vietnamese partner.
His enthusiasm about his first trip to Vietnam was tempered by worries about his competitors, Asian and European manufacturers that were not hobbled by the American embargo. Some have been at work in Vietnam for years. "All of my major competitors are Japanese," he said. "And they are already in Vietnam."
Can Briggs & Stratton hope to catch up with the Japanese? "It's my job to make sure that we can," Mr. Guy said with some confidence. "This isn't impossible." Briggs & Stratton, he said, thinks that Vietnam could become the company's major Asian market within four years.

HEADLINE: Fetal Test Focuses the Health-Care Debate

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Jeannie Evans was pregnant last year and had no reason to expect her child would be born with any problems.
She was 28 years old, and her risk of having a baby with a birth defect caused by abnormal chromosomes was 1 in 435 -- too low, according to standard medical opinion, for her to undergo an amniocentesis test and court an even greater chance that the procedure might cause a miscarriage. 
 But that logic was illogical to Mrs. Evans, a social worker who lives in Manhattan. "I didn't feel the trauma of losing a pregnancy was the same as the trauma of having an abnormal baby," she said.
With the support of her doctors, she had amniocentesis and joined a rapidly growing number of younger women who, health-care professionals say, are ignoring the medical standard that only women over 35 or those with a history of genetic abnormalities should risk a miscarriage by having the test, which detects chromosomal disorders in fetuses.
The rise in use of the test among young women -- reported in interviews by doctors, genetic counselors and insurers across the country -- has triggered a heated debate over whether it is a wise use of existing technology or a waste of health-care dollars that are sorely needed elsewhere.
The controversy is freighted with questions about medical risk, patient autonomy, national policy and the moral questions of abortion and reproductive technology and is an emblem for some of the most perplexing questions facing the country as it tries to control health-care costs.
"This issue has all the ethical considerations in health-care reform now," said Dr. John Larsen, director of the Wilson Genetics Center at George Washington University Medical Center. "It's about the confluence of technology and personal choice and social responsibility and financial liability. And the debate will only expand as our ability to test for more genetic problems expands."
Many younger women -- and indeed many doctors -- are challenging the notion that the emotional and financial costs of having to raise a seriously disabled child are in any way comparable to the costs of losing a pregnancy.
"Even 1 in 1,500 is not a very comforting risk if you're that one," said Mrs. Evans, whose son, Ryan, is now 5 months old. "I don't think that I'm equipped to handle a baby with a severe disability. As it is there's enough stress raising a wonderful healthy child."
Doctors designated 35 as the benchmark for having amniocentesis because at that age the risk of giving birth to a baby with such problems -- 1 in 192 -- is greater than the risk of miscarriage due to the procedure -- 1 in 200.
But many doctors, genetic counselors, health economists and women question that reasoning, saying that the evaluation of risk is very personal and differs from woman to woman. A woman in her 40's with a history of infertility might fear a miscarriage more than having an affected child, while a woman in her 20's, having a second child, might dread more the burden of a severely handicapped baby and decide to have an abortion.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize there's no logic in this standard," said Dr. Keith A. Eddleman, the director of prenatal diagnosis at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, who has seen a sharp decline in the age of women having the test. "They are unequal risks."
 
<If Nothing Else, A Little Preparation
 Many young women who had the test and discovered their babies were normal said they were not sure what they would have done if the results had shown an abnormality. Most said that their decision to continue with the pregnancy or to have an abortion would depend upon the severity of the disorder. All said that even if they chose to have the baby, they would want to be prepared.
"In my case, there was no way the baby would have lived for more than a week," said one 29-year-old woman, who did not want to be named, who had an abortion after discovering through an amniocentesis that her fetus was missing most of its brain. "It was the worst thing I have ever gone through, but I can't even imagine what it would have been like if I hadn't had the test and didn't know."
The test is performed about the 16th week of pregnancy. Using ultrasound as a guide, doctors insert a needle into the mother's abdomen to withdraw a sample of amniotic fluid that is later studied for chromosomal abnormalities, the most common being Down Syndrome. The test, which costs from $1,000 to $2,500, cannot detect all birth defects or even all genetic disorders. About 2 to 3 percent of all babies born in this country have some major birth defect.
Some obstetricians argue that younger women who undergo the procedure are needlessly endangering what in all likelihood are normal pregnancies, although no studies have measured whether more young women have miscarried because they had the test. And just because the technology is available, these doctors and some health economists say, does not justify its blanket use.
"If we are ever going to get costs under control, we are going to have to make some hard choices, like limiting who is covered for this test," said Alain Entoven, a health economist at Stanford University. "We must not go on acting as if such things are free. We are diverting money from programs that are important to the life, health and well-being of people."
But that reasoning examines just "the base dollars and cents," said Dr. Mark I. Evans, director of the Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy at Wayne State University-Hutzel Hospital in Detroit, who has for more than a decade used age 30 as his standard for recommending the test.
"The test may cost about $1,000, but a reasonably conservative estimate is that it costs $100,000 for just the first year of a Down Syndrome baby's life," he said. "How many people would I have to test to balance the lifetime cost? And then there are economic considerations nobody knows how to factor in, like the number of women who would have to quit their careers to care for these babies."
Where the medical establishment sees risk, many women said, they see peace of mind. "The technology exists, why not take advantage of it," said Chagit Cohen, who was 25 four years ago when she had the test before her daughter, Natalya, was born. "We take advantage of technology in all kinds of other ways that are less important."
Diane J. Loder, a marketing consultant from Alameda, Calif., who is now 33, did not have amniocentesis in 1991 when she became pregnant with her daughter, Alexandra. She regretted the decision. "I worried during the whole pregnancy, and I think I became obsessed with it," she said. When she became pregnant again, she said, "I knew the day I took the home pregnancy test that I would get an amnio.
"I didn't care if I wasn't in a high-risk group," said Mrs. Loder, whose son, Joshua, was born last year. "I didn't care if the insurance wouldn't pay for it. It was my right, and I wanted it done."
Not only are more younger women requesting the test, but many doctors across the country said that increasingly they are offering it.
"I feel very strongly committed to informing every pregnant patient about the testing options available and about the statistical risks for chromosomal problems at her age," said Dr. William Walden, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Cornell Medical College. "And I will be very emphatic that no matter what age, she is not immune. In the last few months alone I have been aware of three women under 29 who had babies with Down Syndrome. When you see things like that it makes you much more conscious."
 
For Opponents,Waste or Immorality
 But Dr. Bill Weise, chief of obstetrics at North Texas Medical Center in McKinney, a small city in the countryside about 30 miles north of Dallas, said he rarely recommends amniocentesis because he is morally opposed to abortions and would object if a patient used information gained through such a test in deciding to end a pregnancy.
And Dr. Dorwin T. Moore, an obstetrician in Manning, S.C., a town of 4,000 in the eastern part of the state, said he thought screening "indiscriminately" was wasteful and so he closely follows the traditional guidelines in deciding when to offer amniocentesis.
Doctors are often too quick to make such decisions for their patients, said Arthur Caplan, the director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.
"If there is a test that can yield information that can be relevant to a patient, you should offer it to the patient," said Dr. Caplan, who has studied ethical issues in genetic counseling. "There is no morally defensible reason not to offer even a 25-year-old woman the opportunity to have amnio and leave the decision to her."
All the insurers interviewed said the test is covered uniformly for women over 35 and when a physician determines it a necessity, but that the younger the patient the more likely that the insurance company will challenge a doctor's decision.
Under the proposed Clinton health care plan, amniocentesis will be covered when it is "medically necessary and appropriate," with 35 remaining the standard recommended age, said Dr. Susan J. Blumenthal, the deputy assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for women's health.
Doctors and insurers said that doctors often list "maternal anxiety" as the reason why a woman younger than 35 needed the test, and often, the insurance companies pay. Some doctors acknowledged confidentially that they felt so strongly that all women should have the test that they sometimes falsely report that a woman has a family history of abnormalities, to assure coverage.
The trend among younger women began with and is strongest among professional, highly educated women, who are familiar with medical technology, doctors and genetic counselors said. "Their lives revolve around control and information," said Dr. Albert L. Brooks, the president of the medical staff at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. "So when they embark on a pregnancy they want control and information."
But the practice, said Dr. Evans of Hutzel Hospital, has "moved down the socio-economic ladder," with working-class and poor women also seeking its reassurances.
Dr. Lillian Hsu, the director of the Prenatal Diagnosis Lab of New York City, a nonprofit center where 80 percent of the patients are on Medicaid, said that younger women there are increasingly asking for the test, but that few can afford it when Medicaid denies payment.
The public policy and economic concerns in guaranteeing such coverage to all four million women who become pregnant in the United States each year are too vast to dismiss so easily, said Dr. Sharon L. Dooley, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University in Chicago and chairwoman of the maternal and fetal health committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
"Dear God, we have an enormous job providing all women with basic prenatal care," she said. "To spend money encouraging women who don't need it to have amnio would not be good public-health policy. I think age 35 is still the best standard."

HEADLINE: Unemployment Is Put at 6.7% By New Method

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Severe winter weather crimped the expansion of business payrolls in January as the Government's new method for sampling the nation's households showed an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
But while the job figures were difficult to interpret, analysts said they regarded the data as consistent with an economy still moving briskly ahead in the early weeks of the year after unsustainably rapid growth of 5.9 percent in the final three months of 1993. 
 "The economy is in a very strong cyclical upswing," said Walter M. Cadette, a senior economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. While the latest figures may be "a mixed bag," he added, "what counts is not so much the month-to-month readings, but the trend."
 
Survey Is Changed
 The unemployment rate in December was 6.4 percent, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics stressed that the number could not be compared with the January rate because of a major revamping of the population survey on which it is based. The January report was the first to use the new method, which had been under development since the Reagan Administration.
But the Bureau of Labor Statistics also made some supplementary calculations using a reduced sample of data adjusted by a computer to give a rough comparison. If the old method had been applied to the January survey, the result would have been 6.3 percent.
Shortly after the job figures were published, the Federal Reserve announced that it was raising short-term interest rates in an effort to prevent a revival of inflation. Analysts said the labor market report was in some respects stronger than it appeared. They said the Fed, though probably not alarmed by any aspect of it, had concluded that the economy was strong enough to withstand a small increase in rates.
In January, payrolls expanded by 62,000 over all, a gain only about a third as large as the private-sector consensus had expected, but the number reflected extremely cold weather, said Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics. This was the case even though the week used for the survey preceded icy weather and snowstorms on the East Coast and the earthquake in Southern California, she said.
"The weakness in the payroll survey was quite concentrated in weather-sensitive industries" like construction and amusement parks, Ms. Abraham added, "while other industries continued the pattern of moderate growth that has prevailed for some time."
On the other hand, some private analysts noted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics had assumed that businesses too new to be included in the survey created 112,000 jobs, a number considerably higher than what the Labor Department was using last year.
The payroll survey was unaffected by any of the changes made this month, the first major shifts since 1967, in the survey of households.
The Clinton Administration, which had actively sought to prevent any rise in the January employment rate from being characterized as a weakening of the job market, expressed satisfaction with today's report.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's chief economic adviser, pointed particularly to a 26,000 rise in factory payrolls, the fourth consecutive rise. "We may well have turned the corner" in this important sector, she said.
 
A Few Surprises
 The results of the revamped household survey, which is conducted by the Census Bureau on behalf of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, were generally within official expectations, though some surprises emerged.
One surprise was that under the new survey method, the jobless rate for New York State declined, to 7.1 percent; it had been thought that the state's rate would rise from the 7.6 percent level that prevailed in November and December. Conversely, the rate for California jumped 1.3 points, to 10.1 percent, when a decline had been expected.
To address anxiety expressed by Congressional Democrats and the White House, Ms. Abraham's statisticians agreed to make various supplementary calculations. They hoped these would take the sting out of what was expected to be a jump of about five-tenths of a point between the December and January jobless rates; the jump turned out to be three-tenths of a point.
If the new method had been applied to December, for example, the unemployment rate for the month would have been 7 percent, according to a computer model for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"In either approach, the unemployment rate declined," Ms. Tyson told a White House briefing attended also by Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, and Lloyd Bentsen, the Secretary of the Treasury.
 
Flaws Seen in Questions
 The redesign of the household survey reflected various deficiencies in the questions asked of some 60,000 households every month and an effort at the same time to use laptop computers throughout the survey process.
The January results also incorporate figures from the 1990 census, which had the effect of raising the month's jobless rate by a tenth of a point. These results would normally have been added two years ago but were put off pending the outcome of a debate over whether they should be adjusted for an undercount, which in the end they were.
One main problem with the survey was what the department called a bias against women, because of a presumption that those interviewed at home were homemakers -- who are not deemed part of the work force.
Instead of asking women "What were you doing most of last week, keeping house or something else?" the revamped survey asks, "Last week, did you do any work for pay?"
With more women now reporting at least half-hearted efforts to find jobs, their unemployment rate rose to 6 percent, compared with 5.7 percent under the method used in December.
 
Shades of Joblessness
 Similarly, the survey is now better able to distinguish between people who really consider themselves unemployed and are diligently seeking work, and people without jobs who may do no more than scan newspaper ads. Another change seeks to distinguish better between workers laid off but expecting to be recalled and those who suffer permanent job loss.
By changing the definition of re-entrants to the work force -- any previous work is now counted instead of a minimum of two weeks of full-time experience -- the proportion of re-entrants is markedly higher and new entrants are a smaller component of the jobless.
And the number of people classified as part time for economic reasons, who must now explicitly state a desire for full-time jobs as well as availability to take them, dropped to 5.2 million last month from the range of 6 million to 6.5 million that had prevailed since mid-1991.
Yet another change was a tightened definition of discouraged workers, who must now have looked for a job within the last year. Their ranks were put at 600,000 last month, barely half the 1.1 million that have been reported for the last two years.
One of the more interesting figures from the overhaul shows that 6,756,000 million people, or 5.6 percent of the employed, held more than one job last month. Typically, for both men and women, the primary job was full time and the secondary job part time, but 920,000 women had two part-time jobs (nearly twice as many as men) while 174,000 men had two full-time jobs (more than twice as many as women), the report showed.

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve, Changing Course, Raises A Key Rate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
After five years of falling interest rates that helped pull the American economy out of recession, the Federal Reserve nudged short-term rates higher today with the aim of prolonging the current economic expansion by preventing a short, unsustainable burst of growth.
The Federal Reserve increased the rate for overnight loans between banks by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.25 percent. This reversal in monetary policy will scarcely affect the interest rates that Americans pay on home mortgages or car loans, economists and business executives said, nor is it likely to have any immediate effect on the health of the economy. But it set off a strong reaction in the stock market, which fell sharply after the Federal Reserve announcement. 
 Economists said that if further increases followed -- which would depend on trends in the economy and inflation this spring -- the economy's strong recent growth could be trimmed slightly.
 
Further Increases Possible
 "The economic impact of such a small move is negligible, but the important point is that this is the first act of a play that is probably going to have many acts," said John P. Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers.
The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 96.24 points, to 3,871.42, or 2.43 percent, its biggest single-day drop in more than two years, and in the bond market, Treasury prices fell more than half a point. [Page 37.]
Showing a new level of political sophistication for an agency increasingly under attack for its obsessive secrecy, the Federal Reserve startled investors and money managers around the world by making a public statement of its move, something it has never done before in its 80-year history, Federal Reserve officials said.
 
Avoiding 'Misunderstanding'
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, said in the statement that the agency's monetary policy committee announced the action immediately "so as to avoid any misunderstanding of the committee's purposes, given the fact that this is the first firming" of overnight interest rates since early 1989.
Mr. Greenspan's announcement did not specify how much the short-term rate would rise, but by announcing publicly that the Federal Reserve would push this rate higher, he departed from usual Federal Reserve practice. Typically, the Federal Reserve quietly pushes the short-term rate higher or lower, and it is left to market analysts to announce that the Federal Reserve has changed its monetary policy.
To raise rates, the Federal Reserve sells Government securities to banks, decreasing their reserves and curbing their lending. To lower rates, the Federal Reserve buys back bonds, increasing the reserves. By the time the Federal Reserve was done selling bonds today, the Federal funds rate had risen by one-quarter of a percentage point.
Mr. Greenspan's statement coincides with political pressures on the Federal Reserve. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee, has been waging a campaign to end the secrecy surrounding the Fed's monetary policy decisions, contending that the secrecy has shielded the Fed and its enormous power from public scrutiny. But Joseph R. Coyne, the Fed's chief spokesman, denied that political pressures had made any difference and said that today's announcement did not necessarily mean that any more statements would follow.
The Fed essentially tried today to slow down the economy slightly by limiting the ability of banks to lend money to individuals and companies.
As banks find themselves paying more to borrow money, they tend to raise interest rates for the loans that they issue. This means that fewer people and companies can afford to take out loans and buy goods and services, so the economy slows slightly. This reduces the competition for scarce resources like skilled labor or factory space, so prices -- and inflation -- rise less quickly.
Although the rise in short-term interest rates is expected to slow growth, the Federal Reserve hopes it will prolong the current economic expansion by cooling possible inflationary pressures, thus allowing longer-term rates to remain low.
Many banks never cut their loan rates deeply to match the fall in the Federal funds rate in recent years, preferring instead to pocket the widening difference between the interest rates that they pay to borrow money and the interest rates that they charge for loans.
That trend was reversed today, when few banks responded to the higher Federal funds rate by raising their prime rates, which are charged to corporate customers with good credit records.
The Harris Trust and Savings Bank, a large regional institution in Chicago, raised its prime rate to 5 3/4 percent from 5 1/2 percent, but most other banks had never cut their prime rates below 6 percent and did not change them today.
But the Federal funds rate is the only interest rate in the financial markets that the Fed directly controls. Interest rates for maturities longer than one night tend to move at different paces over which the Fed has much less influence.
Treasuries maturing in three years or five years are used to set interest rates for car loans, and the interest rates for these securities did not move up as much as the Federal funds rate. Treasuries that do not mature for 30 years, which influence the interest rates for fixed-rate mortgages, rose five one-hundredths of a percentage point today, to 6.35 percent.
Long-term rates depend mainly on expectations of inflation. So by raising the Federal funds rate and confronting inflationary pressures, the Fed acted today in a way that tends to hold down long-term rates. In testimony before a Congressional panel on Monday, Mr. Greenspan expressed concern that the large gap between short-term and long-term rates was a sign that while inflation might be low now, it might return.
 
Signals From Clinton
 A succession of Administrations has joined home builders and car dealers over the years in asking the Fed to postpone rate increases. Although President Clinton did call on the Fed three months ago to hold down rates, his aides have sent numerous signals in recent weeks that they were prepared to accept some increases.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, even acknowledged the likelihood of at least one more similar increase this year. The President's budget for the fiscal year 1995, scheduled for release on Monday, will be based on a forecast that short-term interest rates will rise by half a percentage point this year, she said in an interview this afternoon.
Some Clinton Administration officials had even quietly hoped for a rate increase now, reasoning that such increases were better now than in 1995 or later, when they might slow down the economy during the next Presidential elections.
In the early 1980's, home builders angry about high interest rates took the aggressive step of mailing two-by-fours to the Fed. But Tommy N. Thompson, a home builder in Owensboro, Ky., and the president of the National Association of Home Builders, said today, "If we could choose, we wouldn't raise these rates, but we don't view this move as a threat to the housing market."
Roger Hogan, the general manager at Toyota of Orange, in Orange, Calif., said that an increase in short-term rates might help bring a few extra customers into his showroom who had been hoping that car loan rates would fall even lower. But Mr. Hogan expressed concern that if car loan rates did bob up slightly in the coming months then he could lose some buyers.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Seeking Tougher Embargo Despite the Strain on Haiti's Poor

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Despite growing concern that the embargo on Haiti is not working and is badly squeezing that nation's poor, the United States said today that it would ask the United Nations Security Council next week to impose tougher sanctions on Haiti.
The proposed new sanctions, which aim to show Haiti's military leaders that the world will not back down in its campaign to force them to restore democracy, would broaden the current embargo on fuel and arms to include almost everything except food and medicine. 
 Haiti's military leaders have been hopeful that the sanctions would eventually end in response to the growing hunger in Haiti, thus enabling them to maintain their hold on power.
"Haitian military authorities believe sanctions were on the verge of being removed, and that our resolve was weakening," a Clinton Administration official said. "This is a signal that we're in this for the long haul."
Acknowledging that the embargo has hurt Haiti's poor, Administration policy makers said they were seeking to tailor the tougher sanctions so that they bring maximum pressure on the military and its supporters, without increasing the suffering of the poor.
Some United States officials said they were optimistic that with the fuel embargo already biting hard, a tightened embargo might force the military to cede power within two or three months to the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in September 1991.
 
U.S. Seeks Mandatory Embargo
 At a meeting on Governors Island in New York City last July, Haiti's military leaders agreed to give up power and allow Father Aristide to return by last October. But after a dispute over an amnesty for the military leaders who overthrew Father Aristide, and an outbreak of street violence that was fomented by the military and intimidated its opponents, the military refused to step down and Father Aristide still remains in exile in Washington.
The United States, working in conjunction with Canada, France and Venezuela, plans to ask the Security Council to make the embargo mandatory for all nations. It is now voluntary.
The Clinton Administration also plans to ask the United Nations to ban all flights, except commercial, scheduled ones, to and from Haiti, a move intended to stop Haiti's military leaders and their rich supporters from buying provisions from abroad to skirt the embargo. This flight ban, officials said, also aims to prevent Haiti's military from making money in the narcotics trade. Officials said airports around the world would be informed of this flight ban and told not to accept unscheduled flights from Haiti.
American officials said the chances were good that the Security Council would approve the tougher sanctions, but they said there could always be complications.
In another move to put pressure on Haiti, the Administration plans to ask other countries to stop granting visas to about 600 military officials, as well as to freeze their bank accounts and refuse to process their financial transactions.
The United States is asking France, Britain and other countries to take these steps voluntarily, rather than asking the United Nations to impose them, because some countries have laws that do not allow for international financial sanctions to be imposed.
 
U.S. Denies Malnutrition
 The decision to tighten the embargo comes after a wave of reports about a surge in malnutrition in the most destitute parts of Haiti. United States officials deny that there is serious malnutrition and cite figures that international relief groups are feeding more than 850,000 Haitians a day.
"Haiti has been at the bottom of the hemisphere's income scale even before there were sanctions," a senior Administration official said. "It's gotten worse since the military came in, and then sanctions have had a further debilitating effect. But to give the impression that the sanctions are doing all this is unfair. The military is putting out stories that the embargo has created hardship in Haiti."
Representatives of Father Aristide applauded the proposal to tighten the embargo.
"We have favored the tightest possible sanctions for the shortest possible time," said Michael Barnes, a former Maryland Congressman who is Father Aristide's top American adviser. "We have advocated a total embargo with humanitarian exceptions for food and medicine. We believe that that, coupled with clear resolve from the international community, can result in a swift resolution of this crisis."
American officials say the pain created by the embargo has created some cracks within the military's united front, and they hope the tighter sanctions would increase those divisions. While top military officials have yet to be hit hard by the sanctions, some officials concede, many soldiers resent the sanctions because they are being squeezed badly.
"We're hoping that tightening the sanctions will cause these splits to grow," an Administration official said.
Many human rights groups have been ambivalent about the embargo, quietly favoring the sanctions because they should in theory help restore democracy, while at the same time worrying that they could cause starvation.
Administration officials said the exact scope of the broadened embargo has not been worked out, but that it would probably exclude food, medicine, diplomatic traffic, newspapers and educational materials.
One subject under debate is whether the embargo should cover raw materials and components that are needed to maintain the operation of some of Haiti's factories. American officials say they are concerned that if such components are placed under the embargo, those factories will close forever, doing lasting damage to Haiti's economy.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Rightists Demonstrate in Haiti
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 4 (AP) -- More than 2,000 rightist dem onstrators demanding an end to inter national sanctions and a replacement for Father Aristide blew horns and beat drums today in a parade through the Haitian capital.
 The demonstration, in which protest ers waved the flag of the former Duva lier dictatorship, was organized by a far-right paramilitary political group and was backed by rightist parties that supported the 1991 coup that ousted Father Aristide. They have called for new presidential elections so that he can be replaced.

The Economy
The Federal Reserve nudged short-term interest rates higher. But economists said the move would not raise the rates that Americans paid on home mortgages or car loans, and was not likely to have an immediate effect on the health of the economy. [Page 1.] 
 The U.S. unemployment rate was 6.7 percent in January as severe weather crimped the expansion of business payrolls, according to the Government's new method for sampling the nation's households. Analysts said the data were consistent with an economy that was still moving ahead briskly in the early weeks of the new year after growing 5.9 percent in the final three months of 1993, which was considered too rapid to sustain. [1.] The New York City unemployment rate rose, while rates for New York State and New Jersey declined slightly. [48.]
 The Clinton Administration is promoting a technology that makes it possible for law enforcement agencies to intercept telephone and computer communications, even if they are in code. [1.]
 Government security experts warned that unknown intruders had broken into government, corporate and university computers connected to the global Internet communications network. [37.]
 
Markets
The Fed chilled stock and bond markets. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 96.24 points, or 2.43 percent. Treasury bond prices fell, raising the yield of the 30-year issue. [37.]
 Gold and silver futures prices weakened. [47.]
 The dollar surged to a two-and-a-half-year high against the German mark, and rose against other leading currencies. [47.]

Companies
Rupert Murdoch will sell The Boston Herald to its publisher, clearing the way for Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation to buy back the local Fox television station, which he sold in 1989. [39.]
Herman's Sporting Goods reached an agreement with its creditors on a reorganization plan. [39.]
 William M. Shinker resigned unexpectedly as the head of the adult trade division at HarperCollins. [39.]
 G.M. defended its electric vehicle program, saying it was trying to develop a vehicle consumers would buy but needed more time. [39.] Chrysler recalled its Neon subcompact for the second time since it went on sale last month. [10.]

American and European media companies are watching the new commercial television station in the Czech Republic. [37.]
 Anthony F. J. O'Reilly bought nearly 25 percent of the parent of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday for $27.6 million, intensifying the fight for the innovative British newspapers. [37.]

HEADLINE: Unemployment Edges Up To 10.8% in New York City

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The New York City unemployment rate rose last month, while the rates for New York State and New Jersey declined slightly, the United States Labor Department said yesterday.
The figures, however, rely on a new method of collecting data, which makes comparisons with previous months' jobless rates less meaningful, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, commissioner for the New York region of the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Joel Naroff, an economist with First Fidelity in Philadelphia, said, "I hate to say it, but we're in a statistical quagmire right now."
The unemployment rate for New York State was 7.1 percent in January, and in New Jersey it was 6.8 percent, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. In December, under the old survey method, the unemployment rates were 7.6 percent in New York and 7 percent in New Jersey.
Connecticut is not among the states for which the Government provides monthly figures.
In New York City, the unemployment rate increased to 10.8 percent under the new survey method, from 10.5 percent in December. The city rate, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, "kind of dampens the story for New York State as a whole because New York City is such a big part of it."
In New Jersey, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, "we're seeing signs of improvement, but job recovery has yet to hit its stride." Construction and services were leading the rebound, he said, with manufacturing still weak.
Richard M. Stein, an economist at Corestates Financial in Philadelphia, estimated that under the old system, New Jersey's unemployment rate would have shown a slight increase in January, to about 7.1 percent, to reflect sluggish growth in the labor force. But he added that he was still trying to understand the new system.
Economists said it would take several more months of collecting data before the new system could be used to provide an accurate picture of employment trends.

Sale Is Set For Boston Newspaper

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Rupert Murdoch said today that he would sell The Boston Herald to its publisher of the last 10 years, Patrick J. Purcell.
The sale will clear the way for Mr. Murdoch to buy back the local Fox television station, WFXT, Channel 25. He was forced to sell the station in 1989 by the Federal Communications Commission, which prohibits companies from owning two media outlets in the same market. 
 In New York, where Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation owns the Fox television station, WNYW, Channel 5, he was able to repurchase The New York Post last year by getting a waiver to the Federal rule when no other suitable owner could be found for The Post.
 
Leaving Other Jobs
 Mr. Purcell is also the publisher of The New York Post and the president and chief executive of News America Publishing Inc., part of Mr. Murdoch's media empire. He will resign those posts on Feb. 14 when he takes over as owner of The Herald.
"One thing we do not have any more are the deep pockets and the safety net of Rupert Murdoch's corporation," he said at a news conference today at the Herald building. "We are going to have to make it on our own."
The terms of the sale were not disclosed, and Mr. Purcell would not describe the financial health of The Herald except to say, "We're in the black."
Mr. Murdoch said in a statement that "it will be good for Boston to have the commitment of a local publisher." The Herald's rival, The Boston Globe, was bought by The New York Times Company in October.
The competition between The Herald and The Globe has been fierce in recent years. The Herald's circulation, as of September, was 321,715 on weekdays and 213,985 on Sundays, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations; The Globe's circulation was 507,647 on weekdays and 814,036 on Sundays.
"We know that Boston needs and can support two daily newspapers," Mr. Purcell said at the news conference where he shared the stage with his wife, his children and his parents.
The Herald is known for aggressive local reporting on politics and crime. After Thomas M. Menino, the Mayor of Boston, praised the sale at today's news conference, he said jokingly to Mr. Purcell, "Some of your reporters I'll talk to you about later on."
 
Different Points of View
 The Globe includes more national and international news and places a greater emphasis on writing style than does The Herald. The Herald's gossip columnists, Gayle Fee and Laura Raposa, like to refer to their rival in print as "the Boring Broadsheet."
Rick Gulla, a spokesman for The Globe, said, "We wish Mr. Purcell well."
One of the more famous moments of the rivalry occurred in 1992, when The Herald was running one of Mr. Murdoch's trademark Wingo contests to raise circulation. The Herald sent a photographer to stake out the house of The Globe's editor, Matthew V. Storin. As Mr. Storin left his house, the photographer stuck a "Wingo" sign into his arms and snapped his picture. Thus The Globe's editor appeared in The Herald promoting its contest.
A leading newspaper analyst said it would be difficult for The Herald to fight The Globe without Mr. Murdoch's financial help. "The history of second newspapers in this country is kind of a grim one, and usually depends on someone with deep pockets," said John Morton, an analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan, a brokerage firm in Washington.
"I understand that since the recession, it hasn't been making any money," he said. "I don't want to be shooting at lifeboats. I hope Mr. Purcell has some strategy to keep it going."
Mr. Purcell, a native of Queens whose first newspaper job was filling glue pots in the advertising department of The Daily News in New York, said in an interview that he would refurbish the paper's press units, find more efficient ways of producing pages, and put new features in the Sunday paper.
"I have been the leader of this newspaper for the last 10 years," he said at the news conference. "I have had almost complete autonomy."

HEADLINE: Inmate Fears Death Because Prison Won't Finance Transplant

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
If DeWayne Murphy were not in Federal prison, he would be on a waiting list for a heart transplant or might even have had one by now.
But the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which is responsible for his medical costs, does not pay for organ transplants, so the 33-year-old Mr. Murphy is living in a medical ward at the Rochester Federal Medical Center in Minnesota, agonizing over his case. One prisoners' rights advocate argues that by not financing a heart transplant for Mr. Murphy the Bureau of Prisons has converted his four-year sentence to a death sentence. 
 Mr. Murphy says his health is rapidly deteriorating as his heart fails. He says that he is weak and short of breath and that he must sleep sitting up, with an oxygen mask over his face. His mother, Pat Murphy of Liberty, Mo., says her son is afraid to fall asleep at night.
Mr. Murphy's case, ethicists and lawyers say, raises troubling questions about access to health care for those in the criminal-justice system.
 
A Host of Questions
 Should the nation provide expensive care and scarce organs to convicted felons? Can it justify a system in which an estimated one in four employed Americans cannot have a transplant because they are uninsured or underinsured, yet ask the Bureau of Prisons to provide them for prisoners?
If the Bureau will not pay for a transplant, should it pay for a quadruple bypass? Or, looking at it another way, should a nonviolent criminal like Mr. Murphy get a heart, but a murderer or rapist not? What about someone convicted of a white-collar crime, like tax fraud? Where, if at all, should society draw the line?
Esther Benenson, a spokeswoman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, the national group that allocates organs for transplant, said 2,856 Americans were waiting for heart transplants on Jan. 26. She said about half the people on heart-transplant lists eventually received organs.
Mr. Murphy was arrested in March 1991 for possession, with intent to sell, of about a pound of methamphetamine. It was his first Federal offense and he pleaded guilty. He was already desperately ill with cardiomyopathy, a progressive weakening of the heart muscle.
 
A Longer Sentence
 Before his arrest, he had been evaluated at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., where he was told that he was a candidate for a transplant. But instead of going on the transplant list, he went to prison. And now that his health has deteriorated, he must be re-evaluated before he can be put on the list.
Mr. Murphy, perhaps naively, never expected to serve a long prison term. "Everything considered, I figured I would get maybe six months or home confinement or something similar to that," Mr. Murphy said in a telephone interview. But Federal mandatory sentencing laws resulted in a four-year sentence, with no chance of early release, beginning in January 1992.
Before he was arrested, Mr. Murphy had Medicaid coverage because he was unemployed and Medicare coverage because he was disabled. Both pay for transplants. To be eligible for Medicare a person must be disabled for two years. In Mr. Murphy's case, the disability that made him eligible for Medicare was not heart disease but Lyme disease. He says the cardiomyopathy is a result of the Lyme disease, although experts say most cardiomyopathy is of unknown origin.
A public information officer at the Bureau of Prisons, Gregory Bogdan, said that the bureau provided "essential, basic, health care that is consistent with community standards" but that it did "not ordinarily pay for transplants."
 
Out of Options
 The bureau says it would permit him to leave on medical furlough to have the transplant if he had a way to pay it. But because Medicare does not cover Federal prisoners and because Missouri Medicaid will not cover him because he is now out of state, he has no options.
A heart transplant costs about $123,000, said Dr. Roger Evans, the director of health services evaluation at the Mayo Clinic; moreover, transplant patients must take immuno-suppressive drugs, which cost $5,000 to $6,000 a year, for the rest of their lives, he added.
"Every convicted felon has a right to health care," Dr. Evans said. Still, he acknowledged that transplanting a heart into a felon at public expense "sends a perverse message to people considering organ donation."
"There's going to be another person waiting on that list who potentially could be returned to productive capacity," he said. If a heart goes to a prisoner, Dr. Evans said, "we're essentially paying twice."
"We're paying to house them and then we're incurring a substantial cost for their medical care," he said.
 
A Death Sentence
 But John Boston, a lawyer who is project director for the Prisoners' Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society of New York City, said that by refusing to provide Mr. Murphy with a new heart the Bureau of Prisons is essentially giving him a death sentence. Mr. Boston, who had not heard of Mr. Murphy's case until he was asked about it this week, said he thought it would not stand up a challenge under the Constitution's Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.
Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Minnesota, said he believed that there was no ethical justification for denying organs to prisoners on any basis other than failure to meet medical criteria. "For me, it's open and shut," he said. "It's absolutely wrong to make judgments about past behavior, criminal conduct, moral worth, indictments, charges or convictions."
Dr. Nancy Dubler, the director of the division of bioethics at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, said that the case reminded her of the early days of artificial kidney machines, when citizen committees, often referred to as "God squads," decided which patients with kidney failure would have access to the scarce machines -- in essence, deciding who would live and who would die.
 
The Worthiness of a Life
 Ethicists and the public eventually found it so distasteful to rate the worthiness of a human life that, Dr. Dubler said, "the clear movement since then has been to establish rigorously abstract criteria so that the worth of an individual is not factored in" when deciding who should get organs or other lifesaving medical treatments.
Dr. Caplan said he understood the argument that it would be galling to give a new heart to a felon when many working Americans could not have a heart transplant because they have no health insurance; but, he said, that is a problem of health insurance in America. "The answer is not to kill DeWayne Murphy," he said.
Mr. Murphy said he just hoped he lived long enough for his case to be resolved. "I've been here 11 months and my health has deteriorated," he said. "If it deteriorates any more, I'll be on life support. And there's only one thing left after life support."
"All I'm asking for is a chance," Mr. Murphy pleaded. "This was my first offense. I was never in trouble before this. I think I've learned my lesson."

HEADLINE: New Orleans Mayor's Race Heats Up

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Mardi Gras is fast approaching, with its usual excesses in tow, but this year New Orleans is grappling with more serious concerns as well.
Voters here are trying to choose a new mayor who can cure an excess of ills: high crime, blighted housing, an economy still coughing from the collapse of oil prices, a loss of faith in City Hall, and middle-class flight to the suburbs. And just around the bend, there will be the need to cope with a giant casino planned for downtown. 
 Along with all the other excesses, there is also an abundance of candidates: four black men and three white men who will compete in a nonpartisan primary on Saturday among an electorate that is 59 percent black.
"It's a very serious election because the city's basically going down the tubes," said Dr. Edward Renwick, director of Loyola University's Institute of Politics, offering a blunt assessment of the problems confronting New Orleans. "It's got to be turned around."
 
Priority on Crime
 He went on: "The issues are crime, crime, crime -- and the economy. You have to stop the flight out of the city of both races. And if the crime problem isn't arrested, it's going to impact tourism, which in turn is going to affect gambling, which both the city and the state are saying will be the savior."
But at least there will be a lull before the start of gambling in what is touted as the world's largest casino and the first to be built in a major American city. A lawsuit challenging the right of the city to lease the land where the casino would be built has delayed construction of the big casino, which has a gaming area of 200,000 square feet, as well as the opening of a smaller, interim casino in the Municipal Auditorium.
Gambling has begun on a boat on Lake Pontchartrain, however, and a Mississippi riverboat will begin gaming operations downtown next week.
The city's problems are neither new nor unique, but voters seem to think they are worsening. According to a recent poll by the University of New Orleans, 80 percent of 781 people surveyed said the quality of life here was declining. In 1986, only 25 percent believed the quality of life was declining.
Their pessimism centers on crime. Last year there were 389 murders in New Orleans, a record here. In 1992 there were 279, and the year before that, 346. According to 1990 census figures, the population dropped to 496,938, from 557,515 in 1980. Nearly a third of the people live below the poverty level.
The issues are being driven home with unusual force because there are so many candidates. But Carnival offers some diversion. On Saturday, the day of the primary, New Orleans will be distracted by five parades, in advance of Mardi Gras on Feb. 15. A runoff election will be held on March 5.
Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, who cannot run for a third term, is backing Councilman Lambert Boissiere, but his support may actually hurt the candidate. The Mayor has lost favor among blacks and whites alike, especially in the aftermath of a dispute involving scholarships at Tulane University and political patronage. Many people were outraged last year to learn that the Mayor had granted a scholarship to his son. Mr. Barthelemy subsequently withdrew it.
Recent polls show the front-runners to be State Senator Marc Morial, the 36-year-old son of the late Mayor Ernest N. (Dutch) Morial, and Donald Mintz, a 50-year-old lawyer and civic leader who ran a strong campaign for mayor four years ago and entered this race early. Both are Democrats.
Mr. Morial, a lawyer, said at a forum at Dillard University last week that the race was between him and Mr. Mintz, and suggested that votes should not be "wasted" on the other candidates.
But the polls also show that many people are undecided: 33 percent in a survey of 558 voters directed by Susan E. Howell, a professor of political science at the University of New Orleans. Mr. Morial received 24 percent of the vote, Mr. Mintz, 22 percent. The poll had a margin of sampling error of four percentage points.
Mr. Mintz has written a book, "Turning New Orleans Around." Indeed, he has made that phrase the theme of his campaign, as he did four years ago. He talks about the need to diversify the city's economy, which has become more and more dependent on tourism. And he has been endorsed by the editorial page of The Times-Picayune, the city's major newspaper.
For his part, Mr. Morial has emphasized strong leadership, a trade mark of his father, the city's first black mayor who gained a reputation for being effective and arrogant in his eight years in office in the 1980's.
State Representative Mitch Landrieu, 33, the son of former Mayor Moon Landrieu, is a distant third in the University of New Orleans poll.
 
'Two Agents of Change'
 "Voters' preferences are really crystallizing around Mintz and Morial," Dr. Howell said. "No candidate here is clearly the agent of change -- we have two agents of change, Morial and Mintz." In a hypothetical runoff, Dr. Howell added, "it's dead even." Her poll shows the vote to be divided along racial lines and, to some degree, by age. "Older black voters are evenly divided between Mintz and Morial," she said, while some younger white voters are attracted to Mr. Morial.
This week the hardball tactics that accompany all elections here focused on the front-runners. Mr. Morial has been taunted for not divulging his medical records, which, his enemies hint, would show he has been treated for drug abuse. Mr. Morial has denied the rumors.
Mr. Mintz's enemies say his campaign has engaged in dirty tricks by distributing racist and anti-Semitic fliers that attack him and create the impression that he is the target of vicious opponents. Mr. Mintz, who is Jewish, says he is not responsible for the fliers. A state grand jury today indicted one of Mr. Mintz's unpaid advisers, Dr. Napoleon Moses, a college professor from Mississippi, on a misdemeanor charge of distributing anonymous fliers. Dr. Moses said afterward that he had "done nothing wrong." Mr. Mintz appeared voluntarily before the grand jury earlier in the day.

The Funniest Rabbi Contest: when it comes to stand-up comedy, most should sit down.

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
There may be a lot of witty rabbis around, but two out of three have no future as stand-up comedians. That rule emerged on Monday from Round 2 of the Funniest Rabbi in New York Contest.
The contest is the idea of Cary Hoffman, the owner of Stand-Up N.Y., a comedy club at West 78th Street and Broadway in Manhattan. He has organized competitions for the Funniest Lawyer, Funniest Wall Streeter, Funniest Taxi Driver (English-language division) and Funniest Police Officer. He has also done Funniest Unemployed Person, a particularly handy category since it includes most stand-up comedians. 
 Mr. Hoffman admits failure at finding recruits for Funniest Undertaker, but he has a surplus of contenders for Funniest Accountant.
His own accountant gets more than a chuckle when the competing rabbis appear, however, because they usually swell the crowd with loyal members of their congregations. And rabbis are a favorite category with Mr. Hoffman himself. "Jews have a special relationship to humor," he said, and "rabbis are comfortable on stage compared to other professions."
At least that was what he said before Monday night's session.
The club was, indeed, filled with rabbinical family members and friends, and with faithful congregants. A contingent of students from Ramaz, an Orthodox Jewish private school on the Upper East Side, had come to root for their Talmud teacher, Rabbi Moshe Rothchild.
So bring on the rabbis.
Well, no: three of the club's regular comics went first, while the master of ceremonies, Todd Barry, tried to parry the growing impatience. When one rabbi contestant volunteered that this was the "the most important day of my life since my bar mitzvah," Mr. Barry snapped back, saying that "it is the most painful day of my life since my circumcision."
Finally, it was the rabbis' turn. Within a few minutes, one sensed a wave of nostalgia for the house regulars. In keeping with the Talmudic principle of "al talbin pnai haverkha barabim" -- don't embarrass your friend in public -- the first two contestants shall remain nameless.
They displayed a minor talent for colorful description but none, alas, for punch lines. Worse, they slipped from stand-up into sermonizing. When the second rabbi introduced his closing remarks by saying, "I may not be the funniest rabbi in the world," no one protested.
The profession's honor was rescued by Rabbi Rothchild. He took the stage amid the general hilarity of his students. "I've only got five minutes," he told them. "Laugh quickly."
"Anyone here not Jewish?" he asked, then reworded the query to be politically correct: "I mean, Jewishly challenged?"
Rabbi Rothchild had been so nervous, he said, that he called his mother earlier in the day. "Don't worry," she reassured him, "no one will laugh at you."
The 26-year-old Talmudic teacher was the clear winner of Round 2. Eventually, he will face Rabbi Neil Fleischmann, who won Round 1 a week earlier. Rabbi Fleischmann, who is 31, teaches Russian Jewish immigrants the basics of Judaism at the Academy of Jewish Education's branch in Washington Heights.
Much of the rabbinical humor on Monday was surprisingly generic, rather than specifically Jewish. Where were the grand themes of guilt, worry, assimilation, Jewish mothers, denominational battles, Talmudic logic, anti-Semitism, the tarrying of the Messiah?
It was Sam Greenfield, not a rabbi but one of the professional comics, who said he always kept the three major Jewish holidays: Rosh ha-Shanah, Yom Kippur and the Academy Awards.
And it was Dave Attell, another of the regulars, who noted that "in the Bible we're the chosen people -- in the gym class we are the last-chosen people." He also expressed his admiration for Israelis: "They're tough, they're cocky -- they're almost like Italians."
There was only one example of really biting religious humor. Rabbi No. 2 recalled being called a Christ-killer at the age of 5. "At first it bothered me," he said. "Then I felt empowered."
That was up to current comedy-club standards of offensiveness but still proportionate to the nastiness of the accusation.
Three years ago, when Stand-Up N.Y. held its first Funniest Rabbi competition, the contestants drew heavily on Jewish life. The winner, Rabbi Robert Harris, offered recollections that ranged from his working on a dairy farm kibbutz near Nazareth (someone suggested naming it Cheeses of Nazareth) to the first synagogue services he conducted: "Very often I outnumbered the congregation."
Rabbi Harris is not defending his title. Although he has done occasional gigs since his victory, he found stand-up comedy to be time-consuming and distracting from his family life, rabbinical responsibilities and doctoral studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary.
Besides, he recently formed a rock band, with a Jesuit-educated Catholic businessman on bass guitar and a rabbi friend from the East Village on drums. Lead guitar is played by Eve Weiss, a classical musician who says she always had fantasies of being a rock star.
The group, known as Shake Rabbis and Roll, will give a benefit performance tonight at the Jewish Center in Pelham Manor, in Westchester County, Rabbi Harris's synagogue.
Both finalists in this year's competition are Orthodox rabbis and are friends from the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary of Yeshiva University.
"At age 12 or 13 I used to write my own plays and movie plots and perform at synagogue," Rabbi Fleischmann said. "But I put it on hold when I got more serious about religion."
"I try to do this with dignity," he continued. Rather than involving any mockery of religion or Judaism, he said, "this is part of my spiritual side."
The two finalists have something else in common, too: Both use their humor in the classroom. Rabbi Rothchild said, "The Talmud has advice for people who want to teach something: 'Begin with a joke.' "
At Stand-Up N.Y., Mr. Hoffman has not set a date for the finals. He is still hoping for more rounds and more finalists. For publicity, he has the cooperation of The Jewish Week, a New York City newspaper whose recently appointed editor, Gary Rosenblatt, made a stab at stand-up comedy in the early 1970's. ("That's why I went into Jewish journalism.")
But Mr. Hoffman has even greater hopes. Funniest Minister! Funniest Priest! And why not Funniest Zen Master or Funniest Ayatollah (although he didn't mention it)?
Finally, he envisions a grand interfaith playoff: the Divine Stand-Up Comedy!
Perhaps Father Guido Sarducci could serve as judge.

HEADLINE: Japan's Crisis Delays Economic Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Even after agreeing to drop a bitterly disputed tax plan in a hail of criticism, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition Goverment grew more divided today, delaying the completion of a critical package of measures for reviving Japan's recession-battered economy.
The delay disappointed business executives, who had hoped that after achieving a measure of success in a major battle last week over reforming the election system, the Government would quickly take steps to get the faltering economy back on track. 
 "We have no time to spare," said Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren, Japan's most influential business lobbying group, in urging the Government to finally take action.
 
Could Effect Trade Accord
 The turmoil today could also eliminate a vital element in a broad trade agreement that the Government has been struggling to conclude with the United States in advance of a meeting in Washington next Friday between President Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa.
One of the few areas on which the two Governments have agreed is that Japan should take bold measures to stimulate its economy after two years of recession. More rapid growth would be likely to draw in more imports, reducing Japan's annual trade surpluses with the United States of more than $50 billion.
Mr. Hosokawa's tax proposal, which involved a $55 billion income tax cut this year and then a huge increase in the national sales tax after three years, was central to a planned $138 billion economic stimulus package. Its rejection makes it difficult if not impossible for Mr. Hosokawa to bring to Washington the one clear sign that Japan is serious about reducing its surpluses.
Within Japan, perhaps the most damaging aspect of the turmoil was the fact that the criticism of Mr. Hosokawa's tax plan grew very personal today.
 
Leadership Questioned
 The plan's defeat, just one day after it was proposed, was described not as a sign of the fractious nature of the governing coalition, but as a failure of leadership, a perception that could limit Mr. Hosokawa's room to maneuver in Washington next week.
The Clinton Administration has placed most of its hopes for resolving some of the gnawing trade disputes with Japan on Mr. Hosokawa's personal ability to override the Japanese Government bureaucracy and the opposition in Parliament.
"Even if he manages to ride over the crisis through compromises this time, his prestige has been undermined and the mutual trust among the coalition partners irreparably damaged," the Asahi Shimbun, a leading daily newspaper, said in an editorial.
Mr. Hosokawa's supporters insisted that the damage would not be long-lasting, but admitted that the defeat had taken a worse toll than the battle over election reform and the opening of Japan's rice market to imports.
"I admit his credibility was damaged, but I don't think the damage will be serious or permanent," Kazuo Aichi, the head of the Defense Agency, said in a telephone interview today.
Mr. Hosokawa took many here by surprise, including some members of his ruling coalition, by announcing on Thursday that he had decided on the income tax reduction and the subsequent sales tax increase.
The idea was to use the income tax reduction, much of which was retroactive to Jan. 1, to revive consumer spending. Once the tax cut and heavy public works spending had helped trigger a recovery, the thinking went, the big increase in the sales tax would offset the earlier loss in income tax revenues. The aim of that approach, pushed relentlessly by the Finance Ministry, was to avoid incurring long-running Government budget deficits.
To make it easier to sell the idea, Mr. Hosokawa decided to call the increased sales tax a national welfare tax, saying that the proceeds would be used to cover some of the expenses of providing pensions, health care and other benefits to Japan's aging society.
But Mr. Hosokawa refused to write into the law a provision that would have reserved the money from the tax for such welfare spending. He further alienated some of his coalition partners, particularly the Socialists, by refusing to reconsider the size of the sales tax increase and its timing.
"My ministry is in charge of welfare affairs, but it is strange that the national welfare tax surfaced without any advance consultations with this ministry," said an angry Keigo Ouchi, the Minister for Health and Welfare.
 
Partners Threatened to Quit
 Mr. Hosokawa was forced to back down after the Socialist Party, along with some of his closest allies, threatened to resign from the Cabinet and push the coalition toward collapse.
The episode exposed the deep suspicions that many Cabinet members have of the bureaucrats who formulated government policy during the 38 years of Liberal Democratic Party rule, which Mr. Hosokawa ended last summer. It also pushed to the surface the growing tension between two of Mr. Hosokawa's key allies, Ichiro Ozawa, a conservative who favored the tax increase, and Masayoshi Takemura, the chief Cabinet secretary, who has generally been more sensitive to public opinion.
Mr. Hosokawa continued to press for his plan today, even after the defeat, insisting that it had been "frozen," not scrapped.
Others in the coalition agreed. "Starting with a clean slate does not mean we have scrapped everything," Mr. Aichi said. "I'm hoping personally for a consensus somewhere along the same lines as what Mr. Hosokawa proposed."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Precious Metals Weaken On Move to Check Inflation

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold and silver futures prices weakened yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised a key interest rate for the first time in five years.
Analysts expect the Fed's move to calm fears about inflation. If that is the case, the recent rally in gold may lose much of its steam because gold is still seen by some investors as an inflation hedge. 
 The move toward higher interest rates also worried silver traders, who see reduced industrial demand for silver if the economy cools.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, fell 80 cents, to $388.30 an ounce. March silver ended 4.8 cents lower, at $5.427 an ounce, after trading as high as $5.51, a four-year high.
Analysts were not sure how the metals would react on Monday to yesterday's plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average of 96.24 points, or nearly 2.5 percent. The stock market was down only about 50 points when the precious metal markets closed.
 
Surprised at Size of Drop
 "I'm just sitting here, polishing my Japanese sword, getting ready to commit hara-kiri if I can't call the market right for my company on Monday," said James Steel, precious metals analyst for Refco Inc., the giant futures trading firm.
He said he was a little surprised that gold had not fallen more sharply in response to the quarter-point increase in the Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another on overnight loans, to 3.25 percent. The higher rate is likely to lead to higher business and consumer rates.
The Fed's move also shocked and destabilized the stock market, which caused some panic buying of gold, Mr. Steel said. In addition to its appeal as an inflation hedge, gold is also perceived as a safe haven in times of financial turmoil.
"There's a lot of big money flying around on both sides," said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst at Paine Webber Inc.
Mr. Savaiko was skeptical of gold's value as a hedge against a stock market collapse. During the 1987 and 1989 market collapses, many investors had to sell assets, including gold, to raise cash to meet margin calls, he said.
"All you can say is that higher interest rates and a low inflation climate are not supportive for precious metals," Mr. Savaiko said. "Whichever way we go from here is likely to be a big move. I don't necessarily think it's going to be on the up side."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges on Increase In Short-Term Rates by Fed

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar surged to a two-and-a- half-year high against the German mark yesterday in a broad rally after the Federal Reserve said it was tightening monetary policy. It also rose against other leading currencies.
The Fed usually subtly reveals monetary policy through open market operations. But yesterday it took the unusual step of announcing that it would tighten credit. The move nudged short-term money market interest rates upward for the first time in five years and jolted financial markets. 
 While the Fed said it announced the increase to avoid market confusion, the disclosure sent stocks and bonds lower and the dollar soaring. "It was pretty explosive," said Paul Yarden, Bank of Montreal marketing representative, referring to the reaction in currency markets. "People were just scrambling for dollars against all the other currencies."
The dollar reached a two-and-a-half-year trading high of 1.7640 marks before giving back a bit of ground. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7590 marks, up sharply from 1.7412 marks on Thursday. It also rose to 109.30 Japanese yen, from 108.23 yen.
Higher American interest rates usually strengthen the dollar, since better yields on dollar-denominated assets make it more attractive.
 
 
Traders Caught Off Gauard
 Dealers said many participants had been caught off guard by the Fed's move, particularly after the release of January's payrolls report, which fell below expectations.
"The market was surprised by the Fed," said Jim Phoenix, a dealer for CIBC. "I would say people were expecting the Fed to add reserves at Fed time and for Fed funds to trade down to 3 percent. Obviously, the Fed had their minds made up before the employment numbers."
The dollar virtually ignored disappointing news on the trade front with Japan, as the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, Jeffrey E. Garten, said the United States and Japan remained far apart in their efforts to reach a trade deal.
While the news would have normally put pressure on the dollar versus the yen, it had limited impact yesterday because of the market's preoccupation with the Fed.
Meanwhile, the British pound eased in New York to $1.4765, from $1.4880 late Thursday.

Where Did the Don Get His Fortune?

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHIA, Colombia

 BODY:
With steaks sizzling on charcoal, the waiters in cowboy hats, a band playing "ranchera" country music, and Colombian walking horses prancing through the dining room, La Margarita del Ocho steakhouse has become the latest popular family outing for Bogota residents.
But helping to pack the parking lot of the 700-seat restaurant 15 miles north of the capital is the star quality of the restaurant's new owner, Fabio Ochoa Restrepo. 
 Settling into a red velour armchair every weekend, the 69-year-old "Don Fabio" presents a portrait of a traditional Latin American patriarch: barking orders at waiters and ranch hands, inspecting his purebred horses, and holding court for horse buyers and the diners who flock around him, eager to share his limelight.
No diner ever speaks about what they all know: Don Fabio acquired his fame largely because of his sons, three of South America's most successful cocaine smugglers.
Perhaps only in Colombia, where hard questions are rarely asked about mysterious fortunes, could an excursion to La Margarita del Ocho be considered a wholesome family outing.
 
Hundreds of Tons to U.S.
 Starting in the 1970's, the three Ochoa brothers shipped hundreds of tons of cocaine to the United States. In their heyday in the 1980's, they helped make the Medellin cartel the world's most powerful drug trafficking organization. The oldest brother, Jorge Luis, regularly landed on Forbes's list of world billionaires.
Although the police assigned to the drug trade say Mr. Ochoa's horse-breeding business did not begin to boom until his sons began to rise to the top of the cocaine-trafficking world, the Ochoa clan patriarch insists that he never benefited from his sons' illicit activities.
"I have had all this since I was born," the restaurateur said about his herd of 1,200 purebred horses, worth an estimated $25 million.
Mr. Ochoa's popularity is one of many signs of how comfortable Colombia has become with an economy that benefits from the drug trade.
In Cali, home to the nation's strongest drug cartel, a multimillion-dollar construction boom, financed from mysterious sources, is transforming the skyline of the formerly workaday provincial capital. In Bogota, now shunned by tourists because of the violence and urban congestion, 33 construction projects now under way are doubling the city's hotel capacity.
Explaining how he acquired his fortune, Mr. Ochoa skips over the fact that his wife and five daughters bused tables at a family restaurant in the mid-1960's. Instead, he traces his money back to horse-breeding stock acquired by his grandfather in the 1920's.
In his autobiography, "My Life in the World of Horses," published by a vanity press, Mr. Ochoa writes, "Fabio Ochoa is to Colombia's horse world what Garcia Marquez is to Colombia's world of letters or what Fernando Botero is to Colombia's world of painting."
The Government apparently has not made a vigorous search to find out the truth. Aside from a brief detention 10 years ago over a pistol permit violation, Mr. Ochoa has never been arrested. After desultory investigations for illicit enrichment, prosecutors decided not to lodge any charges against him. Police officers who stop by for free steaks and sodas respectfully greet him as Don Fabio.
Legal clouds are also lifting from his sons, who surrendered three years ago to face trial for drug trafficking and for illicit enrichment. Two sons, Fabio and Jorge Luis, have negotiated terms under Colombia's new plea bargaining system that could allow them to leave jail by the end of of next year in return for good behavior and payment of $4.5 million in fines. The third son, Juan David, is to start negotiating his sentence soon.
 
The Ultimate Offense
 Mr. Ochoa moved here last year from Antioquia, where Medellin is situated. But it was not embarrassment over his sons' activities that led him to leave the state that had nourished his family since the 18th century.
"There is a lot of violence in Medellin now -- hired killers, robbers, kidnappings," he said, seated on his informal throne in his restaurant. Dozens of family photographs were visible behind him and throughout the restaurant's interior. To his right, a table was cluttered with a sample of the 5,000 trophies he said he has won in a lifetime of breeding Colombian walking horses. A few weeks ago, he said, he turned down a $1.2 million offer for his most prized horse, Atrevido, a 5-year-old black stallion.
He said that for a horse breeder the ultimate offense in the Medellin area came six months ago. Members of a rival drug trafficking group kidnapped a $1 million stallion that belonged to a member of the Escobar branch of the Medellin cartel. Then the horse was castrated, returned and tied to a tree.
So, on a highway running through Bogota's savanna, with a verdant mountain as a backdrop, Mr. Ochoa opened what he called, with a touch of nostalgia, "a consulate of Antioquia."
Painted in the red and green colors favored in rural Antioquia, the restaurant serves its regional specialties -- roasted beef, black beans and arepas, or corn muffins. As a charcoal haze collects under the burlap-lined roof of the open-sided dining room, guests eat at wind-slapped tables, separated by post and rail fences from a steady parade of ponies, Percherons and Colombian walking horses.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Ochoa's eyes lighted up with special pride when a gentle black mare called Pomposa walked in the restaurant. Perched on her back was Daniela, Mr. Ochoa's 3-year-old daughter.
With a little prodding, the patriarch, who describes himself as "the family trunk," conceded that it was more than Medellin's violence that caused him to leave home.
Seven years ago Mr. Ochoa's wife had looked the other way when he fathered a daughter out of wedlock. But when the young woman had a second daughter, Daniela, Mrs. Ochoa called a clan meeting in the jail near Medellin where her three sons are imprisoned.
"The boys all took the side of their mother, and I guess they were right," he said with a hint of sheepishness as he tried to explain something new to traditional Latin patriarchs: divorce.

HEADLINE: Ruling Is Seen as a Threat To Preferences in Bidding

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
By invalidating a New York City program that gives preferential treatment to women and members of minority groups who bid on municipal contracts, a State Supreme Court judge may have undermined incentive programs for other businesses in the city, regardless of the race or sex of their owners.
On Monday Justice Walter B. Tolub ruled that the city's affirmative action "price preference" violated a state law that requires government agencies to accept the lowest bids in awarding contracts. The preference, allowing women and members of minority groups to bid up to 10 percent higher than their competitors, is one provision of a broader two-year-old program intended to increase the participation in city contracts of companies that have often been excluded. 
 To many officials the court decision seemed anticlimactic, since Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had repeatedly criticized the affirmative action price preference and signed an executive order to eliminate it only days before Judge Tolub's ruling.
But since Monday, as the court ruling has circulated at City Hall and among lawyers, many have concluded that the ruling raises serious doubts about the validity of two other price preference programs. The larger of the two, known as the local preference, allows city agencies to accept bids as much as 5 percent higher than the lowest bids on contracts, so long as the winning bidder is based in the city.
 
An Appeal Is Considered
 "As it stands, the reasoning in this case might be read in a way that makes other preferences vulnerable," said Jeffrey D. Friedlander, a lawyer on the staff of the New York City Corporation Counsel. Although the city's legal staff says it has grounds for an appeal, he said, no decision had been made on whether to file an appeal.
Whether to appeal may raise difficult political questions for the Giuliani administration, since it could mean defending the principles of a program the Mayor has abolished to save another that is widely supported among businesses in the city.
A spokesman for the Mayor, Forest Taylor, said yesterday that Mr. Giuliani "generally supports" the local preference program. "It has traditionally been part of the city's economic development initiatives to support locally based enterprises," Mr. Taylor said.
Legal experts said the other price preference program, which the city adopted in 1991, would also be vulnerable because of Justice Tolub's ruling. In that program, far smaller than the local preference program, a 5 percent preference is given to companies that sell the city paper and other products that are recycled.
Although it has won favor among New York City construction companies, suppliers of computer equipment and a broad spectrum of other companies that do business with the city, the local preference program has also drawn some of the same criticism that the Mayor has lodged against the affirmative action program, mainly that it wastes money.
"We always are troubled by price preferences," said Constance Cushman, executive director of the city's Procurement Policy Board, an agency established as part of the revision of the municipal charter in 1989 to monitor contract awards and procurement policies.
Although the Procurement Policy Board has no power to change city policy, it has consistently criticized the local preferences. According to an analysis it released in January 1993, the most recent available, the city had spent $1.5 million more since 1984 by giving its preferences to local companies than if it had simply accepted the lowest bids.
The repercussions of the local preferences have extended beyond New York City, where, through much of the late 1980's, business people and government officials cried foul.
 
In New Jersey, a Penalty
 New Jersey was the first to retaliate, in 1991, when it adopted what it called a Golden Rule for dealing not only with New York City, but also 18 states and 6 other cities that imposed various forms of local preference. According to the New Jersey rule, which is still in effect, businesses in the cities and states with local preferences will be penalized by the same preferences when they bid for business with New Jersey agencies.
Next, in 1992, came Nassau County. Its policy, still in effect, is to grant a 10 percent price preference to its own resident businesses. But Nassau has avoided a direct confrontation with New York City, since it extends the same preferences to businesses in the city, as well as in Suffolk County.
Judge Tolub's ruling on the affirmative action price preference made no mention of the other two price preference programs in New York City, and lawyers familiar with the decision said its impact was for now a matter of legal conjecture. Even if the ruling is not appealed, it is not known whether anyone will seize upon its language to challenge the other preferences.
The case before Judge Tolub was brought in a lawsuit by Seabury Construction Corporation, a Yonkers company that had been bypassed by the city in a $1.7 million bid to repair water treatment plants. The work was awarded to three joint ventures that bid slightly higher but had been certified as having sufficient minority ownership to receive a preference.
In his ruling the judge said that since it revised its charter in 1989, New York City was governed by a 1953 state law requiring it to accept the lowest responsible bids for municipal work. Before charter revision, the city's powerful Board of Estimate, now abolished, had been shielded from the state regulations and had been given almost complete authority to sit in judgment over contracts, regardless of who had the lowest bids.
In defending the affirmative action price preference, lawyers for the Corporation Counsel argued that in revising its charter, the city had retained enough legal discretion in awarding contracts to offer preferences intended to promote social advancement. The judge ruled that it had lost such discretion.

HEADLINE: In Fishkill, a New Team Steps Up to the Plate;
Minor-League Club Excites Baseball Fans in the Economically Ailing Hudson Valley

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FISHKILL, N.Y.

 BODY:
It may be buried under 16 inches of snow and studded with evergreen, pine and birch trees, but when Skip Weisman drives past the 20-acre field wedged between Route 9D and Interstate 84, he sees baseball.
"The lights are on and a game is going on," Mr. Weisman says, conjuring the daydream he has each night as he heads home from work. "The scoreboard's lit up. There's a packed house. There's green grass. There's brown dirt." 
 Mr. Weisman is not the only one with such visions these days. Ever since his minor-league baseball franchise, the Erie Sailors, announced in late November that it was leaving Pennsylvania for this Dutchess County town, the economically ailing Hudson Valley has found itself cheered by a refreshing case of baseball fever.
 
The Renegades
 When Mr. Weisman, the team's general manager and part owner, asked residents of the area to suggest a name for the franchise, more than 5,000 entries streamed in. Late Friday, the team announced that it would call itself the Hudson Valley Renegades.
Already, more than 400 individuals, families and businesses have bought season tickets to the team's 38 home games, at $225 a seat. The Class A team, affiliated with the Texas Rangers, is expected to open its 76-game season in mid-June in a 4,000-seat ball park now under construction. The season ends Sept. 3.
The appeal of the national pastime in one of its purest incarnations, free of million-dollar salaries and matching egos, has fueled much of the excitement. So has talk that the team could contribute upward of $1 million a year to the slumping local economy, what with the souvenir caps and T-shirts it would sell, and the services, like printing and hotel rooms, that it would purchase.
But this is also the heart of I.B.M. country, and people here say that baseball is just the ticket to lift their spirits after the computer manufacturer's retrenchment, which saw thousands of Hudson Valley residents lose their jobs last year at the company's three nearby factories.
"I don't know about anyone else, but I'm planning my summer vacation around the season," said Marsha Rozales Gordon, the president of the Greater Southern Dutchess Chamber of Commerce, which is raising private donations to pay for part of the $4.95 million stadium. "Someone invited me to a wedding on June 24 and my first thought was, 'I hope there's not a game that night.' "
Jaime Giannetta, a 28-year-old lawyer from Wappingers Falls, about 10 miles north of here, said she bought two season tickets, one for herself and the other to be shared with her father and assorted friends.
"I think the feeling is that we've got something else to do in the Hudson Valley, something that's ours," said Ms. Giannetta, who works for the Legal Aid Society in Putnam County. "I guess it's the way people in the Bronx feel, like they have the Yankees. It's such a morale boost."
Until Friday the hottest game in town -- other than wondering how the team will fare against such New York-Penn League opponents as the Pittsfield (Mass). Mets and the Burlington (Vt.) Expos -- had been guessing what the team would be called.
After scanning the reams of entries to the "Name the Team" contest, Mr. Weisman put all speculation to rest and announced that the team had settled on the name Renegades, bypassing three other top submissions: the Hudson Valley Vipers, the Hudson Valley Venom and the Hudson Valley Hawks. One idea that was rejected out of hand was the Jailbirds, an allusion to the nearby Fishkill Correctional Facility.
"The nickname Renegade conveys a strong sense of the unconventional," Mr. Weisman said in a statement, "the team that will hit and run or steal third when it is least expected, and take the opponent out of its own game plan."
He added, "It flows nicely with the geographic name of the Hudson Valley."
The woman who suggested the winning name, Yvette Cruz, 31, of Gardiner, N.Y., will receive two free box seats for the season and be the guest of honor on opening day, Mr. Weisman said.
The Renegades will join two other new teams in the New York region, the Trenton Thunder, an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers, and the New Haven Ravens, a farm club of the Colorado Rockies. Both will be in the AA Eastern League, a step up from the Hudson Valley team's league.
 
Financing Is Questioned
 The key to bringing the team to Fishkill, after the owners were unable to reach agreement with Erie officials on a lease for a proposed new stadium, was a 27-8 vote by the Dutchess County Board of Legislators last month to lend $2.5 million to the private company that will build the ball park here.
But that deal has not set well with everyone, particularly Woody Klose, a County Legislator who voted against it. Mr. Klose said he was concerned that the company formed to build the park, the Dutchess County Entertainment Corporation, planned to pay back much of the loan with private contributions and a grant of more than $2 million from the State Urban Development Corporation that it has not yet been awarded.
Mr. Klose said he doubted that the stadium builders would be able to reach their goal of collecting more than $1 million in donations from corporations and individuals to house a team three notches below the major leagues.
"It is one step above college ball," Mr. Klose said. "You're not going to see Dwight Gooden. You're not going to see Mickey Mantle. You're not going to see Joe DiMaggio."
Supporters of the team brand Mr. Klose a killjoy. They say they are eager to get a front-row glimpse of the baseball stars of tomorrow, some of whom may be in the major leagues within three years.
The Texas Rangers will determine the roster of team players about four days before opening day, Mr. Weisman said. The players, who will be paid $850 a month, will be drawn from other Ranger farm teams and from a draft of college players.
Local officials say they are confident that the team's spending, on everything from automobiles to apartments for players to hotel rooms for visiting umpires, will help the economy.
"I went to my local physical therapist and he asked me if they are interested in a team doctor," said Jack Dexter, 62, a one-time prospect of the Cleveland Indians who is president of the Dutchess County Old-Timers' Baseball Association, a hall of fame. "My local optometrist was saying that if a player strikes out 18 times in a row, maybe his eyes are bad and he can help out."
 
'Solid and Optimistic'
 But the team's most important contribution, its fans say, may be helping the Hudson Valley redefine itself as something more than I.B.M.'s backyard, particularly when the relationship between the computer giant and its neighbors has frayed.
"Nothing is more solid and optimistic than, what do they call it, the boys of summer," said Roger Akeley, the Dutchess County Commissioner of Planning and Development.
Captivated by that optimism, Matt Schlossberg, who runs a magazine distributorship in Poughkeepsie, was first in line to buy season tickets when sales began earlier this year. He bought four: for himself; his wife, Marcia; his 15-year-old son, Josh, and his 12-year-old daughter, Rachel.
"You've got your own team in the area now, something you can root for," he said. "Without getting corny about the whole thing, I just enjoy being around baseball."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
With Fed Raising Rates, Bond Review Is in Order

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty

 BODY:
WHEN the Fed announced that it was moving to raise short-term interest rates yesterday, the nervousness of already high-strung bond investors went up a notch. But even before the announcement, their duty was clear: ease out of long-term bonds, gratefully pocketing the run-ups of recent years.
On the details, of course, advisers differ. James B. Stack of Investech Research in Whitefish, Mont., sees short-term rates rising "up to 1.5 percent" by the end of the year; with 60 percent of his model portfolio already in cash, he urges others to make quick exits. "There's no rush," countered Mary Malgoire, a financial planner with Malgoire Drucker in Bethesda, Md. 
 Quickly or slowly, though, all these planners are walking to the same place: investments with shorter maturities and less volatility. Steve Janachowski, a financial adviser with Brouwer & Janachowski in San Francisco, likes bonds with maturities of 5 to 12 years. They yield 5 to 6 percent, compared with 6 to 6.5 percent for longer maturities, and have less risk from rising rates.
"If interest rates rise 1 percent, with a 20-year bond you could lose principal of 12 percent," he warned.
Among Mr. Janachowski's fund picks are Pimco Low Duration, yielding 5 percent, and Fidelity Intermediate Bond, yielding 5.1 percent. Ms. Malgoire favors three-year to five-year bonds as long-term substitutes, and for her money "Vanguard has the best bond funds around," she said. She also suggests phoning funds to determine current average maturities. "You can't pick that information up from a prospectus," she said.
Mr. Stack prefers cash. "If interest rates rise just 0.5 percent in the next six months, no bond fund -- short, intermediate or long -- will outperform money markets," he said.
Many investors, however, resist not only these specific strategies but also the general wisdom to go lighter on long bonds. Nearly 55 percent of all bond fund assets are still in long-term offerings, Mr. Janachowski said. And in December alone, those funds had a net increase of $2 billion.
Why this flight toward an increasingly perilous investment? "People are blindly buying yields," Mr. Janachowski said. This behavior, he and others say, stems from the traditional income orientation of bond investors, but also from the aging bond bull market. With most bond funds returning a total of 70 to 80 percent since 1989, people have just grown used to great gains.
But "what you learned to love, you now must learn to hate," Ms. Malgoire said. "And that's very hard." Even advisers who disagree on strategy agree on the power of this emotional attachment. "Bonds have done little else but go up for a decade," Mr. Stack said. "Investors forget, or don't want to remember, they can go the other way."
Still, knowing investors' income needs, advisers suggest some ways to tease bond portfolios for higher returns. John Rekenthaler of the Morningstar newsletters points to short-term global income funds, like the Scudder fund of that name, which turned in 6.74 percent in 1993. "Better than cash, right?" he asked.
But he emphasized the currency risks of foreign investing, and others noted that falling foreign yields might no longer justify those risks. Germany's three-month rates have fallen to 5.8 percent from 8.5 percent since last year, while Italy's have dropped to 8.5 percent from 12.9 percent. Also, as rates rise here, so will the dollar's value against other currencies -- bad news for Americans who invest overseas.
What about high-yield funds? They can juice up returns, advisers say, and as the economy gathers steam, their primary risk -- corporate default -- declines. The junk market is prone to panic, though, and to counter that tendency Mr. Rekenthaler suggests a very big fund, the $2 billion Vanguard Fixed-Income High-Yield Corporate, or a very conservative one, Nicholas Income. The latter is "a junk fund, but barely," he said; in 1990, it lost only 1 percent when the average high-yield fund dropped by 10.3 percent.
It is somewhat late in the day for junk funds, though advisers diverge on the exact time. "It may be 4 P.M. for these funds, but it's not 9 P.M.," Mr. Rekenthaler said. Mr. Stack's watch is faster. "The funds have done well for three years," he said, including an 18.89 percent return in 1993. "A lot of the gain has already been realized."
Truly adventurous bond investors may want to make a contrarian move -- into long bonds. They will be betting that the Fed's move will pre-empt inflation and bolster long-bond prices.
Most advisers, however, see these alternatives as risky and marginal. The main event is moving to shorter maturities, and for that "the cautious investor will just have to sit and take his hit," Mr. Rekenthaler said.
But, just as some investors find it hard to leave long bonds, others accept that prospect but insist on an alternative investment of equal profitability. Believing every problem has a solution, they search high and low for a long-bond replacement -- whatever the risk.
'People equate action with doing the right thing," said Harold Evensky, a planner in Coral Gables, Fla. Mr. Janachowski's take is only slightly different. "Everybody," he said, "wants to do something."

HEADLINE: Vietnam Welcomes U.S. Decision on Embargo;
Hanoi's Response Subdued

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Government officials welcomed President Clinton's lifting of the United States trade embargo on Vietnam in measured terms today.
But even though this capital, unlike Ho Chi Minh City in the south, has never known what it is like to have the United States as a trading partner, many ordinary Vietnamese here greeted the American action as a significant boost to the festive mood building up for Tet, the lunar new year holiday beginning on Thursday. 
 In a news conference punctuated by bursts of exploding Tet firecrackers in the surrounding streets, Deputy Foreign Minister Mai voiced the Government's satisfaction at the lifting of the ban. But Mr. Mai, one of the principal architects of Vietnamese-American reconciliation, took pains not to jubilate. Asked about his personal feelings about the end of the embargo, he replied: "I think that Vietnamese matters have created many emotional issues in the United States. We, the Vietnamese, are less emotional."
"I think the lifting of the trade embargo may bring about many new things, or maybe very few new things, or maybe nothing new," the Deputy Foreign Minister said, and he indicated Vietnam's irritation at Mr. Clinton's remark, in announcing the end of the ban, that his action was "reversible."
"No nation in the world," Mr. Mai said, "has the right to impose a trade embargo on another nation or to threaten to reimpose an embargo."
 
Pledged Cooperation
 But in comments obviously designed for concord with Mr. Clinton's emphasis -- that he lifted the embargo for the sake of advancing the search for evidence of the 2,238 Americans still officially listed as missing in action -- Mr. Mai pledged Vietnam's full cooperation.
"We will continue to cooperate fully with the United States under any political circumstances," he said. "The Vietnamese people have themselves suffered sorrow and grief and share the concern of American families whose loved ones are still listed as missing from the war."
In a conversation before the lifting of the embargo was announced, Mr. Mai said on Thursday that many Vietnamese held unrealistic hopes for quick economic changes once trade with America became possible.
 
Fear of Inflation
 Indeed, a staff member at the History Museum voiced caution today that the end of the embargo might bring such an inflationary economic boom that the low wages of civil servants might not keep up with a rise in prices. Most Government employees earn no more than $30 a month.
But she also saw the value of the broadening of Vietnam's relations to include the world's leading power. "It will protect us against invasion from the north," said the woman, a combat veteran of the war in South Vietnam. Her fear of China is widely shared throughout this nation.
Tu Giay, founder and former chief of the National Institute of Nutrition, a 73-year-old veteran of the war against France and a longtime Communist, was philosophically Buddhist in welcoming the end of the embargo.
"We come into the world only once," he said. "We don't know when we can come back, because we must die before we can return. Why spend this short life quarreling? So the event is a happy one -- but a little late."

HEADLINE: U.S. and France to Form Bosnia Working Group;
9 Killed Waiting for Food

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Mortar shells slammed into a line of people waiting for food today, killing 9 people, 3 of them children, and leaving at least 15 wounded.
Relief workers were measuring out portions of flour just before noon on a spring-like day that brought crowds out into the sun when the first round landed in Dobrinja, a neighborhood that has suffered particularly heavy damage during the 22-month Serbian siege of the city. 
 Moments later, as neighbors and soldiers rushed to help the wounded, two more shells landed in the small courtyard set among battered high-rises, catching some of those giving first aid.
 
Area Housed Olympic Athletes
 Much of Dobrinja was built to house the athletes of the 1984 Winter Olympics. The mountains looking down on it hosted the ski and bobsled events then; now they hold Serbian artillery. A makeshift cemetery holds the bodies of residents killed by the shelling and sniping in a neighborhood where a magnificent view has turned into a dangerous exposure.
Shelling and sniping have been increasing here in recent days, as they almost always do when the battling Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian leaders prepare to head to Geneva for another session of the seemingly endless peace negotiations. The next round of talks is scheduled to begin on Thursday.
The Croatian Government met in emergency session in Zagreb today to consider a warning from the United Nations Security Council to withdraw the regular army troops it has sent into Bosnia to bolster the militia of the Bosnian Croats.
The message sent by the Security Council on Thursday is the sternest warning to Croatia since fighting broke out between the Bosnian Croats and the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government last spring. United Nations officials estimate that from 3,000 to 5,000 regular Croatian Army troops have been across the border. Bosnian officials say the number is as high as 20,000.
The possibility that the Security Council could impose sanctions on Croatia is greatly feared by the Zagreb Government of President Franjo Tudjman, who has watched the ruin of the Serbian economy under economic sanctions imposed in May 1992.

HEADLINE: Opening to a New Vietnam

 BODY:
President Clinton did the right thing for the United States this week in ending the 19-year-old ban on Americans' doing business with Vietnam. For Mr. Clinton, it was an act of political courage. Had his predecessors been able to take a larger view of American interests, they would have lifted the embargo years ago.
Vietnam has been changing dramatically for nearly a decade. Most of the differences that drove Hanoi and Washington to war in the 1960's and 1970's and kept them at odds through the early 1980's have disappeared. 
 In fact, almost all have been resolved in America's favor. Vietnam's troops are out of Cambodia. Its markets are open to the world. And it has turned away from what remains of the Communist bloc to seek new links with the Association of South East Asian Nations, formed during the Vietnam War as an anti-Communist bloc.
Vietnam is still a one-party state with an appalling human rights record, but so are some of America's best friends and trading partners in Southeast Asia. What has kept Washington at arm's length from the new Vietnam is, of course, the legacy of an old war.
Only a small part of that legacy was substantive. While every single case of a soldier lost without remains or information is a family tragedy, the number of Americans still unaccounted for is unusually small given the scope and duration of American involvement.
The war's larger legacy has been political and psychological. The dead and the missing were not, as in past wars, redeemed by an American military victory. For many Americans this was humiliating; for some, even dishonorable. Refusing to acknowledge Hanoi meant refusing to certify Washington's defeat. As the years passed, and Vietnam found the trade and aid it needed elsewhere, making the embargo pointless, only a minority remained irreconcilable. But successive Republican Presidents indulged this minority, while successive Democrats feared provoking them.
It is thus remarkable that Bill Clinton, whose own opposition to the war and avoidance of the draft made him especially vulnerable to attack on this issue, became the President who finally recognized reality and acted in the national interest.
Hanoi made it easier for him with its vastly improved cooperation in recent years on searching for remains of missing Americans. So did American business leaders clamoring for a share of the growing economic action before European and Asian countries locked any more of it up for themselves. And Mr. Clinton has prudently held back on such steps as diplomatic recognition and special trade and aid agreements, holding them out as inducements for further Vietnamese cooperation and human rights progress.
But give this President the full credit he deserves, for at last ending America's self-imposed, self-punishing exile from the new Vietnam.

Awards Honor Leading Designs

BYLINE: By HANS FANTEL 

 BODY:
CHARLES IVES, America's crankiest composer, once scoffed, "Awards are merely the badges of mediocrity." Audio manufacturers think otherwise. To them, the Grands Prix for outstanding design in sound equipment represent a coveted distinction. Awarded each year by an independent jury convened under the auspices of Audio-Video International, a leading trade journal, these prizes are the audio equivalent of a Pulitzer.
The awards cover different classes of audio equipment, from minimal table-top models to semiprofessional sound gear. Here are some winners that combine musical merit with reasonable cost. 
 Among full-sized, floor-standing loudspeakers, awards went to the Definitive Technology BP-10 ($1,100 a pair), the Boston Acoustics T1030 ($1,000) and the KEF 103/4 ($1,800). The Definitive Technology design differs from the others by radiating sound both forward and backward to attain unusually spacious sound distribution. Various models differ in their tonal shadings, and each has a distinct sonic character. Yet all cover the entire audible range and handle even massive symphonic passages with generous ease.
Smaller bookshelf speakers also ranked among the winners, with the PSB Alpha, at $199 a pair, being the lowest-priced. This design was cited for its high efficiency, that is, the ability to generate ample sound even from relatively modest wattage. This attribute permits the speaker to be used with low-powered receivers, making it even more economical.
Other winners among bookshelf speakers included the Paradigm Titan ($200), the Advent Baby III ($229) and the Boston Acoustics AD9 ($340). Predictably, these small speakers lack the deep sonority and power of their larger counterparts. But their sound is well balanced and -- especially in music of a lighter texture -- thoroughly enjoyable.
Winning stereo receivers included Yamaha's RX-770 ($549), which was cited for its ability to exceed its nominal power rating of 85 watts per channel to accommodate brief loud moments. The jury also praised the tuner section, which allowed the receiver to separate closely neighboring FM stations on the dial.
Prizes were handed out even among bargain-basement receivers. Kenwood's KR-A5050 garnered laurels for delivering a hefty 100 watts per channel at a modest $229.
Among CD players, honors went to Sony's CDP-X303ES ($730) for its distinctive circuit used for deciphering the digital signal and an elaborate memory device that remembers the listener's preferred selections on as many as 184 CD's.
Other winners in this group -- Rotel's RCD965LE and Denon's DCD-1290, both priced at $550 -- achieve outstanding performance by contrasting means. Rotel converts the digital data to a musical signal by means of the newly popular single-bit decoding method, while Denon relies on a 20-bit decoder.
All three CD players are single-play models. The jury noted that many listeners find single-play designs easier to use than CD changers. Even so, awards were given to CD changers holding several disks, including the Denon DCM-550 ($500), the Onkyo DX-M505 ($430) and the Sony CDP-C601ES ($420).
Listeners in search of a high-quality cassette deck can also pick among Grand Prix winners. The most elaborate is Harman-Kardon's TD4800 ($1,199), which is a virtual compendium of clever refinements. Additional winners among tape decks included Sony's TCK909ES ($750) and Nakamichi's DR-1 ($879). All are three-head designs that allow the tape to be monitored while recording, so faulty adjustments can be rectified instantly.
All the winners mentioned here were victors in a tight race. Given the competitiveness of the audio business, judges must spot small distinctions among strong contestants in a close and crowded field. The prizes go to entries leading the pack by a nose.

A Radio Talk Show That Doesn't Run on Vitriol

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Ray Suarez, THE NEWEST, least likely and perhaps fastest-rising figure in talk radio, says his show is not aimed at an elite audience. It is a little tough at first to manage a straight face at this.
Mr. Suarez, after all, works in the nation's most pointy-headed city, in a studio six blocks from the White House. He sports a beard and a rumpled sweater. He likes to muse about stuff like the "enormous consequences" of the global rise of the money-commodity economy. 
 If this were not enough, his two-hour program, "Talk of the Nation," is on National Public Radio, the goose-liver pate network in an otherwise braunschweiger medium. But he is insistent. "We're anti-elitist," he said. "If anybody wants to listen to smart conversation with regular people, they'll see."
And in fact, a few hours' exposure to Mr. Suarez's slightly nasal, eminently reasonable moderation of "Talk of the Nation" is persuasive. Rush Limbaugh runs a boxing match of a program, and Howard Stern operates a peep show. Mr. Suarez, on the other hand, conducts a very democratic cocktail party. He sets out one or two eclectic issues, sort of like plates of strange-looking canapes, then spends the rest of the broadcast stoking the conversation, as if filling glasses and hauling out crackers.
When it works, everyone gets a little buzz, and nobody leaves hungry. Among recent shows, Mr. Suarez has opened phone lines to an astronaut aboard the space shuttle Columbia, spent an hour talking with callers about the legacy of the Trappist monk Thomas Merton and asked listeners -- in an especially curious year-end program -- to transport themselves to the year 2000 and phone in their lists of top stories of the 1990's.
"It's a much better approach to issues than a host who's trying to shove his opinion or an idea down someone's throat," said Ross Reynolds, the program director at the Seattle public-radio station KUOW-FM. "Ray really provides a safe place for listeners who aren't sure how they feel about a subject to try out their ideas."
Indeed, Mr. Suarez's genially Socratic manner and the bizarre menu of topics are main ingredients of the show's success since he became the host in April. In Seattle, ratings show the number of listeners has grown by about 25 percent in the last six months, a trend NPR officials say is being repeated most places the program is heard.
"Talk of the Nation" claims more than a million listeners, enough to give NPR something it has always lacked: a strong midday program between its two news hits, "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered." Both those shows attract more than 6 million listeners a day, but both claim drive-time slots with captive audiences of commuters. And both are carried virtually nationwide, while "Talk of the Nation" is confined to about 80 of the network's 489 affiliates.
The success is all the more unusual because "Talk," while run by the network's news division, is a departure from its taped, slickly produced and not-very-abashedly highbrow companions. "NPR looked at live radio as something for the unwashed," said one veteran of the network who refused to be named. "Ray has really fought an uphill battle to make the show work, and he's established a real beachhead." (On Fridays, when the program is devoted to science issues, its host is Ira Flatow, NPR's science specialist.)
Mr. Suarez's special talent is to make listeners interested in topics that normally would send them charging for the "off" button. He does it by introducing the topics with brief essays, often lyrical and sometimes quite personal, that frame the discussion in ways that directly engage people.
Thus for a show on Burundi, he said, it was a matter of pointing out that Africa has 50 nations, many in the direst of straits, but that national sympathy tends to flow to a select few like Somalia. So the issue, he said, becomes: "We've got a United Nations that is stretched thin. We've got a plate so full that we can't do everything. What do we do?"
And a panel of theologians talking about Merton was pitched not as a religion lecture, but a dialogue about whether monastic ideals are achievable in an era when even the Pope and Mother Teresa are celebrities. A blurb at the end of that program offering a list of supplementary readings drew a response from listeners "in the four digits," a senior producer, Marcus Rosenbaum, said. "It blew our minds."
Mr. Suarez says he is pleased but not surprised by such responses. "I think if you pitch it right, you can have a show on almost any subject," he said.
At 36, Mr. Suarez is universally described as a very smart fellow with a quick wit and a voracious appetite for facts. Less apparent -- and all but smothered in his appeal-to-all radio persona -- is a hardened journalist with a surplus of self-confidence and a history of walking out over issues of principle, or ego, or both.
RAY SUAREZ GREW UP IN THE Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bensonhurst neighborhoods of Brooklyn, one of three sons in a family headed by a Navy man. Upon entering New York University in 1974, he went straight to the campus radio station.
Mr. Suarez rose to become news director, then took the first of several drastic career steps: denied the post of general manager, he quit -- "in a petulant teen-age fit," he said -- and moved to the campus newspaper.
Of course, it proved a wise move. Mr. Suarez became editor and gained an appreciation for good writing. After college, he bounced around New York, writing for trade publications like Paper Trade Journal (slogan: "The Newsmagazine of the North American Pulp and Paper Industry") until he decided he was adrift. So he moved to London with his soon-to-be wife, jobless but ready to freelance.
That was a wise move, too. "Eventually I was turning down work," he said. London led to Rome, where Mr. Suarez wandered into St. Peter's Square in 1981, moments after an intended assassin had shot Pope John Paul II. His coverage won him a radio-news job with CBS, which in turn led him to ABC.
But after a spell in what seemed make-work posts, Mr. Suarez heard that ABC was being sued for discrimination, and he concluded that his job was tied more to his Hispanic surname than to his ability. So he moved again, to Los Angeles and the infant Cable News Network. From there he joined Chicago's NBC affiliate, WMAQ-TV.
And there he seemed to thrive, earning a six-figure salary for five years. But after winning a journalists' fellowship at the University of Chicago, he began to chafe.
John D. Callaway, who headed the fellowship program, called him the most outstanding scholar in its history. "He brought the eye of an investigative reporter to history, and the soul of a poet to his writing," he said. "Anybody who's been around Ray for eight minutes knows he's ambitious. But for Ray to be in commercial TV today, particularly at the local level, where you're scrambling for audience in ways less than noble, is a contradiction in terms."
When he quit WMAQ last spring, Mr. Suarez infuriated his bosses with a public blast at local television news and its thirst for mayhem. Next stop: Washington and "Talk of the Nation."
By all accounts, he found a troubled operation. Soon after the program started in 1991, its first host and its inspiration, John Hockenberry, left for ABC News and the broadcast lacked direction for months. Mr. Suarez spent his first months learning talk-show tricks and scrapping for a place in NPR's tightly closed hierarchy.
After nine months on the air, he seems to have found it: as a literate, low-cal alternative to a network diet of BBC reports and insistent analyses of Federal bureaucracies.
"Ray's a valuable addition to the rarefied, tweedy image NPR has," said Rick Kogan, a former media critic at the Chicago Tribune. "He's not unfamiliar with the back alleys. He's a reporter. He's not a mannequin."

HEADLINE: Signs Signal Both Profit and Controversy

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
THE best-known 7,200 square feet along the East River in Hunters Point, Queens, have been under reconstruction recently in a factory on 12th Avenue in Manhattan, not far from the Hudson River.
What is being rebuilt is a 60- by 120-foot Pepsi-Cola sign, the unofficial landmark of Hunters Point, which dates to 1936. It rises over a Pepsi bottling plant immediately north of the site on which construction of the enormous Queens West project is to begin this year. 
 (With work still in progress, the sign read "epsi- ola" last week -- or "alo- ispe" from Queens.)
Rosina K. Abramson, president of the Queens West Development Corporation, sees the restoration of the sign as a helpful herald. "We're pleased if property owners are sprucing up," she said. "We think that the more positive attention is called to the site, the better it is for present users and future projects."
Big signs are not only big business, they are intimately tied to real estate in New York City.
They are, for example, a point of contention between state officials and the private developers of the 42d Street rehabilitation project. They generate profits -- or headaches -- for other owners around Times Square, where spectacular signs are required by law. For some buildings, they are the most important tenants.
In the form of advertising kiosks, illuminated signs are about to transform the streetscapes, a matter of concern to both the Real Estate Board of New York and the Municipal Art Society. And, like so many other properties, big signs have even been considered for landmark status.
That was in 1988, when the Pepsi sign came before the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The matter was never voted on, however, because there was not enough interest among commission members, said David F. M. Todd, a former chairman.
IN the years since, the sign has not fared well, having been buffeted by a nor'easter in December 1992. Looking tattered in daylight and scraggly at night, it reached the end of its life last year. The 50-foot-high Pepsi bottle, 44-foot-high "P" and "C" and the smaller letters were removed.
They have been replicated in the 12th Avenue factory of the Artkraft Strauss Sign Corporation, whose predecessor, Artkraft Signs, is said to have built the original.
Pepsi's property adjoins what is called the Gateway neighborhood, the first phase of the Queens West project. Although the Pepsi site is eventually to become a residential neighborhood as well, and although Pepsi is exploring the relocation of its bottling operation elsewhere in New York City, a spokeswoman said there was "no question that we would have renovated" the sign.
"It's a symbol of our trademark and our commitment to New York City," said the spokeswoman, Christine M. Jones. "It's only natural for us to want it in perfect working order." She would not discuss the cost.
Instead of sporting the streamlined blue, modern letters, the sign retains the ruby-red letter forms of the 1930's -- with swash letters, curlicues and Gothic spikes, outlined by a 15-millimeter strand of neon.
"To change that sign would mean losing a little bit of the texture of New York," Ms. Jones said. "It would be like modernizing the lions at the Public Library or putting a digital clock on top of Grand Central or covering Central Park with Astroturf."
Clearly, signs are a serious matter.
In fact, it is a key issue between the 42d Street Development Project Inc., a New York State Urban Development Corporation subsidiary, and Times Square Center Associates, the developers of the 42d Street crossroads. This is a joint venture of the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty, headed by George Klein.
Independent of the Times Square Center project, it was announced last Wednesday that the Walt Disney Company would rehabilitate the landmark New Amsterdam Theater on 42d Street and reopen it in 1996.
Construction of the four Times Square Center office towers has been postponed until the real estate market improves. Meanwhile, existing buildings are to be rehabilitated as stores, restaurants and tourist attractions, following guidelines drawn up for the state by Robert A. M. Stern Architects and the design concern of M & Company.
Among the key underpinnings of the guidelines is that 42d Street's "unique tradition of bold signage and lighting displays" must be "retained and enhanced with ever-evolving signage adding to the daily drama."
"We want to make sure that 42d Street remains an entertainment street," said Vincent Tese, the chairman, president and chief executive of the Urban Development Corporation. "We want signage. We think signage is important. And there will be signage."
WITH enough signs, pedestrians would be drawn to the street, adding traffic for the retail and entertainment tenants. "They're interesting and people want to see them," said Paul Whalen, a partner in Mr. Stern's office. "Just by the fact that there is a critical mass of signs, the value of the properties where they are put goes up."
But the developers are wary. "What we're being asked to do is have signs that are different than existed there before and might not make commercial sense today," said Brian P. Murphy, senior vice president of the Prudential Realty Group.
"During the interim period we will maintain signs that are equivalent to what was there in 1992," he said. "That's the understanding we have. We agree to do that as a minimum." That includes maintaining such "spectaculars" as the green, white and red Fuji sign at Broadway and 43d Street.
Noting that Times Square Center Associates had "invested close to $300 million to purchase these sites for the purpose of building office buildings" and that any other use was temporary, Mr. Murphy said, "We cannot have the tail wag the dog."
"It is absolutely essential," he said, "that we have the ability at any time to take over a complete site when a tenant steps forward, even if it's within a month. The advertisers who would want 'spectacular signs' might require a minimum period of three to five years, or longer, to establish their 'sign presence' and recover the cost of those signs."
(It would cost about $1.5 million to build Fuji's 4,500-square-foot neon spectacular, said Jason Perline, the chairman of Van Wagner Communications.)
Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, said: "We are looking for signs that show cleverness and imagination. They don't have to be $5 million spectaculars to be memorable."
Mr. Tese said state officials were beginning to feel apprehensive about the "long delays" with which any suggestions were met by Times Square Center Associates, as well as the developers' "inability to really start advancing the ball."
"T.S.C.A. is tall on buildings and short on signage," Mr. Tese said. "We're going to come up with more suggestions but T.S.C.A. knows this is a priority with us, and they've got to start getting real."
Sign requirements have been part of the Times Square landscape since 1987, affecting new buildings on Broadway and Seventh Avenue, from 43d to 50th Street.
These regulations call for at least one illuminated sign for every ground-floor establishment, larger signs along the "street wall" (the part of the facade that rises straight up from the sidewalk, before a setback) and "super signs," up to 12,000 square feet in size, as high as 120 feet above the curb.
"THE way the old signs were laid out was chaos," said Jonathan Starr, chief operating officer of Artkraft Strauss. "Now, what's happening is that chaos has become part of the content that's being administered."
"That is the only case in history that any municipality mandated that you can't build a building unless there are signs on it," Mr. Perline said. "Of course, these buildings, for the most part, didn't want signs."
The only developer who openly embraced the requirements was Jeffrey Katz of Sherwood Equities, builder of the trapezoidal tower at 47th Street, Broadway and Seventh Avenue. It houses the Ramada Renaissance Times Square Hotel. Even more notably, its southern prow has a 310-foot sign tower, stacked with spectaculars: Coca-Cola, Suntory whisky, Samsung electronics.
"Economically speaking, the signs are a benefit to us," Mr. Katz said. "Our benefit derives from the uniqueness of our location, at the head the square, together with the design that John Schiff came forward with."
"But they are not a benefit to any other building; they're a burden," Mr. Katz said. "They're a net plus to the city but they're not a plus for each individual project."
The Katz project represented something of a departure from the way landlords typically dealt with outdoor advertisers.
"It used to be that we would lease space, pay the landlord a net sum, and everything after that, we pocketed," Mr. Perline said. "Because of the huge cost and value of the new buildings, the owners looked at the signage as a profit center -- although, in context, a small profit center. But they said: 'Hey, it's not a nuisance. There's a profit to be made.' It became, frankly, more difficult for us to do a standard deal."
Instead, Van Wagner acted as agent for Mr. Katz, working for a percentage. In the case of 1540 Broadway, at 45th Street, Van Wagner entered into a joint venture with the developer, Ian Bruce Eichner, which continues with the new owner, Bertelsmann Inc., the media conglomerate. Even before Bertelsmann moved in, there were two giant signs on the building. Two more have been added, with two to come. In purchasing 1540 Broadway, Bertelsmann "liked the signage that was all around here because it's lively and goes well with the entertainment industry we operate in," said Christian Alpers, senior vice president.
"I would not say the signage on our building had a major role," he said. "It did not make or break the deal."
Two buildings of contemporary vintage from which signs are conspicuously absent are 1585 Broadway, between 47th and 48th Streets, and 750 Seventh Avenue, at 49th Street. That is because the requirements are not triggered until an owner applies for a temporary certificate of occupancy for more than half the building. Neither 1585 Broadway nor 750 Seventh Avenue, which were developed by Solomon Equities, have ever reached that level of occupancy.
"Signage has been a marketing obstacle to many new buildings," said William G. Cohen of Newmark Real Estate Services, leasing agents for the consortium of banks that now owns 750 Seventh Avenue. "People don't want the responsibility for it. They don't know what to do with it."
However, Mr. Cohen said, there was "great interest in the tenant community" in the possibilities afforded by illuminated displays along 49th Street and the Broadway side of the black, ziggurat-like tower.
A block away, the silvery 1585 Broadway skyscraper was purchased last August by the Morgan Stanley Group and will be filling up in the next year and a half. "We haven't made any decisions about the new signage," a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley said.
Warren Wechsler, first senior vice president of the Real Estate Board, asked: "What does an investment banking house do with signage like that? It's got to define a use that's consonant with the tone it wants to strike in the marketplace."
Mr. Katz ventured an answer. "I think what they'll end up doing is something compatible with their image," he said. "That may not be commercial, but decorative."
But signs will be part of the bargain.
"Our position is that there is nothing discretionary in this," said Geoffrey W. Baker, deputy chief urban designer in the City Planning Department. "They are required to comply with the regulations."
"People understand that they can make money off these things and contribute to the quality of the area," Mr. Baker said. "I think you're going to see some signs on buildings that don't have to meet these requirements."
In fact, a neon spectacular for Hertz has recently been added to the north tower of the Marriott Marquis Hotel, at Broadway and 46th Street, next to the vast Kodak display. More signs may be coming to the hotel, which leases the sign space to Spectacolor Inc.
HAVING been built before the sign requirements took effect, the hotel is not compelled to install them. However, George N. Stonbely, the president of Spectacolor, said: "They do feel strongly that the building is part of the area and that signs are part of Times Square. They also enjoy significant revenues."
"We looked for clients that would be in sympathy with the business of the hotel: travelers, tourists, conventioneers," he said.
Spectacolor is also exploring ways to restore the illuminated 20-foot glass globe and four-sided tower clock atop the landmark Paramount Building, on Broadway, between 43d and 44th Streets. The clock was installed in 1926 and has not worked in many years.
A sponsor is being sought who would "want to be identified with the maintenance, relighting and operation," Mr. Stonbely said.
"If there were a discreet identification on the face of the clock," he added, "as you would see on a watch face, that might suffice."
Jeffrey R. Gural, president of Newmark & Company Real Estate, the managing and rental agent at the Paramount Building, said a restored clock and globe would be a "big benefit," attracting attention as the lighting does at the Empire State Building.
There are buildings where signs are more than icing on the cake; they are pretty much the cake itself. That is the case at One Times Square Plaza, at 42d Street, where the Sony Jumbotron screen and Minolta and Pepsi spectaculars are installed. The building filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992.
"The signs are the economic rationale for the building, at this point," said Mr. Stonbely, whose office is in the tower.
Mr. Perline, of Van Wagner, echoed the sentiment. "Signage is the best potential for income on that building," he said.
None of the big sign operators -- Van Wagner, Artkraft Strauss and Spectacolor -- would discuss the specific terms of their leases. However, Mr. Starr, of Artkraft Strauss, said rents can reach $100,000 a year.
"The value is determined by visibility, as well as size," said his sister, Tama Starr, who is the president and chief executive of the company. "When they are lower to the ground, they are worth more than if you have to crane your neck."
It is precisely at a lower level of altitude that New Yorkers will be seeing the next generation of illuminated advertising, in the form of cylindrical advertising kiosks that are meant to finance new public toilets.
The toilets would be built, maintained and operated by a private company, which would finance them by charging admission and by erecting two kiosks for every toilet it provided. The kiosks could rise 20 feet, as high as a two-story building, and would not have to be near the toilets.
Two-thirds of the display space could be used for paid advertising, in illuminated panels. One-third of the space would be set aside for public services: telephones, newspaper vending machines, maps, recycling bins or interactive video terminals, for example.
The City Planning Commission approved the proposal last month and sent it to the City Council, whose zoning and franchises subcommittee will consider it tomorrow. With approval from the Council, the Transportation Department could issue a request for companies to install the toilets and kiosks. The first phase calls for 40 toilets and 80 kiosks, with a final total of 800 structures.
PERHAPS the likeliest contractor is JCDecaux, a French company that says it supplies and maintains 4,000 toilets in 550 cities. Edward C. Wallace, a lawyer for JCDecaux USA, said that to meet the $39,000 annual cost of operating each toilet the company would need at least three kiosks for every toilet it provided.
Concern about the kiosks has been expressed by the Real Estate Board and the Municipal Art Society, who are not usually on the same side of the fence.
"First of all, there's the matter of traffic flow," said Mr. Wechsler, of the Real Estate Board. "You've got a huge office building, valued in the many millions of dollars. How will the arrival of one of these amenities affect people's access to the entrance, the ease with which they can move in and out?"
And what, Mr. Wechsler wondered, would be the impact of kiosks "whose presence, if not inimical, might pose a marketing problem" -- such as a Benetton billboard in front of a building whose principal retail tenant was a Gap clothing store.
A lawyer for the Municipal Art Society, Douglas N. Cogen, said, "We want public toilets, but you've got to ask at what price."
"If the move is to constantly create these new vehicles for advertising," he said, "eventually you reach the saturation point where nobody sees any of it. In the end, you lose the sense that there's some public commons that's not paid for by Absolut or Gap."
Brenda Levin, one of the planning commission members who voted for the proposal, did so with this guidance: "The shortest, the smallest, the fewest -- the best."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Fairfield in the Van of Commercial-Market Recovery

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
IN just five years, Fairfield County's commercial real estate market took one of the worst tumbles in the New York metropolitan region -- from a 17.5 percent vacancy rate in 1987 to 25.4 percent in 1992.
But today it is in the forefront of Connecticut's recovery, with space being consumed at an accelerating rate. 
 The Stamford-Greenwich vacancy rate is down to 21 percent from the 25 percent that persisted from 1991 through mid-1993. But most real-estate brokers believe that, given the overbuilt supply of offices and widespread corporate retrenchment, there will be no single-digit vacancies until late 1995.
"The northern and eastern parts of the state still suffer from defense industry cutbacks," said Owen J. Brown, manager of Cushman & Wakefield commercial realtors in Stamford. "Stamford and Greenwich will be fine, Hartford and New Haven too, eventually."
But he said he believed that Danbury and Waterbury would be hampered by their distances from I-95 and that Bridgeport had "a long way to go" to overcome its economic and image problems.
Fairfield County continues to benefit from proximity to New York.
"In 1992, 48 companies moved in, leasing 662,000 square feet," said Joseph Ercolano, vice president of the Stamford Area Commerce and Industry Association. "In 1993, 31 firms took 820,000 square feet, continuing a trend toward larger leases, from an average 6,700 square feet in 1990 to 14,800 in 1993."
Major reductions in the county vacancy rate for 1993 are attributable to the leasing by Witco Corporation, the chemical company, of 258,000 square feet in Greenwich and Dun & Bradstreet's taking 94,000 in Westport.
Office rents are firming up and concessions are dwindling, according to John H. Rostenberg of Rostenberg-Doern Company in Stamford. His company is marketing 10 Stamford Forum, one of the last major downtown buildings for sale.
Built in 1979 by the F. D. Rich Company, the 244,000-square-foot, half-vacant building was taken over by Prudential six months ago. "The asking price is $16.5 million," said Mr. Rostenberg.
Carl Traub, vice president of Cushman & Wakefield's Hartford/New Haven region, articulated a view held by many realtors that "older buildings are having a problem." With prices down, first-class space is being snapped up, he said, leaving older buildings in the dust.
"The market is looking for well-located, well-managed, up-to-code space," he said. "New Haven has been stagnant. Nobody has been coming in and I.B.M. moved out."
WILLIAM KANE of Edward F. Heberger & Associates, a New England appraisal firm, said that apartments and shopping centers in suburban areas were moving well.
"The concept of power centers," he added, "or clusters of category-leader stores, is growing."
He cited Universal Drive in North Haven, with a Home Depot, Price Club, Sports Authority, Office Max and Coconuts Video; another on Federal Road in Danbury, with The Wiz, Staples and Linens 'n' Things; and Route 1 in Norwalk, with ShopRite and Barnes & Noble Superstores.
There have been complaints by some real estate professionals that many lenders are reluctant to deal with commercial projects.
But Ellen Davis, first vice president of the commercial mortgage department of People's Bank, with headquarters in Bridgeport, said:
"It is not true that there is no money for business loans in Connecticut. We closed on $58 million in construction loans in 1993, covering single-family homes, apartments, shopping centers and nursing homes in Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport, Stamford and northwest Connecticut. We have financed sales and purchases of our own foreclosed properties and acquisitions of buildings. Our portfolio for the year grew from $100 million to $710 million."
"Typically," said Brian Dreyer, senior vice president of commercial lending for People's, "we negotiate one-, three- and five-year fixed-rate mortgage loans at rates based on credit quality, guarantors' strength, and market data. The most growth has been among small businesses with sales below $5 million."
People's does not lend for office buildings larger than 25,000 square feet "because we are not into speculative purchases where large vacancy rates prevail," Ms. Davis said. Among the ventures financed in 1993 were subdivisions for first-time home buyers in Shelton, Trumbull and Milford and retail centers in the Hartford region.
Commercial space users in downtown Hartford continue to move out to the suburbs.
"Farmington, West Hartford, Simsbury and Avon have good highway access, a strong retail base, and a lot of executives already live there," said Michael Puzzo, market analyst for the Farley Company, a Hartford real estate firm. "Downsizing of the insurance companies has put a damper on progress and without new jobs the downtown office market is not going to fill up again."
BUT on a brighter note the landmark Constitution Plaza, a complex of 640,000 square feet owned by GE Capital Corporation, has found a partner, Simons & Steinberg Interests of West Hartford, to update the 30-year-old complex. And plans are afoot to replace obsolete manufacturing plants in scattered industrial areas with 500,000 square feet of warehousing and distribution space..
Danbury Corporate Center, formerly headquarters of the Union Carbide Corporation, has 450,000 square feet to rent at a negotiable $21 a foot, constituting a large chunk of the city's 600,000 square feet of vacancies. Union Carbide and its subsidiaries occupy the rest of the 1.2 million square-foot complex, along with such concessions as several dining rooms, a health center, hair salon, newsstand, dry cleaner and gift shop.
Downtown Danbury is expecting a boost from the construction of a new Metro-North railroad station this year and a new performing arts and sports center, planned as a joint venture between the city and Western Connecticut State University.
"A retail anchor or two are needed downtown" to counter the draw of the Danbury Fair Mall, said Abel Carvalho, president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors' commercial division. Downtown rents range from $10 to $19 a square foot.
In New London, the Foxwoods Casino provided jobs but has not affected the real estate market, said Bruce Hyde, director of the city's development and planning department. Tourism, focusing on New London's seafaring history, the Groton submarine base and Coast Guard Academy, the gambling casino and Mystic's Seaport and Marinelife Aquarium, is perceived as the region's future.
New London's downtown retail district has been hurt by the Crystal Mall in Waterford, and offices "are renting up slowly, around $12.50 a square foot," said William Newman, a partner at Connecticut Commercial Realty.
Manufacturing and warehousing, laggards for decades in Connecticut's economy, are being revived even in Fairfield County, aided by aggressive state programs that offer tax abatements, credits and grants to incoming and existing businesses.
"Connecticut can take credit for doing an exceptional job in that regard," said Mr. Rostenberg.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Subleases;
The Manhattan Sublet Market Offers Surprises

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
CLEARLY, NationsBank had to move when its lease expired. It loved being in the General Motors Building, on Fifth Avenue and 59th Street. But it was bursting out of its 10,000 square feet, and the space's asbestos problems made repairs too costly.
The bank got the best of all worlds. On Memorial Day, it moved into 13,000 square feet it had sublet for five years from Bank Austria, another tenant in the building. And last month it sublet 6,000 additional feet from the rival bank, this time for eight years, and plans to move in on March 15. 
 "I'm paying half of what I was paying on the old lease and we only have to do minor renovations," said Thomas E. McCaskill, a NationsBank senior vice president.
Logic would dictate that with rents starting to rise, the sublet market would be falling apart, as tenants rush to lock in tomorrow's space at today's prices. But reality is defying logic. According to RELocate, which tracks building vacancies, there were 12.9 million square feet of sublet space available in Manhattan at the end of 1991; two years later there were just 8.3 million.
The absorption is throughout the city. Cushman & Wakefield says more than 1.4 million square feet of sublet space was rented last year in the Plaza District, which the brokerage firm broadly defines as 47th Street to 65th Street, east of Seventh Avenue.
Less elegant areas are heating up, too. According to Williams Real Estate, sublet availabilities in the southern, less expensive, part of midtown dropped by almost 9.6 percent last year, to 1.19 million square feet.
Apparently, many tenants are following a bird-in-hand philosophy, rushing for short-term bargains now, even if it means risking sky-high rents when the subleases run out.
"Direct rents may be tightening, but sublessors are still willing to mark down space to get rid of it," said Michael C. Dailey, a Cushman & Wakefield executive director who negotiated for NationsBank.
The savings can be huge.
"If a 50,000-foot tenant saves $10 a foot on a sublease, that's $2.5 million over five years," said Barry Gosin, Newmark Realty's president. "That's worth rolling the dice on what you'll be doing five years from now."
In fact, some tenants use sublets to hedge their own bets. Michael T. Cohen, Williams Real Estate's president, is looking for a short-term sublet for a law firm that is opening its first New York office.
"If they can't get a foothold here, they don't want to be stuck with a lease," he said.
Others are subletting in buildings they otherwise cannot afford. Robert C. Martin, a senior managing director at Grubb & Ellis New York, helped C & A Insurance sublet about 43,000 square feet of Marine Midland Bank's space at 2 World Trade Center.
"They wanted to move to the center, but a direct deal was just too expensive for them," Mr. Martin said.
And still others want move-in-ready space. A publishing company has asked Joseph G. Genovesi, managing director of D. G. Hart Associates, to find it a 22,000-square-foot sublet equipped with furniture and phones.
"They just don't want to deal with architects, pick out furniture, go through all the time and expense involved when you lease direct," Mr. Genovesi said.
Actually, not all sublet deals are for as-is space. Sometimes a primary tenant will offer a wonderfully rich deal if it can get rid of all its space in one swoop, rather than carve it up for six or seven small tenants.
"You find a primary tenant with a big problem at the right time and you can really capitalize on it," said Jeffrey Lichtenberg, a partner in the Peter R. Friedman brokerage firm . Mr. Lichtenberg recently helped the Battle Fowler law firm sublet 105,000 square feet from the International Business Machines Corporation at 65 East 55th Street. He would not talk numbers, but others say the law firm is paying $25 a foot -- about half of I.B.M.'s rent -- and got 14 months of free rent and $50 a foot toward customizing the space.
I.B.M.'s lease still had seven and a half years left. For shorter leases, many primary tenants are asking their landlords to assure sublet tenants that they will not have to move out a few years after they move in.
When Chemical Bank wanted to sublease space at 600 Fifth Avenue, at 48th Street, its sublessee, the investment company Reich & Tang, balked at moving for just the six years left on the lease. So Rockefeller Center Management, the building's owner, agreed to give the new sublessee first rights of refusal on the space when the lease expired -- provided they would pay market rates at the time.
"We would have been less likely to agree to a future rent at numbers that reflected 1994 market values," said Alan L. Stein, Rockefeller Center's vice president of marketing.
AND when the Reid & Priest law firm needed to get rid of 50,000 square feet of sublet space at 520 Madison Avenue, near 54th Street, Tishman Speyer, its landlord, wrote a new 10-year lease for the subtenant, Kroll & Tract, another law firm.
"They agreed because they didn't have to pay anything to renovate the space," said Peter Riguardi of Koeppel Tener Riguardi, who represented Kroll & Tract.
More important, there was only a year left on the lease, said Geoffrey P. Wharton, Tishman Speyer's managing director. He makes no promises about how he will handle some longer-term sublet space that he expects will soon be available in the building.
"If they can find a high-quality tenant and make the economics work, we'll try to cooperate, but frankly, I'm skeptical that they will strike a deal that would meet our financial objectives," he said.
Sometimes landlords capitalize on a sublessor's rising panic and sublet the space back to themselves. A tenant that moved out of 60 Madison Avenue, near 27th Street, was on the hook for 14,000 square feet, at $30 a foot, for another three years. The landlord sublet the space from the tenant for less than $10, and rented it to another tenant, on a longer lease, for a rent in the high teens.
"The tenant couldn't have found a sublet for just three years, so he was happy to do it," said Mr. Gosin, who represented the landlord. "And the landlord got to pocket the differential on the rent."
Other times, landlords and sublessors jointly market their vacant spaces on the idea that, with large blocks of contiguous space getting scarce in midtown, the whole is worth more than its parts.
Deutschebank, for one, has asked Robert J. Alexander, a senior managing director at Edward S. Gordon Company, to find a sublessee for two floors at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, near 52d Street. Mr. Alexander and Olympia & York, the building's owner, are working out a deal under which O & Y would extend the Deutschebank lease, which has almost 10 years left, and let Mr. Alexander market it in conjunction with three other floors that may become vacant in the building next year.
"We have more flexibility if we can offer more space," Mr. Alexander said.
WHEN landlords will not cooperate sublet space must go at fire-sale prices. In a rising market, the value of empty space that can be leased directly from a landlord grows. But a sublease decreases in value with every passing day.
Most brokers say a sublease for less than eight years is a hard sell, and one for less than five years is nearly unmarketable. As the clock ticks, the deals get richer.
A couple of years ago, Chubb Insurance sublet space from Salomon Brothers at 1221 Avenue of the Americas, at 49th Street, when there was nearly 10 years left on the lease. A few weeks ago it sublet some more of Salomon's space, at a lower rent.
"Now there's just eight years left to go on the lease," explained Josh N. Kuriloff, a Cushman & Wakefield director who represented Chubb.
For almost two years Bertelsmann tried to find subtenants for 250,000 square feet at 666 Fifth Avenue, near 52d Street. Its lease expires in 2000 and the company, which has moved into its own building, 1540 Broadway at 45th Street, is getting desperate.
Recently it slashed the rent it was asking, and leased 150,000 feet. Mr. Lichtenberg, Bertelsmann's broker, says he is pretty close to getting rid of 75,000 square feet more. And he has sent out word that "we'll be extremely aggressive in making a deal" for the rest.
"We're dumping the space out at less than half of what we're paying, and we'll bearhug anyone who comes in now," he said.

HEADLINE: A New Session, an Uncertain Agenda

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
AN election-year budget fuss? A gun-control blunderbuss? Property tax? Spending whacks? Casino gambling off the tracks?
If Dr. Seuss were to write the script for this year's General Assembly session, there would probably be no more pratfalls, loop-the-loops and odd characters than what the lawmakers themselves will provide when the 12-week session convenes in Hartford on Wednesday. 
 Legislative leaders, lobbyists and others who watch the Capitol say that this year, even more than in some past years, the process will be subject to forces from beyond the inner circle.
From the Mohegan Indian tribe's hopes for Federal recognition and a second Connecticut casino, to the legal odyssey of Michael Ross, the convicted serial killer whose death penalty drama in the State Supreme Court will play out even as lawmakers are talking crime and punishment across the street, to the men and women who would be governor, major forces and events will be unfolding outside the Capitol. How those events are perceived by the public -- and how politicians further interpret those perceptions -- are the great unknowns.
"It's going to be a much different type of session," said the Speaker of the House, Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat from Hartford. "The issues are far more complex."
Casino gambling is probably the perfect example of an issue that could sail into new spirals of complexity even as the session goes on.
Legislators say that after last year's crushing defeat, when casino promoters declined to even try a vote in the House or Senate after spending millions of dollars in lobbying and advertising fees, the momentum has clearly slowed. With Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in the governor's chair for a last session and vowing a veto of any casino bill, even some of the most enthusiastic believers in gambling as an economic development tool say that building a casino in Hartford or Bridgeport to compete with the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe's Foxwoods casino in Ledyard is out of reach.
What could change everything, however, is the prospect of another Indian casino. The Mohegans, based in Montville, have indicated a readiness -- and the financial backing -- to get into the gambling business alongside the Pequots if their petition to the Federal Government for formal tribal recognition is granted. Two casinos, legislators believe, could shift the discussion.
 
Looking for Override Votes
 "Casino advocates in the legislature are looking for an opportunity to collect override votes," Senator William A. Aniskovich, a Republican from Branford, said in referring to the two-thirds majority needed to override a gubernatorial veto. "If the Mohegan reaction creates a critical mass of public opinion that could swing people, then they'll look to move quickly."
If the gambling issue heats up, the shift in focus could start to squeeze out issues like gun control or property-tax relief, both of which are expected to be included in some form in Mr. Weicker's State of the State speech on Wednesday.
Mr. Weicker -- who announced last year that he would not seek a second term -- has said he would use his last year in office to push an agenda to benefit children. It would include in particular a crime bill that would create a licensing system for gun owners akin to the driver's license and registration systems. The proposal would also create a new, higher hurdle for carrying a concealed weapon, and stiffer penalties for owners of guns used in violent crimes.
The bill has drawn criticism, especially from some Republicans concerned that individuals' rights to defend themselves from criminals could be weakened.
 
The Michael Ross Case
 One wild card in the discussion is Michael Ross.
Mr. Ross was sentenced to death six years ago for kidnapping and strangling four young women in 1983 and 1984, and on Feb. 15 and 16, the State Supreme Court will hear his appeal. The Ross case has been an emotional trigger point for years, and the court's consideration of the case -- during a session already earmarked by the Governor for the question of crime and its effect on society -- will be watched by the legislators for voters' reactions.
Among the proposals that could be buffeted by the Ross case are stiffer penalties for persistent offenders, including a measure that would require life in prison for a third felony offense or a second felony offense with a gun. Lawmakers in both parties locally and nationally are pushing the idea.
Behind everything, of course, is the budget, usually the main event in the legislature, and sure to be again this year -- if only by being ignored. Last year, under a new budget-writing law, the General Assembly passed the first two-year budget, intended to take the state through June 30, 1995 with only minor tinkering.
 
Who Defines What's Minor?
 The question is, who defines what is minor? Because of increases in the costs of Medicaid and of prisons in particular, the $9 billion budget for the year beginning July 1 is more than $160 million out of balance. Leaders in the House and Senate have said that keeping budget work to a minimum is a priority because of the precedent-setting value. Find a way to cut spending enough to fill the gap, the leaders say, but don't question the major priorities or the bottom line.
"This is the test of whether a biennial budget works or not," Mr. Ritter said. "How we conduct ourselves will set the tone for future legislatures."
But those priorities have not yet met reality. The Majority Leader in the Senate, William A. DiBella, a Democrat from Hartford, said that Mr. Weicker has informally indicated that he has some "new priorities" that he will introduce in his speech before the combined House and Senate.
 
Opening Up the Budget
 How much the budget actually gets opened up, Mr. DiBella said, will depend on what Mr. Weicker asks for, because to whatever degree the Governor wants new items in the spending plan, so too will everyone else want their revisions considered.
"He's basically going to set the stage as to where we're going to go on this issue," Mr. DiBella said.
And there is, of course, the issue that elections for governor and all the General Assembly seats are just nine months away, and that the Capitol will be packed with people intent on keeping their current jobs, or taking away someone else's, on Election Day.
 
Going After Higher Office
 In the Senate there are three candidates for governor: Senator Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat from Newington, Senate President Pro-tem John B. Larson, a Democrat from East Hartford, and Lieutenant Governor Eunice S. Groark, who presides over the chamber, and who is running on the third party ticket that Mr. Weicker created in 1990, A Connecticut Party. Another Senator, James H. Maloney, a Democrat from Danbury, is seeking the nomination for the Fifth District congressional seat held by Gary A. Franks, a Republican.
In the House, at least three people are seeking more prominent jobs. The Majority Leader, Representative Thomas S. Luby, a Democrat from Meriden, is also running for the Fifth District seat sought by Mr. Maloney; Representative Miles S. Rapoport, a Democratic from West Hartford, is running for Secretary of the State, and Representative Gene Gavin, a Republican from Westport, is running for Comptroller.
Other candidates will be close at hand and no doubt making their voices heard. Pauline R. Kezer, the Secretary of the State, and former United States Representative John G. Rowland are both seeking the Republican nomination for governor. Democrats outside the legislature include William E. Curry Jr., the state Comptroller, and Joseph P. Ganim, the Mayor of Bridgeport.
Democrats and Republicans agree that there is one key indicator to watch: how Mrs. Groark is treated. If polling indicates that her third party candidacy is taking votes from one party more than the other, she will become an ally to one and foe of the other.
"It's as basic as that," Mr. Ritter said.

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Who's Responsible For Drain Repairs?
 
Q. I live in a rent-controlled apartment. Recently, the landlord billed me for work done by an outside contractor to clear a bathroom drain of excessive hair. The landlord quotes from a two-year lease signed by us in 1962 as the basis for our responsibility. 
 May the landlord cite such an old lease and, if not, is the tenant indeed responsible for such repairs? . . . Lorraine Simmons, Manhattan
 
A. According to Michael Finder, a Manhattan lawyer, if the landlord is able to prove that the cause of the drainage problem was coming from the tenant's putting hair down the drain, then the tenant could be held responsible.
He added that the original date of the lease in this case was not relevant.
 
How Much to Spend To Buy a Home
 
Q. My husband and I are looking to buy a co-op. How can we figure out what we can afford? Is there a formula? We have an income of about $90,000 a year?
How much would be a reasonable down payment, mortgage payment, maintenance and tax payments? . . . P. Reed, Manhattan
 
A. According to Margaret S. Scott, president of the Mortgage Advisory Service, a mortgage broker in Manhattan, there are several simple ways to gauge how expensive an apartment you can afford, though the amount will also depend on the size of your down payment, maintenance and taxes on the property, your total liabilities and financial goals.
One of the easiest ways, and a method often cited by real estate brokers, is to double your annual income. In your case, that's $180,000.
Ms. Scott also recommended that you make a 20 percent down payment, or $36,000, not only to keep your payments lower but also to avoid paying mortgage insurance, which is the equivalent of adding .375 of a percent onto your mortgage rate.
You should also be prepared, Ms. Scott added, to pay about $2,500 in closing costs for a co-op and a higher amount if you buy a house or a condominium.
There is also, in New York City, a mortgage tax of 1.75 percent for houses and condominiums. In addition to closing costs, you should add any points that are part of your mortgage. (A point is equal to one percentage point of the mortgage.)
With a down payment of $36,000, you will need a $144,000 mortgage, which at 7.5 percent annual interest over 30 years, will cost you about $1,000 a month. Ms. Scott estimated that the average maintenance on such an apartment was about $750 a month, a portion of which is probably tax deductible. This maintenance includes your taxes and insurance. If you were buying a house, there would be no maintenance, but taxes and insurance would be additional. For a condominium, there are common charges that cover insurance but not taxes.
Thus your combined mortgage and maintenance is now $1,750, which is under the 28 percent limit of gross monthly income that is required by most lenders. They will also require that the $1,750 plus any installment debt you may have not exceed 36 percent of your gross income.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Will the Big 3 Stay on the Road To Success?

BYLINE: By Doron P. Levin

 BODY:
WHAT a difference a recovery can make in Detroit. Only yesterday, it seems, the Big Three chiefs and President Bush flew to Tokyo complaining about "getting our brains beaten in," to use Lee Iacocca's vivid expression.
Today the Big Three, exemplified by Chrysler's stunning turnaround, are selling cars almost as fast as they can build them. With improved American quality and Japan's higher prices, Detroit's models indeed represent superior value, a claim that is finally holding water. 
 The biggest factor in Detroit's revival, however, hasn't been better quality, but rather the steadily improving demand for vehicles, especially light trucks, that began last spring.
But the huge losses of a year ago are easily forgotten by those who bought General Motors, Ford and Chrysler shares during the past two years and now sit on nifty gains.
Now the mystery is not just how long the boom will last but what happens after sales peak.
Will the Big Three again lose stupendous sums? Will they have to scramble to replenish the capital they need for new models and research?
The test of a competitive auto industry won't be whether it can break out of its cyclical pattern -- it is, after all, a mature, not a growth, industry -- but whether it can maintain its health during a trough in sales. In market share, the Big Three haven't regained much of what they lost to Japan.
The companies still struggle with the fundamental puzzle of how to configure operations so they can remain profitable -- or at least less unprofitable -- with lower sales volume. "All the auto makers are improving but we can't really answer the question of their basic health until the next downturn," said Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York.
When will the downturn arrive? Most economists agree that car sales should peak no sooner than 1996. Some say that stock prices tend to peak a year before sales do, so investors in Big Three shares may have another year or so of profit -- provided nothing like a war or a surge in gas prices scares car buyers in the meantime.
Wendy Needham, a Smith Barney analyst, noted that in Detroit, "management is reinvesting in products this time, not spending on acquisitions as they did during the 1980's." Beyond watching for a turn in the economy, Ms. Needham warned, investors need to keep an eye out "for an obvious flop of a new car or truck, something that could cause a stampede out of the stock." For now, she forecasts all three companies will appreciate at least to the range of $70 to $80 a share.
The American auto industry has been better at recovering from trouble than staying out of trouble. As Tom Gale, a Chrysler vice president, said: "Chrysler is terrific at adversity. We're not that good at success." Only the next downturn will tell if the pattern will be broken.

THE ECONOMY
 
A Whiff of Inflation, and a Stampede Out of Stocks
Inflation continues to hover just off stage, a dragon that never actually appears but whose menacing noises still keep the on-stage actors jumpy. On Friday the Federal Reserve raised its Federal funds rate a notch -- to 3.25 percent from 3 percent -- and the financial markets acted as if someone had stolen their champagne. It shouldn't have been a surprise, though. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said earlier in the week that such a nudge might be needed to head off long-term inflation, and many people shrugged it off, saying things were going so well that a small rise couldn't do much harm. But when the announcement came, bond prices fell and stocks tumbled, with the Dow industrials (after flirting with 4,000 earlier in the week) losing 96 points for the day, to 3,871 -- the eighth-biggest drop ever. So has the bull market stumbled, or will investors decide that 3.25 percent still isn't that high? It's a nervous weekend. 

Solid Job Data (Look Closely)
The job numbers should be crisp, clear guideposts, but you needed a fine-print user's guide to read January's report, out last week. Yes, unemployment was 6.7 percent, up from December's 6.4. But: the survey's been redesigned (the old one was missing too many women looking for work), so it's apples vs. oranges. All things being equal, the Government says, the job picture's improving. And, yes, payrolls expanded by just 62,000, a third what was expected. But: blame the cold weather. The bottom line, economists say, is an economy still moving solidly ahead. This time, we'll have to take it on faith.
 
Buying Cars, Even in January
Americans must really be primed to buy new cars these days. Neither sleet nor snow nor ice (nor even more ice) nor collapsing freeways held them back in January, as sales surged 13.8 percent, beyond even the rosiest forecasts. The dealers' main worry now is just having enough cars and trucks to sell. Why the stampede? Clearly, with employment, income and confidence up, Americans are looking hard at their dented, sputtering antiques -- the average vehicle is now nearly eight and a half years old, the highest since the early 50's. And one dealer came up with a grim tidbit of optimism: Because so many cars were totaled on January's ice, sales are bound to stay strong.
 
New York Women, Catching Up
Women already know the bad news: men earn more than they do. But the good news is that the gap is shrinking -- and especially so in New York City. If you're a woman and a high school graduate, New York was the place to be in the 80's. A study out last week says women in the city who worked full time in 1989 earned 77.5 cents for each man's dollar, up from 71 cents in 1979. Nationwide, though, the '89 number was just 66 cents. The study, done by Columbia's Teachers College, also showed that by 1990 women had become a majority in the city's labor force -- no doubt because manufacturing jobs are on the decline. Progress, yes, but for the city's women the next question has to be, "O.K., what about that other 22.5 cents?"
 
The Perils of Messing With Milk
The food industry has tinkered with nature for ages -- adding preservatives, dyes, who-knows-what -- but rarely has there been such an outcry. Perhaps milk is different -- sacred, somehow -- for there's been a gut reaction against this round of tampering. Last week a growth hormone designed to increase cows' output made its debut -- a hormone born of biotechnology -- and several big food companies quickly moved to limit its use. The F.D.A. insists it's safe, but stores are balking not for safety reasons but out of fear of what customers will say.
 
Volunteering for Emission Limits
If California can do it, so can we! That seemed to be the thinking of 12 Eastern states last week when they asked the E.P.A. to impose California's stricter auto emission rules. The governors of the states -- from Maine to Virginia -- wanted the rules, but if they get Washington to make them do it, they'll have less rebellion from state legislators, who tend to have lobbyists banging on their doors.
 
Does Sculley Know Best?
What is John Sculley up to? A lot of people would love the answer. When the former Apple chairman made his puzzling decision to join Spectrum Technologies, had he lost his senses or was he privy to some information about Spectrum's glittering future? Initially, investors bet on the latter, and the stock soared. But then came word that top Spectrum executives, who would surely know of any pots of gold, cashed in a lot of stock after Mr. Sculley joined. To top it off, the company faces an S.E.C. inquiry, and there was talk of a spat between Mr. Sculley and Spectrum's president. So last week the company went out of its way to say Mr. Sculley was busy, busy, busy with acquisitions and joint ventures.
 
BMW, With a British Accent
Like water in adjacent (leaky) pools, European industry is finding its own level. Germany's auto makers are known for high quality -- but also for high labor costs, and that's hurting. Seeking a better balance, BMW last week agreed to buy the Rover Group for $1.2 billion. For BMW, it was the best way to get an efficient small-car maker, because in addition to big, trendy Range Rovers, the British company makes cars like the Metro and Mini. And, more to the point, British labor costs are roughly half of Germany's. So the sun has clearly set on one empire: Every big British auto maker is now under foreign control.
 
I.B.M. and Intel, Drifting Apart
In 1981, mighty I.B.M. bestowed on Intel the right to supply the microprocessors, the "brains," for its personal computers. But Intel has grown mighty itself and now dominates this highly profitable market, turning into an I.B.M. rival. So last week I.B.M., as part of its effort to redefine itself, pulled back from its ties with Intel, moving toward making its own type of microchip.
Intel was already turning part of its attention to lower-tech pursuits. The next day it said it would sponsor the Professional Chess Association, founded by Gary Kasparov, the world champion. At tournaments, Intel will use computer graphics and giant video screens to "bring the ancient game of chess into the 21st century." It might have made it anyway.
 
Networks Seek Better Ratings
The television folks aren't satisfied with a population that spends most of its waking hours in front of the tube. No, they want the precise who, what and when of this national addiction. Nielsen ratings try to provide this, but networks have long said Nielsen is inaccurate. Last week they ran out of patience, starting a multimillion-dollar search for another way. The main complaint: Nielsen undercounts some viewers, costing networks millions of ad dollars. "It is simply unthinkable," said an NBC executive, "to be locked into yesterday's methods." With "people meters" out of favor, is tomorrow's method a spy in every household?
 
A Whispered Hello to Vietnam
President Clinton is dying to tear down trade walls, but when his finger came to Vietnam as he worked down the list, an emotion-charged past flooded in -- right up to the "draft dodger" cries regularly hurled at him. American business, eyeing a possible $6 billion market, wanted to end the war-era trade embargo, and many others just wanted to close that painful chapter. But veterans' groups balked. So when Mr. Clinton ended the embargo last week, he tiptoed up to it -- and went right to the point on everyone's mind by vowing that the move "offers the best way to resolve the fate of those who remain missing."
 
A French Aircraft Subsidy
Europe's commercial aircraft subsidies have been a touchy subject on both sides of the Atlantic for some time now. The way Washington sees it, an Airbus kept aloft by Government largess is an unfair rival to Boeing and its cousins. Nonsense, says Airbus: Pentagon and NASA contracts for American plane makers are just subsidies by another name. France did nothing to cool this tension last week when it said it would chip in $341 million to prop up the state-owned Aerospatiale, which owns more than a third of Airbus. Of course, the Airbus A330 has been slow to rival Boeing's 777 -- the first A330's have been grounded by a landing-gear defect.
 
The Americas, United in Trade
After passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the rest of Latin America looked at Mexico and said, "What about us?" Washington welcomed the question, because Latin America is devouring American exports, and the Clinton Administration's diplomatic tool of choice is trade, not aid. So last week the Administration said it was drafting a plan for a Western Hemisphere free trade zone. (Great: Now that we've got "Nafta," we face "Whftz" -- pronounced, presumably, "Whoofts.") It won't be quick -- 10 to 15 years, probably -- because Latin nations must first get their economies in order by deregulating markets and taming inflation. Chile, whose economy has come the furthest, will be the first in. And if the rest follow, there'll be a single tariff-free market of 750 million people.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Roots Grow Into an Argentine Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: LLAO LLAO, Argentina

 BODY:
TUCKED into a dense stand of evergreens, a group of low, whitewashed buildings with corrugated metal roofs give little indication of the activities within. Maybe a conservation group. Maybe a national park office. The only clue is the parabolic dish on top of a red-and-white radio tower.
But inside the shaded compound, an elite team of Argentina's electronic and nuclear engineers are working, not exactly secretively, but with a very low profile. In newly built "clean rooms," their primary project is a $7 million research satellite for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States, to be launched in mid-1995. 
 Some 15 miles east, in the city of Bariloche, inside a two-story sandstone-colored building that looks like a home, computer programmers are working on robotics and software for just-in-time manufacturing, as well as designing small but highly advanced nuclear reactors. There are no signs outside the structure to indicate the advanced work within.
These are the offices of Invap S.E., Argentina's tiny version of a Silicon Valley company. It has 300 employees and sales of no more than $40 million a year. Its shareholders are the provincial Government of Rio Negro and the Argentine Government through the National Atomic Energy Commission.
Though tiny compared with leading international high-tech companies, Invap has found that in certain market niches -- like building small research reactors -- it can compete with international giants like General Atomics of San Diego and Babcock & Wilcox of New Orleans.
The project with NASA, the first time a satellite has been built in Argentina, is providing training for Argentine engineers and transfers of American technology that would have been impossible just four years ago, because Argentina was considered a threat to nuclear proliferation.
"We are mainly nuclear engineers and physicists, and what the people from NASA told us was that they were surprised how quickly our engineers switched into space technology," said Hector E. Otheguy, general and technical manager of Invap. "Though small, we find that at least in some areas we can compete."
In the first part of this century, Argentina was among the world's richest nations, yet today it has only a tiny home-grown technological capacity. Its failure to keep up is sobering testimony to decades of intense nationalism, isolation from the industrialized world and association with often unstable third-world governments. Argentina developed its own reactor technology -- and thus the potential to build an atomic bomb -- as far back as the 1960's, through its atomic research center in Bariloche. But from the start it refused to let international monitoring agencies inspect its operations.
Successive Governments argued that permitting international controls was the equivalent of giving the industrialized world the right to manipulate the nation's technological future and its growth.
In many ways, Invap was one of the main instruments for Argentina's nuclear program. Founded in the early 1970's by scientists from the atomic center to use the technology they had developed, Invap, under the guidance of the National Atomic Energy Commission, built small reactors for third-world countries like Algeria, Peru and Iran, as well as for the Argentine Government itself.
MOST of the work was done in almost total secrecy, including a uranium enrichment plant 40 miles east of Bariloche, begun in the early 1980's to supply Argentina's research reactors with fuel in case the international community cut off supplies. The plant, which has cost the Government $300 million, places Argentina among a select group of nine countries that have the capacity, at least in theory, to enrich uranium to a grade that nearly approaches that used in bombs.
Although its nuclear program was remarkably advanced compared with those of most third-world countries, Argentina found itself on a list of nations prohibited from receiving transfers of new computer and electronic technology. The prohibition stemmed from an effort to stop proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
That has changed, however, under the Government of President Carlos Saul Menem, who has opened all of the country's nuclear operations to international controls and inspection, and renounced nuclear proliferation.
For Invap, it has meant drastic changes -- in particular, shedding its tradition of secrecy -- as well as a brush with near-bankruptcy two years ago.
IN the mid-1980's, Invap signed a contract with Iran to build a purification plant for enriched uranium. Under a second contract, a pilot plant was to be built that would produce fuel rods for Iranian research reactors.
In late 1991, when its first shipment of equipment was ready to leave port, the company received instructions from the Foreign Ministry -- at Washington's request -- to halt it. The reasoning was that Iran, though it had signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, was a potentially unreliable signatory that at any time could decide to develop nuclear weapons. Breaking the contracts meant a loss of $25 million in income.
"It was a blow for Invap, and we didn't know if we could recover from it," Thomas Buch, an official of the company, said. "We were shipping things we bought off the shelf -- tubing, valves, lathes -- and argued they in themselves did not contribute to proliferation. But the Foreign Ministry reasoned that anything that increased Iran's capacity to develop nuclear weapons should be stopped."
Since those bleak first months, the company seems to have more than recovered.
In addition to being given the contract with NASA, many say as American compensation for having broken the two Iranian contracts, it has won a $60 million deal to build a research reactor in Cairo and is on the short list of finalists for an even larger reactor for the Government of Thailand; two of its competitors for the Thai deal are General Atomics and Babcock & Wilcox.
In addition, informal talks are under way with General Atomics on joint ventures.
Invap is considering taking the design of its small-reactor technology even further. With Argentina's explosive economic growth over the last three years, and anticipation of continuing growth through much of the decade, the country's electrical power needs could almost double over the next decade.
While Invap does not pretend to build giant nuclear power stations with the capacity of 600 to 700 megawatts, it is working on designs for small plants in the 25-to-50-megawatt range. The smaller plants could be built in much less time -- about two years -- eventually using a type of assembly-line technique if enough were built. That would allow greater economies and enable nuclear power to compete in price with gas and hydroelectric plants.
Jorge Marticorena, former president of Invap, argues that not only do the smaller plants use simpler cooling technologies and are thus safer, but that Argentina would be using its large uranium reserves as well as its home-grown high-tech know-how.
"It cost us a lot politically and economically to get where we are, and it makes sense to use the technology we have developed here in Argentina," he said.

HEADLINE: Profile;
From Brooklyn, Around the World, To Mobil's Top Job

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

DATELINE: FAIRFAX, Va.

 BODY:
Lucio A. Noto, who will soon replace Allen E. Murray atop the Mobil Corporation, is not typical of the men who have risen to the top of international oil giants. He's the Brooklyn-born son of the leader of a union local comprising mostly Italian immigrants. He rose through the ranks at Mobil in planning and marketing, rather than winning acclaim with big finds in the exploration division. And he made his reputation not in this country but overseas.
Little-known at headquarters here until recent years, he was until last year a dark horse in the race to run the $64 billion company that is the nation's fourth-largest. 
 But with Mobil looking abroad for an increasing share of its business, Mr. Noto's accomplishments were hard to overlook. He helped build Mobil's operations in Japan, then Italy, then Saudi Arabia. He gained a reputation for financial savvy, detailed knowledge of operations, social skills and sensitivity to other cultures. All won him friends among the foreign officials and executives with whom Mobil needed to work.
Now, Mr. Noto, who is 55, has a broader challenge. His predecessor refocused the company on its core businesses, shedding Montgomery Ward and the Container Corporation, and began cutting costs in a big way, reducing the work force by about 15,000 over the past five years to 62,000. Mr. Noto is obligated to continue that streamlining -- weak operations in France might be among the first to go -- but also to strike deals to develop new reserves in politically perilous places like Vietnam, Russia and Kazakhstan as Mobil's major fields begin to run dry.
He also must find enough customers to justify the company's $8 billion effort to develop one of the world's largest gas fields, in Qatar, at a time when other companies are also hurrying to bring on gas production.
And he must execute such risky plans while continuing to satisfy shareholders, who have become accustomed in recent years to rising dividends and stock prices. In the past five years Mobil shareholders have received a pre-tax annual return (combining dividends and stock increases) of about 17 percent, compared with an average of 13.5 percent among the major oil companies.
Mr. Noto, already the president and chief operating officer, will take over from Mr. Murray as chairman and chief executive on March 1. The two men differ in style. Whereas Mr. Murray avoided the limelight, gave few interviews and disliked informal politicking, particularly in Washington, Mr. Noto feels at home in such roles and might be more aggressive and outspoken in pursuing the interests of the industry. He can be expected to communicate in person what Mobil has been saying in its print advertising campaign since 1972.
He says he is not daunted by the position. "Some people say, 'Well, the glory days of this industry have passed,' " he said. "I say no to that."
Like his oil-industry counterparts, Mr. Noto is faced with low prices for oil and gas and stricter environmental requirements for gasoline in many nations. That will raise operating costs. His challenge is to make his company the low-cost operator in all phases of his business.
At the same time, Mobil, whose United States reserves are past their peak and which now has nearly two-thirds of its production abroad, must find new reserves in foreign lands.
New technology for exploration and drilling, plus the eagerness of many nations to bring in major oil companies to find new fields, has made Mobil's job abroad easier. Still, the dangers are high of sinking a lot of money into a country whose government might change, and where chances are slim of finding major deposits.
For example, Mobil has received permission from Vietnam to drill in a promising area called the Blue Dragon in its territorial waters, near the area where the company had drilled before abandoning its efforts after the Vietnam War. Now that President Clinton has lifted the Government's post-war trade embargo, that project can proceed. Yet one of Mobil's own experts, after reviewing the plan recently, said there is only a 20 percent chance of finding oil or gas in the region.
"And that's hot -- that's not a bad prospect, 20 percent," Mr. Noto said.
The Qatar gas project is another tough one. It includes a huge plant to liquefy the gas and an investment in giant tankers to carry it to customers in Japan and other countries. Mobil still has to line up long-term customers, like utilities in Japan, and persuade banks and other investors to put up the billions in financing to see through the project. Mr. Noto wants at least 50 percent of the money to come from outside the company. The first gas will not flow from the project until about 1997.
Mr. Noto also said that Mobil may have to get out of some markets in Europe. He would not say which, but Constantine Fliakos, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said Mobil had a weak position in France and may decide to sell its refining operations and gas stations there.
LUCIO NOTO grew up in Bensonhurst, a tough neighborhood in Brooklyn to which his parents had moved with their parents from Sicily early in the century. His father became active in the labor movement, and was later Secretary General of Local 89 of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, an Italian-speaking unit.
Mr. Noto, who pushed hand carts and packaged clothing during the summer as a teen-ager, remembers the day in 1945 when his father packed everyone in his 1938 Oldsmobile, filled canteens with water and drove across the George Washington Bridge to Englewood Cliffs, N.J., to look for a house. They bought the old Victorian where Mr. Noto grew up.
A quick mind that could recall details and figures got him into a private high school, St. Regis, run by Jesuits in Manhattan. Mr. Noto went on to the University of Notre Dame, where he studied physics and played catcher on the baseball team. Then came Cornell University, where he got his M.B.A. in 1962.
Out of school, he joined Mobil's planning group and began to court his future wife, Joan.
By 1968 he was in Tokyo, overseeing teams of Japanese workers that began to bring Mobil a significant share of the gasoline market there. He learned some Japanese and made friends, and this could help him in Mobil's current attempt to win customers for the Qatar project.
In 1973, he was sent to Italy, as an executive vice president of Mobil Oil Italiana. He had learned Italian from his grandparents but, he recalls, his Sicilian dialect was so heavy that he had to take lessons so that Italians could better understand him.
IN 1979 he went to Saudi Arabia to coordinate Mobil's joint ventures there. He helped set up a petrochemical plant and refinery with the Saudis, who have the biggest oil reserves in the world. He made a lot of allies and friends and caught the eye of Mobil headquarters.
He also made contacts elsewhere in the Middle East. "Lou has close relations with the Middle Eastern governments which could help the company to open doors," said John D. Hervey, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Mr. Noto's abilities in entertaining foreign government and industry people were often crucial to sewing up a deal or easing through a project. He also credits his wife's skills.
Brought back to New York by Mr. Murray in 1985, Mr. Noto was made vice president of planning and economics. He became the front-runner for the top job last year, when he was elected president and chief operating officer.
He credits his rise to the top partly to good fortune. "I was lucky to be in countries where there were issues that got a lot of attention, so I got a lot of attention," he said.
He also said that his many years in joint-venture projects, as opposed to projects solely owned by Mobil, helped keep him thinking of ways to do things better. "When you have to go into a joint-venture board every month and convince them that this is the right way to go, it generates a different kind of skill set that I think is pretty good," Mr. Noto said.
He likes to meet occasionally with recently hired young employees, who ask him how he made it to the top. He tells them: "There are many ways to get to the top. And I tell you one of the best ways in my opinion is not to worry about what's going to happen next. Worry about what you're supposed to do today."
He is not one to keep long hours and to pressure other executives to toil late. After exercising at home, he gets to work in his Toyota Land Cruiser at about 7 A.M. By 6:45 P.M. he is generally on his way home. "I get tired," he said.
Outside Mobil, Mr. Noto moves easily among writers, artists and the social set, as he demonstrated last October at the Lotos Club in Manhattan. An Absolut on the rocks in hand, he worked the crowd and gave a small speech honoring a Slovak writer, Martin Simecka, with the company's Pegasus Prize for a work in a language other than English.
Colleagues recall that when Mr. Noto was stationed in Italy, he and his wife helped sponsor the Spoleto arts festival. He is also an avid collector of abstract art and has made friends with artists, including the British painter Albert Irvin.
Yet Mr. Noto also likes to show his Brooklyn roots. He seems comfortable with working people. He kids employees at all levels and last week enjoyed some razzing from Calvin Pugh, a maintenance man who is a Dallas Cowboys fan, about the defeat of the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl.
A car buff who lights up when he recalls the orange Maserati he picked up for a song in Italy and drove on the autostrada when there were no speed limits, Mr. Noto still likes to get his hands in the tool chest. He tinkered with a Datsun 240Z but botched the job so badly that he had to bring it to the shop to finish the work. He has no such plans for Mobil.

HEADLINE: Technology;
For 'This Old Field,' a Costly Renovation Project

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
WHEN Phillips Petroleum brought Norway into the oil industry by discovering the Ekofisk field 180 miles off the country's southwest coast in 1969, Phillips figured it might be able to continue production through the 1990's. And certainly, Phillips officials thought at the time, they would phase out production many years before 2011, when its oilfield development license from the Norwegian Government would expire.
But now, thanks to technologies that promise to keep the North Sea oil flowing from Ekofisk into the 21st century, Phillips is thinking about investing an additional $3 billion to $4 billion in the field -- if the terms are right. 
 "This old field is doing better than we ever dreamed," Phillips's chairman, W. W. Allen, crowed in a recent interview.
And so, in late December, the company made a proposal to the Norwegian Government to extend its license to the year 2031, pledging to meet stricter safety and environmental rules as it drills new wells and updates Ekofisk's production and transport facilities. To justify the investment, Phillips has proposed exempting any new wells from royalties to the Norwegian Government, which currently run about 10 percent of the price of every barrel of oil the company extracts.
The Norwegian Parliament is expected to take up Phillips's proposal in the spring. It's a significant issue in Norway because Ekofisk, accounting for 12 percent of all oil produced from Norwegian fields, provides 8,500 jobs onshore and offshore. The Ekofisk complex also serves as a transportation hub for 250,000 barrels of oil and 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day from fields operated by other oil companies such as British Petroleum, Amoco and Statoil, the Norwegian national oil company.
The surprising staying power of the North Sea fields in general has been the result of diverse technologies -- drilling horizontal offshoots of wells from existing platforms, for example -- in recent years. In October, the North Sea produced a record 4.94 million barrels a day and the rate is expected to reach about 5.3 million barrels daily by the end of this year.
Because a surplus of even 100,000 barrels a day on the world market can have a big impact on the price of oil, some analysts say that such an increase from the North Sea could further erode the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to control crude oil prices, which have been below $16 a barrel lately.
The greater North Sea flow, much of which is finding its way to the United States, has put OPEC on the defensive and prompted some of its members to petition the British and Norwegian Governments to pressure major producers to cut back, as they did about five years ago, to prop up crude oil prices.
So far this time, OPEC's efforts have been rebuffed. Indeed, instead of exercising restraint, Phillips and the other big North Sea producers have sought to extend the life of existing fields and bring on what production they can. (The expensive search for new fields is on hold.) And the story of Phillips's Ekofisk complex, one of the North Sea's biggest and oldest gas and oil fields, may provide the best illustration of this trend.
WHEN Phillips discovered petroleum in 1969 in Norway's part of the North Sea, it was in shallow water (about 200 feet), below which lay oil-saturated chalk. Drilling wells as deep as 15,000 feet, Phillips's engineers soon realized they had something big -- reserves estimated at more than 1 billion barrels. But they expected to be able to extract only 20 percent or so of that before the natural pressure of the formation subsided and oil would no longer flow to the surface.
Phillips named the field Ekofisk, coining a Norwegian-based word to mean "echo fish," in reference to the undersea seismic readings by which engineers found the deposit.
By 1971, oil from Ekofisk was being shipped by tankers. But severe weather in the region -- prodigious North Sea waves commonly exceed 40 feet -- meant tankers often had trouble getting through. So Phillips that same year used six tugboats to tow a 215,000-ton storage tank to the field. The tank could hold 1 million barrels of oil, and the platform supporting it also became the site of Ekofisk's central processing operation.
In 1972, Phillips began laying a 34-inch-diameter, 220-mile pipeline to Teesside, England, which has subsequently become a major transportation hub for North Sea oil. Phillips opened the Teesside processing terminal in 1975, and two years later opened a natural-gas processing terminal in Emden, Germany, connected to Ekofisk by a 275-mile pipeline.
In those days, the field's life was estimated to be 20 to 30 years. "By the end of the 1990's, we expected production to slow down and we would start abandonment," recalled Rolf Wiborg, deputy managing director of the Phillips Petroleum Company Norway.
Through the early 1980's that forecast seemed to be holding up. Production, which hit a peak of 624,000 barrels a day in January 1980, sank below 150,000 barrels a day by 1986. "We started going downhill," Mr. Wiborg said.
By this time, the company had the most highly developed field in the North Sea -- a constellation of 26 drilling platforms linked by pipeline to the central storage tank and on-shore terminals.
Even though production was dwindling, however, Phillips engineers reached the happy realization that as oil was extracted, the porous chalk tended naturally to suck up water, displacing further oil for recovery. To assist this natural process, Phillips in 1987 began injecting hundreds of thousands of barrels of water a day deep into the field, to maintain a constant pressure that would keep the oil flowing to the wellheads.
The value of water injection had long been known in the oil industry, but this was the first time it had been tried in an offshore chalk formation. Subsequent fine-tuning of the process, like adding hydrochloric acid to the water to help dissolve the flow-hindering calcium carbonate of the chalk, has further increased the expected recovery rate, to as high as 40 percent -- double the rate originally expected.
But the extraction of oil and gas had also created a problem, which was discovered in 1984: The sea bed was sinking. At the central Ekofisk complex of nine platforms and the huge storage tank, the subsidence had dropped the structures more than seven feet closer to sea level.
To keep the whole complex from being swamped, Phillips spent the summer of 1987 -- and more than $400 million -- using 100 hydraulic jacks to raise six of the platforms by some 20 feet. Because the huge storage tank could not be raised, Phillips spent more than $300 million to erect around the tank a concrete wall, rising like a 35-story building from the seabed, to keep the waves off.
Today, production from the Ekofisk field has rebounded, averaging about 270,000 barrels a day. Phillips to date has spent about $2 billion on water injection, and there are now plans to increase injection capacity from 500,000 barrels a day to 820,000 -- which could extend the life of the field into the 21st century.
"Ekofisk is the model of finding the secret of being able to sustain production," Mr. Wiborg said. It will remain the model, however, only if Phillips can persuade the Norwegian Government to accept its proposal -- more precisely, one of two proposals -- aimed at solving the problems of rising operating costs while meeting stricter environmental and safety standards.
One of the major problems is the walled-in storage tank and processing center. The wall has created safety risks by reducing natural ventilation, meaning a gas leak would be more likely to result in a massive explosion.
Phillips has proposed two solutions.
The most comprehensive and expensive, costing up to $4 billion, would be building three new operation and processing platforms that would have no wells drilled immediately below them, making them less vulnerable to sinking. Because the pipelines have long since eliminated the need for the giant storage tank -- although not the installation containing the tank -- once the processing operation was moved to the new platforms, the walled-in site could be abandoned.
TO make this solution feasible, Phillips wants the Norwegian Government to extend its license to produce oil through the year 2031 and forgo royalty payments on new wells. (Although the Norwegian Government would continue to assess corporate income taxes, which can exceed 70 percent.) Another condition set by Phillips is that the expensive removal of abandoned platforms be put off until after the current license term expires in 2011.
By that time, Phillips and other operators in the North Sea would all be needing to scrap many of their original platforms, and Phillips expects that their joint effort -- and new salvage technologies -- will make the job easier and more economical.
If the Government does not approve this first proposal, Phillips has suggested a less expensive -- perhaps $2 billion -- alternative intended to extend the useful life of the current Ekofisk installation. A new processing platform would be built, linked to the existing storage tank platform, which would be used primarily as a hub for the transport of oil and gas through existing pipelines.
Abandonment of "this old field," it seems, keeps moving farther away.

HEADLINE: Quality: High. Price: Low. Big Ad Budget? Never.

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
"MOM," says the boy in a cartoon in the supermarket journal, enjoying a President's Choice cereal, "is it possible that a cereal without its own TV commercial could taste so good?!!"
President's Choice may or may not be better than Kellogg's, but there's no question that this upscale private label, now appearing on cereal boxes and hundreds of other products in North America, has been a resounding success for its owner, the Loblaw Companies, Canada's biggest supermarket chain. 
 In the process it has fired the rebellion of consumers and retailers against highly advertised, and therefore pricey, national brands. And the products have already found their way into more than 1,200 stores in the United States, in chains like D'Agostino's in New York, Jewel in Chicago and Lucky Stores on the West Coast.
President's Choice's American sales volume rose 127 percent last year, while overall North American volume increased 37 percent, making Loblaw what J.P. Morgan Securities calls "the most developed North American private brand retailer."
Loblaw got a big lift in the United States two years ago when it made a deal to help Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, generate what are now some 600 private brand items.
Loblaw's secret: It took house brands that had been around for a long time but were inferior to the national brands and raised quality to levels equal to or above the national brands.
David A. Nichol, the man behind this transformation at Loblaw, explained that the products could still be sold for less than the national brands because they had no "brand tax." In other words, their profit calculations did not need to include the tens of millions of dollars that the big guns spend every year on advertising, promotion and product introductions.
"There are not many Canadian ideas that you can export," said John Winter, a Toronto food consultant, "but that definitely was one with some legs."
The impact of President's Choice on American retailing promises to be dramatic. It's had an "extraordinary ripple effect," said Brian Sharoff, president of the 1,700-member New York-based Private Label Manufacturers Association. The label already has imitators here, but it will probably take a long time for them to catch up.
As the battle intensifies for space on the supermarket shelf, "President's Choice raises the standards by which every retailer who has a private label program will have to judge the competitiveness of that program in terms of quality and price," Mr. Sharoff stressed.
PIGGYBACKING on President's Choice, Loblaw has come a long way. In the 1960's the Toronto-based chain -- which is 77 percent owned by George Weston Ltd., a giant Toronto-based food processing and distribution company -- was racking up yearly losses of tens of millions of dollars.
"Loblaw quietly went to sleep," according to the assessment in one of its own publications, "as growth in a number of stores stopped."
In stepped Mr. Nichol, son of a railway station agent from Chatham, Ontario, who by zeroing in on quality in the generics did something that no one in North America had really tried before.
The payoff is clear. Loblaw's North American sales were an estimated $9 billion (Canadian dollars, currently worth about 75 United States cents each) last year. Of that, $1.2 billion came from cereal, spaghetti sauce, cookies, frozen pizza, cola and other products with President's Choice on the label, up from $500 million three years earlier.
"Bottom-line benefit is the key," says Gabe Lowy, consumer products analyst for Oppenheimer & Company in New York. "The stores can afford to price President's Choice below the national brands and still make more money."
Besides D'Agostino, Jewel and Lucky, Lower 48 outlets include National Supermarkets in St. Louis and New Orleans, Acme Markets in the mid-Atlantic states, Star Market in Boston, Tom Thumb in Dallas and Smitty's Supervalue in Phoenix.
While President's Choice products now sell in 34 states, Loblaw's biggest prize is the deal with Wal-Mart, which had $73 billion in sales in 1993. Mr. Nichol reports that Wal-Mart's volume last year on Sam's American Choice and Great Value lines, also developed by Loblaw, was up 300 percent.
Wal-Mart has just announced its own invasion of Canada, acquiring 120 of the 142 Canadian Woolco stores from the Woolworth Corporation. It plans to reopen them as Wal-Mart stores this summer.
Under its agreement with Loblaw, Wal-Mart cannot sell in Canada the private-label line that Loblaw helped it develop for the United States. But, Mr. Nichol says, "It may be that Loblaw and Wal-Mart would want to work together in Canada" on a line similar to President's Choice.
He also suggests that the two might work together on putting Loblaw supermarkets next to Wal-Mart's Canadian stores. "That's really a 1-plus-1-equals-3 situation," he observed.
The fate of President's Choice, though, will no longer be in Mr. Nichol's hands. He has been president of Loblaw's International Merchants unit, which develops the private label products. But Loblaw announced recently that he is leaving to pursue other business interests. He remains on the board, however, of both Loblaw and Weston.
Loblaw said in a statement that he will become a consultant "specializing in the development of retailer-controlled brands around the world."
The 53-year-old executive said that after 20 years at Loblaw, "It would be interesting now to have the experience of being an entrepreneur." Among his future pursuits: a wine distribution company. He and his wife, Terri, own a vineyard in California's Napa Valley called Dave Nichol's Memories of Napa.
Any doubts about what private labels have done for Loblaw are dispelled by a look at share prices. Despite Canada's extended recession and the crimp on consumption from 11 percent unemployment, Loblaw's stock has more than doubled since 1989 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, reflecting steady growth in sales and earnings.
For the nine months ended Oct. 9, its latest reporting period, Loblaw earned (in Canadian currency) $67.3 million, or 76 cents a share, on revenues of $7.17 billion, compared with $51 million, or 55 cents a share, on revenues of $6.87 billion in the 1992 period.
Mr. Nichol's work at Loblaw has spawned inevitable imitators. The upscale house labels of other big supermarket chains include Safeway Select and A.& P.'s Master's Choice. Kroger uses the Kroger name.
Although it will take a long time for any of them to catch up to where President's Choice is today, big store wars loom. Mr. Nichol confidently predicts that within 10 years private labels will account for 40 percent of the food market in North America, up from 18 percent today.
"Retailer-created and -controlled brands are the most efficient way of delivering a product to the North American consumer," he says with missionary fire.
Although many brand name manufacturers, like Heinz and Campbell, use some of their capacity for private labels, all face tougher battles for shelf space.
"Those that are No. 3 and 4 on the shelf have a lot to worry about," says Stephen A. Greyser, professor of consumer marketing at the Harvard Business School. The "core implication" of the trend, he adds, is that "national manufacturers must work harder to add value to their brands."
Some brand leaders are already reacting. Procter & Gamble has a telephone network advising customers how to use its brands more effectively and has switched from sales promotions and coupons to "everyday low prices" to avoid big price swings and make production costs more consistent.
"Once a national brand provides more value," said Robert Kincaide, managing director of the Hazelton Group, a marketing firm with offices in Toronto and Greenwich, Conn., "the private-label merchants will have a tougher time, too."
AS for the man who fired the revolution, at one time he wanted to be a law professor. But after Mr. Nichol earned a law degree from Harvard, he was immediately recruited by McKinsey & Company, where he spent three years helping companies like Heinz turn around some divisions.
Earlier, as an undergraduate at the University of Western Ontario, he had met W. Galen Weston, the grandson of George Weston, who in 1882 established the Toronto bakery that became the base of the Weston empire. After Mr. Nichol's tour with McKinsey, Mr. Weston invited him to join Loblaw and help turn it around.
Mr. Nichol actually developed two private-label lines, the upscale President's Choice and No Name, whose quality is said to be on a par with national brands but is priced 20 to 30 percent lower.
Loblaw came out with No Name in 1978 and now sells 2,000 products under that label, mainly through its No Frills chain in Canada. No Name products are not distributed in the United States, but it and President's Choice's 1,000 products together racked up sales of $2 billion (Canadian) last year, or nearly a quarter of Loblaw's total sales.
President's Choice was born in 1984 and landed running with Decadent chocolate chip cookies.
Nabisco's dominant Chips Ahoy had 24 percent chocolate chips and used vegetable oil. Mr. Nichol, who says he is "food-obsessed," took the Decadent to 40 percent chips, used 100 percent butter -- and sold the cookies for less than Chips Ahoy.
Although the Decadent was being sold in the mid-1980's in only 17 percent of the stores in Canada, compared with 98 percent for Chips Ahoy, it fast became Canada's best-selling cookie.
"When that penny dropped," says Mr. Nichol, "we realized what kind of potential we had." Now, the Decadent is also in the United States.
 
 
 
JUST THE FACTS ON FOOD? NOT LIKELY
 A MIX of Mad Magazine and Consumer Reports, zaniness and food tips, wrapped up in a comic book format -- that's the offbeat way that Loblaw's pitchman, Dave Nichol, romances his President's Choice customers.
"Grapes as big as golf balls," $1.49 a pound, notes one shopping suggestion in the latest issue, next to a golfer whose swing at the tee has just gone "SPLAT!" To promote deep-dish meat pies, an elephant is on a stew pot. Recipe: "Cut elephant into bite-size pieces. This should take approximately two months."
Insider's Report, as it is called, has been coming out quarterly for 10 years, stuffed into newspapers as special advertising supplements and into the racks at thousands of checkout counters.
A few years ago the print run was 7 million. Now, with expansion into the United States, it's up to 10 million, making this probably the most widely distributed food publication in the world. Georgie Girl, one of Mr. Nichol's French bulldogs, appeared on the cover with him on every issue until last summer, when she died at age 12. Now he's shown with her bronze statue.
Combined with his appearances on Loblaw's television commercials, Insider's Report has made Mr. Nichol a widely recognized Canadian personality. A Toronto Sun cartoon captures some of the flavor. A woman is watching the evening news, saying to herself: "Why can't they just let Quebec be distinct, dump the Senate, lower the G.S.T. [Goods and Services Tax], end the recession, and let Dave Nichol run the country."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Big Rewards Abroad, and Big Risks

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
BILLIONS of mutual fund dollars are flying across the Atlantic and Pacific in search of better returns, and investors have profited handsomely. International stock funds gained 38.3 percent, on average, in 1993, compared with 12.6 percent for domestic stock funds.
This red-hot performance, though, may be blinding investors to some awfully big risks. Because when foreign markets fall, the drops are often as sharp as the gains. 
 Much of this can be traced to the volatility of foreign economies, but the sheer volume of outside money cannot be ignored. With mutual fund companies urging investors to move overseas, total assets of international funds rocketed from $22.4 billion to $110 billion during 1993, said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, an Arcata, Calif., company that tracks mutual fund money.
This volume has pushed the markets to artificially high levels, said Richard Schmidt, a money manager and editor of The Risk Report, in Naples, Fla., who is warning clients and subscribers to get out of foreign stocks and mutual funds.
When investments "start becoming the rage," he said, "it's a signal to sell."
Investors got a taste of the risks abroad when the overheated Hong Kong stock exchange lost 10 percent of its value last month. Shareholders yanked nearly $2 billion out of Asia-Pacific Rim funds, the first time in more than a year that the funds showed a net outflow, according to AMG Data.
There's also a lesson in Japan, whose stock market roared through the 1980's so forcefully that the Merrill Lynch Pacific Fund took second place among all funds for the 10 years ending in both 1989 and 1990.
But when the Tokyo market crashed later in 1990, Capstone Nikko Japan, the purest play on the region, lost 37 percent. Even a conservative fund like Scudder Japan lost more than 16 percent in 1990, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago.
With that in mind, and so many regions showing such terrific gains, investors should probably brace for losses.
One risk factor is a lack of liquidity, Mr. Schmidt says. While more than half of Americans participate in the domestic equity markets, the numbers are far smaller overseas. The lack of liquidity that helped propel the markets upward will push them down, too.
Mr. Schmidt also worries about the lack of information about many overseas issues, which will exacerbate selling pressure.
To be sure, not all investment advisers are so gloomy. The huge number of dollars flowing abroad cannot be considered speculative, said Mark W. Headley, director of international investments for Litman/Gregory, investment advisers in San Francisco.
"When you look at all the money flooding out the door last year, it was just the beginning to pull U.S. equity investing up to an appropriate level," Mr. Headley said.
Looking ahead, "international markets don't have as compelling price differentials as they had because of last year's strong performance, but there are still so many good investing stories," he said.
Among other positive factors, he cites falling interest rates in Europe and Japan; the ongoing restructuring in Europe, Japan and Latin America as controlled economies are replaced with free market ones; and tremendous growth in Asia. Fund investors should participate in all these markets, Mr. Headley said, allocating 10 to 50 percent of equity portfolios overseas, depending on how comfortable they are with the risk and how long they plan to hold shares..
He advises commitments of at least three and preferably five years, "because you get shocks that don't hit the U.S. markets, like the oil scare around Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 that caused 30 percent drops in the Asian markets."
He does concede the danger that individual investors may pull money out at the first signs of trouble, causing volatility, especially in smaller markets. But that should be balanced by the huge amounts of pension money flowing abroad; that trend, which began a few years ago, is gaining momentum, he said.
Mr. Headley says Japan is a "tough call," and advises only minor exposure there. He likes Warburg Pincus International, a diversified fund with only 25 percent of its portfolio invested in Japan.
In other areas abroad, Mr. Headley likes Europe, which is just starting to come out of recession. Because small-capitalization stocks are cheaper than large ones there, he recommends Tweedy Browne Global Value, which is 90 percent invested in small European stocks.
While he admits that the emerging markets are expensive today, "they are still the best long-term growth story available." Right now he prefers Latin America over Asia, because Asian markets may tumble in the next 6 to 12 months, he said.
To reduce risk, stay with diversifed emerging markets funds, Mr. Headley said. He likes Templeton Developing Markets Trust, which has the longest track record in the region, though it carries a 5.75 percent sales charge. Among no-loads, he prefers the Montgomery and Fidelity Emerging Markets Funds.
Norman Fosback, editor of the Mutual Fund Forecaster in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., also says diversification is the best bet for most American investors. He recommends 20th Century International Equity and Fidelity International Growth-and-Income.

HEADLINE: The World;
Cutting Itself Down to Size: Japan's Inferiority Complex

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
HOW'S this for a switch: A Japanese magazine takes Chrysler's newest compact car, the Neon, for a test spin in Texas and decides that Japan's auto industry has catching up to do: The Neon's doors fit better than those of a low-end Toyota or Honda. The finish is nicer, the engine runs smoother. (And wasn't Chrysler the company that a few years ago needed Mitsubishi Motors to make small cars?)
And there was a front-page report in the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest dailies, last week: The latest trend among Japanese yuppies is to obtain a green card and move to America, the land of personal freedom and creativity. "Japan," one applicant told the paper, "is making me feel as if I am suffocating." 
 Welcome to the new age of Japan-bashing -- this time by the Japanese. The perception pendulum about who is up and who is in decline has once again swung wildly. In Japan's eyes, the United States may still be populated by gun-toting maniacs, but its industrial leaders have suddenly transformed themselves from schoolroom dullards to the canniest of competitors. And in America's view, the Japanese recession seems smugly reassuring. Did we really spend the '80's worried about these paper samurais?
For anyone trying to figure out why the Japanese and the Americans communicate so poorly -- an issue Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa says he wants to chip away at when he visits the White House this week -- one answer is that the two countries are forever veering to extremes when it comes to assessing each others' talents. One side is always ten feet tall, the other ten inches. And economic turns of fortune are regularly mistaken for fundamental changes in competitiveness.
Still, the shift in perceptions over the past 18 months is striking. In the old Japanese mythology, the Americans couldn't rivet two sheets of steel together without first bringing in a consulting group to lecture them about Japanese quality-control techniques. Now study teams are heading to Detroit to study the revival of America's auto industry.
"It's true that the manufacturing sector in America was weakening in the '80's," said Ryuzaburo Kaku, the chairman of Canon Inc. "But industrialists here exaggerated it. Think about 'The Japan That Can Say No,' " he said, recalling the book that suggested America's defenses would collapse if Japan ever stopped contributing its electronic genius to the defense industry. "And think of us -- apart from autos and electronics, our own manufacturing sector had very little depth. And that's our problem now."
Exaggeration, of course, cuts both ways. The late 1980's were days when, in American lore, the Japanese were unstoppable, gobbling up Hollywood movie studios, Honolulu beachfronts, and a third of the American auto market. Few paused at the time to consider what seems obvious now: The Japanese were making bad investments at home and abroad, and last year there were 14,041 corporate bankruptcies to prove it.
But this is hardly the first time that wild underestimation has begotten wild overestimation.
In the years leading up to World War II, Americans dismissed Japan's military power out of hand, portraying the Japanese, in the crudest racial stereotypes, as little monkeys clearly incapable of doing the West any harm. Pearl Harbor changed all that. By 1942 The New York Times Magazine was running a story headlined "Japanese Superman: That Too is a Fallacy," to dispel the new impression that the Japanese were invincible. The little monkeys had turned into Godzilla. Then, during the postwar occupation, they became America's little brothers, and roamed with incredible freedom through American factories so they could learn and grow. Then came the 1980's, when little brother, in American eyes, indeed grew up -- into a financial Superman with a heart of stone.
"But look at the graphics you see in the papers now," said John W. Dower, a historian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who writes about Japan. "There are no more of these giant sumo wrestlers and giant samurai taking over Wall Street. Japan has receded in the American consciousness as a threat and as a model."
Japan's imagery has changed as well, chiefly in its portrayal of itself. Rather than celebrate the launch on Friday of the country's first home-grown space rocket, many critics carped that it was a symbol of Japan's lack of competitiveness, because it was twice as expensive per launch as Europe's Ariane rockets.
 
No More Lectures
 And gone are the tiresome lectures about what makes the Japanese system superior. Now, some of the monuments to its uniqueness are crumbling.
Take, for example, the notion of guaranteed lifetime employment -- once considered the magic formula for inspiring corporate loyalty from workers. Japanese companies, this line went, are more akin to families. But now, with factories closing and companies running out of subsidiaries willing to take workers for "reassignment," the wisdom of lifetime employment is under open attack, and many executives say it must be jettisoned.
Long-term planning has suffered a similar fate. Remember the argument that while America thinks about the next quarter, Japan thinks about the next century? Think again. The gargantuan budgets for new equipment and research have been slashed, and critics now complain that Japan is selling its future by letting its university laboratories go to pot. The new image? People listen more closely to Junichi Nishizawa, an inventor and president of Tohoku University, when he says, "Japanese companies have no respect for pioneers."
But Americans would be deceiving themselves to think that Japan really fits its exaggeratedly grim new image of itself. In a year or so, one senior Japanese bureaucrat mused over lunch the other day, the current spate of national self-loathing will very likely give way to a new discovery: Japan is back, slimmed down from the recession and more fit than ever. "I'd like to think we all learned some lessons about excess from the bubble economy," the bureaucrat said. "But don't count on it."

HEADLINE: The World;
America Opens the Door To a Vietnam It Never Knew

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Steven Erlanger, a correspondent of The New York Times in Moscow, was the Southeast Asia correspondent from 1988 to 1991.

 BODY:
AN old friend, a Vietnamese diplomat in his 40's, thinks of his life as a definition of cultural dissonance. A northerner, he remembers French colonial education before 1954, followed by Chinese Maoism and then Soviet Communism, all of which left their colonial residues on his Vietnamese soul. Now, once again, he admits, shrugging, it's the turn of the smiling, big-handed Americans, whom he fought rather bravely during the Vietnam War. "For us," he once said, "Chinese is the language of the ancient enemy and brother, from whom we sprang. French is the language of love. Russian is the language of arguments. English is the language of money, the language of our future."
The American war in Vietnam -- which for Vietnamese was only the last, bloodiest and most puzzling chapter of a much longer war for national unification and independence -- had very little to do with the Vietnamese themselves. The last time the Americans came in earnest it was in the name of ideology, of anti-Communism, domino theories and the rest, which happened to coincide with the moment a young pair of Kennedy brothers felt the need to prove their toughness to the world. 
 For Americans, Vietnam encapsulated the death of one kind of national dream, wrapped up in visions of altruism and purity. It still remains a metaphor for unfinished healing. The American reaction to the loss of the war, our refusal to accept normal relations with Vietnam for the last 20 years, puzzles Vietnamese more than any other fact about the West.
"Can you ever forgive us for winning the war?" an old Vietnamese friend once asked, musing on the idea that the Vietnamese would have profited most from losing, given America's well-known generosity to the defeated. Then he said, almost solemnly: "Americans will never come to terms with the Vietnam War until they come to terms with Vietnam and the Vietnamese."
In increasing numbers, Americans who have visited Vietnam, to rediscover old battlefields or just to tour, have found that necessary solace. On my last visit, two years ago, I found that Vietnamese in general liked and admired Americans. What American businessmen will also find is that in most important respects, it is really the south that finally won the war. Vietnam's aging leadership is bewildered by the decay of a socialist ideology to which they've devoted their lives. The discipline of wartime was long ago cracked by corruption and bureaucracy, and by the siren song of the West.
 
'Living Quickly'
 For the young, increasingly in the north as well as in the untamable, pleasure-seeking south, the only ideology is "song voi," or "living quickly."
Another Vietnamese friend, now in his late 60's, worked during the war as an agent for the North Vietnamese. Now he tends his birds and books in a large, walled house in Ho Chi Minh City, where he is still mistrusted by the authorities, even as they ask him for political advice. All around the house are cafes, which pump out Western music into the night. Putting his hands over his ears, he once told me that his friends joke: "It's the revenge of the C.I.A."
During only the last American chapter, more than one million Vietnamese died, compared with 58,000 Americans. Everywhere you go in Vietnam, north or south, there are poor families with framed documents on the walls commemorating the loss of their sons, tens of thousands of them missing in action.
Yet it is the Americans, with some 2,238 official M.I.A.'s in all of Indochina -- one-quarter the number still outstanding from the Korean War and one-fortieth of those outstanding from World War II, where the Americans have always had access to the battlefields -- who continue this grisly accounting of bones.
While it may be, as often charged, that the Vietnamese are withholding remains, it is the Americans who officially insist, against the available evidence and simple logic, that some M.I.A.'s may still be alive and held against their will 20 years later.
For the French, who got over their defeat in Vietnam with a great deal more aplomb, Vietnam has taken on an astounding degree of chic, especially now that Thailand is so developed. From the soft-focus soap opera of the film "Indochine" to the soft-porn of "The Lover," Vietnam finds itself an improbable object of fashion.
These days, after so much poverty and isolation, the Vietnamese are in a hurry. From the bar girls to the pickpockets, the young businessmen to the nearly decollectivized farmers, everyone is out to make as much money as they can. Vietnamese leaders, as in China, are afraid of the political impact of economic development. But they know they have no choice. Always afraid of new colonialisms, they are eager for American investment and influence to balance the Japanese.
Having been divorced from the world for so long, the Vietnamese are rushing now to meet it more than half-way; the end of the American embargo, and the restoration of normal relations that is bound to come soon, will be seen as a final acceptance of Vietnamese territorial integrity. It will also mark the end of a painful isolation, made longer not only by American folly, but by their own.

HEADLINE: CLINTON PROPOSING $30 BILLION SHIFT IN FEDERAL BUDGET

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Hamstrung by overall spending limits set by law, President Clinton will send to Congress on Monday a 1995 budget that will propose cutting more than $30 billion from Government programs to pay for increases for crime prevention, homelessness and other priorities, according to Government documents and Administration officials.
Mr. Clinton will propose ending some programs and squeezing others, like heating aid for the poor and public housing for the elderly. At the same time, more money will be sought for programs like job training, education for poor children under Head Start and highway construction. 
In recent days, the Administration has released portions of the budget that emphasize the cuts Mr. Clinton is willing to make rather than the new spending he will endorse. The message is directed to Republicans as well as conservative Democrats in Congress who have sought to pass a balanced budget amendment and paint Mr. Clinton as an inveterate tax-raiser.
Mr. Clinton stressed the theme of retrenchment today during his weekly radio address, asserting that his plan would "maintain budget discipline" in cutting spending on more than 300 programs and reducing the Federal work force by more than 100,000.
"We had to cut spending on yesterday's outmoded programs so we can bring down the deficit and still invest more in tomorrow's most urgent priorities," Mr. Clinton said.
Many of Mr. Clinton's cuts, however, are the same ones that President George Bush went after every year, and there is little reason to think lawmakers will be more inclined to pass them now. [Page 34.]
Even so, the Administration's tactic is to send a signal to the financial markets as well as to critics of the President's expensive health care proposal that the White House is willing to make hard decisions that demonstrate fiscal responsibility.
The proposed cuts in the budget are likely to draw protests from some of the Administration's most loyal constituencies, including advocates for the poor and the elderly. But the budget would also cut deeply into the ranks at the Pentagon and slow the growth of spending in the space program.
While most departments would be forced to spend less money over all than they did during the current budget year, several, including Justice, Labor, Commerce, Health and Human Services and Education, would realize a net gain if Congress adopts Mr. Clinton's proposals.
At the Pentagon, the Administration wants to stretch out its procurement for several weapons systems, including the Air Force's B-2 bomber, reflecting a continuing desire to reduce the size of the military and long-term commitments to expensive hardware.
"They're squeezing the nickel where it won't have a major effect on force levels," said Eugene Carroll, a retired admiral who is the director of the Center for Defense Information, a private group. The new budget would also reduce civilian and military personnel at the Pentagon to save more than $4 billion.
 
100 Programs Are to End
 Elsewhere, the Administration is recommending that more than $700 million be cut from a heating aid program for the poor and $1 billion from a program to build public housing for the elderly. More than 100 small programs would be eliminated entirely, at a savings of about $3.2 billion.
Administration officials and Cabinet officers have chafed at the strict spending limits imposed by Congress in the deficit-reduction agreement with President Bush in 1990 and reinforced by the budget law President Clinton signed last summer. Instead of assembling a budget that would have increased by $16 billion just to keep pace with inflation, Mr. Clinton has been forced to come up with a spending plan that cuts $8 billion in 1995 in real dollars, without taking inflation into account.
More than half of Federal spending is devoted to mandatory programs like Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, the health programs for the poor and elderly, and pensions for retired Government employees. The President has control over only the discretionary portion of the budget, and it is from this section that most of the proposed cuts would come.
Spending in almost every other area of Government, excluding the payment of interest on the national debt, is limited by law to $542 billion for 1995. Over the next five years, Government spending would have to be reduced by $221 billion overall to stay within the limits imposed by law.
 
Money for Manhattan
 But specific areas of the budget that reflect Mr. Clinton's priorities would see net spending increases. And although the budget calls for reductions in the politically difficult area of mass transit subsidies, the interests of Congress have not been entirely ignored.
The Clinton budget, for example, calls for $100 million in new financing for the renovation of the General Post Office at 33d Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan as a new Amtrak railroad hub: a project favored by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York.
That project would include a retail shopping complex like Washington's Union Station. After lobbying by Mr. Moynihan, who as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee will influence the fate of the President's health plan, Mr. Clinton said in October that he would support such an idea. About $10 million would by appropriated for the current budget year, officials said.
The total cost for the project is pegged at about $315 million. The state and city are expected to provide the rest of the money by using Federal transportation and community development grants.
 
Broader Approaches
 Other increases address broader needs. At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which will suffer a net loss in overall financing, spending for programs for the homeless would increase by $427 million, and the housing voucher program would increase by 25 percent.
At the Department of Labor, the Job Training Partnership Act would be reduced by $26 million, but much of the savings would be diverted to other training programs. Mr. Clinton said today that he hoped to replace a patchwork of job training programs with a more efficient system.
Those programs, he said, "have been trapped in a time warp, frozen in by-gone days when most laid-off workers could expect to be called back to their old jobs."
Administration officials said education programs like Head Start, the School-to-Work Initiative and the Chapter 1 program for schools with disadvantaged students would receive increases, as would technology programs administered by the Commerce department.
The following are among the cuts Mr. Clinton will propose:
*Agriculture: $242 million would be cut from watershed and flood-prevention operations, money that would be consolidated instead under programs operated by the Army Corps of Engineers.
*Army Corps of Engineers: No new projects would be started in 1995, delaying about $345 million in previously approved undertakings generally favored by members of Congress who lobby for discretionary spending for their home districts.
*Defense: The Pentagon would continue its shift away from increasing force levels and modernization programs and toward readiness, research and development. The operations and maintenance budget would actually increase by 2 percent, officials said. But very few new vehicles, missile projects or aircraft would be included. "No matter where you look, we are buying less," an official said.
*Health and Human Services: Although this department would realize an overall net increase of $1 billion, more than $1 billion in programs would be cut, including $247 million in health services and installations on Indian reservations.
*Housing and Urban Development: Administration officials would continue a trend begun under President Bush that replaces new construction with an emphasis on housing vouchers and incentives for private development. About $8 billion in previously authorized housing construction money would remain in the pipeline.
*NASA: Financing for the Space Shuttle would be scaled back to reflect the Administration's plan to emphasize maintenance of the existing fleet over new expansion. This would result in a $281 million cut. Another $203 million would be saved by shifting Federal involvement in aeronautics research to the private sector.
*Transportation: About $432 million would be cut, resulting in a 25 percent reduction in operation subsidies for mass transit programs in cities with populations of more than 50,000. Capital grants for construction of such systems, however, would increase by 40 percent, Administration officials said.
Fiscal reality has placed Mr. Clinton in an unusual and awkward position as he prepares to sell a budget that continues to emphasize deficit reduction and Government streamlining over ambitious new spending. Many past Presidents, Republicans and Democrats, have used budget pronouncements to brag of the contribution they will make to expanded Government programs.
Instead, Mr. Clinton is trying to focus on deprivation and discipline. Administration officials were reluctant to release any information on the amount of the budget they would divert to new

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Woman Urging an End To an Argument Is Shot to Death

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
A Brooklyn woman who was the mother of four children was shot dead as she leaned out her second-floor window late Friday after urging her boyfriend to stop arguing with two men outside, the police said.
The woman, Carmen Fernandez, 31, was killed about 11:40 P.M. while her friend, Joseph Delgado, climbed the stairs to the apartment at 233 Cleveland Street in East New York. 
 Mr. Delgado said he found her lying on her back on the red-carpeted floor, shot once in the stomach.
"She was just screaming out my name," said Mr. Delgado, 29, an unemployed factory worker. "I kept telling her, 'Wake up, wake up!' She was in shock. She didn't believe it."
A detective who spoke on condition of anonymity said the quarrel appeared to be over drugs and that Mr. Delgado had drug convictions.
"She wasn't the intended target," he said. "It was a message for him."
Yesterday, friends and relatives gathered in the large three-bedroom apartment to mourn the woman's death. They described Ms. Fernandez as "a real caring housewife and a devoted mother" who did embroidery and sold cleaning products for extra money.
 
Plans for 'a Better Life'
 Ms. Fernandez had one child, Erica, 11, from a previous marriage, which lasted a few months. She met Mr. Delgado 11 years ago, and the couple had three children -- Joseph Jr., 8, Victor, 7, and Tanya, 3.
Family members said they had planned to get married and move to Tampa, Fla., where they had made several trips recently. "She wanted to give the kids a better life," Elsa Carrasco, Mr. Delgado's mother, said. "It was too much over here."
Although he admitted spending 14 months in jail for drug offenses involving crack, Mr. Delgado denied that the argument was about drugs. He said he did not know the men.
Mr. Delgado said the dispute began after the car he was driving almost hit another car parked at the corner of Cleveland and Fulton Streets, a few yards from his apartment. As he got out of his car, he said, the argument became boisterous and one of the men drew a gun. Mr. Delgado said he ran into his apartment and as he climbed the stairs, he heard the shot. Ms. Fernandez was taken to Brookdale Hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.
"She was a nice girl" said a longtime family friend who would not give his name, "but she fell in love with the wrong person. She could have left him, but she went to jail every couple of weeks to see him."

HEADLINE: The Clinton Difference? Not Much in the Budget

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The budget President Clinton will send to Congress on Monday, the first to be prepared by a Democratic Administration in 13 years, varies only slightly from what a Republican President would have submitted.
Mr. Clinton will indeed ask for a little more money for the kinds of programs Democrats normally favor, like education and construction of public works. But Administration officials who worked on the budget calculate that as a practical matter, they had the flexibility to propose changes in barely 1 percent of Government spending: less than $20 billion in a total budget of about $1.5 trillion. 
 That is because the amount of revenue to be raised and the level of spending for broad categories of Government programs in the fiscal year 1995, which begins Oct. 1, were set in stone by the deficit-reduction agreement President George Bush struck with Congress in 1990 and were reinforced by the budget law that President Clinton signed last summer.
"There can be little more than tinkering at the margins," said Stanley E. Collender, director of Federal budget policy at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm.
 
Same Cuts Bush Sought
 Even then, many of the programs Mr. Clinton will propose cutting or killing, the officials say, are the same ones Mr. Bush went after unsuccessfully. Among these are operating subsidies for mass transit, grants to help poor people pay for fuel to heat their homes and community development grants to cities and counties.
Congress has protected these programs for years, and little reason exists to believe lawmakers will trim them for Mr. Clinton when they would not do so for Mr. Bush. But without such cuts, nothing will be left for the places where Mr. Clinton wants to increase Government spending.
This is the one area where the Clinton budget does differ from what Mr. Bush might have proposed. Administration officials say Mr. Clinton will emphasize modest new spending for what he calls investment: education, job-training, public works, scientific research, clean-water enforcement, child-immunization and national service.
Many of those proposals would not have been on Mr. Bush's list. Rather than spending for social programs, Mr. Bush favored tax breaks for capital gains, private school tuition and retirement saving.
 
Robbing Peter to Pay Paul?
 The new budget will not contain additional money to accommodate the big changes the Administration is contemplating in health-care and welfare. In the case of health, that is because even if Congress enacts the President's program this year, little of it will be in effect in the fiscal year 1995. As for welfare, the President's proposals have not been drawn up.
Spending limits under the law are so tight that more than half the Cabinet departments would have less money to spend in the next fiscal year than they do in this one.
As a consequence, it is clear from conversations with many Administration officials, the new budget has a flavor of robbing Peter to pay Paul.
At the Department of Health and Human Services, increased spending for poor children under Head Start would be offset by reducing money energy assistance for the poor.
 
Less Money for Mass Transit
 At the Transportation Department, money would be freed up for highway construction by spending less for mass transit.
At the Labor Department, some job-training programs would be scrapped or merged to pay for a new training program.
At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, spending for public housing would be lowered to provide money to help the homeless.
Officials said the budget showed that the President wanted to kill outright more than 100 small Government programs that altogether now cost the Government about $3 billion a year.
 
Shrinking the Deficit
 In his State of the Union address last week, Mr. Clinton said the deficit in the next fiscal year -- the amount by which spending would exceed revenues -- would be less than $180 billion. The Congressional Budget Office has put the figure at $171 billion.
That would be about $50 billion below the deficit expected this year and more than $100 billion lower than last year's projection of what the fiscal year 1995 deficit was likely to be.
The improved picture results mainly from two factors: the tax increases and spending ceilings in last year's budget law, and the stronger economy, which means that more tax revenues will be collected, less money will be spent for programs like food stamps and unemployment compensation and less will have to be paid in interest on the national debt.
The spending caps are what limits the Administration's flexibility.
 
3 Categories, Little Flexibility
 In budget terms, Government spending falls into three large categories: mandatory spending, discretionary spending and interest on the debt.
Mandatory spending, also called entitlements, involves programs that pay benefits automatically to everyone who qualifies. More than $800 million, or slightly more than half the Federal budget, falls into this category.
About 80 percent of this money goes for four programs: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and pensions for retired Government employees. Politically, Social Security is thought to be untouchable. Pensions are basically contractual obligations that cannot be changed. And while last year's law puts new limits on Medicare and Medicaid spending, the Clinton Administration wants to reserve the money saved to help pay for universal health insurance.
Everything else for which the Government spends money, from tanks to telephones, from foreign aid to forestry, falls into the category of discretionary spending. For the first time since 1969, total Government spending for all these programs will not rise from one year to the next. The budget law limits such spending to about $540 billion each year, with no allowance for inflation.
 
Effects of Deficit Reduction
 If annual inflation runs about 3 percent, that means the President and Congress must find ways to cut nearly $20 billion each year in discretionary spending merely to keep pace with inflation in areas that few Americans would stand for cutting -- like air traffic control, criminal investigations, medical research and compensatory education for poor children. And despite continually dropping military budgets, little is left for new programs to fight crime, poverty, homelessness and other problems that Democrats believe they were elected to solve.
"The reality is that these deficit reduction acts are actually going to cut discretionary spending in real terms," said Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee. "We're going to see whether the American people and Congress really want to cut these programs or just talk about it."
This is quite frustrating to many Administration officials who came to Washington to solve problems and find they do not have the money to do so.
"The spending discipline forces us to make unpleasant choices," said Barry Toiv, the chief spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. "It forces us to do more with less."

HEADLINE: Manufacturers Oppose Clinton Plan

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAPLES, Fla., Feb. 5

 BODY:
Arguing that the White House had ignored their pleas to amend President Clinton's health care proposals, the directors of the National Association of Manufacturers voted 56 to 20 today not to support the Administration's package "in its present form."
The resolution was the third blow this week to the Clinton plan from a major business organization, and perhaps the most damaging. The association represents 12,500 manufacturers, large and small. Nearly all carry health insurance for their 15 million employees, and in some cases the plans are more expensive than the Clinton proposals. Nevertheless, the manufacturers vote showed that they considered the President's plan too costly. 
 "The range of business people who have indicated their opposition to the Clinton plan, or their support of other plans, has changed the environment in which the health care debate is taking place," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the association and its chief lobbyist. "The Clinton plan is no longer as dominant as it was."
Until now, the manufacturers had neither endorsed nor opposed the Clinton plan or any other. Mr. Jasinowski had argued that this independence gave him more leverage as a lobbyist to win amendments in the health care bills favorable to the the manufacturers. He repeated that argument before the vote today, which took place at the semi-annual meeting of directors.
 
Group Is Divided
 "People in my position do like the maximum amount of bargaining power," Mr. Jasinowski said later. "But it was the wisdom of the board that we needed to send this signal. We weren't being heard."
The resolution, reflecting divisions within the association, was milder than the resolutions adopted earlier this week by the Business Roundtable, representing 200 large corporations, and the United States Chamber of Commerce, representing tens of thousands of companies. Those resolutions endorsed the alternative health care proposal put forth by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee. The manufacturers resisted a similar step, although Mr. Cooper came here on Friday to seek support.
Robert E. Rubin, chairman of the President's National Economic Council, had been scheduled to speak here this morning, but canceled at the last minute. The directors were told that he had a scheduling conflict. The cancellation came after Mr. Rubin was advised that a resolution had been drafted Friday night formally opposing the Clinton plan.
 
Big Companies Back Clinton
 The manufacturers are divided over health care, with the largest companies like the General Motors Corporation, Caterpillar and the General Electric Company, leaning toward the Clinton plan. Manufacturers with fewer than 1,000 employees tend to prefer the Cooper plan, which has emerged as the major competition to the Administration's proposal.
The companies have financial reasons for their preferences. The big companies, for example, provide company-paid health insurance for thousands of retirees under age 65 who are too young for Medicare. The Clinton plan would have the Government absorb 80 percent of the cost of the premiums for these retirees, while the Cooper plan would pay none of that.
The big companies also provide, in most cases, benefits packages that are richer than the packages likely to be required by either the Clinton or Cooper proposals. Under the Clinton proposal, big companies could continue to offer this extra coverage with no penalty, because they would be allowed to continue deducting the cost of premiums from their taxable income. But under the Cooper plan, only premiums for the required basic coverage could be deducted.
"The Cooper proposal to put a cap on deductions would cost us an enormous amount of money, and it would cost an enormous amount for any company with a good health insurance plan," said James D. Johnston, a G.M. vice president.
 
Opposition by Small Companies
 The Clinton plan would require employers to pay more for health care than some small manufacturers now pay. The Cooper plan, in contrast, would order companies to offer the required health care coverage to their workers, but would not require the companies to pay the premiums.
"Even if the Clinton plan held our cost to 7.9 percent of our payroll, as the President proposes, that would still be more than the 6 percent we as a company now pay for health insurance," said Ronald D. Bullock, president of Bison Gear and Engineering of Downers Grove, Ill. Bison has 160 workers.
Against this backdrop, the manufacturers fashioned a resolution that emphasized their desire to "work with all parties involved in the legislative process to draw on the best features of all the various health care reform plans." The resolution was softened with an amendment that said the association was unable to support the Clinton plan "in its present form."
Still, the divisions were clear in the debate. Don V. Fites, chairman of Caterpillar, for example, appealed to the association to neither endorse nor oppose any plan. He said that he had voted against the Business Roundtable's resolution, for this reason, and so had other big manufacturers who are Roundtable members. Executives from Honda, General Electric and the Navistar International Corporation made similar appeals, but other companies, including some large ones, endorsed the resolution, arguing that it would force the Administration to listen to the group's complaints.
 
Negotiations Are Expected
 "I think that the President cannot refuse to negotiate" with the manucfaturers' group as a result of this resolution, said James P. Melican, executive vice president of the International Paper Company.
Mr. Jasinowski has been lobbying the Administration to agree to several amendments to its health plan that are favored by both large and small companies. The manufacturers, for example, would like the Administration to scale back the health benefits package required as minimum insurance to make the basic health plan less costly.
The manufacturers also want the Administration to avoid cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. The Administration has proposed such cuts, to help pay for its health insurance proposal. But the manufacturers say that hospitals and doctors would have to treat the elderly and the poor anyway. The manufacturers say hospitals are then likely to cover the extra cost by inflating the bills for treatment of workers covered by the insurance that companies would provide and largely pay for under the Clinton plan.
Most important, perhaps, the manufacturers object to the Clinton health plan on the ground that it would involve too big a role for Government. The Clinton plan, for example, would put ceilings on premiums to keep down costs and would require companies with fewer than 5,000 employees to join regional health alliances that would be regulated by the states. These alliances would act, in effect, as purchasing agents for health care.
But the manufacturers argue that the Clinton proposals would stifle corporate efforts to prove less expensively health care on their own. The manufacturers want to amend the Clinton bill to require that companies with fewer than 100 workers, not 5,000, join the regional health alliances.

HEADLINE: Protest Aside, Wyoming Coyote Hunt Begins

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo., Feb. 5

 BODY:
About 200 hunters spread over tens of thousands of acres of the stark prairie of northeastern Wyoming this weekend to track down and kill as many coyotes as they can.
Bret Taylor, president of the Gillette Chamber of Commerce, said he had organized the hunt in response to ranchers' complaints that coyotes were costing them thousands of dollars a year in lost livestock. 
 The hunt has provoked criticism from environmentalists and the national Humane Society.
The state's top wildlife official has disavowed the coyote hunt, and Gov. Mike Sullivan has wondered if it will hurt the state's reputation.
Despite his misgivings about the event, Governor Sullivan, a Democrat, said last month that he understood"the frustrations felt by those in the livestock industry" over the loss of livestock and wildlife to coyotes.
The hunt began this morning on ranches around Gillette, a coal strip-mining town of 20,000 people 240 miles north of here. On Sunday, when the hunt ends, two hunters will be awarded $500 prizes, one for the heaviest carcass and one for the most carcasses.
Mr. Taylor said hunters from as far away as Arkansas had paid $25 fees to take part.
Coyotes, disheveled cousins of wolves, have been hunted and poisoned with few restrictions ever since Europeans settled the West. Ranchers consider them vermin because they sometimes prey on livestock, especially sheep. Hunters say coyotes reduce the populations of big game animals.
But some environmentalists argue that coyotes, by preying on rodents, contribute enough to the balance of prairie species that the loss of some sheep is tolerable. Others say coyotes deserve respect as symbols of the freedom, independence and resilience of the West.
Pete Petera, director of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, said that coyotes, as predators, were "outside the department's jurisdiction" but that he did not believe the weekend of killing would help increase the herds of elk, deer and moose.
And Larry L. Kruckenberg, chief of information and education services for the Game and Fish Department, said the hunt was a killing contest that could hurt Wyoming's image and tourism.
Mr. Petera of the state game department said in his statement that he, like the Governor, worried that the hunt might keep tourists away "based on the public's response to Alaska's wolf-control program."
He added that he feared "considerable controversy and adverse publicity for hunters, for Campbell County and for the state."
In Alaska early last year, a public outcry and threats of a boycott by tourists forced state officials to abandon a plan to kill hundreds of wolves as a way of letting the herds of caribou and moose grow, and thus giving sport hunters more game.
This fall Alaska officials instated a modified version of the plan, and a state-authorized wolf kill is under way this winter.
 
Population Explosion
 In the early 1970's, the Federal Government banned the use of poisons to kill coyotes because the baits were indiscriminately killing foxes, bears, badgers, eagles and dogs. Since then, ranchers have grown increasingly alarmed by what they see as an explosion in the coyote population, and a corresponding economic threat.
It was in response to that growth, said Mr. Taylor, the chamber official in Gillette, that he organized the coyote hunt.
"We view it as an economic matter," he said this week. "We started hearing some real horror stories about rancher losses." Some ranchers reported annual losses of $10,000 to $20,000 because ofcoyotes, he added.
Mr. Taylor said that the hunters were assigned two or three to a ranch and that 75 ranchers had agreed to have the hunters on their places, many of which sprawl over thousands of acres of windswept grasslands.
The chamber had expected to spend up to $1,500 to advertise the hunt, Mr. Taylor said, but after widespread news coverage, advertisements were not needed.

HEADLINE: Trade vs. Human Rights

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The raging arguments over relations with Vietnam and China are at the core of a sharpening debate in American foreign policy. In a world where every nation's motto is now "export or die," where should the United States draw the line between its desire to export its values and its increasing requirement to export its goods?
During the cold war, the main debate was between idealists who argued that relations with other countries should depend on their human rights behavior and realists who argued that the United States could not afford militarily to isolate dictatorships in places like the Philippines or Iran, because their support was needed against Moscow. 
 Today, the idealists are still advocating human rights. But increasingly they are finding themselves debating not with hawkish generals, but with General Electric and General Motors, who argue that the United States cannot afford economically to isolate the fastest growing economies, like China and Vietnam.
 
Economics vs. Human Rights
 "There are still security considerations, but increasingly the thrust of the debate in foreign policy today is economics versus human rights," said Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. "When I was working for Henry Kissinger in the 1970's, I tended to meet with think-tankers and academics, purely on political-security issues. Today, I find myself going from a meeting with Amnesty International or Asia Watch in the morning to one with the Chamber of Commerce in the afternoon. That is where the big divide is. I think we can promote the interests of both. But clearly in the short run there are sometimes tough trade-offs."
Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of the human rights organization Asia Watch, says he has also seen the change: "In the old days, when Chinese or Indonesian dissidents came to the States I would only bring them to Congress or the State Department. Now I try to arrange appointments for them to talk to business people. Sometimes the business people agree, sometimes they don't. But many of them now feel they really have a stake in how the human rights debate plays out. This is all very recent."
What has recast this debate? It's all in the numbers. In 1970, United States merchandise exports were 4.2 percent of the gross national product and merchandise imports were 3.9 percent. Today, merchandise exports are 7.2 percent of G.N.P. and imports 9.3 percent. Labor Department statistics indicate that American jobs related to exports pay, an average of 20 percent more than those focused exclusively on the domestic economy.
 
Trade-Related Jobs in U.S.
 Two decades ago, virtually no Americans made a living from trade with China. Today, some 200,000 Americans are employed in the sale of $9 billion worth of products a year there -- including 14 percent of the sales of Boeing aircraft. Millions more depend on low-cost Chinese shirts, dresses and sweaters to clothe their families. Vietnam? The potential investment marketplace in Vietnam will reach $8 billion in the next five years, including everything from airport construction to power generation, a recent report by the U.S.-ASEAN Council said.
Nearby India, Indonesia and Myanmar, formerly Burma, represent even bigger potential markets, but also with widespread human rights abuses.
It is fitting that President Clinton should be the one to have to sort out these tough choices. He came into office preaching two themes on foreign policy: that he would give a higher priority to human rights than the Bush Administration and that he would give a higher priority to trade in foreign relations than his predecessors. Now he is being forced to translate that straddle into policy.
In the case of Vietnam, Mr. Clinton tried to bridge the gap by arguing that the more Americans were allowed to visit and do business in Vietnam, the more chances there would be to encourage the Vietnamese to pursue the cases of missing Americans.
White House officials insisted that economic motives were not involved. But only 10 hours after Mr. Clinton spoke, American Express signed an agreement with a Vietnamese bank to pave the way for use of its credit cards in Vietnam. And the Pepsico started a cola war in Ho Chi Minh City with its rival, Coca-Cola. Veterans' groups cried "sellout," but most of the American public seemed accepting.
 
Difficulty With China
 China is more difficult. On May 28, when the President renewed China's favorable trade status, which allows it to export its products to the United States at the lowest possible tariffs, he laid down five human rights conditions that Beijing would have to meet to win another renewal this June. These included accounting for political prisoners, allowing them to be visited by the International Committee of the Red Cross and ending the use of prison labor for exports to the United States.
So far, American officials say, the Chinese have not done enough, creating the prospect that the Administration might actually have to withdraw China's trade benefits. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, argues that this would be to "drop the trade equivalent of a nuclear bomb."
With that danger in mind, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the President's economic adviser Robert Rubin have put out another carrot to Beijing: meet the President's conditions and the Clinton Administration will effectively retire the weapon of most favored nation status once and for all.
This is where things get interesting. The strongest critics of China in Congress say they hope that Beijing will meet the conditions of the President's executive order and that there will not be a revocation of the trade advantages. But they add that there is no way they are going to retire the trade weapon, which is part of American law: section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974, better known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment.
"Jackson-Vanik ain't going away," said the House majority leader, Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
 
Another Mechanism Sought
 In an effort to change that, Administration officials have asked the heads of major companies doing business in Beijing to come up with some mechanisms that the White House can propose to Congress that would be effective in pressing China toward more human rights compliance without threatening a revocation of trade.
But "most of those arguing for using something other than trade sanctions don't have an alternative," argued Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who has led the China human rights cause in Congress. She said the leverage of most favored nation status should definitely be kept around as a tool, not simply to keep China from backsliding on human rights, but to use as a lever in resolving the many trade disputes with Beijing.
"We spent trillions of dollars fighting the cold war," Ms. Pelosi said, "and now that the cold war is over, I hope we don't say that what that struggle was about was access to cheap labor and potential markets. Let's not forget: it was also about freedom. Is our message to the world going to be, 'If you are small and economically insignificant, we intend to advocate for human rights in your country, but if you have potentially huge markets we should find another strategy to influence your behavior?' "
 
The Power of Congress
 This brewing argument between the Administration and Congress is a reminder of something else. When foreign policy is dominated by security matters, the executive branch almost always takes the lead and Congress, with its ambiguous war powers authority, follows. But when trade is the instrument of foreign policy, Congress -- which has constitutional authority for regulating commerce -- can easily have its say and force the Administration to follow, said Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics.
That is another reason, Administration officials say, why they urgently have to find an effective tool for influencing the human rights behavior of other countries without cutting off trade. Not so easy.
"In a world without the East-West divide," said Jeffrey Garten, Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, "commercial competition is now much more fierce and our ability to enlist other countries to join us in using economic leverage to pursue noneconomic goals -- such as human rights or environmental standards -- is diminishing. At a minimum, we are going to have to intensify our multilateral diplomacy to figure out how to encourage other countries to join us in pressing for human rights. Because if we can't, and we are forced to act unilaterally, we lose in two ways: we lose commercially and we don't achieve the values we hold dear."

HEADLINE: For Brooklyn Family, a Rare Find: Public Housing

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Not far from the cramped Williamsburg apartment she shared with her four children, her brother and his family, Flor Roque watched the home of her dreams take shape. It is in a boxy, red-brick apartment complex in an area pockmarked with factories. But to Mrs. Roque, who lived for four years doubled up with her brother waiting for public housing, the new buildings might as well be on Park Avenue.
"I cried when we found out we had made it in there," said Mrs. Roque, who until last week took turns with her brother sleeping on the sofa in a two-bedroom apartment. "We were so excited about it my kids could not sleep the night we found out. We've been inside and it is beautiful. It doesn't look like the projects." 
 Mrs. Roque, who was among thousands on the Housing Authority's waiting list, has received one of the coveted apartments in the 150-unit complex, which opened to new tenants this week.
The new apartments are precious indeed. The four buildings, on Berry Street at South Ninth and South 10th Streets, are the first new public-housing units built in Williamsburg in 20 years. First planned more than 10 years ago, the development stalled because of Federal cutbacks and then because of a dispute between the neighborhood's Hasidic and Hispanic residents over who should receive preference in occupying the apartments.
 
Decline in New Housing
 While the Berry Street complex has been particularly hampered by delays, its problems reflect a sharp decline in the creation of government-subsidized apartments throughout New York City, which was once a model for the nation's efforts to build public housing. These days, the number of families applying for public housing in a single day exceeds the number of new units the Housing Authority adds in a year.
Last year 26,109 people applied to the authority for apartments, joining more than 122,000 already on the waiting list. In 1993 the Housing Authority added only 250 apartments, through new construction and building renovations.
As it presses for ways to shrink its waiting list, the agency has seen the demand for public housing grow and the turnover rate in existing complexes slow substantially. Housing officials say the sharp growth in families seeking public housing in recent years reflects the accumulated impact of severe cuts in housing development funds at the Federal level, the city's growing homeless population and the continuing economic downturn, which has forced many families from more costly private housing.
About 80 percent of the cost of building new public housing is paid by the Federal Government through the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an agency that suffered drastic cutbacks during the 1980's. To fill the gap between the Federal subsidy and the cost of building in New York, the authority must tap city funds.
 
An Array of Obstacles
 The lack of Federal money, housing officials say, remains the main obstacle to building more apartments faster, but it is not the only one. A shortage of appropriate sites, neighborhood opposition and turf wars that end up in court -- like the one over the units on Berry Street -- also hobble new projects.
Last fall the Berry Street complex became a vivid symbol of how a desperate housing shortage can further divide a community already suffering from religious, racial and ethnic antagonism. In September a group of Hispanic families took over the still-unfinished project after hearing rumors that Hasidic families would be receiving some of the apartments that the Hispanic families had expected to be given. The demonstration ended peacefully after two days, and in November a Federal Court upheld the Housing Authority, which had been challenged over its selection process.
"Berry Street has had its own set of complications that make it unique," said Paul Graziano, acting general manager for the Housing Authority, which oversees more 600,000 residents in 180,000 units. "Even so, what we can provide does not come close to meeting the need. We have two main sources for people waiting for housing: apartments we get when apartments become vacant, and what we build."
In Williamsburg and many other struggling neighborhoods throughout the city, private development of new housing is nearly nonexistent, and subsidized housing, when it is built, comes at a trickle. So families of 6, 8, 10 or even more squeeze themselves into one- and two-bedroom apartments.
When Sara Mermelstein moved as a newlywed into a one-bedroom apartment in Williamsburg, she never imagined she would still be living there with her husband and six children 14 years later. With nowhere to go when their children were born, the couple created a second "bedroom" by putting up a wall and door on the window side of the room.
"There is no place to go," said Mrs. Mermelstein, who has applied for public housing several times in the last several years. "There are no apartments in this building. Other families are as crowded as we are."
 
A Wearying Routine
 The closeness of quarters governs the family's wearying daily routine. Except for Friday night, when the family sits down at the table together, Mrs. Mermelstein feeds her six children in shifts. Supper starts at 4:30 P.M., and she starts putting the first of her children to bed two hours later.
"It is too early to go to bed," said Mrs. Mermelstein, who is expecting another child later this spring. "But I cannot put them in the room at the same time. They will keep each other awake."
Even if the family could afford the space it needs -- a four-bedroom apartment or larger -- apartments of that size are scarce in a community where families are large and vacancies are rare.
Despite the hardship for families like the Mermelsteins, who are Hasidic Jews, the prospect of leaving Williamsburg is unthinkable. Their religious convictions dictate their domestic circumstances. They must be close to synagogues, religious schools, shopping and other services that cater to the Hasidim.
For the Mermelsteins, the prospects for placement in public housing are not good.
After years of denying racial steering, the Housing Authority acknowledged that in some neighborhoods, including Williamsburg, white families had been given preference for public housing to the detriment of nonwhites. Because of this, the courts have ordered the Housing Authority to give preference to nonwhite families, mostly Hispanic, in the new housing on Berry Street.
The Housing Authority has no plans to build more housing in Williamsburg. But elsewhere, a modest restoration of Federal funds for the construction of new housing is beginning to have an impact.
Last November the Housing Authority opened Howard Park, a complex for 156 families in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, Brooklyn. The agency has eight other projects under development and has financing commitments for 2,280 units. The authority has also added units in buildings it has bought from the city and renovated.
 
Budget Cuts Loom
 And in a fledgling program, the authority has begun selling 730 cooperative apartments in buildings bought from the city to working poor people or others on the waiting list. One such co-op opened on Southern Boulevard in the Bronx in 1992.
But looming on the horizon are city budget cuts that may threaten future public-housing developments.
Dominick Catania, the Housing Authority's deputy general manager for development and modernization, said that while money from Washington has started to flow again under the Clinton Administration, the authority must still look to the city to fill the gap between what HUD allocates and the actual costs of building housing in New York City.
"The funding from Washington is not unconditional," he said. "It is allocated for a certain number of units. If the cost of building those units cannot be met by what the Federal Government gives, we cannot just take the money and build fewer units. We have to find a way to make up the difference."

HEADLINE: In a Courtroom in Milan, Italian Society Is on Trial

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Much of Italy's recent history is on trial these days in Milan's Palace of Justice, where it has unfolded like a Fellini epic: part drama, part farce, part tragedy.
It is the first case to come to trial in Italy's two-year-old wave of scandals, and on some days, hundreds of Italians line up at the courtroom door, vying to fill a narrow visitors' area while millions follow the proceedings on national television. 
 "All of Italy is seeing how lavishly they went at it," said Giorgio Rampi, a 23-year-old political science student who came to watch a session. "Our entire system is on trial here. How much was paid, how people got their power."
 
Intrigue, Fast Cars, Suicide
 The trial of a 45-year-old money manager named Sergio Cusani has wandered into its fourth month, the proceedings revealing a maze of scheming, graft and corruption that has enveloped many of the country's best and the brightest over the last decade.
The case chronicles the fall of the golden generation that rode a wave of prosperity to designer suits, fast cars and corporate jets in the 1980's.
Mr. Cusani, the sole defendant in the scandal's first trial, faces charges in the financial collapse of the Ferruzzi industrial group, Italy's second-largest private company.
 
Former Premiers Testified
 The roll call of star witnesses has included former prime ministers like the Socialist Bettino Craxi and Arnaldo Forlani, a Christian Democrat. But the trial will not include two of Italy's most dynamic corporate leaders over the last decade: the former Ferruzzi chief executive Raul Gardini and Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of the Government-owned ENI energy group. They committed suicide within days of each other last summer as details of the widespread corruption became more widely known.
A verdict might come this month, after the trial's last scheduled session on Feb. 25, less than two months before national elections that are viewed as the most crucial since voting in 1948 prevented the Communists from leading a government.
As it turns out, a front-runner in the March 27-28 general election is the Democratic Party of the Left, the Communists' successor organization. Its leaders have come under attack by several witnesses.
 
The Look of a Classroom
 On a recent Wednesday, Chief Judge Giuseppe Tarantola joined two other judges under a 25-foot-square Art Deco mural of Adam and Eve's expulsion from Paradise and called to order the defendant and lawyers who sat cramped on long benches that gave the chamber the look of a classroom.
The lawyers put aside their newspapers -- the headlines were about an Italian crooner's daughter missing in New Orleans -- and slumped into their chairs. Mr. Cusani wore a dark blue suit and orange-rimmed glasses that made him indistinguishable from his lawyers. He is charged with falsifying corporate balance sheets and violating the laws on the financing of political parties.
The judge called to the stand Giuseppe Garofano, who was chief executive of Ferruzzi's Montedison chemical subsidiary until corruption charges ended his career. At issue was a receipt for a $10 million payment to Rome politicians for favors. Mr. Garofano, a tall, nattily dressed man, denied any guilt.
"I did not give operative instructions," he said.
That prompted Antonio Di Pietro, the anti-racket investigator who is also the trial prosecutor, to say: "Oh, I get it. You just told your people, 'If someone asks you for the money, then you pay it.' "
 
Angry Wife Started It All
 Italy's wave of scandals involving top names in business, politicians and the mob began unfolding in 1992 after a Milan City official named Mario Chiesa, who pocketed bribes from businessmen in exchange for favors, was denounced by his disaffected wife.
But it was the collapse of Ferruzzi last year that led to the arrest of Mr. Cusani, a close associate of Mr. Gardini, and uncovered what may prove to be the greatest of Italy's scandals, the Government buyout in 1990 of the Enimont chemical corporation.
The charges involve a November 1990 battle between Ferruzzi's Montedison chemicals subsidiary and the ENI, the state-run energy company, for control of Enimont, their joint venture.
Mr. Di Pietro and his team of investigators have focused on how ENI and its chairman, Mr. Cagliari, together with ENI's owners at the Italian treasury, staved off a hostile takeover bid for Enimont by Mr. Gardini. To this end, they evidently prevailed on state-run banks to refuse to underwrite Mr. Gardini's bid, then worked out a deal whereby ENI paid an inflated sum to get Mr. Gardini and Montedison out of the Enimont venture. In turn. Mr. Gardini and his associates, including Mr. Cusani, channeled the equivalent of about $94 million in kickbacks to the major political parties.
'High Technology' Corruption
Scrutiny of Ferruzzi's books disclosed immense unaccounted-for sums that led to the charges against Mr. Cusani. Fresh arrests and further disclosures revealed a tangled network of confidential bank accounts in Switzerland, at the Vatican and at offshore banking havens like the Caymans. Leaks to the Italian press and the jailing of prominent figures like Mr. Garofano, the former chief executive at Ferruzzi, helped bring out details about just how hundreds of millions of dollars flowed clandestinely from Italian businessmen to the politicians.
Trying to explain the wide net of corruption in the 1980's, a senior diplomat from an allied country said: "Two things happened. First, the art of corruption moved from the stage of simple craftsmanship to that of high technology. Next, it became personalized, no longer enriching just the parties, but individuals."
 
4,000 Under Investigation
 Now more than 4,000 people, including 130 members of the old Parliament, are under investigation. Within the next two months, the corruption cases of two former Prime Ministers, Mr. Craxi and Giovanni Goria, a former Christian Democratic government leader, will go to trial. In the wake of bad publicity, Mr. Craxi's Socialists have been virtually wiped from the political landscape in pre-election voter surveys, while the Christian Democrats recently renamed themselves the Italian Popular Party.
The arguments used by Mr. Cusani's defense lawyer, Giuliano Spazzali, are essentially that the numbers are inflated, that no such large sums were ever paid and that a closer look at Ferruzzi's books will show that they all add up. Moreover, he says, since everybody appears to have been doing it, why make a scapegoat of Mr. Cusani.
 
Follow the Money
 Much of the efforts of Mr. Di Pietro's team of investigators have focused on tracking down the money through foreign bank accounts and front companies used to launder it. The investigators' frustrations are often illustrated by the cross-examination.
After hearing Mr. Garofano, the judge called Carlo Sama, a former Ferruzzi executive and the husband of Alessandra Ferruzzi, the daughter of the company's founding patriarch, Serafino Ferruzzi. Mr. Sama was questioned about an account he established in 1990 called the San Serafino Foundation, for his late father-in-law, with a deposit of $1.1 million at the Vatican bank, as he now said, "for the purpose of absolute confidentiality."
In earlier testimony, another Ferruzzi employee named Luigi Bisignani who helped set up the account said that with Mr. Sama's complicity, the account was used to launder about $55 million in Italian treasury notes. Apologizing for contradicting an old friend, Mr. Sama denied all this, and when Mr. Bisignani was led in for a face-to-face meeting, he backtracked, exonerating Mr. Sama.
 
Prosecutor Explodes
 "Somebody here is lying," Mr. Di Pietro shouted, punching the air with a fist.
Many Italians follow the trial because they identify with Mr. Di Pietro, said Laura Gaiani, a 20-year-old law student who watched the session.
"The phrases, the comments, the questions," she said, "are those most ordinary people would use."
Approving of the proceeding's atmosphere, she added: "In this way, all Italians can see how lavishly they went at it. When ordinary people hear these numbers, these millions and billions, then people who have had to work all their lives to support themselves, they can only roll their eyes."
Still, Mr. Di Pietro has been accused of turning a blind eye toward the Communists, who have been little implicated in the scandals until now, and the annual human rights report of the United States State Department recently criticized his use of the preventive imprisonment to coax confessions from from suspects.
While the 43-year-old magistrate has been approached by several political parties to run on their ticket, without success, perhaps the best measure of his popularity came recently from Naples, where carvers of traditional Christmas figurines produced a Good Shepherd in the likeness of Mr. Di Pietro. The figurines became the sales hit of the season.

HEADLINE: A Final Staten Island Homecoming

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
More than 1,000 people, from public officials to veterans to just plain neighbors, turned out yesterday to welcome the cruiser Normandy home to Staten Island after a 182-day Mediterranean mission. There were bagpipes, red-white-and-blue balloons, an airplane pulling a welcome home banner and a little construction-paper sign saying, "We love you Dad."
But there was a deeper poignance than the joyful reunion of families who had not been able to share in the start of school, Christmas and the birth of 10 babies. It was a final Staten Island homecoming for the Normandy, the only active warship stationed at the island's Homeport. 
 The Homeport, which opened in 1990, is to close on Aug. 31. A victim of steep cuts in military spending, the $300 million base is being closed even as it is still being built -- final touches are still being put on the general headquarters building.
The Normandy, an electronics-studded Aegis-class cruiser that was returning from the waters off the former Yugoslavia, is to be moved in June to Norfolk, Va. Similar dislocations are being seen from South Carolina to California as naval bases are closed.
 
End of the Line
 "This really represents the beginning of the end," said Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President. "It's really a sad day for New York City, not just Staten Island."
Indeed, Lieut. Cmdr. Roxie Thomsen, public affairs officer at the Homeport, said the closure of the Staten Island base means New York will be without a naval base for the first time in more than two centuries. When the Homeport opened, the Navy closed its only other local outpost, a repair site in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
More immediately stinging, Mr. Molinari and others say the Homeport's loss represents a huge economic blow to Staten Island at a time when the borough is trying to secede from the city, in part to better its economic fortunes. Gone will be more than 3,000 military and civilian jobs and the spending power they create. Stores, restaurants and other businesses, some created expressly for the new naval market, face precarious futures.
Of the area adjoining the naval station, Mr. Molinari said: "It was an old community that had gone to pot. There were shuttered windows, and some buildings had been destroyed by fire."
With the Navy's arrival, "the eastern shore started to come alive again," he said. "That's all turning about now."
 
Real Estate Dip
 Roberta Jacobowitz, executive director of the St. George Tompkinsville Improvement Corporation, a community revitalization program, said real estate prices in the area around the base have dropped by 30 percent. "In a way," she said, "I think the impact is greater than many of the merchants realize."
Not that they don't already feel pain. "I lost a lot of business," said Charlie Park, owner of Gentle Cleaners on Bay Street near the base. "I feel very bad, sad, you know."
"It's going to hurt us, but it's not going to bury us," said Danny Blaine, one of the owners of a beer-and-burger hangout called Pumpkin and Danny's down the street.
Accordingly, the city is scrambling vigorously to replace the Homeport with other public and private uses to soften the blow of the Navy's departure. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has already met with the commission appointed by his predecessor, David N. Dinkins, from the private sector, and asked them to stay on.
Possible Federal tenants for housing and office space include the Coast Guard, the Interior Department, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Food and Drug Administration. Private uses that have been discussed with various companies include using the new $100 million pier as a berth for luxury liners, and the huge main building as a rapid-turnaround repair site for airplane parts.
 
Some Hopeful Prospects
 "Things are going very, very well for us out there," said Bill Federici, spokesman for the New York City Commission of the Redevelopment of Navy Station New York. "Perhaps we'll even improve the economy of Staten Island."
The commission is hiring a consulting firm with $250,000 in Federal funds. The firm will then evaluate applicants to determine which would be most economically fertile. A further Federal grant of $1 million, as well as $1 million in promised state money, is to pay for later needs.
"We hope this will end up being not a pain in the neck, but a positive experience," said Representative Susan Molinari, the Staten Island Republican.
Staten Islanders say the biggest blow may be personal. When the Normandy first arrived four years ago, local pizza parlors delivered many dozens of free pizzas. On Friday nights, parties were staged for naval personnel, and at the spring Fleet Week celebrations, free bowling and golf tournaments were offered the sailors and officers. The roses that sailors presented to wives yesterday were a gift from a Staten Island florist who had them dropped from a helicopter.
Local women helped out with free baby-sitting, and during the long absences of sailors have made a point of including wives in social activities.
 
Creating a Family
 "A lot of us don't have family close by," said Karen Harris as she waited for her husband, Clay. "This is how we survived."
The Navy reciprocated by helping repair the boardwalk, spruce up local parks and clean up after storms. Navy personnel have coached little league teams, even as local businesses have sponsored Navy softball teams.
The disappointment was evident in the sad faces of two members of the Staten Island chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, an organization of veterans wounded in combat. "It's not right," said Jim Francis Jr., a retired city sanitation worker. "What kind of defense is the United States going to have? It's not right."
His friend, Frank Mulholland, still on the sanitation force, took the parochial view. "This is the best thing they ever did for Staten Island," he said, before mentioning the nice congratulatory letter his unit received from the Navy for their work in cleaning out the old pier to make way for the $100 million new one that stays level by rising and falling with the tides and currents.
But as always, the Navy people will move on. One wife said she had moved seven times in eight years. The Staten Island Chamber of Commerce will try to lessen the separation by formally adopting the Normandy. Officials hope to make the ship a focus of school letter-writing projects, among other things.
A few blocks away, along Bay Street, a sheet was hung on a fence. "You've made us proud," it said in big spray-painted letters.

HEADLINE: Recovery of Seized Jewish Assets Sought

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 4

 BODY:
In a mission both diplomatically sensitive and legally complex, a coalition of Jewish groups is negotiating with Eastern European countries to recover -- or at least receive compensation for -- properties that were seized first by the Nazis and then by the Communists.
Communal and private assets believed to be worth billions of dollars are at stake. 
 Beyond the money, leaders of the Jewish groups and Israeli Government officials say the collapse of Communism has handed them a previously undreamed-of opportunity to assert legitimate claims and to correct in part decades-old injustices against Jewish property owners. But it is a delicate matter, they acknowledge.
 
Demands on Fragile Economies
 They are making financial demands of fragile democracies with similarly fragile economies. And so they walk a line, they say, between trying to right old wrongs and appearing insensitive. Concerns have also been expressed that they might fuel anti-Semitism and damage Israel's relations with those countries, restored a few years ago after decades of cold war limbo.
Still, these groups say history requires them to act. Early next week, they will be in Washington to enlist support from the Clinton Administration and Congress. Israel may also take up the issue with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic, who is due in Jerusalem on Sunday.
"People ask us why we're doing this now," said Avi Beker, director in Israel of the World Jewish Congress, a leader in the recovery effort. "It's because for 40 years those domains remained outside history. If there had been no Communist regimes, restitution for what the Nazis did to the Jews of those countries would have started immediately after World War II."
In Hungary, Poland, Ukraine and other countries, Mr. Beker said, a few prewar communal properties -- synagogues, school buildings, nursing homes and cultural centers -- have been returned to the tattered remnants of once-thriving Jewish communities. But these are exceptions. The recovery process, officials say, is painfully slow and hobbled by deliberate delay.
 
'Not Enthusiastic'
 "They're not at all enthusiastic," said Naphtali Lau-Lavie, a senior official of the World Jewish Restitution Organization, a coalition of several groups, headed by Edgar M. Bronfman, that is the chief negotiator both for world Jewry and for Israel.
"We haven't had any rejection from the people we've met," Mr. Lau-Lavie said. "But they say that they have to look at it. There's understanding but no delivery."
Initially, the same could have been said about Israel. The Government was not enthusiastic about the project, fearing diplomatic fallout just when relations were warming with Eastern Europe. But it has come to accept the organization's argument that Israel, as "the embodiment of Jewish sovereignty," should receive compensation if there are no known heirs.
How much property is at issue is unclear. Mr. Lau-Lavie's group is still taking inventory.
It is a complicated situation, varying from place to place. In some towns, synagogues and yeshivas were destroyed. In others, they are standing, but no Jews live there. In still others, religious buildings were turned into warehouses by the Communists; in Minsk, Belarus, the main synagogue houses the national theater. As for private buildings, some stand, some were knocked down, some have no one to claim them, some have surviving owners or their heirs in Israel, some are state-owned, and some have been turned over to private hands by post-Communist governments.
 
Responses Vary
 And those governments' attitudes also vary widely.
The unified Germany, for instance, has assumed the burdens of the former East Germany. It stands ready to return properties to their rightful owners or heirs, or, if the buildings no longer exist, to pay compensation based on the assessed value in 1935.
Slovakia, a Nazi ally during the war, recently passed a law that provides for restitution of Jewish-owned communal buildings confiscated from November 1938 on. It does not affect those that belonged to individuals. And a Czech restitution law does not go even that far, covering only properties that were seized by the Communist regime that took power in 1948. It does not affect assets taken during the previous decade by the Nazis.
Mr. Beker said Israel recognizes that it is dealing with hard-pressed countries and is not interested in full compensation so much as in establishing long-ignored Jewish rights. Nonetheless, some here caution against pressing too hard.
Uri Huppert, a Polish-born lawyer active in Israeli-Polish affairs, noted that Poland itself suffered greatly at the Nazis' hands. To Poles, he argued, the reasons why they should pay now for the Nazis' crimes are "not as clear historically and morally as they are to the Jewish people."

HEADLINE: Some Companies Sit Out the Rush to Vietnam

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAPLES, Fla., Feb. 5

 BODY:
Now that American companies can trade with Vietnam, several are jumping right in. But despite the emotional impact of President Clinton's decision to lift the trade embargo, for corporate America Vietnam is down the list of priorities in Asia, behind booming economies like China, Thailand and Indonesia.
Some companies rushed this week to announce deals with Vietnam. Pepsico started to bottle soft drinks in Ho Chi Minh City. American Express said it would soon issue credit cards. United Airlines said it would begin scheduled service between Los Angeles and Ho Chi Minh City and Northwest Airlines wants to make scheduled flights there. And Caterpillar said it would soon sell parts to repair Army bulldozers that the North Vietnamese had captured after Vietnam fell to the North in 1975.
 
A Small Market
 Despite this flurry of activity, many corporate executives said Vietnam was still too small a marketplace to get their immediate attention. 
 The President's announcement on Thursday came as senior executives from 125 companies gathered here for the semi-annual directors meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers. But health insurance and labor relations, not Vietnam, were the main concerns at the two-day meeting.
"Our corporate future is not going to rise or fall on Vietnam," said Laurence C. Seifert, vice president of global manufacturing at American Telephone and Telegraph. "We provide some long-distance telephone service, mainly to Vietnamese in the United States who call their relatives in Vietnam. This business might rise. But the big market is China. We are exporting telephone equipment to China."
Still, more than 30 United States companies have opened offices in Vietnam, including Citibank, Bank of America, General Electric, Baker Mackenzie, Philip Morris, I.B.M., Digital Equipment and Motorola.
The Boeing Company and Caterpillar have talked with Vietnam Government agencies about buying airliners and bulldozers when the embargo was lifted. And the Mobil Corporation has an option to explore for oil offshore.
 
A Two-Speed Strategy
 But many American executives reacted to the new business freedom the way Warren Batts did: sell right away the few things that the Vietnamese really want, and go slow on the rest.
Mr. Batts is the chairman of Premark International Inc., a manufacturer of Tupperware and commercial kitchen equipment. Premark plans to sell the kitchen equipment to German, French and Japanese companies that are building hotels and investing in Vietnam. "We have the arrangements; we just needed the freedom to do it," Mr. Batts said.
The National Association of Manufacturers, representing 12,000 companies, had petitioned the White House last October to lift the embargo, noting among other things that Vietnam, with its 72 million people, "should be viewed as an important country in the fastest-growing region in the world."
That competition has been a problem for Boeing. "We had a preliminary agreement with Viet Nam Airlines to sell them 737's, but time passed and we could not sell, and they went with Airbus," Lawrence W. Clarkson, a vice president of Boeing, said. The Vietnamese bought six A320s, giving Airbus an edge for future purchases of small jetliners. "But the Vietnamese are also in the market for larger airliners," Mr. Clarkson said, "and they will be an important customer for us over the long run."
 
A Market for Parts
 Caterpillar has an advantage. When the North Vietnamese overran South Vietnam, they seized a thousand bulldozers that Caterpillar had sold to the United States armed forces. The Vietnamese have been using the machines ever since, stripping some for parts to keep others operating, said Don V. Fites, the chairman of Caterpillar.
The company will sell parts immediately for the aging bulldozers -- and earth moving equipment later. Mr. Fites said that over the long run, Vietnam might buy as much as $1 billion of Caterpillar's earth-moving equipment.

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Fighting One Another Over Federal Aid

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Federal Government is planning the largest inner-city development effort in more than a decade, New York City has deep problems, and its senior Congressman sponsored the law creating the program.
So everyone from the Hudson to the Potomac takes it for granted that New York will be one of six urban areas to receive $100 million to create an economic "empowerment zone." 
 It sounds simple: The Mayor and the Governor must jointly nominate up to three separate swaths of the city, to be reviewed by a panel of Federal officials that includes the Governor's son. The winning neighborhoods would receive new money for job training, drug treatment and other social services, and they would qualify for tax credits and pledges of matching state and city help for some of the poorest blocks in the nation.
But when the Democratic Congressman is Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, the Republican Mayor is Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Governor running for re-election is Mario M. Cuomo and the Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is his son, Andrew, simple turns out to be awfully complicated.
In fact, the feud over just where New York will ask the Clinton Administration to put an empowerment zone has turned into a classic inter-borough brawl in a city where disagreement is a way of life, and it could jeopardize the application altogether. It pits Mr. Rangel, the city's senior black politician and one of the new Mayor's early antagonists, who wants the whole zone for Harlem, against the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, one of Mr. Giuliani's leading future rivals who wants at least part of it for the South Bronx.
The struggle has its roots in one of David N. Dinkins's last acts as Mayor. He designated Harlem as the city's sole choice, in deference to his old friend Mr. Rangel, who has supported the notion for years and fought to include the program in President Clinton's budget package last summer.
But the Giuliani administration now says other neighorhoods may be even more deserving and has decided to open the field to all comers, including the Satmar Hasidic Jews of Williamsburg, who were among the Mayor's biggest campaign supporters.
At stake are variables ranging from Mr. Giuliani's relations with Mr. Rangel, the ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee and its potential future chairman, to Governor Cuomo's electoral prospects among black voters. And that's just the politics, never mind the merits, which may be even more complicated in a program that has been variously criticized as too little too late and a reheated revival of failed Federal policies past.
"Because it's my baby from the inception, and because I saved the bill last year, and because the President says it's my bill, you'd think Rangel would get one," Mr. Rangel said last week in an interview in which he also elaborated on a broad range of blunt complaints about Mr. Giuliani's approach to black New Yorkers, including the Mayor's continuing criticism of Mr. Dinkins and his handling of a melee last month at a Harlem mosque.
"I don't think that it's racist," he said. "I just think that he really doesn't know. It's lack of knowledge and understanding and sensitivity to all of us, which has nothing to do with whether or not he stays up at night trying to figure out how he's going to hurt us next."
John S. Dyson, Mr. Giuliani's Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said that the Mayor was grateful for Mr. Rangel's efforts, and that he deserved "some special consideration" but would have to compromise.
"He can't have the whole thing, and he just has to deal with us," Mr. Dyson said. "He thought he had done an adroit piece of legislative work with his then-friend the then-Mayor, but our obligation is to be Mayor of whole city. But Harlem ought to get a part of it."
 
Promoting Unity
 The applications are due in Washington by the end of June, and Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is expected to make a decision by late summer. Mr. Dyson said the city would work with community groups and state economic development officials to forge a draft proposal this month -- one that he strongly hinted would embrace parts of Harlem, the Bronx and Brooklyn, in keeping with a provision of the law that allows up to three noncontiguous sectors within a given city's zone.
"It doesn't many any sense to go to Washington in a divided way," Mr. Dyson said, noting that there would be public hearings this spring. He added: "In the end, the state and city have to make various kinds of pledges for support, and we're not sure yet how much money that will involve. I very much want to include the area of the Bronx around Yankee Stadium because one of the things we're going to have to do anyway is rebuild the stadium, and if we do it in a way that might make it possible to bring more people in there and have a regional commercial center, this money could help us concentrate things that way."
Mitchell Moss, the director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, who helped conduct a study on the subject last year, said vacant land and active community planning efforts under way in the South Bronx made it a better candidate for the program in many ways than Harlem, which is heavily residential, has little open land for industrial development and is dependent on a handful of institutions and businesses.
"Harlem is a needy community, with a lot of social needs," said Mr. Moss, who advised the Dinkins campaign last year. "But if you're going to build an economic development area, that's not the place to do it. There's not enough land."
 
Political Considerations
 Mr. Moss said the fighting posed challenges for Governor Cuomo, who may face a tough re-election fight this fall and be loath to alienate blacks who already feel he may not have worked hard enough to help Mr. Dinkins, and for the President.
"This is the only urban initiative that Clinton has," Mr. Moss said. "How can you ignore the major black Congressman? The sad part is it shouldn't be all in Harlem. They're needy but not deserving."
Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, has worked for months to gain support for his own proposals for redeveloping the South Bronx, but he had all but given up getting a piece of the empowerment zone because of Mr. Dinkins's support for Mr. Rangel. At first, spokesmen for Mr. Giuliani said he, too, supported Mr. Dinkins's proposal. Then they left open other possibilities and finally explained reached the Mayor's current course.
Meanwhile, Mr. Ferrer is smarting from the new Mayor's decision in the budget last week to abandon plans to build a new police academy in the South Bronx as unaffordable. He has renewed heavy pressure on Washington and Albany and was invited for a meeting last week with City Hall officials to press his case for a zone stretching from Central Harlem into the South Bronx.
"I don't think anyone should be precluded," Mr. Ferrer said, adding that he suspected that Mr. Giuliani, in considering the Bronx for designation, might be partly aiming to soothe his anger over the police academy.
"Those are separate issues," said Mr. Ferrer, who is often mentioned as a 1997 Democratic mayoral candidate. "So I get an opportunity to co-apply for empowerment-zone status and that should make me happy for four years? What, are you kidding?"
 
A Proposal for Brooklyn
 A third proposal, less defined, is taking shape under the aegis of Rabbi David Niederman, president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and a strong Giuliani supporter. Rabbi Niederman's organization, sometimes in wary alliance with Hispanic groups, has made various efforts over the years to foster economic development in the area, where Hasidic-Hispanic tensions over limited housing and public resources have simmered for years.
"I'm in the process of putting together a group now," Rabbi Niederman said. "I hope that Giuliani is a very practical-minded person. I feel that we will be able to show this is a good spot, and not some giveaway program."
Governor Cuomo's press secretary, Anne W. Crowley, said the Governor realized that there would be more than one worthy proposal in the city but that only one could ultimately win. "The reality is that Congressman Rangel, who has had an extraordinary influence and credibility, will play an especially important role," she said, adding that the application process was just beginning.
Several politicians here and in New York said that Mr. Rangel had boasted he was confident both Cuomos would support him, and that he would be implacable if he did not get his way.
But in the interview last week, Mr. Rangel acknowledged that he had limited power to take retribution on Mr. Giuliani -- by tying up other money or programs for New York, for example -- without also hurting his own constituents. He disclaimed any desire to have enemies, but acknowledged, "I do have a very good memory."
"I hope we don't allow the competition between our proposals to damage the city's chances of winning," Mr. Rangel said, noting that he planned a breakfast with Mr. Ferrer this week. "The only thing that separates the South Bronx from Harlem is a damn river."

HEADLINE: Study Finds Child-Neglect Deaths Are Highest in the South and West

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Death rates among children because of neglect and abuse are higher in Southern and Western states than in other parts of the country, researchers have estimated after analyzing information from all states.
The researchers, from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the University of Missouri, said their study found that death rates varied by region, state and metropolitan area. They said the reasons for the variations were uncertain because there is no standardized system for collecting and reviewing data on child abuse. 
 Dr. Bernard G. Ewigman of Missouri, one of the principal researchers, said that if all states developed systems for reviewing child fatalities in detail, they would produce the information needed to get at the causes of the deaths and steps could be taken to reduce them.
"Very few states and cities have adequately comprehensive systems in place to investigate children's deaths," Dr. Ewigman said in a telephone interview. "If we could learn more about the factors that cause rates to be higher in some parts of the country, it might be possible to prevent a lot of these tragic deaths."
 
Difference in Official Data
 Previous studies indicate that 90 percent of the nation's fatal cases of child abuse and neglect involve children 4 years old and younger. While officially reported statistics, like those from the police, indicate about 850 child-abuse deaths every year in that age group, the researchers said their work indicated that the number was more than 1,800.
They arrived at the higher figure by estimating the number of deaths normally attributed to accidents and other factors that could actually be considered a result of abuse. The calculations were based on the experience of states that established systems to review child deaths and then found a rise in deaths linked to abuse.
The researchers reported ranges of death rates, with the lower end primarily based on officially confirmed cases of abuse and the upper figure including deaths that were apparently the result of unreported maltreatment. The results, published in the current issue of The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, were the annual average death rates of children 4 years old and younger from abuse and neglect, based on figures compiled for 1979 through 1988.
They showed death rates of 5.4 to 11.5 for every 100,000 children in the South and 5.2 to 11.2 in the West. The rates were 4.3 to 8.2 for every 100,000 children in the Northeast and 4.6 to 9.8 in the North-Central region.
 
Connecticut at Low End
 The study ranked the states in this order in low death rates of children from maltreatment: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Minnesota, New Jersey, Iowa, North Dakota and Vermont. The states with the highest rates were in this order: Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Alaska, New Mexico, Mississippi, Georgia, Oklahoma, Arkansas and South Carolina.
Looking at the nation's 39 metropolitan areas with populations of more than one million, the researchers found the five highest death rates of children from maltreatment in Phoenix, Chicago and the Florida areas of Orlando, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Miami. Ranking lowest were Boston, Hartford, Rochester, Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio.
Previous work by the researchers indicated that childhood deaths because of neglect and abuse were under-reported. The researchers had said many children's deaths officially attributed to accidents, disease, fires and other causes might actually result from maltreatment.
Factors that lead to child abuse and neglect include poor education, unemployment, poverty, lack of available health care and drug abuse, Dr. Ewigman said, adding, "But we don't know what the reasons are in any given area for the numbers we got."
 
Praise From Advocacy Group
 Karen McCurdy, chief research analyst for the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse, a national advocacy and educational group based in Chicago, called the new study a positive step for better estimating the rates of child abuse and neglect.
"This study shows that more research should be done on abuse and neglect and provides a method to make this possible," Ms. McCurdy said in a telephone interview. "The next step is to produce a model that considers causes so that we can get to the meaning behind the numbers."
Among the 39 metropolitan areas, the New York City area ranked 28th in deaths of children from maltreatment, with annual rates of 5.2 to 8.9 for every 100,000 children. Los Angeles ranked 15th, with death rates of 5.1 to 10.5, while Washington ranked 30th, with death rates of 4.8 and 8.6.
The seemingly higher- or lower-than- expected death rates in some cities is partly explained by the use of statistical areas that extend beyond city borders. Dr. Ewigman said the figures for New York City, which has a high crime rate and other social problems, might appear low because the city's numbers were diluted by those of suburbs.

GRAPHIC: Photo: "Dying Young in the Cities" shows estimated range of rates of death for children under 5 due to abuse and neglect, in metropolitan statistical areas with a million people or more. The estimates are annual averages for the years 1979 to 1988, the latest figures available. Lower estimates are officially reported rates, based on sources like death certificates, in places with no comprehensive death-review system; higher estimates are based on a formula derived from studies in places that do have a comprehensive death-review system.

HEADLINE: WINTER OLYMPICS;
U.S. Ice Dancer's Father Found Stabbed to Death

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LILLEHAMMER, Norway, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The father of a United States Olympic ice dancer, Elizabeth Punsalan, was found stabbed to death on Friday night at his home in Sheffield Lake, Ohio, outside of Cleveland. The skater's brother was arrested and will be charged with aggravated murder on Monday, the Sheffield Lake police said today.
Rickey Punsalan was arrested after the police arrived at the home of his father, Dr. Ernesto Punsalan, who was found lying in his bedroom with two stab wounds in the chest, police said. Punsalan was pronounced dead upon arrival at St. Joseph Hospital in Lorain, Ohio, the police said. 
 In a statement today, Elizabeth Punsalan said she would compete in the Olympics.
"My father was proud of my skating achievements and would have wanted me to go on to Lillehammer," she said. "I will try to skate my very best there in his memory."
The ice-dancing competition begins Feb. 18 in Hamar, Norway.
Theresa Punsalan, the widow of Punsalan and the mother of Rickey and Elizabeth, called authorities about 9 P.M. Friday after her husband had been stabbed with a kitchen knife, the police said in a telephone interview. Rickey Punsalan is an unemployed 20-year-old, authorities said.
The family had been planning a trip to Norway to attend the Olympics, friends said. Elizabeth Punsalan, 23, and her husband of five months, Jerod Swallow, 27, who train in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, won the national ice dancing championship in Detroit in early January, qualifying as the only American dance entrants at the Winter Games.
Ernesto Punsalan, a 54-year-old general surgeon, practiced at Elyria Memorial Hospital Regional Medical Center, and was described by a hospital spokesman as friendly and outgoing.
Kristin Matta, a spokeswoman for the United States Figure Skating Association, said that she was "deeply saddened" by the death of Dr. Punsalan.
"It goes without saying that a tragedy that impacts any Olympic athlete saddens the Olympic family tremendously," said Mike Moran, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee. "But in the case of Liz Punsalan, it is especially heart-rending because of what she personally and with her husband give back to their sport and the Olympic movement."

HEADLINE: Pricing to the Market in Silicon Valley

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I found it difficult to be moved by Neil R. Henry's plight, as described in "Job Crunch: The Slamming Doors of Silicon Valley" (Jan. 23). Hard times for the 31-year-old, it seems, means deigning to seek jobs in the $40,000 to $60,000 range, rather than at the $80,000 a year he previously was fortunate enough to earn.
It's kind of like being priced out of the market for a Rolls Royce, but staying in the running for, say, a Jaguar, while the rest of the world is getting a 100,000-mile tuneup on the old Ford wagon.

HEADLINE: Raising the Flag for Capitalism

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Ray Jenkins ("Socialism's Noble Aims," Viewpoints, Jan. 23) seriously misses the mark in terms of understanding capitalism, socialism and the major tragedies of the 20th century. Mr. Jenkins's definition of socialism's goals is really a definition of the best principles of capitalism, namely "teamwork, concern for one's fellow citizens, cooperation. It calls for sharing and pulling together. It calls for people to see themselves as part of the whole." 
 Mr. Jenkins seems to equate late 20th century capitalism with the robber barons of the 19th century. Capitalism has evolved to the point at which an enterprise cannot survive without the very human face that Mr. Jenkins ascribes to socialism.
As Friedrich Hayek pointed out so eloquently, it is not the aims and goals of socialists we need to fear, it's the road they travel. In other words, in the name of socialist aspirations that few can fault, this century is awash with the blood of innocents, shed because socialists of every stripe pursued their ends by any means.
When it comes to maximizing the benefits society has to bestow upon its citizens, I'll take capitalism every day. We'll feed, clothe and house more people at a higher standard of living. And we'll do it without a moralist directing our activities, robbing us of our freedoms and liberties -- the road the socialists must eventually travel.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Ray Jenkins displays the worst behavior of an American leftist: After a lifetime of enjoying the freedom and the high standard of living of American capitalism, he feels guilty! There is a simple cure: Take up residency in one of the remaining socialist countries, like Cuba or China, and try to live and make a living there while they still have their "noble socialist aspirations." But hurry, before their noble aspirations cause them to cease to exist. 
 I have news for Ray Jenkins: After living in socialist Czechoslovakia for 30 years and in capitalist United States of America for almost 20 years, it is my conviction that the attributes of socialism alleged by Mr. Jenkins have been implemented to a far greater degree and with infinitely greater personal freedom in the United States than in any socialist regime known to date.
People like Mr. Jenkins are surely guilty of one thing: Perpetuating for decades a myth that socialist countries have engaged in a valiant effort based on ideals superior to capitalism. These John Reeds and Gus Halls of the Western world helped to legitimize socialist regimes in the eyes of many Westerners and, thus, helped socialist regimes to enslave and destroy millions of people.

HEADLINE: Raising the Flag for Capitalism

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Mr. Jenkins claims that socialism leads to cooperation between people. He also claims that "faulty economic theory, or the usual human failings, have kept it from working." 
 But Mr. Jenkins is wrong. He is wrong about human nature and morality, wrong about the political implications of socialism, and wrong about the cause of wealth.
Human nature is neither intrinsically good nor bad; humans can choose good or evil. The socialist concept of good is that which is purportedly good for the group as a whole, regardless of the goals of individuals within the group. Indeed, one's pursuit of individual goals is regarded as evil. Under socialism, if an individual commits the "sin" of seeking his own happiness, he is condemned.
In the political arena, socialism enforces its moral base by coercion. It requires the individual to sacrifice his life in order to meet a planned political agenda. The consequences of such an agenda have been illustrated in the fate of peoples in Communist Russia and Nazi Germany.
As to the cause of wealth, its origin is the most fundamental human virtue: rationality. Wealth exists because humans think, and produce values to aid them in survival and the pursuit of happiness. According to socialist theory, such aspirations should inspire guilt.
Socialism is a variant of human slavery. Capitalism, on the other hand, is the only moral social system ever devised. Pure, unregulated, laissez-faire capitalism recognizes that it is good for human beings to achieve values. Morally, it asserts that human life is the standard of value and that each individual human life is the purpose of that standard.
Capitalism requires that individuals be free, and it provides a government whose primary function is to protect the individual rights of all its citizens. Finally, in contrast to socialist deceptions, capitalism is honest. It recognizes that money is the product of human minds committed to rationality and moral integrity.
The socialist creates poverty -- both morally and economically -- and blames capitalism (or its remnants) for its failures. As the philosopher Ayn Rand observed, however, "capitalism did not create poverty, it inherited it."

HEADLINE: Russia Won't Bankrupt Itself for Our Sake;
Let's Support Research

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Prof. Jeffrey Sachs, my colleague and neighbor, may be right (Op-Ed, Jan. 23) that now is not the time to give the Government of Russia large-scale economic help. 
 But there are individuals and small laboratories in Russia doing work of great interest to the world, and that the world could pay for. I take one example of many of which I know.
Mira Kossenko of the International Radiological Laboratory in Chelyabinsk has 40 years of medical records of 30,000 people exposed to strontium 90 from accidental dumping into the Techa River in 1956. These people had comparable exposures to the Hiroshima-Nagasaki survivors, on which we depend for much of our knowledge of radiation effects, but the rate of exposure corresponds more closely with civilian accidents. These records need to be on computer and analyzed.
Since the world does not want to repeat these exposures, the data are beyond price. The United States pays $80 million a year to the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Hiroshima to understand the Japanese cohort. Yet the budget of the Chelyabinsk laboratory is only $30,000 a year. I have urged our Government to support this work (directly to the laboratory) for 18 months. Only personal and foundation funds of about $12,000 have been available, which I have used to take computers there.
Dr. Kossenko and her colleagues are working to help all of us. Let us support her directly, and people like her in Russia.

HEADLINE: Russia Won't Bankrupt Itself for Our Sake;
Reformer Omissions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Jeffrey Sachs offers misleading and mostly self-serving excuses for the catastrophic condition of the Russian economy in "The Reformers' Tragedy" (Op-Ed., Jan. 23). While there is increasing consensus that the advice offered by experts from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund was neither helpful, given the political context, nor necessarily suitable, Professor Sachs's lament, that the reform movement was sabotaged when promised loans were not disbursed, misses the point. 
 There is considerable evidence that the flight of capital from the Russian Republic alone equaled, and perhaps exceeded, the $22 billion promised by international agencies. This flight of capital took place as a result of actions of the Central Bank and of policies championed by Professor Sachs
and like-minded advisers to the Ministry of Finance. Additional credits would probably have ended up in private foreign accounts as well.
The sins of omission of the reformers and their advisers can be blamed for the depressed state of the Russian economy, the runaway inflation and the increased recourse to barter because of the breakdown of the payment system. The reformers did not try to create the kind of institutions crucial to a less painful transition. Instead -- just like the international agencies -- they focused on fiscal and financial measures.
They neglected to put in place (1) an effective wholesale distribution system that would let producers have uninterrupted access to raw materials and (2) a rapid payment system that would be suitable to an inflationary economy.

HEADLINE: Russia Won't Bankrupt Itself for Our Sake

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Although we in the West long condemned Communism as ideological, United States officials and journalists discuss the Russian crisis in terms scarcely less so. We insist on using "reform" as a synonym for our own prescription for economic shock therapy -- and make it impossible to identify not only Russia's overriding interests, but also our own. 
 We profess to worry that Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin's policy will lead to hyperinflation. But shock therapy -- and in particular the decontrol of energy and food prices -- has been a major cause of inflation. It is true that massive bankruptcies would correct this by a severe deflation, but at the cost of widespread unemployment. At a time when President Clinton promises to end welfare as we know it in this country, he can hardly mean to support tens of millions of Russians. Nor will other rich countries, which also have tight budgets and domestic needs.
It would be one thing if our draconian course actually led to a rosy future. But can we expect Russian wages to undersell third world levels? Even then, global corporations might hesitate to invest in Russia, given its political instability. Nowhere is there the capital to remake the Russian economy from scratch.
If we believe in democratic foreign policy, it is time to be blunt about the interests driving ours. A bankrupt Russian agriculture is a market for American grain. A bankrupt energy sector is a fire sale of oil and mineral rights. A bankrupt arms industry eliminates a major competitor in the global arms trade and hobbles Russia as a military power.
The problem is that this result, even if it were desirable, is politically impossible. The December Parliamentary vote shows that Russians will not accept it in any semblance of democracy. We might like President Boris N. Yeltsin to impose it by virtual dictatorship. But the more Mr. Yeltsin relies on authoritarianism, the more he must rely on the military. Its interests are hardly to dismember Russia for our benefit.
American policy promises only to provoke the severe nationalist reaction we claim to fear. If our leaders had expressly set out to promote fascism in Russia, we could scarcely have done better. There are no easy answers. But humility is the beginning of wisdom. Perhaps we can help Russians find democracy if we practice it ourselves.

And Bear in Mind
(Editor's choices of recent books of particular interest)
 
BEYOND DESPAIR: Three Lectures and a Conversation With Philip Roth, by Aharon Appelfeld. (Fromm, $17.50.) The Israeli novelist argues that literature can and must deal with the Holocaust or give up its pretensions to be a vehicle of spiritual apprehension.
 
THE BINGO PALACE, by Louise Erdrich. (HarperCollins, $23.) Three decent people look for love on a windblown prairie in this novel whose daily life is enriched by supernatural events and the presence of Indian spirits.
 
BITTER WINDS: A Memoir of My Years in China's Gulag, by Harry Wu and Carolyn Wakeman. (Robert L. Bernstein/Wiley, $22.95.) Mr. Wu's memoir of 19 years in labor camps is grimly familiar as to abuse and deprivation but grotesque and surreal in its account of acting out each new political rectification campaign right in the heart of the prison system.
 
THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE, by George Dawes Green. (Warner, $19.95.) Romulus Ledbetter, Mr. Green's protagonist, is a homeless, black, paranoid private eye who can be roused to propriety only by a case as interesting as the one Mr. Green has dreamed up for his first novel.
 
CROSSING THE RIVER, by Caryl Phillips. (Knopf, $22.) A novel, covering two and a half centuries, that presents a brilliantly coherent mythified vision of the irreversible African diaspora.
 
A FROLIC OF HIS OWN, by William Gaddis. (Poseidon, $25.) Mr. Gaddis's fourth novel, easier to like than his previous work, constructs a harsh, misanthropic but hilarious comedy from the language of law and litigation.
 
GOING NATIVE, by Stephen Wright. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $22.) A road novel that explodes the conventions of the genre as a weird, dangerous shape-shifting protagonist remakes his identity on the way to California.
 
HOW WE DIE: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter, by Sherwin B. Nuland. (Knopf, $24.) The author, a physician, surgeon and teacher for 35 years, offers a wise, humane and cultivated examination of what happens to people when they die, omitting none of the clinical detail.
 
IMAGES: My Life in Film, by Ingmar Bergman. (Arcade, $27.95.) At 75, the great Swedish film maker confronts and reveals himself as artist and man in this evocation of his career, based on a fresh viewing of all his movies.
 
JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES. Volume 2: The Economist as Saviour 1920-1937, by Robert Skidelsky. (Allen Lane/Penguin, $37.50.) How Keynes reshaped the world's economy, made a lot of money and married a ballerina, by an economics professor whose mastery of many subjects seems to match Keynes's own.
 
JOSEPHINE: The Hungry Heart, by Jean-Claude Baker and Chris Chase. (Random House, $27.50.) Prodigious research and outstanding narrative fluency mark this biography of Josephine Baker (1906-75), the irresistible American institution of French revues, cabaret and film.

HEADLINE: Reader by Reader and Town by Town, A New Novelist Builds a Following

BYLINE: By Michael Norman; Michael Norman, a former reporter for The New York Times, is an associate professor of journalism at New York University and the author of "These Good Men," a memoir of American troops in Vietnam.

 BODY:
This essay is the second of two parts about the marketing of a first novel and the beginning of a writer's career.
"Art must be practiced as a trade, at all events in our time. This is the age of trade."
 George Gissing
 "New Grub Street" (1891)
WHEN Marly Rusoff is lucky, a book sells itself. When she's not, a handle can be hard to come by. 
 "Well, I think that Mark Richard is going to be remembered as one of the most celebrated writers of his generation." She sighs. "And that's not a publicist's hype." Then she winces. "It's difficult," says Doubleday's vice president and associate publisher. "When you say he's part Melville, part King James Bible, part Faulkner, you feel like an idiot. It's hard to describe."
Perhaps she should be oblique, she suggests, especially this week, a week in early May 1993, just before the book is published. Waiting for the approbation or opprobrium of the critics, the prudent publicist affects a certain uncertainty. "Mark Richard may be called the Joseph Conrad of our day," she says. "Who knows?" And then she smiles.
Ms. Rusoff learned the business from the selling floor up. The daughter of a bookbinder, she owned a bookstore in Minneapolis, then went to work as a sales representative for Simon & Schuster, crisscrossing the cold brown hills of South Dakota with boxes of books in the trunk of her car. She came to New York and worked in the publicity department at Houghton Mifflin, then in 1990 moved to Doubleday, where she now creates the "publishing plan" for 25 to 30 books a year. In a trade of tin-pot reputations where hype is the order of the day, she is spoken of with respect. She won't oversell a book, they say; she doesn't try to pass off a second fiddle as a concertmeister.
Today she's groping for words. The book that she's trying to sell, "Fishboy," by Mark Richard, a first novel, has a thin story, almost no plot and dense language that requires close reading. The narrator is a ghost who tells his life story, recounting a dark fable about an abandoned child, more fish than human, reborn in a swamp, who goes to sea in the company of a crew of cutthroats and grotesques. Such work is hardly what Hollywood would call "high concept." And, like all literary fiction, it will have to fight for a place on the bookstore shelves.
The audience for such fiction, "serious readers," as Philip Roth calls them, is tiny: perhaps 120,000, says Mr. Roth; more likely, say others, much less. In this marginal market, if a first novel sells 10,000 or 15,000 copies, that is considered a victory. The writers of literary fiction sometimes "break out" early with a "big book" that appeals to a general audience, but for the most part they build their reputations slowly, book by book, reader by reader.
On the surface, Mark Richard would appear to have certain advantages. His publisher, Doubleday, a division of Bantam Doubleday Dell, which is owned by the German corporation Bertelsmann, is one of the largest, oldest and most successful concerns in the industry. His agent is the well-respected Georges Borchardt. His editor is Nan A. Talese, who, under her own imprint, publishes both critical and popular successes, among them Margaret Atwood and Pat Conroy.
Mark Richard (pronounced ree-SHARD), 37 years old, has been working for some time to position himself. He came to New York in 1985 and in the eight years since then, his short stories have appeared in major publications like Esquire and The New Yorker. Along the way, some of his stories were collected and published by Alfred A. Knopf in "The Ice at the Bottom of the World," which won the PEN/Hemingway prize and led to a Whiting Foundation grant.
Hungry for success, Mr. Richard is also willing to do just about anything to help sell his first novel. He and Ms. Rusoff have talked about a four-city publicity jaunt to be followed by a driving tour of the South, with signings and readings at 28 bookstores from Texas to Virginia.
For the moment, however, all plans wait.
Next week is the book's official publication date -- in effect, when the company formally releases its product to the critics and the public. Without the reviewers' warranty -- or, in its absence, widespread word-of-mouth or interest generated by feature articles in major magazines and newspapers -- "Fishboy" will have little chance.
Ms. Rusoff has spent a good deal of time, on the telephone or by letter, trying to convince the editors of the major newspaper book review sections -- The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Newsday -- that "Fishboy" was worth a look. (At one point, she was calling the book a "fever-dream" and the author "kin to Garcia Marquez.") Now, a week away from publication, she's worried. "In the past," she says, looking down at the novel's deep blue cover, "I've seen books like this get trashed."
Every year for the last 10 years, American publishers have released an average of 45,000 new titles. Roughly 10 percent of these are fiction -- including mysteries, melodramas, romances, military sagas, thrillers and so on. Many are derivative, written to formula -- a different kind of "Presumed Innocent," another "Hunt for Red October."
Richard Eder, the Pulitzer Prize-winning book critic for The Los Angeles Times and Newsday, whose reviews are available nationwide on the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, figures that he looks at maybe 200 first novels a year. Every week, a load of books and bound galleys is delivered to his Boston office. He arranges them in piles on the floor, then sits down among them to browse. He reads here, he reads there. If a sentence catches his eye, he keeps reading. Twice a week, he writes about something he's read -- usually, but not always, a work of fiction. His reviews reach an audience of between three and four million people.
One day last spring, "Fishboy" arrived at Mr. Eder's apartment. He pulled the proof copy from its cardboard mailing envelope and put it in a pile of seven or eight others. His method of culling is, well, metaphorical: "I taste them, I sniff them, I lift them up. There's a kind of a smell about a book I'm not going to review." Like most critics, he looks for literary staples: a Norman Mailer, a John Updike. Absent a known commodity, he takes a "cursory sniff" at new products. Here he indulges his tastes. He does not like Southern Gothic fiction or American domestic realism -- "which includes a lot of good, tidy literature" -- or anything over 1,000 pages long. He "loves" examples of magic realism, "but I don't think it works that often, so I look for them." And thus he turned to "Fishboy."
Mr. Eder knew that the author had won a Whiting grant, which "was kind of like a friend saying, 'This guy is worth a look.' " So he opened the bound galleys and started to read: "I began as a boy, as a human-being boy, a boy who fled to sea, a boy with a whistling lisp and the silken-tipped fingers of another class. A boy . . . thrown from a car into a side-road swamp. A child born again there, slithering out of the sack. . . ."
MR. EDER put the galleys down. "The first two or three pages were indecipherable." But he did not toss "Fishboy" away. He rarely judges a novel by its opening pages because "God knows, if Theodore Dreiser were on my floor and I read the first 50 pages, I wouldn't have reviewed him." He picked the galleys up again; he read about an ax fight, a mermaid, a helmsman turned inside out and a mate who hated the cook so much that he killed him. Then he turned to his computer and wrote an 800-word review:
"Richard's novel is a trifle . . . a hefty dose of spirits. The fumes occasionally overpower it, and the author's heady images stagger grandiosely. . . . Its hallucinatory ins and outs read like a particularly laborious recipe from the magic-realism cookbook. . . . There is something downright plucky and resourceful about the young narrator. He is an altered state Huck Finn. What he lacks is a river. . . . Richard has written an essentially literary adventure. His hero floats feistily -- but on a book, not a raft."
What Mr. Eder intended was, as he later explained, "a mixed review." He admired the bold effort, the author's mythic echoes and literary allusions, but, essentially, Mr. Eder thought "Fishboy" had failed. "Huck Finn" without a "river" was clearly a metaphor for the book's chief weakness: its lack of a clear story. "Fishboy," he said in an interview, "floated around in a fog."
Mr. Eder's review, the first major review of Mark Richard's book, appeared in Newsday and The Los Angeles Times on May 6, 1993. And in New York the people at Doubleday were hardly downcast.
Marly Rusoff is on the telephone. "We're having a frantic day, but I want to refer you to Richard Eder's review. It's a really fun review. It's given me a much lighter heart about the book. He calls it 'an altered state Huck Finn.' So it's, as we've been saying, an American classic. He gives it a good review, but what I love about it is, it makes the book sound like so much fun. I've always been a little shy about talking about how much fun the book is because you have an idiot, a dead sheriff, two convicts, a murder, so this gives me the courage to tell people what a terrifically fun book this is."
Ms. Rusoff's reading of Richard Eder's review could be taken as an example of what the longtime editor Ted Solotaroff has termed the "cognitive dissonance" that makes American publishing sometimes seem like never-never land. Was Ms. Rusoff trying to wrap a technical failure in the cloak of a critical success? Or was she simply looking for material to help with the handle, the pitch -- and Mr. Eder's review had the kind of "buzzy lines" she'd been hoping for?
"Now I can talk about it as 'an altered state Huck Finn.' You pick up things along the way. With a first novel, you have to have some endorsement beyond yours and a couple of the author's friends'. You have to build up a bunch of material. Now I can probably get some momentum from this. I've read positive reviews that are so boring you'd never consider spending $25 on the book. A selling review is a review that people might talk about. It goes beyond appearing in print; it becomes part of conversation. And word-of-mouth is really what works in the end. 'Altered state Huck Finn' -- yes, that's something people will talk about."
Tonight Mark Richard's friend Pearson Marx is throwing a party for "Fishboy" in her posh Upper East Side apartment. It is a catered affair with champagne and smoked fish, ham and turkey. Doubleday is represented by Nan Talese (sporting a black beret), Marly Rusoff (a tentative smile) and various young and attractive supernumeraries. An assembly of the author's friends are here, as well as his mother and sister. David Hirshey, the deputy editor at Esquire, is in attendance, standing in a circle of literary youngbloods clustered around Gay Talese, Ms. Talese's husband.
Some book parties are promotional stunts; the publishing house asks its well-known authors to lend their cachet to a newcomer and invites the press to watch as everyone walks around offering congratulations and rubbing elbows. Other parties, like this one, are simply part of the tradition of celebrating someone's work. Tonight's affair is private (the author asked the only reporter in the room to leave his notebook at home), a small break from the serious business, a few moments when "Fishboy" is nothing but a book.
Back at work, Marly Rusoff is trolling. She's been faxing Mr. Eder's review to feature editors and radio and television producers. The author, she's been telling them, is good copy -- a teen-ager from Virginia who became the youngest disk jockey in the country, a college boy who went to sea on fishing boats, a writer in the Southern tradition who has made a myth that's fun to read.
Now and then she gets a nibble -- National Public Radio, which attracts a significant book-buying audience, wants to know more -- but no one will commit to an interview. Mr. Eder's review is not nearly enough to create the "buzz" that flowers into the "phenomenon" that demands attention. Everyone seems to be waiting -- waiting for The New York Times.
The New York Times Book Review does not always make or break a book. But, say book publicists, its influence is such that critics and editors across the country regularly follow its lead. More than 8,000 books and bound galleys are sent to the Book Review every year; only about 2,500 titles end up being featured in its pages. The packages arrive at the Book Review's gray offices in waist-high rolling mail bins. Staff workers toss out anything judged inappropriate for review (romance novels, genre westerns, game books, how-to books, textbooks and so on) -- the sorts of titles the Book Review has decided not to cover or, say its editors, books that its readers don't expect to find in its pages. The survivors, about 100 titles a week, are divided among eight preview editors who screen books and bound galleys, make assignments and shepherd reviews into print.
THE previewers record their impressions for the master files. Some of their comments cut to the quick. "Deeply dry," said one, about a book exploring military strategy in the Middle East. "No, deadly dry." Others are more prosaic: "This semi-memoir" about the Warsaw ghetto "is more a document than a book for a general audience." Occasionally, a previewer has some fun: "A veddy British journalist (now a freelance television producer) has veddy interesting (and sometimes veddy troubling) adventures wandering around the islands of the South Pacific. She becomes veddy concerned about the despoliation of paradise -- but not veddy concerned about the neglected state of her own prose."
Every Thursday morning, the eight preview editors gather around an eighth-floor conference table with Rebecca Sinkler, Marvin Siegel and Robert Harris, the editor, deputy editor and assistant editor of the Book Review. The preview editors present the books they think are worthy, then make suggestions -- from a wide-ranging group of scholars, novelists, journalists, historians, editors and experts in various fields -- about who might write the review that will appear in print.
"We fall on their suggestions and try to tear them apart," said Ms. Sinkler. The editors, she said, aim for "lively and informed matches of reviewer and book." They also try to avoid conflicts of interest, even deeply hidden ones: "We might say Y can't review X because she was sleeping with X's agent's first husband." And there are all kinds of other questions. "If you have a book that's sheer misogyny, do you give it to a radical feminist? No."
WHEN the bound galleys of "Fishboy" arrived at The New York Times, the previewer was ambivalent: "Richard's collection of short stories was an uneven, bleakly modernist, sometimes chillingly effective piece of work. His new novel, a sort of absurdist nautical fairy tale (which the publisher, alas, is calling a reinvention of the sea language and myths found in Melville and Conrad), is a similarly mixed bag. A young boy hangs about a strange, female-populated fishing station, scarfing oysters and yearning for the sea. Strange boats come and go. He is involved in what might be a murder. He is taken aboard a boat. He sees strange things. He returns. Sometimes these encounters are described in an interesting way, in vivid images. But the point of it all often seems lost in the posturing."
That Thursday the consensus around the conference table was that -- because of the first reading of the book itself and the competition from other, seemingly stronger titles -- "Fishboy" did not warrant a full review. It was assigned to a freelance journalist, Margot Mifflin, who had written regularly for the Book Review for several years and was known to have a taste for modern fiction. She was asked to write what is known as a "brief," a 200- to 300-word paragraph for the In Short page.
On occasion, reviewers have such a strong reaction to a book that they ask their editors for more space. Sometimes they get it, sometimes they don't; sometimes there's space, sometimes the reviewer is off the mark. Ms. Mifflin told the previewer who had made the assignment that she loved the book. The editors had come to trust her judgment, they said. They knew she was not simply angling for a byline.
Ms. Sinkler took a hard look at the book and, in the end, decided that "Fishboy" was the kind of work "on which reasonable people could disagree"; it also appeared to have a quality she admired -- it seemed "ambitious," the kind of writing that takes chances. So she was persuaded to "bump it up" to a 600-word review that ran on the bottom of page 7 on May 16.
The posturing modernist was now, in Ms. Mifflin's words, a writer with a "seemingly fathomless imagination" who "has folded a host of exquisitely rendered tales into a stunning novel."
"I'll take that, yes-sir-ee-bob, I'll take that any day of the week."
His agent, Georges Borchardt, has just called to read from a copy of the Book Review and Mr. Richard, who is packing for a quick publicity trip, is ebullient. "Georges says the most important thing is to get noticed. And I want the book to get noticed. I'm not trying to put it in every home, but I do want to shove it from shore and get it sailing on its own."
The next day he leaves for a short four-city publicity tour -- Miami, San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto. Most of the 8,000 copies from the first printing have been shipped to the stores. Now all the author has to do is persuade readers to buy them.
Mr. Richard will not sell hundreds at each stop. There will be no queues in the streets outside bookstores, no clamoring for his signature on the title page. In fact, the spot sales on tour count for little. Literary fiction is hand-sold slowly across time and the hand that matters most is the bookseller's. So the smart author tries to meet as many clerks and managers and bookstore owners as he or she can, hoping that when someone wanders up to the register "looking for a good book," the bookseller will recommend him.
The trip took eight days. In Miami, he gave a reading and answered questions at Mitchell Kaplan's store Books & Books. For the most part, it is the independently owned bookstores (16,765 of them in the United States) and not the large chain stores (12,853) that take a chance on new work.
The literary reading, a cross between abject salesmanship and performance art, is an old form of cultural conversation, but it can serve the modern author in many ways. Serious fiction needs a following to survive and often the 20 or 30 people who attend a reading at a bookstore become fans of the writer for life.
Any reading turns on the personality of the author. Some can't emote, others can't stop. "I've done a thousand author readings, and I've found that talent and humility are not first cousins," said Meg O'Brien, who interviewed Mr. Richard in Miami for her show "Cover to Cover" on WLRN, a public radio station. "But Mark said all the right things. Every one of those 20 people there fell in love with him."
Mark Richard has been writing, off and on, since childhood. When he reached puberty, his voice dropped dramatically, and at age 13 he went to work as a disk jockey. After high school, he studied journalism at Washington & Lee University in Virginia, but a professor who took an interest in his work started to push him toward literature -- Poe and Dickens, Faulkner, Fitzgerald and Twain. Mr. Richard left school for a while, worked on fishing boats along the Eastern Seaboard, then returned, finished his degree and in the years that followed bounced from one job to another: photographer, Xerox machine operator, envelope stuffer, newspaperman. He moved to Virginia Beach, lived in a "nasty place" at the edge of a honky-tonk strip and divided his nights between a typewriter and a spot at the bar at a gin mill called the Thunderbird Lounge.
Now and then, Mr. Richard would send his work to New York, to Esquire magazine, where it would end up in a slush pile in Tom Jenks's office. "But the stories always popped out," said Mr. Jenks, who was then the magazine's associate fiction editor. "They were filled with yearning and longing." The writer had talent, but little technique and no discipline. "Sometimes I'd work on his manuscripts and send them back," Mr. Jenks said, "but he was always resistant to revising them. Instead I'd get four more stories."
In 1985, on a vacation to North Carolina's Outer Banks, Mr. Jenks finally met the author. At one point that day, as Mr. Richard remembers it, Mr. Jenks offered some advice: "Tom said, 'You want to play hardball fiction? You've got to come to New York.' " The industry was in New York, and so was a large community of fellow travelers. He needed to meet editors and mix with other authors, Mr. Jenks told him; he needed to become serious about his work. Six months later, Mr. Jenks got a call at his desk in Manhattan. "I went around to the Old Town Bar on 18th Street off Broadway and there he was," said Mr. Jenks. "He had on Maui shorts, a T-shirt and sandals. He said, 'Here I am. What do I do now?' "
Mr. Richard went on to publish a few stories in Esquire and other magazines, but the fees were modest and in the years that followed he lived hand to mouth, often on the largess of friends. At one point he was so impoverished that he was eating the baby food in the apartment where he was house-sitting. About that time, two editors from Esquire invited him to lunch. As Mr. Jenks tells the story, one of them "noticed that Mark only ate half of his sandwich and wrapped the other half up to take with him. They said, 'That's ridiculous. We don't treat our writers like that,' and the magazine arranged for him to get an advance on his next story."
Along the way, on Mr. Jenks's advice, Mr. Richard had taken a writing course with Gordon Lish, an influential editor at Knopf who offers expensive tutorials and often places the work of his students in The Quarterly, his small literary magazine. After the course, Mr. Lish offered Mr. Richard a contract for a collection of short stories, "The Ice at the Bottom of the World." (Mr. Richard will not talk about the terms of the contract, but it was probably a modest one.) Later, with Mr. Jenks's help, he picked up an agent, Georges Borchardt.
Mr. Richard started "Fishboy" a few years after he came to New York. He'd just read "Far Tortuga" by Peter Matthiessen, a novel that inspired him to experiment with a story, written in dialect, about a Caribbean fisherman. Soon he dropped the dialect and changed the locale. But the story wasn't working, so he kept rewriting it. Gradually, a character called Fishboy emerged: "He was a minor character at first, but he was always the one saying something interesting. He said, 'I began as a boy, a human-being boy,' which implied to me that he ended up as something else. But I didn't know what." Fishboy took over the story, and by 1991 the story had evolved into a novel.
At that point, unhappy with the way Knopf had handled his story collection, Mr. Richard began to think about switching publishers. Meanwhile, at a party, he met Nan Talese. She'd read his collection and admired his work. He told her about "Fishboy" and some other projects. A short time later, Ms. Talese called his agent, Mr. Borchardt. After reading the manuscript of "Fishboy" and hearing about Mr. Richard's plans, she offered a three-book contract.
Miami's reading in a small room at Books & Books was packed, but in San Francisco only a handful of people filled the seats. In Seattle, the number grew to 50; then, in Toronto at an arts festival, there were 100. Mr. Richard came home happy, but spent. Who, he wondered, was buying his book? His first night back in his apartment, he walked in his sleep and woke up in his living room.
On Monday, Ms. Talese called with just the right tonic: they were going back to press, she said; from the initial print run of 8,000, only 150 books were left in the warehouse and she was about to order a second printing of 2,500. And there was more. The author had been booked on National Public Radio, the "Fresh Air" show -- 2 million regular listeners at 150 stations around the country, an audience, according to the network's market research, that includes a large number of educated book buyers.
It was Ms. Rusoff who had wangled the gig. The show's host, Terry Gross, rarely interviews fledgling novelists. They tend toward shop talk, said one of the producers, Amy Salit, and nothing can kill a radio show quicker than a disquisition on intertextual analysis. "But Marly called us so many times," she said. "She was so persistent. She sent us reviews. Then Terry read the book and the writing was good. And his personal experience tied into it, so there was something interesting to talk about."
A month after the show, Mr. Richard began a 28-bookstore tour through the South. He flew to Texas, borrowed a 1979 Cadillac Sedan de Ville from an old friend, Dolphin Overton, and set out to sell his book.
As it turned out, he was not the only author to take to the open road last summer. Paul Kafka, the author of "Love Enter" from Houghton Mifflin, visited 62 cities as he logged 18,000 miles in a 1983 Oldsmobile station wagon. And it is likely that others were touring the hinterlands as well.
"They know if they're not out there peddling, the book won't get the attention it deserves," said Leigh Haber, vice president and director of publicity and advertising at Harcourt Brace. "Writers are no longer content to sit by while publishers market their books."
Marly Rusoff had worked with Mr. Richard to plan a trip. (The cost of the two trips, plus postcards, fliers, T-shirts and the like, as well as the cost of local "co-op" ads to promote the readings, and finally 1,100 galley copies sent to independent bookstores across the country -- in short, the cost of promoting "Fishboy" -- came to about $12,000, or $1 a book, which is the industry standard.) They set the schedule, then tried to drum up publicity for each reading by calling ahead to the local newspaper, and to radio and television stations near each bookstore. By the time he was ready to leave, they had managed to marry a number of readings to interviews.
His route took him roughly from Austin, Tex., to Washington. Here and there, he paused to make a few notes, an ad hoc journal of life on the road:
"Out of Kingsville, 72,740 miles on speedometer. . . . Visit to chain-saw art store. . . . Old fat woman abuses child rough-housing pet dog. . . . Tequila on screened porch. . . .
"Good crowd at Europa Books in Austin. Invited to University of Texas to see rare book room, 'Ulysses' manuscript. . . ."
"Stopped in Waco at the What-a-Burger for directions to David Koresh compound. Got T-shirt. . . ."
"Thunderstorm busted reading at Borders in Dallas. Went on call-in talk show. Came after two white supremacists. . . . This guy says, 'I want to know, this Fishboy, is he a fish or a boy? I jus' wish he'd make up his mind'. . . .
"Lake Charles, La. Stayed with Uncle James and Aunt Kitten. Saw alligators in game preserve and stepped on two snakes. . . .'
It is late June, and as Mr. Richard nears Wilmington, N.C. (76,359 miles on the speedometer), Ms. Talese sends him a message. "Warehouse empty," it says. "Going into third printing." He is delighted that 2,500 more copies of his book will be coming off the presses, but tired, melancholy even. At the beginning of the summer, he had said, "I'll do anything to push this into the stores." Now he is finding the whole business a little depressing: "You go to these bookstores and the owners are still hung over from the person they were doing the reading with the night before. At one place a guy asked me, 'When are we going to see your next novel?' I said, 'The way the money's going, sooner than expected.' "
He decides to stay in a down-at-the-heels hotel at Wrightsville Beach outside Wilmington. He needs some time to "decompress," he says, to soak in the surf and stare at the saw grass and myrtle along the dunes. That
night, however, as the Cadillac turns into the parking lot of the Galleria Shopping Plaza and stops in front of Bristol Books, he is still restless. "Bet there will be between three and five people here tonight," he says.
The manager, his wife and four smiling clerks welcome Mr. Richard warmly, not a crapulent eye in the bunch. "Fishboy" and "The Ice at the Bottom of the World" are stacked neatly on a cart by the cash register. The manager steers the author to the front of the room, and soon the air is filled with his story.
A dozen people have settled down to listen, but a tall man with a beard and, apparently, an appetite decides to wander the stacks. Each swing takes him past the refreshment table. He looks at a book on astronomy and wolfs down four cookies; he fingers a book on health and gobbles two pieces of cheese. When the reading is finished, he stops his grazing and wanders over to the cart that holds Mr. Richard's books. He picks up a copy of "Fishboy," eyes the price ($19.95) and puts it back. Then he sees "The Ice at the Bottom of the World" in paperback ($7.95). He takes up the book, finishes off a cracker, and gives the book to Mr. Richard to sign.
After closing, the clerks check the totals: 14 copies of "Fishboy" and 8 copies of "The Ice at the Bottom of the World." For a brief moment, Mark Richard is a best seller.
And on he went through North Carolina. At McIntyres Books in Pittsboro, the reading was packed. He did well in Manteo too, then went to Norfolk, Va. ("I appeared on a television talk show with two anchors who had no idea who I was. On a commercial break, the woman turned to me and said, 'Is this a book about children?' ") Williamsburg was next, then Richmond, Washington and, finally, home.
"Maybe I won't have to do this with the next book," he said, as the fall and his 38th birthday approached. "I really want to go hide somewhere and just do work. I'm done."
But "Fishboy" wasn't. Mr. Richard gave a reading in Iowa City, then went west on an assignment for Esquire, then returned to Virginia for some work with the BBC and some more book promotion. The reviews continued right through September, and in mid-November he read in South Carolina at a national meeting of state arts directors.
Ms. Rusoff calculates that Doubleday has sold, to date, 11,700 copies of "Fishboy" out of the 13,000 that were printed. Mr. Richard's little book has had a good "sell-through," as they say in the trade. In other words, it is being read. And this June, when Anchor Books publishes "Fishboy" in paperback, his readership is likely to grow.
His agent was "pleased," but cautious. Mr. Richard was "pointed in the right direction," but he still had a lot of work ahead of him, said Georges Borchardt. "After all, he's only written two books."
His publicist was "extremely" pleased. "If it's not the beginning of a successful career," Ms. Rusoff said with a wink, "then it's the beginning of a cult."
His editor was characteristically ebullient. With "literary first fiction," Ms. Talese said, "huge numbers are not as important as committed readers."
It appeared to be a case of commerce and culture serving each other. The company probably made a little money and brought a promising writer into its fold. For his part, the author found a home and began to woo an audience for his work.
The example of Mark Richard and "Fishboy" would delight a cultural deconstructionist: its conclusions are inconclusive and contradictory.
Critics in the industry say that for every "Fishboy," there are probably dozens of failures -- books that get no reviews, that don't even sell out their first printings. And many editors worry, with good reason, that the economics of the business and the unchecked cupidity of the conglomerateers have turned American publishing into a vast counting house that has long since lost the spirit of art and ideas. "The heads of publishing companies have never been literary idealists," said Edward Burlingame, who for many years had his own imprint at HarperCollins. "They wanted to make money, but they wanted respect, to contribute to the culture. Now it's, 'What's the profit?' "
Boosters in the industry dismiss the requiems and wax romantic about the creative spirit. They insist that in a quiet corner of many houses there is at least one editor agitating for literature. The optimists have faith that no matter how avaricious the age, literature will endure. "Good writers," said Deborah Futter, an editor at Doubleday, "will keep writing even if success eludes them because they feel compelled to write."
That may be true, or it may be what editors tell themselves before they send yet another first novel out to the stores.
Mark Richard is working on a second novel now -- "Babyhead," a political satire set in the South. Like most writers, he is not inclined to discuss a work in progress. All he will say is that compared with "Fishboy," it is "more grounded." One wonders: Is he still as bold, as adventurous when he's turning out his sentences? Or has a hard summer hustling his book persuaded him to stick his nose in the wind before he sits down to write?

COCAINE TRUE COCAINE BLUE

 ON June 2, 1884, Sigmund Freud sent what was for him a salacious letter to his fiancee, Martha Bernays. "Woe to you, my Princess, when I come," he wrote. "I will kiss you quite red and feed you till you are plump. And if you are froward, you shall see who is the stronger, a gentle little girl who doesn't eat enough or a big wild man who has cocaine in his body."
Freud was 28 years old, in love with Martha and under the spell of cocaine. His first scientific paper, "Uber Coca" ("About Cocaine"), also published in 1884, gushed about the drug as if it were fire stolen from the gods. Cocaine, Freud said, was good for all that ailed us, including fatigue, asthma, indigestion, emaciation, morphine addiction, alcoholism, depression, autism and especially lack of sexual appetite. When a rival psychiatrist described cocaine as the "third scourge of mankind" (morphine and alcohol being scourges No. 1 and 2), Freud leapt to his baby's defense, vigorously denying that the drug was dangerous or habit-forming.
Freud was wrong. Cocaine, particularly the smokable form, crack, offers one of the most dangerous addictions known to man: heart attacks, stroke, seizures and arrhythmia are common. Long-term use leads to cocaine psychosis, a bizarre state of being in which body and mind are rapidly destroyed. Cocaine psychotics get horrendous sores from picking at the imaginary insects they feel beneath their skins and may even poison themselves by spraying their wounds with bug killer. Cocaine psychotics are also acutely paranoid, obsessed with the idea that they are being watched and plotted against. Heroin addicts do us the favor of nodding off to sleep; cocaine psychotics are hyperactive beyond control. Even weekend binges have ominous effects on brain chemistry. The afterword to "Cocaine True Cocaine Blue" tells us that a quarter of those who die in traffic accidents in New York City have used cocaine within 48 hours of death. Those who killed themselves with guns are said to be twice as likely to have used cocaine as those who killed themselves by other means.
The view that cocaine was a harmless pick-me-up -- a candy for the nose -- dominated popular consciousness for nearly a century after "Uber Coca." As recently as 17 years ago, in a song about cocaine, the rock guitarist Eric Clapton repeated Freud's praises virtually unchanged: "If you got bad news, you wanna kick them blues, cocaine / When your day is done and you wanna run, cocaine / . . . If your thing is gone, and you wanna ride on, cocaine . . ./ She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie, cocaine." But that was 1977, before cheap, smokable and super-addictive crack invaded America's cities. By now Mr. Clapton's song seems almost grotesquely lighthearted.
America is dancing to the tune of cocaine. Prostitutes trade sex for it, drug warriors murder for it, and parents surrender homes and children for it. An entire generation is being sacrificed to it.
"Cocaine True Cocaine Blue," by the photographer and journalist Eugene Richards, is a record of the carnage as it is carried out in North Philadelphia, the East New York section of Brooklyn and the Red Hook housing project, also in Brooklyn. Mr. Richards studied with the photographer Minor White and went on to a distinguished career of his own. Like most of his kind, Mr. Richards is a voyeur, obsessed with the grisly. He is a master of the brutal image, though his is a cold, distant brutality that whispers instead of shouting. Though he is primarily a photographer, his works cannot be called picture books. He arranges his images to make what amount to visual novels, which he augments with pungent stretches of reflection, dialogue or description.
Notable among his accomplishments is "Exploding Into Life," a book that documents the mastectomy and eventual death by cancer of his lover, Dorothea Lynch. But the book on which his reputation rests -- and in
which his taste for the grisly is most clearly seen -- is "The Knife and Gun Club," a record of a tour of duty in a Denver emergency room. He first visited it on assignment for a magazine. "I saw cuts, burns, broken limbs, heart attacks, and then, what's inside the human body," he writes. "When a man's chest was cracked, I saw his heart floating in the pool of blood like a drowned puppy." One suspects that the "drowned puppy" seduced him. His assignment completed, he stayed on taking pictures until the hospital's management asked him to leave. If they had let him, he'd probably have stayed forever.
"Cocaine True Cocaine Blue" takes its title from the popular notion that cocaine brings with it a transcendent reality. The book jacket shows a close-up of a woman named Mariella, a wild-eyed addict clenching a hypodermic needle between partly toothless jaws. Take note of the needle; it could well be one of those that Mr. Richards says he bought Mariella because the ones she owned were too dull for proper use. Note also that Mr. Richards smoked his share of crack to get a feel for the subject.
The pictures in the book show Mariella's fellow addicts in various states of depravity, shooting up cocaine or smoking it on rooftops and in basement drug dens. The most lurid one shows a prostitute preparing to perform fellatio, presumably for crack money, while her toddler clings to her back. (Fortuitously or by plan, the scene of "The John, the Mother and the Child" is bracketed by pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. on the wall behind them.) Riding herd over the dissolute, the dead and the dying are young men with guns who run the street trade and who are themselves on the fast track, bound for the grave.
THE photographs are sensational enough, but the only thing that's new in them is crack. For 30 years, Americans have been treated to pictures of addicts shooting up, of young men wielding guns, of prostitutes plying their trade, nearly always with black folks as the subjects. What makes this book stunning is the text that attends the pictures. Mr. Richards and the reporter Edward Barnes do an extraordinary job of bringing us what the camera cannot. The voices of the addicts and their families come through in high fidelity; the narrative is icy and clear. The methodical accretion of detail reminds one of the lawyerly poet Charles Reznikoff.
No photograph could match this scene of the crack den: "Their basement apartment resembled a military bunker or a bomb shelter. There were no windows. The entryway was seven steep, narrow stairs below the sidewalk. . . . You stepped down through a storm door, then a second sturdier door into a kitchen, which was airless and dark, lit only by a trembling, dying fluorescent tube. Almost every night the users who huddled there created piles of litter, burnt matches, bloody cotton balls, scraps of toilet paper, bent needles. This morning, because it was still early, the table was swept clean."
Listen to Rita, who cares for her grandchildren because their mother, Joyce, is lost in crack: "I cry. I walk the floor. I cry. Joyce is gone . . . this generation is gone. . . . There is no more neighborhood here. I don't do coke, but now I dance to the music of drugs too. My grandkids, I tell them I sell weed. 'It's not the right thing to do, but Grandma has to take care of you, because the welfare check will not.' I explain this is how they get to private school, to keep them out the public school. It costs me $1,780 a year to get my grandson into a Christian private school. Same thing with my granddaughter.
"So who's left out here on the streets with me? My grandmother used to have a saying that when hell full up, the dead will walk the earth. We're seein' it now. They are the dead. Look at 'em."
Here's the last word from an addict named Joe: "What keeps you from dying is you run out of money."
Reading and looking, I couldn't help wonder: why are nearly all of the people in these photographs black? The vast majority of drug addicts in America are white. This could be said of any phenomenon in the United States, of course, but why is the white aspect of drug addiction so consistently invisible?
The drugs that flood impoverished neighborhoods certainly don't originate there. Where are the faces of those who import them, the well-to-do chemists who earn piles of money by turning out the product? Couldn't Mr. Richards have found a setting where most or at least half of the drug addicts were white? The Hartford Courant did, in "Streets of Despair," its series two years ago about drug addiction in its city. Courant staff members say that readers were surprised to see that 70 percent of the addicts depicted were white. Bombarded for years with images of black depravity, they had come to believe that drug addiction was a black problem exclusively.
I'm not alone in wondering why nearly all Mr. Richards's addicts are black. African-Americans in New York were incensed when some of these pictures appeared in December in the pages of The New York Times Magazine. A small demonstration was staged at The Times's door.
The book's afterword anticipates the criticism, but the attempt to dismiss it fails: Dr. Stephen W. Nicholas, an AIDS specialist at Harlem Hospital in New York, urges readers not to accuse Mr. Richards of "reinforcing negative images of the urban poor" or discounting the effects of joblessness and economic decline. Dr. Nicholas suggests that the photographs force us to "understand something about the degenerative relationship between drug addiction and poverty." But that's impossible. Photographs can shock and dismay, but are useless to explain such complicated matters as economic decline.
Dr. Nicholas tells us that throughout America, about half of all men and women who are arrested have cocaine in their urine. Certainly drugs are a scourge in the African-American community. I am not asking for equal-opportunity representation of drug abuse. Nor am I saying that Mr. Richards should have written a different book. The point is larger than that. When the culture focuses on black addiction alone, we miss the breadth of the danger and confine the problem to "those people" over there.
"Cocaine True Cocaine Blue" will invariably be spoken of in Dantesque terms. But understand that the lowest reaches of hell are reserved, not for addicts, but for the tortured souls of drug traffickers. Not the two-bit dealers who pedal five-dollar bags until their heads get blown off, but the Colombian drug lords and Mafia princes who command murder, addiction and misery on a monstrous scale. The deepest reaches of hell in the 1990's would be home to the soul of the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar Gaviria who, until his assassination last December, was one of the most successful cocaine producers in the world. Places next to Escobar would be held ready for law enforcement officials who were sworn to thwart the drug trade but abetted it instead.
"Cocaine True Cocaine Blue" is a powerful concoction. One of the things it shows is that pictures can't tell it all.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: THE HUB;
Police Academy Fades Away

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
The Koch administration announced it in early 1989 as the anchor of an ambitious plan to revitalize the South Bronx. The Dinkins administration delayed it, because of concerns about its cost.
Now, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has announced that the construction of a new eight-story police academy just southeast of Yankee Stadium at 153d Street and Park Avenue will be scrapped altogether to help close the city's $2.3 billion budget gap. 
 The decision, included in the Mayor's preliminary financial plan unveiled last week, surprised many Bronx officials who had counted on the $247 million project for years, not only to create as many as 400 construction jobs but also to foster a new law-and-order image for the bustling commercial area known as the Hub.
Borough President Fernando Ferrer said he first learned the project was in jeopardy on Jan. 28, when a reporter called to ask about rumors that Mr. Giuliani planned to table the project in favor of a $50 million renovation of the existing academy near Gramercy Park.
Cristyne Lategano, a spokeswoman for the Mayor, said it would have been impossible to call every office for which cuts were being planned. "When you get less than a month to put together a budget plan, not every category is going to be defined until maybe a day before the plan comes out," she said.
Mr. Ferrer said he and several business leaders did not plan to let the project go without a fight. "It's something the Bronx has waited very patiently for for several years," he said. "This was to be the Bronx's turn."
He cited the construction of the $1 billion Metrotech Center office complex in downtown Brooklyn and the 50-story Citicorp Tower in Long Island City, Queens.
"If you think about the price tags on all those projects," he said, "we were pikers by comparison."
The academy was to be built on the outskirts of an area that after more than 25 years of decline, is rebounding with new housing development that is, in turn, attracting new merchants and businesses.
Joseph Wuensch, the Police Department's deputy commissioner for management and budget, said he was disappointed that the academy would have to make do with its present building, which is overcrowded.
"But we're pragmatists," Mr. Wuensch said. "We understand the nature and severity of the reductions. If the city came back and said, 'We have additional resources. What would you recommend?' I'll tell you that a new building is No. 1 on our list."
Richard A. Kahan, chairman of the steering committee for the Bronx Center, a major redevelopment plan in the South Bronx that includes more than 2,000 new units of mixed-income housing, said he believed that the academy would eventually be built.
"This is something that has survived two administrations," Mr. Kahan said. "We're going to make every effort humanly possible to convince the Mayor not to do this. It's that critical, not just to the Bronx but to the city of New York." RANDY KENNEDY

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: THE HUB;
A Multicultural Marketplace With Health Care Upstairs

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Hoping to build on a nascent increase in housing and commerce in the bleak neighborhood surrounding the Hub, city officials have given a development company conditional approval for an international marketplace at 149th Street between Brook and Bergen Avenues.
Envisioned as the centerpiece of a plan to transform 100,000 square feet of city-owned lots that have been vacant since the late 1970's, the marketplace would be a two-story building with restaurants, food stores and kiosks on the ground floor and a walk-in health clinic above, said one of the developers, Daniel Gerard. 
 Mr. Gerard, who is also involved in a commercial redevelopment project in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that is scheduled to get under way in the fall, said he and three other builders had been watching the Hub with interest for years.
"It's an area that looks kind of daunting to some people, especially to some retailers," he said. "It still has such a stigma attached to it. But frankly, we think the South Bronx has been coming back. It's just a great time to get involved."
Conditional approval means that the developers will be in negotiations with the city's Economic Development Corporation for several more months about the final shape of the marketplace. The developers have also just begun to try to attract merchants to the site.
But Mr. Gerard and another partner, Jeffrey Stern, who is also involved in the Bushwick project, said their initial plans were in keeping with what the city wants -- a sleek, interior mall on the triangular 56,000 square-foot lot, with businesses representative of the neighborhood's diverse culture.
"Right now, we're thinking about Caribbean food, Haitian, Jamaican, Afghani," Mr. Gerard said. "The possibilities are quite exciting." R.K.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Debates Quake Aid for Illegal Aliens

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 5

 BODY:
As the city struggles to pull itself together after last month's earthquake, its social fissures have re-emerged in an angry debate over whether relief aid should be provided to illegal immigrants.
Coming on the heels of a proposal by Gov. Pete Wilson to deny health and education benefits to undocumented aliens as one way to cope with the state's lingering economic slump, advocates for immigrants are complaining that these residents are again being made scapegoats for widespread hardships in a time of trouble. 
 But such restrictions are receiving considerable public and political support in a time of economic distress and tight budgets. In Washington, the House Appropriations Committee passed a measure that would permit emergency relief to illegal immigrants, but would also deny them 18-month housing vouchers being issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other long-term aid.
 
Conflicting Feelings
 "My heart goes out to them, and I'm not in any way trying to bash them," said Representative Ron Packard, Republican of California, who sponsored the amendment. "But when it comes to the spending of taxpayers' dollars, I cannot turn my head and treat undocumented aliens like citizens."
The Census Bureau has estimated that there are about 1.3 million illegal immigrants in California, most of them from Mexico, and in recent months Democrats and Republicans have spoken out for curbs on their continued entry. The two Democratic Senators, Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, have offered proposals to tighten controls on the porous, 2,000-mile border.
Supporting the thrust of the amendment to the aid bill, Senator Feinstein said, "I'm one who believes that emergency help such as food and clothing should be provided to all victims, but that Section 8 vouchers, with a rent subsidy for 18 months, and small-business loans and grants, should be reserved for legal residents."
Opponents of such restrictions say they may be largely symbolic, since illegal immigrants are not eligible for Small Business Administration loans and considerable documentation is already needed for the housing vouchers. They say there is no straightforward way to check on legal residence and that efforts to do so will create a bureaucratic bottleneck.
 
An Ugly Symbol
 And as a symbolic act, they say, the message of the restrictions is ugly, painting a nation that has been generous with disaster aid around the world as petty and miserly when people within its own borders are in need.
"What kind of message does it send when we're trying to segregate earthquake victims?" asked City Councilman Richard Alarcon, a Democrat. Charles Wheeler, the directing attorney of the National Immigration Law Center, said the notion of imposing controls in the midst of a disaster was fraught with technical problems.
For one, there is the question of how to treat the many undocumented residents whose American-born children are citizens. Mr. Wheeler said immigration requirements might frighten many illegal aliens away from applying for emergency assistance.
Even Republican city officials, who are dealing with the day-to-day hardships wrought by the earthquake, oppose the requirements because of the added problems they would create.
 
'Bureaucratic Nightmare'
 Noting the nation's continuing difficulties with trying to control illegal immigration, Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican, said in a letter opposing earthquake-aid restrictions that the restrictions would create a "bureaucratic nightmare" for Federal, state and local agencies, as well as for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Laura Chick, a Republican City Councilwoman from one of the hardest-hit areas in the San Fernando Valley, said that while she favored controls on immigration there was "no system in place today to allow for people to be identified as legal citizens."
"It's a process that has to be put in place, but a disaster is not the time to do it," she said.
 
Debate in the Lines
 The debate over assistance was similarly lively in the long lines awaiting disaster relief.
"We all work hard, but now they don't want to give us anything," said Maria Elena Sauledo, a 22-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico who shared a government shelter with 19 other relatives. The men of the family work in gardening and landscaping, while the women sew clothing part-time for garment factories. "We are all human beings," she said, as her mother-in-law cradled Mrs. Sauledo's infant, an American citizen. "We all have rights. Everybody needs help."
Laura Bahena, an illegal immigrant who said she had moved here after a 1985 earthquake that devastated parts of Mexico City, called the talk of restrictions racist. "The earthquake did not ask for paperwork," she said.
But Phyllis Holliman, 23, who is unemployed and now homeless after the earthquake, voiced what seemed to be the prevailing sentiment as she waited for food. "L.A. is just too overcrowded," she said. "I know it's hard where they come from, but they're making it hard for us. We can't get jobs."

HEADLINE: North Korea's Huge Military Spurs New Strategy in South

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON with DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
While the world is focused on North Korea's program to develop nuclearweapons, an equally serious buildup in conventional troops and equipment in the North has prompted United States military commanders to overhaul their plans fordefending South Korea.
 Over the last year, North Korea has used its huge array of artillery andtroops near the heavily fortified border to try to intimidate the United States and its Asian allies from dealing too sternly with it on its nuclear weaponsplans. 
As recently as Thursday, the state-run North Korean press agency issued one of its most explicit warnings, saying: "The United States must not miscalculate our will and determination nor underestimate our might. It had better behavewith discretion, knowing well our people and People's Army."
 
A Revised Approach
 Despite the bombast, American military commanders both in the Pacific and inWashington, say that the combination of the North's nuclear program,conventional arms buildup and concentration of forces close to Seoul and to the South's vital economic centers has made Pyongyang the paramount threat for thePentagon.
 "North Korea will be the critical, major military threat for the next fewyears," said Lieut. Gen. James R. Clapper, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
 That threat, and other military and political developments, have led Americancommanders to revise their approach in the event of a North Korean attack on theSouth.
 Rather than simply driving the North's troops from South Korea, the new plan provides for a fierce counteroffensive intended to seize the North's capital,Pyongyang, and try to topple the Government of Kim Il Sung, American officialssaid.
 The Administration has also confirmed it is planning to send Patriotantimissile systems to help protect South Korean airfields and ports from North Korean missiles. The commander of American forces in Korea, Gen. Gary E. Luck,has requested still other steps in the event that the negotiations overinspections of the North's nuclear sites break down and Washington and itsallies impose economic sanctions. The North has said it would consider sanctionsan "act of war."
 
Diplomatic Initiative Urged
 Even if the nuclear issue were settled and the immediate crisis defused, thethreat to the South would remain.
 Reflecting this concern, the Pentagon is pressing for a new diplomaticinitiative to persuade Pyongyang to move its artillery and forces back from the front lines in exchange for diplomatic recognition.
 But despite Washington's planning, the steadily expanding threat has led to abroad debate over whether the Clinton Administration is being forceful enoughwith the North Koreans and is taking adequate military precautions.
 Brent Scowcroft, who was national security adviser to President George Bush, said he thought that Washington should consider moving an aircraft carrier tothe region and deploying more Air Force fighter planes there.
 "I would be ostentatiously strengthening my position," he said.
 
The North's Power
Allied Forces Outnumbered 2 to 1
 Like the balance of Western and Warsaw Pact forces in the cold war, thedeployments on both sides of the Korean divide have as much political asmilitary significance.
 Much of the North Korean force consists of aging weapons, but with a strengthof 1.2 million, the North Korean military is enormous and outnumbers the allied forces in South Korea by about two to one.
 In recent months, North Korea has taken steps to camouflage the planes itwould use to drop commandos behind American and South Korean lines in a war and has increased to 47 from 5 the number of antiaircraft guns around its Yongbyong nuclear installation.
 The North, which already has Scud and Frog missiles, is also trying to expandits missile power. Last May, it tested its new medium-range Rodong missile offthe Japanese coast. The Rodong is intended to have the ability to strike westernJapan. According to intelligence reports, the North Koreans may also be tryingto develop an even larger missile with a range of 1,800 miles, although theevidence is fragmentary.
 
On the South's Doorstep
 More important, over the last several years the North has positioned much ofits striking power virtually on South Korea's doorstep. According to intelligence officials, North Korea has stationed more than 8,400 artillery pieces and 2,400 multiple rocket launchers within 60 miles of the border. The demilitarized zone is marked by minefields, tank traps and observation posts, and much of the artillery is so close to the zone that Seoul, which is about 30 miles from the border, is within firing range. A recent visit to the heavily guarded border evoked memories of some of the toughest fighting the American military has ever faced.
 The North Korean military has its weaknesses. Some Pentagon officials say that fuel shortages have limited large-scale training, and they question whether North Korean commanders could effectively coordinate such an attack in the face of allied air superiority.
 The United States has stationed five advanced radar tracking systems in South Korea to pinpoint North Korean artillery fire and would also use spotter planes to direct air strikes.
 Still, because so much of the North's artillery and other forces are already close to the border, American and South Korean forces might have as little as 24 to 76 hours warning of an attack, an American military official said.
 The American high command says that in the event of a war, the North Korean military strategy would be to thrust deep into South Korea in an attempt to seize the entire peninsula before reinforcements arrived.
 
20 Tunnels Believed Built
 Along the demilitarized zone, North Korea's artillery would fire a barrage to dislodge the defenders and sow confusion and panic in Seoul in the hope that refugees would clog the roads and prevent allied reinforcements from reaching the front.
 As the bombardment continued, infiltrators would try to sneak through the 20-odd tunnels the North is believed to have dug beneath the demilitarized zone, some of which have been discovered and sealed in recent years. Infantry units would try to create gaps in the defense. Then armored forces would try to burst through the American and South Korean defenses.
 Meanwhile, North Korea would try to place commando units in the rear areas of the South in helicopters, small boats and the North's fleet of mini-submarines, and fire missiles at airfields and ports that the United States would use to reinforce its troops. American intelligence estimates that the North has almost 100,000 special forces.
 "This is a front-loaded attack plan organized to propel the invasion into the heart of the Republic of Korea," Gen. Robert W. RisCassi, the former commander of American and South Korean forces, said of the North's battle plan.
 
The South's Defenses
Vital Areas Face Devastating Attack
 Preparations to foil a North Korean attack are part of everyday life in South Korea. Specially designed concrete overpasses span critical highways. If the North launched an offensive, the South Koreans would set off explosives to collapse the overpasses so that huge chunks of concrete would block the attack routes. Other stretches of highway have been cleared of dividers and posts so that they can be used as runways by allied planes.
 While the ability to repel a North Korean attack has been a matter of considerable debate within the Pentagon, the dominant view is that it would only be a matter of time before an invading North Korean Army would be routed in the face of more superior allied forces.
 But it would be virtually impossible to prevent North Korea from destroying much of the heavily populated and economically vital South Korean territory near the border, senior American officials say.
 A ranking Pentagon official said war games indicated that a war would inflict hundreds of thousands of casualties on each side, not including civilians, and would probably last three to four months.
 "You are talking about a very bloody, largely ground war," he said.
 Nonetheless, the American military has sought to improve its ability to deter an attack and limit the damage if one should occur.
 
New Army Doctrine
 Developed by General RisCassi and refined by his successor, General Luck, the American military's new plan for the defense of South Korea reflects some important changes.
 Drawing on the experience of the Persian Gulf war, in which the United States sent in its best armored and air units instead of husbanding them in case trouble broke out elsewhere, the military has revised the list of reinforcements.
 The timely dispatch of reinforcements would be critical since the United States has only about 35,000 troops in Korea. Only one of the three Air Force squadrons there is equipped with a special targeting pod that allows pilots to fight effectively at night and to deliver laser-guided "smart" bombs.
 The plan also embodies the new Army doctrine, which emphasizes aggressive counteroffensives instead of static defenses. Under the five-phase plan, the American and South Korean force would try to slow Pyongyang's ground assault north of Seoul, buy time while reinforcements pour in, and then repulse the invaders. But the major change is in the next step of the contingency plan: American and South Korean forces would cross into North Korea after beating back the North's forces and occupy Pyongyang.
 "It would be unconscionable if there was not some penalty for starting a war," a senior American officer said. "The aggressor should not be able to get off scot-free in the sense of loss of territory."
 In developing the plan, American officials studied the Korean War, where Gen. Douglas MacArthur's march to the Yalu River induced the Chinese to intervene in the fighting. But planners concluded that American-Chinese relations had improved so much since then, and North Korean relations with China had so soured, that Beijing would not intervene now.
 
A Go-Slow Approach
 Still, with an eye to Chinese sensitivities, the Pentagon has not decided whether American forces should go much farther north than Pyongyang or whether the allies would pursue if the Government fled toward the Yalu, asenior Administration official said.
 President Clinton met with Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the departing Secretary of Defense Les Aspin to discuss Korea. A senior official said the new plan was not the main order of business but was discussed. The United States, however, is only one part of the equation.
 South Korea, which has 655,000 troops, has advocated a go-slow approach on the nuclear issue, hoping to avoid a military confrontation. But if a war broke out it would be so devastating that the South Koreans would be unlikely to settle for the restoration of lost territory, Western diplomats say.
 "Whether American forces crossed the border or not is irrelevant," a senior Western diplomat in Seoul said. "The fact is that there would be no stopping the South Koreans."
 
The U.S. Role
Is Administration Doing Enough?
 The immediate issue is not whether war would damage the South, but whether the Clinton Administration is making adequate military preparations to dissuade the North from attacking and to defeat it if it does.
 Reflecting the Administration's caution, Adm. Charles Larson, the commander of American forces in the Pacific, said Washington should move deliberately to strengthen its military forces if sanctions were imposed.
 "You get into a fine balance that certain things you could do could also be provocative," Admiral Larson said in an interview at his headquarters in Hawaii.
 "So it would be very important to raise our levels of readiness and, by and large, have most of it be in the benign category," he added. "Where we go from there depends on their reaction."
 
Bigger Intelligence Effort
 After some delay, the White House has agreed in principle to a request from General Luck to dispatch Patriot antimissile systems to South Korea, but it has yet to send them.
 The United States has also increased intelligence efforts and is following through with earlier plans to dispatch Apache attack helicopters and a new Army surface-to-surface missile to South Korea. According to a senior Pentagon official, some new types of munitions have been quietly moved into the region in recent months.
 General Luck has also requested other military steps in the event that the Administration seeks economic sanctions.
 Publicly, the Clinton Administration has not ruled out a preemptive attack on North Korea's nuclear installations. But fearful of the North Korean ability to destroy Seoul, and with no firm intelligence on where Pyongyang may have hidden a bomb, senior Pentagon officials maintain such a raid would be fraught with risk.
 But outside the Clinton Administration there is considerable debate about Washington's approach. Some former Bush Administration officials assert that Washington is right to offer North Korea economic and political benefits for giving up its nuclear program but argue that the Clinton Administration should be taking more military steps to strengthen the United States hand in the negotiations, protect American forces against an attack and keep open the option of a preemptive attack against the North's nuclear installations, a move they say would prevent the North from producing more plutonium for nuclear bombs.
 As tense as the situation is now, it will become worse if it becomes clear that the North has developed nuclear weapons, as most American intelligence agencies believe.
 "Everybody says we might do something that makes them attack. But we should not behave in a way that signals to the North Koreans that we are afraid of our own shadow," Mr. Scowcroft said. "If the situation is serious enough that they are contemplating an attack, it is better that we find that out before, rather than after, they have nuclear weapons."

HEADLINE: Nuclear Roots Grow Into an Argentine Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: LLAO LLAO, Argentina

 BODY:
TUCKED into a dense stand of evergreens, a group of low, whitewashed buildings with corrugated metal roofs give little indication of the activities within. Maybe a conservation group. Maybe a national park office. The only clue is the parabolic dish on top of a red-and-white radio tower.
But inside the shaded compound, an elite team of Argentina's electronic and nuclear engineers are working, not exactly secretively, but with a very low profile. In newly built "clean rooms," their primary project is a $7 million research satellite for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States, to be launched in mid-1995. 
 Some 15 miles east, in the city of Bariloche, inside a two-story sandstone-colored building that looks like a home, computer programmers are working on robotics and software for just-in-time manufacturing, as well as designing small but highly advanced nuclear reactors. There are no signs outside the structure to indicate the advanced work within.
These are the offices of Invap S.E., Argentina's tiny version of a Silicon Valley company. It has 300 employees and sales of no more than $40 million a year. Its shareholders are the provincial Government of Rio Negro and the Argentine Government through the National Atomic Energy Commission.
Though tiny compared with leading international high-tech companies, Invap has found that in certain market niches -- like building small research reactors -- it can compete with international giants like General Atomics of San Diego and Babcock & Wilcox of New Orleans.
The project with NASA, the first time a satellite has been built in Argentina, is providing training for Argentine engineers and transfers of American technology that would have been impossible just four years ago, because Argentina was considered a threat to nuclear proliferation.
"We are mainly nuclear engineers and physicists, and what the people from NASA told us was that they were surprised how quickly our engineers switched into space technology," said Hector E. Otheguy, general and technical manager of Invap. "Though small, we find that at least in some areas we can compete."
In the first part of this century, Argentina was among the world's richest nations, yet today it has only a tiny home-grown technological capacity. Its failure to keep up is sobering testimony to decades of intense nationalism, isolation from the industrialized world and association with often unstable third-world governments. Argentina developed its own reactor technology -- and thus the potential to build an atomic bomb -- as far back as the 1960's, through its atomic research center in Bariloche. But from the start it refused to let international monitoring agencies inspect its operations.
Successive Governments argued that permitting international controls was the equivalent of giving the industrialized world the right to manipulate the nation's technological future and its growth.
In many ways, Invap was one of the main instruments for Argentina's nuclear program. Founded in the early 1970's by scientists from the atomic center to use the technology they had developed, Invap, under the guidance of the National Atomic Energy Commission, built small reactors for third-world countries like Algeria, Peru and Iran, as well as for the Argentine Government itself.
MOST of the work was done in almost total secrecy, including a uranium enrichment plant 40 miles east of Bariloche, begun in the early 1980's to supply Argentina's research reactors with fuel in case the international community cut off supplies. The plant, which has cost the Government $300 million, places Argentina among a select group of nine countries that have the capacity, at least in theory, to enrich uranium to a grade that nearly approaches that used in bombs.
Although its nuclear program was remarkably advanced compared with those of most third-world countries, Argentina found itself on a list of nations prohibited from receiving transfers of new computer and electronic technology. The prohibition stemmed from an effort to stop proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
That has changed, however, under the Government of President Carlos Saul Menem, who has opened all of the country's nuclear operations to international controls and inspection, and renounced nuclear proliferation.
For Invap, it has meant drastic changes -- in particular, shedding its tradition of secrecy -- as well as a brush with near-bankruptcy two years ago.
IN the mid-1980's, Invap signed a contract with Iran to build a purification plant for enriched uranium. Under a second contract, a pilot plant was to be built that would produce fuel rods for Iranian research reactors.
In late 1991, when its first shipment of equipment was ready to leave port, the company received instructions from the Foreign Ministry -- at Washington's request -- to halt it. The reasoning was that Iran, though it had signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, was a potentially unreliable signatory that at any time could decide to develop nuclear weapons. Breaking the contracts meant a loss of $25 million in income.
"It was a blow for Invap, and we didn't know if we could recover from it," Thomas Buch, an official of the company, said. "We were shipping things we bought off the shelf -- tubing, valves, lathes -- and argued they in themselves did not contribute to proliferation. But the Foreign Ministry reasoned that anything that increased Iran's capacity to develop nuclear weapons should be stopped."
Since those bleak first months, the company seems to have more than recovered.
In addition to being given the contract with NASA, many say as American compensation for having broken the two Iranian contracts, it has won a $60 million deal to build a research reactor in Cairo and is on the short list of finalists for an even larger reactor for the Government of Thailand; two of its competitors for the Thai deal are General Atomics and Babcock & Wilcox.
In addition, informal talks are under way with General Atomics on joint ventures.
Invap is considering taking the design of its small-reactor technology even further. With Argentina's explosive economic growth over the last three years, and anticipation of continuing growth through much of the decade, the country's electrical power needs could almost double over the next decade.
While Invap does not pretend to build giant nuclear power stations with the capacity of 600 to 700 megawatts, it is working on designs for small plants in the 25-to-50-megawatt range. The smaller plants could be built in much less time -- about two years -- eventually using a type of assembly-line technique if enough were built. That would allow greater economies and enable nuclear power to compete in price with gas and hydroelectric plants.
Jorge Marticorena, former president of Invap, argues that not only do the smaller plants use simpler cooling technologies and are thus safer, but that Argentina would be using its large uranium reserves as well as its home-grown high-tech know-how.
"It cost us a lot politically and economically to get where we are, and it makes sense to use the technology we have developed here in Argentina," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 6, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 6 about Invap S.E. incorrectly described the company's relationship with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Invap is not building a satellite for NASA; it is building one with the help of NASA engineers for the Argentine Government. The article also mistakenly included Iran among countries for which Invap has built experimental nuclear reactors; it has built no such reactor for Iran. The article also described incorrectly the type of purification plant Invap built for Iran; the plant purifies uranium, not enriched uranium.

HEADLINE: 10 Men Put 300 Years at I.B.M. to Use

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
IS there life after I.B.M.? Yes, say 10 former I.B.M. executives who together have had almost 300 years of experience at International Business Machines. Now they have joined forces and built a business of their own.
Their business, Multinational Market Services Group, is a high-tech marketing-consulting concern in White Plains specializing in helping companies anticipate and manage market changes, said Stanley Freid, the 65-year-old founder of the group who during his 31 years at I.B.M. held positions ranging from international business manager to senior manager of direct marketing. 
 In explaining how the company came into being, Mr. Freid said the idea came to him when he was taking a course given by an outplacement company.
"The outplacement perk was part of my retirement package from I.B.M.," he said. "I took early retirement in 1988 but only after I agonized over it for three months. I felt I was too young and had too many good ideas to retire. But at the time, I.B.M. was offering us such a great financial package it was hard to resist it."
Mr. Freid said he began talking to other I.B.M. executives with extensive international experience, all of whom were in their 50's and 60's and were taking early retirement.
 
Traveling the World
 "When I queried everyone I knew in the same position as I was and found out all of them were planning to do something after retiring, I thought we could forge an innovative team," he said. "In the 31 years I spent at I.B.M., for instance, I had had 9 different careers. The others also had multiple careers. I.B.M. was a great college and training ground for all of us. We had a lot of autonomy. Yet, all of us were curious and anxious to test our theories and our skills in the real world."
One member of the group, Victor Wakefield, 67, a native of Britain, started his career with I.B.M. in his homeland in 1960, managing market research.
"I was asked to come to the United States in 1967," Mr. Wakefield recalled, "and since 1967, I had five different careers with I.B.M. -- in market research, new business opportunities -- and all of them in I.B.M.'s World Trade Corporation." He added that he traveled the world over for I.B.M., setting up international inventory management systems. "I made more than 50 lengthy trips abroad in 25 years, literally touring the Pacific Rim for weeks at a time. It really was a lot of fun, and fascinating, and I wasn't keen on retiring. But in 1988, I.B.M. made me such a good offer I felt I had to take it, and I took the package."
Mr. Wakefield said that at that point he and his wife, Celia, decided to go back to Britain.
"But when we got there, we found that Britain had changed, or maybe it was we who had changed," he said. "So we came back to Chappaqua and decided to become American citizens. I started examining a number of proposals. I felt I had amassed so much knowledge during my career with I.B.M. that I should really do something with it."
 
Experience and Flexibility
 One of the things Mr. Wakefield did was start a time-management business with his wife, designed to teach people how to achieve greater efficiency. Another was to go back as an outsider to I.B.M., to run a two-day seminar on international inventory management for sales executives.
"I gave the seminars a couple of times and what became clear to me is that in the wake of downsizing, corporations are going to call more and more on the service of outside consultants to replace managers that have gone," he said.
"So I liked Stan's concept from the beginning. As consultants, we are a large enough group to have in-depth experience and knowledge, and we are small enough to be flexible and move fast, which is very important in today's economic climate. Collectively, our track record covers successful projects in over 100 foreign companies as well as projects here in the United States, so we have a global perspective and a worldwide network of contacts at our disposal."
Very little capital was needed to establish the multinational group, Mr. Freid said. "We also added other professionals including my wife, Constance. Constance was formerly director of economic development for Westchester County, and she played a key role in forming the Westchester Business Partnership."
 
Sensing Customer Fickleness
 Emphasizing that helping clients build competitive strategies starts with the premise that everything begins by listening to the customer, Mr. Freid said, "Drawing on the experience of every member of our group, we developed a proprietary new marketing and management tool we call the Customer Intelligence System, and we use it to measure a business's bottom line by sensing and responding to change faster than the competition."
What makes the Customer Intelligence System different, he said, is its ability to analyze and monitor why customers change what they value and what they expect a company to provide in the future.
"The technique has been around for years," Mr. Freid said. "What we did that was different was to put it together in one package using advance computer models and analytical techniques, which enable us to collect, monitor and evaluate data that link customers' preferences with outside forces -- such as emerging technologies and economic trends -- that shape their values. What it actually is is a continuous surveillance system that generates market intelligence needed to make strategic business decisions."
Citing the experience of Reebok International, the athletic-shoe manufacturer, Mr. Freid said: "What happened was that in 1993, Reebok brought out a new sneaker they expected to be a winner. It was white, trimmed in blue, and the retail price was $130. But it didn't do well at all.
"Had Reebok the system we have designed, they would have been able to track styles and anticipate market changes and then react quickly by bringing out what had been a more successful seller, which was a black-on-black sneaker selling for under $100."
 
Joining the Client's Team
 Each member of the group has a specialty. Allen L. Morton, the former director of the I.B.M. Corporate Technical Institute and director of the I.B.M. Systems Research Institute, now focuses on strategic development and redesign of business processes.
"Technical advances can't take place in isolation," Mr. Morton said. "The role of communication and trust in building teams is essential to this process."
Project teams of four and five members work directly with clients.
"We will go into the client's officeand work there as if we were part of his company," Mr. Freid said. "Our client list is broad based, ranging from accounting firms, banks, publishers, to the Government of Turkey. We bill on a daily or project basis. Most assignments are for projects that can last from a couple of weeks to several months. They can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000. At the end of the year, we deduct our fixed expenses and divide the profits among the members of the group."
One client, John F. Sitar, who is also a former I.B.M. executive, founded his company, Corstar, in Elmsford, 15 years ago. Corstar supplies computer hardware and software to industry. Mr. Sitar said he believes Multinational has the ability to put the finger on the pulse of changing values in the marketplace. "What they basically give us is an early-warning system, so that we can supply our Fortune 100 customers with the right business product."

WORLD WAR II NOVEL
LOVE AND INFAMY
By Frank Deford.
Viking, $24. 
 Cotton Drake, the son of missionaries who came to Japan in the years after World War I, grows up as a near-brother to a Japanese boy named Kiyoshi Serikawa. As adults, they resume their relationship, even though Kiyoshi works in an international shipping firm and Cotton has himself become a missionary. Then Kiyoshi, who has served in the company office in Honolulu, is recruited as an intelligence officer by Admiral Yamamoto, who is, without the Imperial Army's knowledge, planning an assault on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor. When Cotton learns about all this, he tries to convince American officials of the threat. Not surprisingly, the plot of "Love and Infamy" races ahead toward the inevitable conclusion, but in his sixth novel Frank Deford manages to keep the suspense going. He has a good story to tell, creates believable and complicated characters, and has done his research on the harrowing political and economic conditions of prewar Japan. And yet the reader begins to lose interest because Mr. Deford has most of his Japanese characters speaking in American slang, including all the more familiar and tiresome vulgarities and obscenities. It is extremely difficult to imagine Admiral Yamamoto, predicting after the Pearl Harbor raid that the war ahead will not be easy, saying, even in jest, "There's no such thing as a free lunch."

HEADLINE: A Time to Ponder Where Blacks Stand

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
LAST Sunday, Anni Moss the black singer and actress known to audiences by her first name -- kicked off Black History Month on the local weekly radio program Dreamsounds by playing "Stand for Something," a rap song recorded by the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis. In choosing the song -- which invokes the names of black heroes like the slave leader Nat Turner and the educator Mary McLeod Bethune -- the WRTN-FM radio host sounded one of the keynote themes for the month of celebrations, lectures and workshops that began last week throughout the county.
 
A Continuing Struggle
 "Now more than ever, blacks need to take control of our destiny," said Anni (pronounced ah-NEE). "We have to take the initiative and not wait for others to call on us." 
 For many of the county's black residents, who, according to the 1990 census numbered 120,195 and represented about 13 percent of the total county poplulation of 874,866, the yearly celebration, which is being observed nationwide as well, has become a time to reflect on gains made and tasks that lie ahead. In interviews last week, black leaders in business, the arts and government voiced their concerns on the 25th anniversary of Black History Month in Westchester.
While they agreed that the achievements among well-educated middle- and upper-class blacks had been significant, they said that poor blacks continued to struggle.
Many of those interviewed cited the need for more economic opportunities for young adults and for outreach efforts by successful blacks to younger members of the community who needed role models to follow. They also spoke about the importance of better education in public schools in low-income black and Hispanic neighborhoods.
"It's like 'A Tale of Two Cities,' " said County Legislator Ernest D. Davis, a Democrat representing Mount Vernon. "Two-thirds of us have been able to make strides, but things are much worse for blacks on the bottom. Their attitudes have hardened, so for us as a group it continues to be a mixed bag.
"It is in our best interests to help, because if we don't, they will revisit us as wards of the municipalities and as faces of anger on the street."
Mr. Davis, chairman of the Legislation Committee and one of three black lawmakers on the County Board of Legislators, said that his agenda as a local government leader included aid for small minority-owned businesses, continued financing for early-intervention day care and Head Start programs and efforts to recruit "better teachers who believe that all children can learn."
 
Equal Education Still a Goal
 Yvonne D. Jones, president of the 1,000-member White Plains-Greenburgh chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said her organization was also concerned about equal education for all students.
"Certain civil rights gains have been secured," said Ms. Jones, referring to the Federal school desegregation lawsuit in Yonkers during the late 1980's. "But there continue to be pockets of blacks throughout the county, and as a result we still get some mostly white and mostly black schools. The quality of education is not even throughout."
Another Board member, Herman Keith, a Democrat from Yonkers and chairman of the Minority Affairs Committee, said his legislative agenda would include curriculum changes in higher education as well. For one, he is recommending that Westchester Community College institute courses in entrepreneurship to target young blacks who want to start businesses.
"If they become the rebuilders of our urban communities, they will be less likely to tear down those areas," said Mr. Keith, who represents low-income neighborhoods on the west side of Yonkers.
 
17 Organizations Represented
 Like other leaders interviewed, Mr. Keith said he was concerned about increased violence among many black youths and statistics that showed that far more blacks than whites spend time in jail.
In Mount Vernon, Mr. Davis said that with "so many Afro and Latino males behind bars, 11-year-old boys are becoming heads of families, and that cannot happen without dire consequences."
At the offices of the African American Federation of Westchester, the chairman, Fred Campbell, agreed that the economic and political strides made by many members of his race were being undermined by problems among poor blacks in the county -- including the growing number of the homeless.
"These problems represent serious setbacks for us," said Mr. Campbell, whose umbrella organization represents 17 groups, including local chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
There are no statistics showing the racial breakdown in the county's homeless population because by law such figures cannot be tabulated, said Norman Shaw of the county's Department of Social Services.
But statistics from the County Office of Criminal Justice Services show that of 9,036 people in county jails in 1992, 37 percent were white and 59.5 percent were black.
And State Labor Department statistics show that throughout New York, the unemployment rate for blacks was 12.5 percent through the third quarter of last year compared with a 6.3 percent rate for whites.
"The economic hard times have exacerbated our problems and undermined our gains," Mr. Campbell said. "For one, many blacks have not had the time to accrue seniority, and the last hired have been the first fired."
 
Vowed to Help Others
 At the offices of the African American Men of Westchester, a 30-member service organization, Thomas L. Clark Jr. said his group was trying to address problems among poor blacks by providing strong role models for younger members of the community.
Mr. Clark, one of the founders of the organization and its current president, said members worked with youths through programs at local community centers. "We tell youngsters you have an alternative to deviant behavior, and you have a tremendous responsibility to your community," said Mr. Clark, who is deputy superintendent of banks and secretary to the Banking Board of the State Banking Department.
In New Rochelle, a businessman, Rob L. Garris, said his recently opened Mackadocious All-Seasons Maintenance Service will hire "brothers coming home from jail and rehab and give them their first job."
Mr. Garris, who also owns Mackadocious Hairstyles in New Rochelle and is a member of the city's Youth Council Committee, added, "I was your average street kid growing up in foster homes, and I said to myself that if I ever got my life together, I would help others."
Black women leaders who were interviewed said they were most concerned with helping younger members of their race move ahead in government. At the offices of the Westchester Black Women's Political Caucus, the president, Sheila Morris, said: "There is a need for women already in office to act as mentors for those who are coming along. We are setting our sights on political empowerment."
The organization represents 400 members in chapters in Greenburgh, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Yonkers and Peekskill.
One of its charter members, County Legislator Lois T. Bronz, a Democrat representing parts of Greenburgh, White Plains, Scarsdale and New Rochelle, said that black women who have achieved a "relatively high profile in public and professional life" needed to help younger women who were struggling to balance raising families with their careers.
 
Less Stereotyping Observed
 "A lot of us were single mothers," Ms. Bronz said, "and we have something to share with our young sisterhood, who in many cases don't have a support system to help show them the way."
At the Open Cage Theater in Mount Vernon, the director, Tina Sattin, said that, looking back at the history of women in the arts, she was seeing less stereotyping.
"We are finally playing professional people," she said. "For men and women, TV took a long time to catch up with us."
But for many blacks, the stereotyping persists, and Kenneth W. Jenkins, president of the Yonkers chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. said, "It's with us still, even in the little things like going to the store and having people look at us as though we are going to steal something."
Throughout the month, there will be art exhibitions, lectures, films, concerts, dances, readings of literature by black writers and special events for children. A copy of the calendar of events can be got through the Office of Cultural Affairs; the phone numbers are 285-2922 or 785-6709.

THE BIRTH OF FASCIST IDEOLOGY
From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution.
By Zeev Sternhell with Mario Sznajder
and Maia Asheri.
Translated by David Maisel.

 FOR the last 15 years, Zeev Sternhell, a professor of political science at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has battled to affirm the ideological significance of Fascism: it was not a flash in the pan, but the expression of political and cultural positions no less interesting than liberalism or Marxism. Fascism, Mr. Sternhell says in "The Birth of Fascist Ideology" (as he has said before in earlier works), is not racism, biological determinism or anti-Semitism (there were many Fascist Jews). It is not a defensive reaction of the bourgeoisie, the last gasp of capitalism on the ropes or a mere byproduct of World War I. It is, rather, a synthesis of the two most forceful ideologies of the 19th century, nationalism and socialism, which leaders of the French radical right had coupled before that century ended, soon to be imitated by Italian syndicalists and nationalists.
The jump shift, Mr. Sternhell suggests, was in the cards. On the one hand, nationalism that views the nation-state as an organic whole could tolerate neither class oppression nor class conflict. On the other, the social opportunities and justice that socialism demanded appeared a natural part of a functioning nation. So national socialism made sense. But, Mr. Sternhell argues, there was more. The closing 19th century suffered from an acute sense of cultural (and physical) degeneration, degradation and disintegration. The eagles that so many dreamed of had come home to roost in the guise of chickens. Democracy seemed a delusion, pacifist internationalism irrelevant, natural rights a dream, equality a fantasy hatched by lachrymose humanists. In the 1890's, intellectuals of the left, already ranged against bourgeois hedonism and parliamentary corruption, often turned against social democracy as well.
As socialist politicians accepted the rules of liberal and democratic games, Mr. Sternhell says, hopes that many had placed in Marxism withered, the rationalist utopias of the Enlightenment looked less convincing. Capitalism appeared selfish, hence antinational; socialism seemed bureaucratic, hence parasitic and counterproductive. Masses were no more amenable to reason than classes. Psychology took precedence over economics: intuition, energy and energizing myths were what counted -- and moral, not social or economic, reform.
The children of the Enlightenment had been materialistic and utilitarian, argued these radical rightists from the left. Now it seemed as if essential questions were not material but cultural and emotional. People's lives could be altered without touching economic structures. It followed that class analyses were snares, and that the true force of the modern world was not the proletariat but the nation. Class struggle, abolished within the national community, would be transferred onto the international plane. The true revolution was war, and war apparently proved the protofascists right.
By the time the bloodletting of 1914 to 1918 was over, social democracy in many places was intellectually bankrupt, and parliamentary democracy discredited; only Communism and Fascism seemed to offer ideological prospects to the brightest and best. To those for whom optimism, humanism and universalism did not wash, who regarded economics as secondary to politics and found material forces less appealing than moral ones, Fascism had to be the ideology of choice. In catastrophic times, it proposed a heroic society led by self-selected elites, an egalitarianism of the meritocratic, a revolutionary idealism to replace historical materialism and a militant, modernizing revolution that challenged the delusive dreams generated by the rival revolution in Russia. To his admirers in the 1920's (Freud and Churchill among them), Mussolini -- the Italian labor leader who, years before the war, had replaced "proletariat" with "people" and with "nation" -- offered not an alternative to revolution but an alternative revolution just as violent, as nonconformist, as avant-garde as that of the left.
Mr. Sternhell and his collaborators, Mario Sznajder, a scholar of Italian revolutionary syndicalism, and Maia Asheri, a student of early Italian Fascism, make clear that the compromises, incoherences and contradictions of Mussolinian Fascism were no greater and no more opportunistic than those of liberalism or socialism. Victory and compromise go hand in hand. Was Bolshevism in practice any different? We know that platforms are made to run on, not to stand on. That does not make them less effective while they last, or even (as the press reminds us) when they have been discredited and allegedly abandoned.
Eloquent, repetitive, uneven in style and insistent in argument, "The Birth of Fascist Ideology" (in a workmanlike translation from the French by David Maisel) will not convince the unconvinced, and it will raise hackles Mr. Sternhell likes to see raised. But it deserves to be read and, whatever one's reservations, to be considered seriously. Its approach, in my view, is too deliberately and narrowly intellectual, shortchanging political and social factors. The authors make Fascism and the intellectuals who forged it in France and Italy bear a heavier ideological burden than they can sustain. But this book rectifies the stereotyped and narrowly derogatory image of a movement that was as representative and influential as its more acceptable contemporaries, and more original than many.

HEADLINE: California Quake Is Lifting Hopes Of the Governor and a Challenger

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The deadly earthquake that moved mountains and toppled buildings here last month also changed the political landscape of California, shifting the terrain in a crucial race that will pit an unpopular Republican Governor against one of two Democratic challengers for his job.
There is widespread agreement that the earthquake on Jan. 17 breathed new life into the political fortunes of Gov. Pete Wilson. The quake also jump-started the underdog primary campaign of John Garamendi, the state's Insurance Commissioner, and raised questions about whether Kathleen Brown, the California Treasurer and Democratic front-runner, is the inevitable winner she once seemed.
 
$8.5 Billion Windfall
 The main beneficiary of California's latest calamity, political experts in both parties agree, is Mr. Wilson, a veteran at coping with disasters and whose job performance ratings improved in the weeks after the earthquake, according to a statewide poll. 
 The Governor, who has issued disaster declarations for fires, floods, riots, toxic spills and droughts in 56 of the state's 58 counties since taking office in 1991, was a reassuring presence in the days after the quake as he toured the devastated areas in his trademark windbreaker and promised to press the Clinton Administration for all the help this battered state needs.
And now it seems that California is on the verge of a Federal windfall, with a record-breaking $8.5 billion aid package already approved by the House of Representatives. The bill is expected to clear the Senate this week and be signed by President Clinton.
Tony L. Coelho, a Californian who is a former Democratic leader in Congress, is one of many political analysts who gives Mr. Wilson high marks for his recent performance and points to an upswing in his ratings, which inched back last week to where they had been before protracted budget battles in Sacramento two years ago.
According to the latest Field Poll, the Governor gets a good or excellent job rating from 30 percent of Californians, up from 25 percent just two weeks ago. And 34 percent now grade him as poor or very poor, down from 40 percent before the quake. The survey of 525 adults, conducted Jan. 27-31, has a margin of sampling error of five percentage points.
And Mr. Wilson's job approval rating could get better, Mr. Coelho said. "The slate can easily be wiped clean if people perceive him to be aggressively interested in helping them solve their current problems," he said. "It isn't even necessary that he have all the answers or deliver the goods. It's an attitudinal thing."
The other political winner in the aftermath of the earthquake seems to be Mr. Garamendi, who trails Ms. Brown by 15 points in the polls. Mr. Garamendi, who characterizes himself as the bull in the china shop of government, attracted attention after the quake by calling for tax increases to pay for rebuilding, while the other candidates were more cautious.
 
Establishing an Identity
 "Because John is carving out a unique position, that helps him flesh out his identity," said Steve Merksamer, a Republican strategist who was chief of staff for Gov. George Deukmejian in 1989, when an earthquake hit the San Francisco Bay Area. Mr. Deukmejian, otherwise adamant about holding the line on taxes during his first six years in office, took quick action after that disaster by raising the sales tax one-fourth of a cent for 13 months, which yielded $800 million for reconstruction. Mr. Deukmejian did not seek re-election in 1990.
Mr. Garamendi is urging a similar approach, calling for a temporary increase in the sales tax to rebuild, particularly schools, and a temporary increase in the gasoline tax to repair the damaged freeways and upgrade others to protect against future quakes.
The state sales tax is now 7.25 percent, and higher in some localities, including Los Angeles at 8.25 and San Francisco at 8.5 percent. The state gasoline tax is 18 cents a gallon.
Mr. Garamendi's call for new taxes contrasts sharply with Mr. Wilson's and Ms. Brown's wait-and-see recommendations.
The Governor is pressing the Federal Government to reimburse the state for the entire cost of rebuilding, and says he prefers bond issues to taxes if more money must be raised. Ms. Brown says it is premature to call for new taxes until a full accounting of damages is made, which is expected this week. In the meantime, she has combed the books in the Treasurer's office and identified $1.3 billion available for reconstruction, from bond issues approved by voters but not sold, and from bridge loans.
 
When Times Were Different
 Publicly, aides to both Mr. Wilson and Ms. Brown say that taxes that were appropriate after the 1989 earthquake are not appropriate today. The state was booming then, they say, but is mired in recession now. Governor Deukmejian had not raised taxes earlier in his administration, but Mr. Wilson presided over a $7 billion tax increase during his first year in office. And the state sales tax was raised by referendum just a few months ago, while the gas tax has been inching up since a voter initiative in 1990.
But privately, aides to both Mr. Wilson and Ms. Brown say they believe a temporary tax increase may be necessary in a state with a huge budget deficit, a depleted emergency reserve fund and many costly problems. But only Mr. Garamendi has said that in public forums and in a barrage of radio advertisements that began last week.
"If a governor or a wannabe isn't willing to say that at a time of crisis, then they're telling the public they don't want to lead," Mr. Garamendi said in an interview.
His provocative strategy could backfire in California, where the nationwide tax revolt began in 1978, particularly if he makes it to the general election in November. But in the short run he has upstaged Ms. Brown and earned media recognition he could not afford to buy.
 
Winning the Headlines
 Many political analysts here pointed to simultaneous appearances by Mr. Garamendi and Ms. Brown last week. While he was at the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce declaring that only "a fool or a liar" would say it is possible to rebuild Los Angeles without new taxes, she was delivering a long-winded economic position paper at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco.
Mr. Garamendi won the headlines that day. "John is more adept at taking advantage of these opportunities," Mr. Merksamer said. "Let's say he's a news hog."
Campaign strategists for Governor Wilson and Ms. Brown sought to portray Mr. Garamendi's call for taxes as one of his typically reckless acts.
"People in California are looking for several qualities in their next governor," said Dan Schnur, a spokesman for Mr. Wilson, "but unfortunately for John Garamendi, hysteria isn't one of them."
Michael Reese, a spokesman for Ms. Brown, agreed. "It goes to the fundamental flaw in his candidacy," he said.
 
She Who Hesitates . . .
 But many political analysts here say that even more characteristic than Mr. Garamendi's grandstand play is Ms. Brown's hesitant approach, a habit that some experts say is corroding her candidacy.
Ms. Brown, who plans to declare formally that she is running on Tuesday, remains 15 points ahead of Mr. Garamendi in several recent polls, all taken before the earthquake, but she has seen her lead against the Governor shrink. In October, according to the Field Poll, Ms. Brown led Mr. Wilson by 17 points in a head-to-head race. In mid-January, that lead was down to 8 points.
"Increasingly, there have been questions in Democratic circles about whether there's a core to Kathleen, a core of beliefs, a core of knowledge," said Bruce E. Cain, a professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley. "She has an unwillingness to take strong positions until other people are already in the fray. It's always, 'Well, I have to think about it.' "
 
The Nature of the Job
 Mr. Coehlo agreed. "People are taking a second look," he said. "Those questions were already being asked, and they have more currency now."
Ms. Brown says it is unreasonable to expect decisive action from her about earthquake recovery when her job is so removed from the process. "Let's be real here," she said in an interview. "I am not the governor. I am not involved in insurance claims. There is a very fine line between doing your job and using disasters to court publicity."
She is not alone in insisting that the perception of the candidates since the earthquake has in large measure been a function of their office. "It's the uniforms the three are wearing," said Mervin Field, director of the Field Poll.
Mr. Field and others also note that there is a long way to go before the election and that current perceptions could have a short half-life. They cite the surge in popularity for Art Agnos, who was Mayor of San Francisco in the 1989 earthquake, and then his shocking defeat two years later to Frank Jordan, who was a political amateur.
In the months to come, Mr. Field said, Mr. Wilson will be held accountable for the grinding inconveniences that Angelenos will continue to suffer, the struggle to pay for rebuilding, and the state's others problems, which are likely to be aggravated by the quake. And Mr. Garamendi will be held accountable for the performance of the insurance industry.
"I don't think these bumps last too long," Mr. Field said of the current political landscape. "There's plenty of time for everything to switch around."

HEADLINE: An End to a Law Firm That Defined a Type

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
For a change this year, Milton S. Gould, the 84-year-old paterfamilias of the law firm Shea & Gould, decided to wait out the winter in a nice pastel house with a pool and a dock in Naples, Fla. And that is where he was last week, reeling from a recent bitter blast from New York: While he was on vacation, the partners in the scrappy law firm that bore his name voted it out of existence. 
 "I've been at the same firm since 1933 -- until I lost my job last week," said Mr. Gould, the legendary litigator who represented Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli Defense Minister, in the 1985 libel suit against Time magazine.
 
'These Kids!'
 His sense of the betrayal of the legacy built by himself and his deceased partner, the power broker William A. Shea, had a King Lear-like dimension. "We turned our clients over to these kids!" he said. "We made them big shots! But they got drunk on their own liquor: they looked in the mirror and thought they saw Shea & Gould. And they were deluding themselves."
In its rise, its heyday and perhaps even its fall, Shea & Gould was widely regarded as the quintessential New York law firm, with a spit-in-your-eye brashness that defied the gentlemanly traditions of the white-shoe Wall Street firms. Mr. Gould ruled the courtroom and Mr. Shea the backroom, with Mr. Gould bringing his potent skills in litigation and corporate restructuring to the merger in 1964 with Mr. Shea, who brought his vast political influence with state and city Democrats and Republicans.
But Shea & Gould was run as a benevolent dictatorship. That worked well enough as long as its personable founders were in control, but by the mid-1980's, when age and illness had forced them to step back, they handed the reins to an executive committee that never stopped quarreling about money and the direction of the firm. In recent years, searching for institutional clients as well as a more subdued image, Shea & Gould expanded in a costly frenzy.
In the end, which came on Jan. 27 when partners voted to dissolve the firm by March 31, Shea & Gould imploded from greed and factionalism. Referring to the efforts made by Bradford W. Hildebrandt, a legal consultant hired to rescue the firm, one partner on the executive committee said, "There was nothing that man could have done to save us from ourselves."
 
Offices Quiet
 Late last week, the carpeted, cavernous offices on five floors at 1251 Avenue of the Americas, where some 240 lawyers and nearly 400 support personnel used to work, were all but silent. Workers wheeled out cartons of files. Doors were shut, lights out; young associates and secretaries stood about, chatting idly. Tucked behind the door of Mr. Gould's corner office was the mahogany and brass-lettered Shea & Gould shingle from the old offices at 330 Madison Avenue. It was inscribed: "With thanks from the partners."
In 1933, when Mr. Gould graduated from Cornell Law School, he was offered an entry-level position at the elite firm of White & Case. But, he said, he was sent to a small back office informally set aside for Jewish lawyers. Anti-Semitism was common among major firms in those days; the lawyers said they were only allowed to write memos and forbidden contact with clients.
"My heart sank," Mr. Gould recalled last week, his plumed eyebrows working like semaphores as he recounted tales in the study of his Florida house, wearing a golf sweater and a Cornell law school baseball cap.
He quickly signed on at an energetic new firm, Kaufman, Weitzner & Celler, whose founding partners included a future Federal judge and a Brooklyn Congressman. Except for the few years he spent as a prosecutor of immigration corruption cases, Mr. Gould remained with the firm for the rest of his career: He would become a named partner there and eventually join its forces with Mr. Shea, a classmate from George Washington High School in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan.
In the 1950's and 60's, he became known as the consummate litigator. Lawyers and judges describe him in the courtroom as wily, charming, eloquent and erudite, with a light but deft touch at cross-examination. He was a jack of all cases, including white-collar crime, libel, real estate and admiralty matters.
"There's no one like him now," said Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin. "We have become so specialized in the practise of law that you don't find broad-gauged people like Milton Gould anymore. "
And Mr. Gould pulled off coups in the corporate world as well, representing parties in major upheavals at Twentieth Century-Fox, Columbia Pictures, Curtis Publishing and at various utilities, including Texas Oil and Gas and Coastal States Gas.
"I didn't just become a legend overnight, you know," said Mr. Gould. "I had to work at it."
 
Working Backrooms And Courtrooms
 In 1964, the firm, then called Gallop, Climenko & Gould, merged with Manning, Hollinger & Shea to create a 22-lawyer firm. Mr. Shea was an extraordinary political matchmaker; in 1957 Mayor Robert F. Wagner tapped him to woo National League baseball back to the city, which culminated in 1962 with the Mets and eventually their stadium, which was named after him. Mr. Shea became the confidant of Govs. Nelson A. Rockefeller and Hugh L. Carey, of Mayors Wagner, John V. Lindsay and Abraham D. Beame.
"Shea had belly-button instincts," his partner said. "He could predict the direction of events and he had an incredible talent for inspiring talent and confidence in people." He paused, then added, "Shea was incapable of parsing a sentence, of course, but he got his message across."
While Mr. Shea flexed the political muscle of the firm, Mr. Gould groomed young litigators and continued to amass a glossy client roster that included Aristotle Onassis, Donald Trump, William J. Casey, Jack Kent Cooke, Aldo Gucci, and Leona Helmsley. He was famous in legal circles for his many friendships on the bench and his conversation last week was peppered with references like, "And then we made him a judge." (He served on a judicial appointment panel for Mayor Beame.)
But when asked what those illustrious friendships amounted to in a courtroom, he looked aghast.
"Do you think Willie Mays had to bribe the pitcher?" he said.
The firm was emphatically unpolished and wore its Irish-Jewish ethnicity like a badge. "I don't think Shea and Gould thought of themselves as outcasts," said Wendeen H. Eolis, a legal consultant, "but they were tough, competitive and broke of lot of rules of social grace that the old-line blueblood firms used to play by."
Present and former employees have vividly fond memories of the early years. When Steven E. Levitsky joined as an associate in 1975, he recalled: "There used to be a lot of running up and down the halls, screaming and yelling. The firm hired some people who were visibly crazy but were brilliant, hardworking, and got results. We were team players."
Mr. Shea and Mr. Gould were absolutely in charge. "There was one boss," Mr. Gould said. "Shea and I." Every morning Mr. Gould would pick up Mr. Shea and they would arrive at the office at 8:15 and drive home together in the evenings.
When it came time to determine the partners' salaries, the two would draw up a list, squint at it, then jot down a figure by each name. They divided the leftovers and became millionaires.
They did not loosen their control gladly. In 1979 they set up a five-man executive committee, but until 1984 they retained veto power. In that year, Mr. Gould, then 74, had a triple-bypass operation, and both he and Mr. Shea relinquished their veto power. He was still active in court, however, planning from his hospital room the Sharon libel suit, which vindicated Mr. Sharon's reputation but denied him damages.
The upheaval of the 1980's, with prosperity followed by recession, rocked Shea & Gould as violently as other law firms. But other firms survived by acknowledging the deep secret of lawyers -- they are generally weak at managing their own affairs -- and hired business managers, created budgets and established clear lines of decision-making authority. Not so at Shea & Gould. Though leaders came and went, a dynamic dauphin was never officially crowned; instead, rule by a tight-fisted committee and revolt by cadres of partners would become the way business was undone.
By 1985, the firm started taking on more partners and offices: a real-estate group came over and an ailing Los Angeles firm became Shea & Gould's new California base. A year later, a Miami branch opened. By decade's end, Shea & Gould had swelled to more than 350 lawyers. In 1988, it had gross revenue of $100 million, netting $44 million, according to The American Lawyer. In the magazine's survey of top-grossing firms that year, Shea & Gould ranked 28th nationally.
But how that rich pie was to be sliced became a never-ending battle. While partners averaged $315,000 in that flush year, The American Lawyer reported that members of the executive committee -- by then there were nine -- drew between $900,000 and $1 million each. One former partner characterized the tone of the fights over money as: "What can I grab today? And if it's from you, so much the better."
In 1989, Mr. Shea had an incapacitating stroke. The 70-lawyer Los Angeles office collapsed, and the Miami office was losing money. Even so, Shea & Gould moved into stadium-sized offices on the Avenue of the Americas at 50th Street, at a rent of nearly $60 a square foot; the move cost some $25 million. Meanwhile, the firm still pays about $1 million a year on its lease at its old address. A respected group of five partners in their early 40's left to form their own firm, reportedly fed up with intransigence of the executive committee.
 
A Committee, But No Unanimity

In 1991, Mr. Shea died, and the partners called in Mr. Hildebrandt, the legal consultant, to renegotiate their lease and patch up their troubles. And they overwhelmingly elected Thomas E. Constance, a member of the executive committee, as chairman of the firm. Mr. Constance, a corporate lawyer, was unquestionably its biggest rainmaker, bringing in clients like Bear, Stearns & Company, and recruiting lawyers with a lucrative intellectual property practice. Under pressure, the executive committee agreed to an election, and new, younger members were added.
But with a swelled committee, tensions simmered. Lauren J. Wachtler, a partner who recently left, recalled, "We became a firm of solo practitioners." Revenues dropped to $83 million in 1992.
By this October, cash flow was severely strained, and the office missed its monthly payout to partners.
A Washington office, favored by Mr. Constance, was also a sore point; it paid high-six-figure salaries to Roderick M. Hills to handle international business and his wife, Carla Hills, the former United States trade representative, to refer international clients. Links were announced with offices throughout Asia and Europe.
By then, the climate in the executive committee was so acrimonious that factions met separately, releasing contradictory memos.
Even so, the 1993 gross revenues inched up to $85 million. But the overhead was so high that net income amounted to $19 million, a return lower than many law firms expect.
 
A Corner Turned, Then a Dead End
 Mr. Hildebrandt was called back in October. He suggested strict reductions in staff and expenses in all offices to make the firm stable on its own, or ripe for a merger.
By Christmas, many believed that the firm had turned the corner. And so when reports surfaced in early January that Mr. Constance had been negotiating with the Miami firm of Greenberg, Traurig, Hoffman, Lipoff, Rosen & Quentel to expand its New York office, all hell broke loose.
Whether Mr. Constance was discussing a merger for the bulk of Shea & Gould or a deal for himself and the firm's prized teams remains in contention; Mr. Constance did not respond to requests for comment. "I have no reason to believe that Tom was doing anything other than negotiating for the firm or at least a very substantial portion of it," said Peter C. Neger, an executive committee member.
But it was widely seen as the ultimate act of treachery.
The week before the final meeting, Mr. Hildebrandt sat down with a small group of partners late at night, according to someone who was there. He pleaded with them to stop looking for new jobs and to make a commitment to the firm, which was spinning out of control.
But at the Jan. 27 meeting, 78 of the 80 partners voted to dissolve the firm. One partner there was heard to remark, "The silence of the leaders of this firm is deafening."
The firm will be nominally open for a year to collect bills and pay off liabilities, but Mr. Hildebrandt said, "The partners won't get anything."
Meanwhile, in Florida, Mr. Gould says he is heartbroken. "I was reared in the tradition where a law firm was a family -- we supported each other from a motive of general benefit," he said. "But I have suffered a betrayal by people who owed a lot to me: they didn't discuss it with me, and they used bad judgment to further objectives that were selfish and unjust.
"But I can't escape responsibility for the fact that I gave them the power to do what has been done."
Throughout a long morning visit, though, the telephone kept ringing. Anxious friends from the firm called, and so did partners from other firms to discuss plans for him and a few stalwarts. Jack Kent Cooke checked in for legal advice.
Mr. Gould shook his head. "I don't know if I'll ever try a case again," he said. "But I would if they asked me."

HEADLINE: Clintons' Whitewater Investment: Details of a Land Deal That Soured

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG with JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLIPPIN, Ark.

 BODY:
The Ozark air smelled of easy profits on Aug. 2, 1978, when Arkansas's hottest young politician walked into a tiny bank here and set in motion what has become one of the most closely examined sets of financial transactions in the state's history.
At age 32, Bill Clinton was in the midst of the campaign that a few months later would make him the nation's youngest governor. With a meager salary, few assets and no business experience, he was scarcely in a position to ride a land boom, even one that seemed to promise lucrative returns at low risk. 
 But Mr. Clinton arrived with a financially impressive partner, James B. McDougal, a former Congressional aide turned land developer. It was Mr. McDougal's personal wealth, bank officials said, that allowed them to approve the $183,000 loan taken out by Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, and Mr. McDougal and his wife, Susan, to buy the land.
Frank Burge, a bank officer who was present for the closing, recalls Mr. Clinton and his wife being surprisingly "uninquisitive" as they took on what, to that point, was their largest financial liability. After a cursory look, the four partners signed the papers that brought them 230 acres of Ozark property that day, and a Federal investigation 15 years later.
"The crux of the whole deal was McDougal was trying to do something to help Bill," said Mr. Burge, who was then senior vice president at Citizen's Bank and Trust of Flippin. "They all thought they were going to be rich."
That did not happen. Today only a handful of small homes dot the hilly land that the couples bought at the juncture of Crooked Creek and the White River.
Last month, a special prosecutor began setting up shop in Little Rock to look into a host of questions. Many arise directly from the venture's tangled finances, in particular whether Mr. McDougal improperly diverted money from his savings and loan, Madison Guaranty, to shore up or benefit the Clintons. The prosecutor, Robert B. Fiske Jr., will also examine whether Mr. Clinton showed favoritism to Mr. McDougal in later years as Madison moved toward collapse.
Among the topics that Mr. Fiske will confront is the Clintons' contention that they and their partners lost $160,000 on a $203,000 land purchase. The prosecutor has also said he will range far beyond Arkansas to events since Mr. Clinton became President, including the suicide of a longtime friend and top White House aide, Vincent W. Foster Jr.
Interviews with several dozen people and a review of land documents, mortgages, and other records provide only partial answers to the questions about the venture's finances.
But what does emerge clearly is a portrait of a deal born in a boom that quickly fizzled, and that had its origins in the kind of interplay of personal, political and governmental interests that has become synonymous with the words Whitewater Development Company.
 
Seeing Opportunity On Banks of River
 In the summer of 1978, the small business circles of Marion County were abuzz with word of the largest land deal in the county's history. A 3,200-acre parcel of riverfront property was about to become available after years of being tied up in an Oklahoma bankruptcy court.
It was viewed as a particularly ripe opportunity, since the picturesque Ozark county, about a three-hour drive north of Little Rock, had recently begun to attract prosperous retirees fleeing Illinois and other wintery states.
Land that had recently sold for $75 an acre was suddenly fetching $500, and some people thought that development might even surpass ranching and dairy as the county's economic lifeblood. "A lot of people who were shrewd investors found out it was easier to graze Yankees than to graze cattle," Mr. Burge said. "Everyone was doing it."
Six Marion County businessmen joined to capitalize on the bankruptcy sale, forming a corporation called 101 River Development. The partners included a real estate agent, Terry Wood; the president of Citizen's Bank, James N. Patterson, and the man who was running Mr. Clinton's campaign for governor in Marion County, Kearnie Carleton.
Before going through with the $1.4 million purchase, the group lined up 15 sets of buyers for parcels of the 3,200 acres. One was the Clintons and the McDougals. The inclusion of the Democratic nominee for governor seemed to bode well for Marion County, and its hopes of spurring development.
"You do things for a guy, you get him indebted to a degree," said Steven Sanders, who was then a director of Citizens Bank and Trust. "At least you get access."
Mr. Sanders said the addition of Mr. Clinton, who was Arkansas Attorney General at the time and considered a shoo-in for governor, also lent the deal a form of subtle elan.
"You bring in one of these politicians just to use their name," Mr. Sanders said. "You say, 'Oh, the Governor's involved in this deal.' "
 
One Small Hurdle: Raising the Money
 There remained an important question: How would the Clintons and the McDougals raise the $203,000 they needed to buy their piece of the land?
As a public official, Mr. Clinton had a big name but a small purse. His job as Attorney General paid only $26,500 a year; his elevation to governor would raise that only to $35,000. His wife, who had kept her maiden name of Hillary Rodham, had only recently begun working at Little Rock's prestigious Rose law firm. Officials of Citizens Bank and Trust said the couple had few financial assets.
"Clinton himself couldn't have gotten the loan," Mr. Sanders said. "McDougal was the guarantee of the resource here," Mr. Sanders recalled, and Mr. Burge agreed.
Even so, the bank's board insisted that both couples personally guarantee the note, rather than letting them take out a loan under some corporate entity. "There was even some discussion: isn't it rather impudent of you to require the future governor to sign such a thing?" Mr. Sanders said. "Some of the directors felt it was a little insulting."
That loan covered all but a down payment of $20,000. Mr. Burge said he then believed that the couples were putting up their own money, as is customary. But the Clinton campaign acknowledged in 1992 that the couples had taken out a $20,000 loan from another Arkansas bank, meaning that the entire land purchase was financed with borrowed money. Mr. Burge said he was surprised to learn of this from recent newspaper articles on Whitewater.
Some local real estate agents contend that the couples paid an unusually high price for the land. Just 19 days before the Clinton purchase, the entire 3,200-acre tract had been bought by 101 River Development for $1.4 million, an average of $440 an acre. The land was then resold by the company to the 15 purchasers or partnerships.
The Clintons and the McDougals paid $880 an acre for their land, making it the most expensive single parcel of the 15. Several 101 River partners said the high price was justified by the Clinton tract's view of the White River and Crooked Creek. And Mr. McDougal, they say, should have been savvy about land values in Marion County from his previous deals.
Other land agents wondered, insisting that at these prices, access to the river was more important than the view. "I know what land values are," said Bobby Joe Baker, a local real estate agent who had helped begin the land boom with some well-placed advertisements in Chicago newspapers. "They paid three times what that land was worth."
 
Land Is Here. Where Are Buyers?
 Mr. Clinton won the November election easily, took office as Governor in January 1979, and soon brought Mr. McDougal into the state government as an economic development aide.
In 1979, in Mr. Clinton's first term as Governor, the Clintons and the McDougals formed the Whitewater Development Company and transferred the land to it. The company officers were James and Susan McDougal; the Clintons were shareholders, entitled to half the company's profits and obligated for half its debt.
Land records valued the property at $250,000. In a 1992 interview, Sam Heuer, Mr. McDougal's lawyer, said the increase reflected his client's additional investment of $46,000 for roads, surveying and subdividing the land.
Whitewater was ready to sell, but the local land market was already souring. The size of the original 3,200-acre deal meant that many lots were coming up for sale simultaneously, while rocketing interest rates discouraged buyers.
Carol Wood, a Marion County real estate agent, remembers it as a frightening time. Her husband, Terry, was president of the 101 River Development Company. She and another Marion County land agent, Nancy Watts, had bought a 378-acre tract from the company for $486 an acre. But Mrs. Wood now had to scramble to make a modest profit before recession arrived in the early 1980's.
In fact, almost everyone involved in buying the 101 River land, except the Clintons and the McDougals, either broke even or made money, Mr. Wood id.
He said Whitewater, too, could have made money if it had sold its lots quickly. "Maybe they spent money on things they didn't need to," he said. "They should have gotten their investment back in 18 months."
The Clintons say Whitewater lost $160,000 of its original $203,000 investment. But since the Clintons have refused to make public the underlying documentation, that contention cannot be verified.
As of May 1980, according to an incomplete account of Whitewater's finances released in 1992 by the Clinton campaign, only a handful of lots had been sold. And of the $60,500 in sales, only $10,000 had been collected, with the rest tied up in installment contracts.
Whitewater was in a squeeze. But the partners disagree about who kept the company afloat.
In a 1992 interview, Mr. McDougal said: "I put money into it. Money was owed me. I don't remember them putting anything in."
Bruce Lindsey, a senior White House official, said the Clintons made $22,000 in interest payments on the bank loan in 1978 and 1979. The Clintons have declined to release copies of the checks or their tax returns for those years.
Trying to increase sales in 1981, Whitewater built a modest house on one of the lots, to help buyers envision what their own might look like. Mrs. Clinton borrowed $30,000 for the house, in her name, not Whitewater's, from the Kingston Bank and Trust, a bank owned by Mr. McDougal, who had by then left government work. Regulators frown upon bank executives making loans to their own corporations.
Whitewater made payments on the $30,000 loan, but the Clintons improperly deducted the interest on it from their personal taxes, the campaign acknowledged in 1992.
In 1983 and 1984, the company sold no property. Interest charges mounted, and Mr. McDougal shuffled tens of thousands of dollars from his other ventures to pay the bills. In at least one instance, more than $5,000 came from Madison Marketing, an advertising company owned by Mrs. McDougal, whose sole client was her husband's savings and loan.
 
Similar Inquiry, Different Approach
 By mid-1985, Whitewater still had 24 lots on its hands. At the end of May that year, the company transferred all of its remaining property to Chris Wade, the Flippin real estate agent who was Madison's chief sales agent. Mr. Wade said that in return he gave Whitewater an airplane worth $35,000 that was used by Madison and eventually sold to Mr. McDougal, and agreed to repay $35,000 of the $100,000 the company still owed on the original loan from Citizen's Bank and Trust.
The grand dream of a developed community along the banks of the White River never materialized. Mr. McDougal lost control of his savings and loan in 1986 and later was tried and acquitted on Federal bank fraud charges. The collapse of his savings and loan cost taxpayers $60 million and left him bankrupt; he lives today on a pension.
Federal investigators are now poring over bank records and other documents to determine whether Mr. McDougal improperly diverted money from his savings and loan to Mr. Clinton's campaign for governor or to Whitewater, or in any other way that might have benefited the Clintons.
There are questions about how Arkansas regulators responded to the early signs of collapse at Madison, at a time when Mr. Clinton and Mr. McDougal were still united in a costly business failure. The collapse of Madison cost taxpayers $60 million.
Since the case arose as a national political issue, the Clintons have been reluctant to make public the underlying documents and records that would dispel questions about Whitewater's finances.
They handled a similar inquiry very differently in 1979, when a reporter for The Arkansas Democrat found out about the land deal and began pressing for details.
Mr. Burge, the banker, said he told the reporter that such information was private. A few days later, he said, Mr. Clinton telephoned him to waive his privacy rights.
"He said, 'Tell them the truth; I've got nothing to hide,' " Mr. Burge said. "So I just told them what they wanted, and right after that the story died."

HEADLINE: Cracks in Haiti's Military Widen, Aiding Efforts to Restore Aristide

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 6

 BODY:
For the first time since international sanctions were reimposed on Haiti in October, serious tensions have increased in the military, and this could help efforts to restore the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President, diplomats and Haitian political experts say.
The tensions are underscored by a rivalry between the country's two most powerful military officers, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras and Lieut. Col. Michel Francois, who have strongly disagreed on how to resolve a political crisis that began with the ouster of Father Aristide in September 1991, the diplomats and political observers said. 
 In recent meetings with Haitian businessmen, General Cedras has argued in favor of dissolving Parliament and formally ending Father Aristide's presidency, whose third anniversary is on Monday.
According to people who have attended the meetings, General Cedras, the army commander who presided over the army coup in 1991, hinted strongly that he would seek to have himself named as the new president.
 
Impeaching Aristide Favored
 But business associates say Colonel Francois, who as police chief is widely believed to have instigated the coup, has vowed to keep Parliament intact and has favored pushing it to impeach Father Aristide and call for elections.
Diplomats said that last week, in the first open display of the split between the two men, Colonel Francois posted police agents outside Parliament to contain a demonstration by a recently formed political movement thought to be allied to General Cedras, the Grand Coalition of the North, which had threatened to close Parliament.
"For the first time they are going after each other, each in defense of his own folly," said a Haitian political analyst with close ties to the military.
 
U.S. Seeks Broader Sanctions
 The tensions within the military come as Washington is seeking to broaden economic sanctions against Haiti to cover almost everything except food and medicine. As part of the pressure against its military, Washington also plans to ask that other countries reject requests for or cancel visas held by more than 500 Haitian officers.
Members of the Haitian military say they have already been warned that if this round of visa cancellations fails to quickly bring major concessions from the army, United States visas for the officers' families will also be annulled. "The visa list includes every Haitian officer down to the level of lieutenant, and everyone who is not on it is wondering if I'm next," one diplomat said. "This thing hits them where it hurts. Officers wives are already saying to their husbands, 'It is bad enough that you can't get out when this place blows up, but what about me and the kids.' "
Haitian political analysts say the decision on visas will add to tensions in the army over high-level corruption, the rise of paramilitary groups and the government's financial strains.
"You have about 900 officers in the army," a Haitian military expert said. "Maybe 100 of them are making out like bandits, with another 100 living pretty comfortably. The rest of them are having an increasingly difficult time scraping by, paying for gas at $20 a gallon like everyone else and struggling to send their children to school."
Signs of these tensions have begun to multiply, with feverish rounds of reassignment orders from General Cedras's headquarters and outright dismissals of disgruntled army members.
This weekend in Washington, Father Aristide met with political opponents in his effort to reach a political settlement that would restore him to power.
But despite hopes that the tensions will help end the political deadlock, some political observers here caution that any return to constitutional rule depends on active support from Haiti's political class, whose members are cowed by severe army repression.
"The embargo by itself won't be enough to settle this thing," one diplomat said. "The people at the top of the army don't have the heart to say that our country has suffered enough. Haitians have to realize for themselves the importance of political work. When they do, they will be surprised to see the impact they can have against an isolated army."

HEADLINE: Study Suggests It Is Easy To Banish Squeegee Men

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
An eight-week Police Department study of squeegee men shows that officers can easily drive them away from the entrances to bridges and tunnels where most of them work. But some law-enforcement officials acknowledge that stopping them from cleaning windshields could push them toward more serious crime.
The study, which accompanied a crackdown on squeegee men during October and November, found that aggressive patrolling and arrests, typically for disorderly conduct, reduced their numbers by two-thirds. Since then, freezing temperatures and continued enforcement have kept the numbers down, the police said. 
 But while the study also found that many of the windshield washers had criminal records, it did not address a concern that has been raised by advocates for the homeless, as well as by some police and Giuliani administration officials: Will the crackdown lead squeegee men toward more violent crime to replace the $40 to $100 a week that the study determined they make washing windshields?
 
Previous Convictions
 The study, which surveyed 41 squeegee men, found that most of them had previously been convicted of crimes like selling and possessing drugs, assault, robbery and illegally possessing guns. Richard J. Schwartz, a senior adviser to the Mayor on crime issues, acknowledged concerns that the men might commit more serious crimes. But he added that they hurt the city's economy, particularly in tourism, and said more money might be available for treatment programs to help prevent other crimes if fewer windshield washers were on the streets.
"This is a situation that is a barometer for the quality of life on the streets of New York City," Mr. Schwartz said. "If you're a motorist and you are stopped at an intersection and accosted, and you have to roll up your windows because you are in New York -- that kind of issue we think is very important to address."
Richard Thomas, who says he is an alcoholic who makes his living cleaning windshields, remembers the days when squeegee men would do favors for the police like clean their windshields for free on Halloween nights after their patrol cars had been splattered with eggs.
 
'A Man Can't Hustle'
 But those days are over, he said last week as he worked the traffic coming off the George Washington Bridge in Washington Heights.
"Now the police drop out of the sky, harass us from behind our backs and arrest us," Mr. Thomas said between sips of wine. "They want us off welfare. They don't give us a job, and now a man can't hustle for a living no more. One way or another we've got to make a living."
Mr. Thomas and another squeegee man working the bridge Thursday afternoon said some of their colleagues had already turned to more serious crimes.
The 41 men surveyed in the Police Department study -- which began in the final months of the Dinkins administration when Rudolph W. Giuliani was pointing to squeegee men as a prime example of the deteriorating quality of life in New York -- had either been arrested or issued summonses for disorderly conduct or illegally soliciting money from drivers.
The study, called "Managing 'Squeegeeing': A Problem-Solving Exercise," was completed last week. It was financed by a $20,000 grant by the Police Foundation, a private policy group, and was based on arrests made by police officers from eight precincts around the city.
 
Sad Conclusion
 It concluded that squeegee men "are of a population that is largely beset with alcohol and drug abuse, economic marginality, unemployment (and, sadly, many who appear to be unemployable save some heroic efforts that go beyond any rehabilitation technologies with which we are familiar), and finally, for about half of the population, arrests for serious criminality."
Of the 41 men surveyed, 31 had homes, 5 lived in shelters and 5 indicated they were homeless. Twenty-one had been arrested for one or more counts of assault, burglary, larceny or carrying a gun. Several others had been arrested on drug charges.
Eight men told the police they had no previous arrest records, but five of those gave false names or addresses, leaving only three whose records could be verified as clean. Most of the arrested squeegee men were released from jail after a day or two. The most seriously punished was a man who had a previous record of 30 arrests and was kept in jail for 10 days.
Police records covering eight weeks of sweeps conducted for the study suggest that squeegee activities can be quickly brought under control. In the first week of the study, there were 48 sightings of squeegee men at eight locations, a number that decreased to 28 the second week, and was then reduced to 10 by the fifth week before stabilizing at 15.
 
Program Seen as a Model
 Senior police officials say their program for cracking down on the squeegee men offers a model they will now follow in dealing with problems like public urination and alcohol consumption, as well as aggressive panhandling.
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton has promised to make a forceful effort to reduce such offenses, on the theory that tolerance can breed more serious crime, an idea that is also advanced in the study of the squeegee men.
"For many predatory persons, disorder left untended is a sign that nobody cares and encourages their predatory behavior," says the squeegee report, which was prepared by Deputy Chief Michael Julian and George L. Kelling, a criminal justice researcher at Harvard University and adviser to Mr. Bratton.
Mr. Julian said squeegee men "balance the pain against the benefits, so a day in jail does the job."
"We don't even need to increase the penalty," he said.
Mr. Julian also conceded that he shared concerns that the squeegee men might commit more serious crimes, although he said, "Half of these guys already had records of theft."
"A few months from now," he added, "we'll look at the criminal records of the guys we picked up before and see if they commit other crimes."
Squeegee men say these are particularly hard times for them, and those who continue to face the winter cold and the police offensive hope that by trying to act more politely they will attract less attention.
Seeing Police Officer Richard Wells walk by on patrol on Broadway and 178th Street at the George Washington Bridge, Richard Thomas dropped his squeegee blade and squirt bottle behind a staircase banister, walked up to the officer, and shook his hand.
Officer Wells responded with a curt smile and later said: "It's not as bad now as it used to be when five or six guys worked here. Now we're down to one or two."
William Gibson, 29, who was also working at the bridge, said he would quit washing windshields as soon as he made enough money to buy a new pair of black shoes and black pants to interview for a job.
When drivers told Mr. Gibson they were not interested in his services, he bowed politely and moved on.

HEADLINE: Foes of Balanced Federal Budget Focus on Effect on Social Security

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Hitting one of the capital's most sensitive political nerves first, opponents of the proposed constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget have asserted that it would lead to cuts of $1,000 a person in Social Security benefits.
The amendment's defenders disagreed, pointing out that lawmakers treat Social Security very gingerly. And Senator Paul Simon, the Illinois Democrat who is the measure's chief sponsor, said that Social Security recipients would be helped by the amendment because it would strengthen the economy and reduce the deficit. 
 The Senate is expected to begin debating the proposed amendment late this month. As now written, the amendment would require the Federal budget to be balanced by 1999, but Mr. Simon said he would substitute a version delaying the deadline to 2001 to make the transition easier. The amendment does not tell Congress and the President how to cut Federal spending; it only says that they must.
 
Close Vote Predicted
 Families U.S.A. and other groups supportive of the elderly asserted last week that if the budget was balanced with no tax increases and proportional cuts among all varieties of Federal spending, that would lead to a $1,081 cut in individual Social Security benefits in 1999, and about $100 more in 2001.
When reporters challenged those assumptions, observing that in most deficit reduction packages, taxes have played a part, Ron Pollack, head of Families U.S.A., said that except for Mr. Simon, most of the amendment's backers say they want spending cuts, not tax cuts.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee and who is the amendment's most dedicated enemy in Congress, said the study showed "exactly the kind of real pain this amendment can cause if it were to become part of the Constitution."
Mr. Byrd predicted a close vote, but said he had faith that the Senate would not give the measure the two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, that a constitutional amendment requires.
 
'Momentum Is Building'
 When Mr. Byrd's news conference on the fifth floor of a Senate office building was over, Mr. Simon and Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, held one on the building's second floor.
Mr. Simon said balancing the budget would solidify the United States currency. "The Social Security retirement fund is secured by U.S. Government bonds," he said, "and if those bonds drop dramatically in value, then all Social Security recipients will be devastated."
Critics' assumptions "do not recognize reality," Mr. Simon said, adding that Social Security was "the last thing that gets tackled around here."
Mr. Craig said he did not think that across-the-board, equal cuts would be imposed. "Without doubt, there will be priorities," he said.
Mr. Simon said Senate passage of the amendment would be difficult because Mr. Byrd was "using the clout that he has as chairman" of the Appropriations Committee to get votes for his side. He added that he did not mean to imply that Mr. Byrd was threatening to eliminate spending for senators' pet projects if they opposed him.
"Momentum is building" for the amendment, Mr. Simon said. He said he did not doubt that proponents would have the 60 votes they needed to cut off debate on the measure and bring it to a vote.

Wall Street's Bulls Count on Small Investors

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
The stock market plunge on Friday left millions of small investors looking to Wall Street to find whether the longest bull market in history has finally run out of steam. And Wall Street is looking right back at them.
Many market savants say the rally's fate is in the hands of individual investors, who poured $128 billion into equity mutual funds in 1993 alone. Since 1990, they have used every dip in the Dow as a chance to go bargain hunting. And their buying has pushed stock prices back up, contributing to the three-year bull market. Wall Street hopes that happens again. 
 "If the public doesn't buy, it will be spooky," David Shulman, equity strategist for Salomon Brothers, said. "If we don't get buying, it will be a problem."
So far, investors do not appear to be frightened by last week's 96.24-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. Indeed, according to some analysts, they may have been looking for a correction, given that the Dow had soared 6 percent in January and had climbed more than 60 percent in the last three years.
Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company and a favorite of trigger-happy investors, received a smaller-than-average number of phone calls on Friday. While stock funds had some modest redemptions, international funds continued to attract new money, Tracey Gordon, a spokeswoman, said.
Anticipating more investor anxiety, Fidelity had extra people to answer the phones and then sent them home when the calls never came. Compared with 1987, when investor panic helped fuel the stock market's 508-point plunge, "it's just remarkable how people are very calm," Ms. Gordon said. "They've gotten religion that the market always recovers."
"Every time we've had a significant one- or two-day decline, investors have come in -- and they've made money," John C. Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds, said. As a result, he said, the market had not suffered a serious drop. But if buying on declines eventually does not prove profitable, he added, "there's a decent risk of a 10 to 20 percent market correction."
Some analysts feel that any buying now will only postpone the time when the market runs out of steam. That is because the market has been driven by falling interest rates, which over the last five years have plunged to levels last seen in the 1960's. For example, the rate on the three-month Treasury bill, which touched 9 percent in 1989, last year fell below 3 percent.
For the stock market, low rates have not only helped corporate profits by cutting the amount companies pay to borrow money, they have also sent millions of Americans flooding into equities because the returns on certificates of deposit and money market funds appeared paltry. The cascade of cash into stocks helped push prices up even though, by some traditional measures, many shares looked overpriced.
But now there are signs that the era of falling interest rates may have come to an end. On Friday, the Federal Reserve raised a key short-term interest rate to 3.25 percent from 3 percent, in what it called a pre-emptive strike to keep inflation cool while the economy heats up.
By nudging up rates for the first time in five years, and, for the first time ever, putting out a news release announcing it, the Fed sent the stock market off a cliff. Interest-sensitive stocks like those of banks, utilities and insurance companies were hit hard; the Standard & Poor's index of financial stocks dropped 2.9 percent, while the broader S.& P. 500 index fell 2.3 percent.
 
 
First Half Step
 "An increase in the Federal funds rate was expected, but the timing was earlier than expected," Richard Hoey, an economist and portfolio manager with the Dreyfus Corporation, said. Such an increase, he added, is very natural at this stage of the business cycle. Indeed, he said he thought the Fed had only taken "the first half step" in its effort to hold down inflation.
In the near term, interest rates will probably move higher, Nancy Lazar, an economist at ISI Group, said. She predicted that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which late last year had fallen as low as 5.8 percent, would climb to 6.5 percent from last week's 6.35 percent.
But by midyear, Ms. Lazar said, the bellwether bond's yield may drop again, perhaps to 5.5 percent, as inflation cools. Among the hopeful signs she cited were slowing growth in the monetary supply, a feeble global economy and "amazingly heavy" announcements of corporate layoffs, which, while awful for affected employees, count as good news on the inflation front because they discourage workers from demanding pay raises.
 
 
'This Is a Blip'
 In fact, some analysts think the current concern over inflation will soon pass, permitting the bull market to run to new heights. "I think this is a blip," Abby Joseph Cohen, a Goldman, Sachs & Company strategist, said. "It seems to us the bull market continues." The key, in her view, is that corporate profits continue to grow. "I think," she said, "this is going to continue to be a very long-lasting profit cycle."
The bulls are also encouraged because so many people remain cautious. Elaine Garzarelli, a strategist for Lehman Brothers, pointed out on Saturday that last week a survey found that only half of the investment advisers questioned called themselves bullish. Before the 1987 crash, she said, 90 percent of advisers were bulls. In the down-the-rabbit-hole world of Wall Street, many gurus believe that the more people agree on something, the less likely it is to occur.
Ms. Garzarelli said a sustained increase in interest rates could eventually pull the plug on the bull market. But in the short run, if rates rise a bit because the economy is expanding, she said, stocks are likely to climb, as analysts raise their estimates of future earnings. "So you could sell into the rally," she said.
And if short-term rates do not go up again, "we could end the year with a 15 percent gain, which," she said, "would be nice."

HEADLINE: Luis Sanchez, Peruvian Politician And a Respected Intellectual, 93

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Luis Alberto Sanchez, one of Latin America's most respected intellectuals and a longtime politician, died here today. He was 93.
He died from a recurring kidney infection, said Luis Alva Castro, a leader of Mr. Sanchez's Apra party. He had entered a hospital on Tuesday and returned on Saturday to his home in the San Isidro district of Lima. 
 A former prizefighter and fencing champion and the author of more than 100 books, Mr. Sanchez was known across the continent for his political skills. As a member of the left-leaning Apra, he built a reputation for credibility among all the mainstream political parties and generally remained above political quarrels.
Born on Oct. 12, 1900, he graduated from San Marcos University here, where he studied literature and law. He earned doctorates at the University of Lima and the University of Chile.
A leading authority on American and Latin American literature, he later taught at San Marcos, serving in later years as university rector. He also taught at Berkeley, Columbia University, colleges in Florida and Oklahoma, the Sorbonne in Paris, and universities in Madrid and Jerusalem.
Mr. Sanchez began writing for a newspaper in Peru in 1919. He went blind in the 1980's but still regularly wrote columns for newspapers and magazines and recorded radio and television commentaries.
He wrote dozens of historical novels and biographies, as well as books of poetry, political and literary essays and a four-volume work on Latin American literature. One of his most recent works was a biography published late last year of Augusto Bernardino Leguia, the dictator who ruled Peru in the 1920's.
Mr. Sanchez was a pioneer member of Apra, or the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance, formed in the 1920's as a leftist nationalist movement devoted to fighting imperialism in Latin America. Also known as Aprista, it became a significant party mainly in Peru, where it gained strength when Leguia was deposed in 1930.
Mr. Sanchez was jailed briefly by the military Government of Luis Sanchez Cerro in 1932 and spent most of the next 25 years in exile in the United States, France and Latin America.
During a 60-year political career, Mr. Sanchez was elected twice as member of a constituent assembly, twice as deputy and four times as senator. He was Senate President in the 1960's.
Apra did not come to power until Alan Garcia won the presidency in 1985. Mr. Sanchez served as Vice President and Prime Minister under Mr. Garcia, whose term ended in 1990 amid spiraling inflation, industrial unrest and allegations of corruption.
But Mr. Sanchez's reputation was unscathed because of the respect he had built up with the public and other political parties.
The general secretary of Apra, Armando Villanueva, said Mr. Sanchez's body would not be taken to Congress for a memorial ceremony because Mr. Sanchez, like his party, had refused to recognize the legitimacy of the Government of President Alberto Fujimori.
Two years after he was elected President, Mr. Fujimori seized emergency powers and shut down the old Congress in April 1992. Congressional elections were held in November of the same year, and Mr. Fujimori's backers gained control of the legislature.
Details on survivors were not immediately available.

HEADLINE: In Land of French Fry, Study Finds Problems

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OTHELLO, Wash.

 BODY:
More than 30 years ago, the king of fast food hamburgers and the patriarch of potatoes came together for a meeting that would change the American meal and create a new breed of corporate farmer.
Ray Kroc, founder of the McDonald's nationwide restaurant chain, and J. R. Simplot, the food processing and chemical magnate in Idaho, forged a deal to make perfect french-fried potatoes -- upright, bright, cheap and free of molds. They would look the same whether they were sold on the Jersey Shore or in a drive-through in Idaho. 
 The potatoes would grow in the dry, volcanic soil of the inland Pacific Northwest, then be washed, sliced, cooked and frozen in factories in this region before being shipped to fast-food outlets from sea to shining sea.
The combination of cheap Federal hydroelectric power and irrigation water made this desert region perfect for the operation, and by the mid-1980's, more than six billion pounds of potatoes were being processed by 10 big factories owned by different companies in the Columbia River Basin, providing America with most of its french fries.
 
High Cost of Uniformity
 But the process of making one fry look exactly like another has come at a big cost, according to a new report on the potato processing industry.
The demand for uniformity has created an industry that is heavy on chemicals, wastes half of every potato it processes and pollutes underground water supplies, according to the Columbia Basin Institute, a research group in Portland, Ore. Its study was financed in part by grants from the Ford Foundation, the Aspen Institute and the Bullitt Foundation of Seattle, which is concerned with environmental issues in the Northwest.
"If you want to produce most of America's french fries this way, you should have to pay the costs -- social, environmental and other," said Bill Bean, founder of the institute and co-author of the study. "We've got a uniform french fry, but it came with a lot of hidden costs."
Industry leaders say much of the criticism is wrong or misleading. They say they have cleaned up many of the environmental problems, investing millions of dollars to better dispose of the water used to wash and cook a perfect fry. They say they provide more than 4,000 year-round jobs, among the best-paying in the low-skill farm sector. And they say they have kept alive rural communities that otherwise might have had severe unemployment and a declining tax base.
 
Cheap Power and Water
 The french fry producers here have prospered in part because of public works projects that provide cheap electrical power and bring water to what was once an unpopulated desert.
More than 50 years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned the Columbia Basin as a haven for Dust Bowl refugees who could farm the desert with the help of irrigation water provided by Federal dams and reservoirs. The laws were written so that people who own and run small farms would be the primary beneficiaries of Federal water projects coming from Grand Coulee Dam and other big dams on the Columbia River.
But over the last 30 years, small farms in this region have all but disappeared, replaced by large corporate operations that can afford the heavy fertilizers and chemicals needed in growing the thick Russet potato used for making french fries.
 
Subsidies Criticized
 Before the mass marketing of frozen fries, about 1,000 farmers grew a variety of potatoes on 20,000 acres in this area; now, half as many farmers grow mostly Russet Burbank potatoes on 115,000 acres.
The irrigated farm land in the Columbia Basin is second only to the Imperial Valley of Southern California in size and the amount of support it receives from the Federal Government. State funds from Washington and Oregon were also used to lure the processors here.
Mr. Bean contends that these subsidies are "an unnecessary and gratuitous use of public funds."
The french fry producers say they probably would have come here even without the government enticements. But as long as the subsidies were offered, they said, they took them.
"We would be the first to admit that we're not perfect," said William Voss, president of McCain Foods, a large processor that received a $5 million loan from Washington State. "But this is an industry that has brought thousands of well-paying, year-round jobs to this region."
Community leaders here tend to agree with Mr. Voss.
 
Fast Food Love Affair
 And indeed, what the Government has helped to produce, in large part, is an industry that might never have come into existence if Americans did not have such a love affair with burgers and french fries. Before the perfect fry was created, most fast food restaurants employed teen-agers to wash, peel and cook fresh french fries.
Now those jobs are done in foul-smelling factories here in the Columbia Basin, where each plant uses more than two million gallons of water a day and the fries are frozen when they leave the factory.
A stench hangs over the factories, a residue of cooking oil and processing. A request for a tour was turned down by industry officials, who said they did not generally allow outsiders to see to how french fries are made.
Industry officials say that if potatoes were square or rectangular, they could use the entire potato to make fries. But because of its shape, only the core is cut into fries. What is left is used for slop for cattle in feed lots, and the strained waste water from the factories is sprayed onto fields for irrigation and fertilization.
 
High Levels of Nitrates
 But now the underground water supply in the Columbia Basin is showing high levels of nitrates from fertilizer and farm and animal waste, prompting investigations by state and Federal environmental officials.
The potato processing industry attributes the heavy nitrate concentrations to past agricultural practices and poor municipal treatment centers. They say their most polluted waste water is contained in smaller pools near the plants and is not a threat to drinking water, a contention challenged by some critics of the industry.
Producing most of America's french fries has created the equivalent of a "smokestack industry" along the Columbia, according to the report. At the 10 plants, three shifts of workers every day produce the vegetable of choice for fast food consumers. The pay ranges from $6 to $9 an hour, on average.
About half the workers are relatively new arrivals from Mexico or the Southwest, according to state labor officials.
Here in this agricultural town of about 4,600 people in southeastern Washington, many workers live in a rundown section known as Little Mexico, within smelling distance of a huge feed lot. Sally Jaime, president of Hispanos Unidos, a group representing some of the factory workers, describes it as a "barrio" and argues that the industry should take more responsibility for its condition.
Tensions between the Anglo and Latino populations in Othello are high, civic leaders say, because the area has changed so quickly with the influx of factory workers. Without the french fries, though, the town may have died. And the workers say the pay is relatively high and the jobs relatively stable, with benefits that include health care.
"We're proud of our Latino work force," said Craig Smith, a vice president of the Northwest Food Processors Assocition, which represents the industry. "The fact is we didn't create that neighborhood."
Mr. Smith was sitting in a McDonald's in Othello, arguably the potato capital of the world. But the fries sold here taste and look the same as they do thousands of miles from the potato fields.
"The consumer is the ultimate driver of all this," Mr. Smith said. "McDonald's doesn't tell us how to grow potatoes. If those fries had brown spots, if one of them didn't look right and people would still buy them, it would be a lot easier for us to make french fries."

The report also asserts that the industry is heavy on chemicals and wastes half of every potato it processes. (Photographs by Jeff Green for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Sharpton Is Rebaptized As Baptist in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES

 BODY:
The Rev. Al Sharpton, who was ordained a Pentecostal minister at the age of 10, was rebaptized as a Baptist yesterday, officially joining the religious tradition of the civil rights advocates he said he reveres and emulates.
Mr. Sharpton, his wife, Katherine, and their children, Dominick, 7, and Ashley, 6, were among a dozen people baptized during the service at Bethany Baptist Church in Brooklyn. But many in the congregation made no secret that they had come to see Mr. Sharpton, a fixture on the political scene who has said he will run for the United States Senate for the second time. 
 Among those in attendance were the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and Mr. Sharpton's mother, who flew in from Alabama.
The baptism signaled a coming home of sorts, Mr. Sharpton said. The Rev. Dr. William Augustus Jones, pastor of Bethany Baptist, has been a mentor to Mr. Sharpton for more than 20 years. And the symbolic plunge beneath the water officially made Mr. Sharpton, 39, a member of a religious denomination that helped nurture and sustain the civil rights movement and its leaders -- a legacy he said he tried to uphold.
 
Following a Tradition
 "Reverend Jones has always been an anchor to my family," Mr. Sharpton said after the service. "And the progressive Baptist church is the tradition of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rev. Jesse Jackson. That's the tradition I come from. And I wanted my family to be in that tradition."
During the baptisms the congregation sang, their voices quieting only when Mr. Jones lifted his arms and, saying, "In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost," dipped the faithful into the baptismal.
Shortly before the ceremony, Mr. Jackson approached the pulpit and spoke a few words on behalf of Mr. Sharpton and the others about to make a new spiritual commitment.
"We come as empty pitchers asking you to fill us up," Mr. Jackson said. "We come as broken vessels. We ask you to fix us. We come as sinners. We ask you to forgive us."
"Let something happen during the time we step down, go down and come up," he said of the plunge into the water.
Mr. Sharpton was the last to be baptized, exchanging his black suit for a white smock and cap. Afterward, as he stood with his eyes closed and face wet, the congregation exploded in applause.
 
'Glad to Have Him'
 Mr. Jones, Bethany's pastor for 31 years, said that every baptism was special but that Mr. Sharpton had been a special charge for many years. "His mother brought him to me 25 years ago and asked me to take him under my wing," Mr. Jones said. "I never asked him to come here. But we're glad to have him."
Bethany, the first black church established in Bedford-Stuyvesant, was the New York headquarters in the 1960's for Operation Breadbasket, the economic action arm of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
Most recently, the church played a role in the case involving Tawana Brawley, a young black girl who contended that she had been raped and beaten by white racists, and for whom Mr. Sharpton was an adviser. The church offered sanctuary to Ms. Brawley's mother when she was cited for contempt after refusing to testify before a grand jury, and it was the site of rallies in support of Ms. Brawley. The authorities later said Ms. Brawley's accusations were false.
Mr. Sharpton said he planned to be ordained as a Baptist minister sometime in the future. But he has no plans to spend his days standing behind a pulpit.
"I'm not interested in pastoring," he said. "I'm doing civil rights work full time. But you need an anchor. And I need a place for my children to grow up."

HEADLINE: Japan Auto Makers Navigate a Leaner U.S. Market

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Japanese auto executives do not have to be reminded about the Chrysler Corporation's new Neon, the small car with the low price that has been dubbed a "Japanese car killer." It is just the latest threat to Japanese auto manufacturing, which these days finds itself in the unaccustomed role of being on the retreat in a growing American market.
But the Neon has already been recalled twice because of defects, a portent perhaps that any notion of knocking out the Japanese may be fanciful. 
 "We haven't been killed yet," Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the president of the Honda Motor Company, remarked when asked recently about the Neon.
 
Remedial Steps by Japanese
 Indeed, Japanese auto makers are taking steps to regain the share of the United States market they lost over the last two years, or at least to stop slipping further. They are planning new models and trying to plug holes in their product lines in mini-vans and sport utility vehicles. And they are slashing costs at home and shifting production to the United States in an effort to hold down prices in the face of a stronger yen.
Doubt that the Japanese can come back is dispelled by looking at the Nissan Motor Company. After losing ground in the American market for a decade, Nissan's sales in the United States shot up 17 percent last year on the basis of its hot-selling, made-in-America Altima sedan. And its market share rose to 4.9 percent from 4.5 percent, making it the only Japanese company that gained market share.
"Based on the Nissan experience, Detroit will very quickly be faced yet again with a significant challenge from Japan," said Stephen Usher of Kleinwort Benson Securities here.
But other analysts are more pessimistic, saying the Japanese companies will have difficulty. Because of the high exchange value of the yen, analysts estimate that a Japanese car is $1,500 to $3,000 more expensive than an equivalent American model.
Some Japanese executives disclaim much interest in market share and say they would be content to see their sales rise, even if not as fast as the overall market. Toyota says it is looking to sell the same number of vehicles in the United States this year as in 1993, meaning that its share would slip again -- from a current 7.4 percent -- if the overall market grows robustly, as expected.
Japanese companies may not want to portray themselves as threats at a time auto trade negotiations are at a crucial juncture. But statements of such limited vistas also suggest that the Japanese, with their profits taking a shellacking from the slump at home and in Europe, cannot afford to cut prices in the United States to gain market share. Some think they may have to keep raising prices.
While the yen's rise was perhaps the main reason that Japan's overall share of the American car and light- truck markets slipped for two years -- to 23.1 percent in 1993 from 25.7 percent in 1991 -- there are two other reasons. One is the improvement in the quality, design and cost competitiveness of the cars made by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
 
Underestimated Markets
 The other is that the Japanese companies missed out on the boom in pickup trucks, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, which now account for roughly 40 percent of the American light-vehicle market.
Japanese makers held 29.1 percent of the passenger car market in 1993, down only 1.1 percent in the two years. But in light trucks, their market share last year was 13.6 percent.
Japanese executives say they misjudged the extent of this market shift. In addition, pickup trucks and two-door sport utility vehicles are classified as commercial vehicles and are subject to a 25 percent United States tariff, virtually pricing such models out of the American market.
But the Japanese companies have some advantages, not least loyal American customers happy with their Japanese cars for years. And they still have a quality edge, if a shrinking one, which translates into a higher resale value for used cars.
The surest way for the Japanese to gain back market share is with popular new products, as Nissan showed with the Altima and also with the Quest mini-van, built for it by Ford.
This year Nissan is hoping to increase sales 10 to 20 percent, said Misutaka Kurumisawa, deputy general manager of European and North American operations. It will introduce a new Maxima, its high-end sedan, in the spring, followed about a year from now by a new Sentra, its economy model.
Honda, long the epitome of success in the United States, saw its sales drop 6.8 percent last year and its market share, including its Acura division, fall to 5.1 percent from 6 percent in 1992. The company expects a sales increase this year because of a new Accord introduced last summer, and it has started to sell a sport utility vehicle made by Isuzu. Until now Honda has made only passenger cars.
Later this year Honda will introduce a mini-van of its own design. Executives here say the vehicle will be innovative, a cross between a passenger car and current mini-vans. The new product, based on the Accord, is expected to have a lower floor than most mini-vans, allowing easier entry yet a high ceiling to maintain the roominess of a van.
 
Leasing Helps
 To compensate for higher prices, Japanese vendors are leasing more aggressively. Monthly payments are determined in part by how much the car will be worth when the lease ends. Since Japanese cars generally retain higher resale value than American models, the Japanese companies can offer lower monthly payments, offsetting the difference in retail prices.
Virtually all the companies are increasing production at their American factories to protect their costs from the rise of the yen.
They are also designing and producing some models specifically for the American market. Toyota is doing that with its new Avalon, a roomier replacement for the high-end Cressida that was announced at the Chicago Auto Show last week. Honda plans to design and build a new model of the Acura in the United States for introduction in the 1996 model year.
In the long run, the Japanese hope to cut costs enough to compensate for the yen's rise, but that will take time. Motoo Suzuki, a managing director at Mitsubishi Motors, said it was possible to cut the manufacturing costs by 3 to 5 percent a year at most.
"It's very hard to cut costs in existing models," said Seiji Tanaka, a managing director of Mazda. But when models change, they can be redesigned to cut manufacturing costs by 10 percent, he said.
One big effort is to reduce the costs of parts and raw material, a big part of production costs. Japanese executives also say that in the past they have made too many models and offered too many options.
 
Stable Price for Accord
 Honda cut development and retooling costs of its new Accord by reorganizing the development process and carrying over many parts from the old Accord. As a result, the new Accord has an improved engine and other new features, but its base price is unchanged. Honda plans to use the same process to cut the development costs of a new Civic due with the 1996 cars.
The new model of the home-market Nissan Sunny, the car that will become the new Sentra in the United States, has 46 fewer variations than the previous model and shares 45 percent of its parts with the previous model or with other cars.
Some analysts suggest that profit pressures could hurt the Japanese makers' ability to regain market share, saying the companies will be reluctant to invest in more American capacity after the current round of expansion is over or to invest boldly in vans and sport vehicles.
"They can't afford to take on investments that might not be successful," said Ben Moyer of Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, adding that the situation in the auto industry now "is on the side of the American companies, and I assume it will stay there for a while."
Chris Cedergren, senior vice president of AutoPacific Inc., a market research firm in Santa Ana, Calif., foresees a tug-of-war, with American companies sacrificing some potential market share this year when they shut down plants for model changes. "The Japanese aren't going to gobble up share again," he said. "But the Big Three won't take share back."

HEADLINE: Once Welcomed, Black Artists Return To an Indifferent France

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Attending a conference here last week on the relationship between black American artists and Europe, Prof. Henry Louis Gates Jr., the chairman of the department of Afro-American studies at Harvard University, was surprised to find himself mistaken for a taxi driver.
"There I was standing in the lobby of my chic Latin Quarter hotel, in my handmade suit, Burberry coat and Paul Stuart scarf, when this French couple comes up to me and asks whether I'm their cabdriver," Professor Gates said. "I was polite, I just said no. At the time I was angry, but thinking about it later, I was furious. Those guys just weren't seeing me." 
 Time was, black American writers and painters came to Paris precisely to be seen and recognized, to become visible after the "invisibility" of life in the United States, as captured by Ralph Ellison. Here the air was less oppressive, and artists including James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Beauford Delaney, Ed Clark and Herbert Gentry came to savor it.
"Paris is where I find myself," Delaney, who painted luminous portraits of the French writer Jean Genet, said in the 1950's.
But today, with a wave of more or less avowed racism sweeping Western Europe as it grapples with a long recession and a wave of immigrants from Eastern Europe and north Africa, the situation is rather different. The French Government has recently introduced legislation making it more difficult for immigrants to gain French nationality. Interior Minister Charles Pasqua has said he intends to fill buses, planes and boats with deported immigrants in a drive to turn France into what he has called a "zero immigration" country.
 
'A Real Nice Village'
 For the many black American artists attending the three-day conference held in the French Senate, Paris was clearly a place for a stimulating sojourn rather than any spiritual haven. "A real nice village," as one participant from New York put it.
But the conference, called "A Visual Arts Encounter: African-Americans and Europe," took place amid virtually complete indifference from the French press and Paris galleries, despite the presence of such distinguished artists as Raymond Saunders, Sam Gilliam, Faith Ringgold, Dewey Crumpler, Betye Saar and Martin Puryear.
Where men like Baldwin were cult figures in Paris, and later the Black Power movement fascinated French intellectuals, turning the city into what the French writer and teacher Michel Fabre once called "a passage leading to the continent of negritude," the French capital now seemed merely uninterested.
"Almost nobody came from the Paris galleries, despite my invitations," said Maica Sanconie, a French woman who was one of the organizers and is a director of the contemporary trans-Atlantic arts program of the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland. "If the artists had been white Americans, they would have come. But somehow the gallery owners here imagine these people are second category. Even the curator of the Musee Seita, which recently exhibited Jean-Michel Basquiat, failed to show up."
Basquiat, whose powerful, disjointed canvases have been seen here as carrying an essential symbolism of the black condition in America, is one of the very few black American artists to have gained a strong following here in recent years, being hailed by once critic, Nicholas Bourriaud, as a "black Picasso." Basquiat's early death -- in 1988, at the age of 27 -- has added to his mystique. Mr. Puryear's sculptures have also gained a considerable following.
 
Liberation in Anonymity
 But if the conference remained fairly anonymous, this very anonymity evidently amounted to something of a liberation for some of the artists present.
Several expressed frustration with what they called the increasing difficulty of open debate in an American society so taken up with according the proper respect to the rights and culture of each ethnic group that open exchange sometimes collapses under the deadening weight of political correctness.
"I don't do black art," said Mr. Saunders, who spends part of his time in Paris and has had successful shows at the small Galerie Resche in the Latin Quarter. "I'm just a black person who happens to be a painter. Separation won't work; us against them won't work. What worries me is that nobody is being protective of the human quality of what we're all about."
Mr. Saunders, a professor at the California College of Arts and Crafts, added: "Paris seemed like a good place to get these views aired."
 
Losing the Old Baggage
 Mr. Crumpler echoed such thoughts, urging the conference to "unload some of these African-American questions, and spend less time worrying about all this baggage we bring over here, and more time thinking about our art." But politics tended to dominate the discussions, leading Ms. Saar to lament that "the art esthetic has not been brought out here much."
Professor Gates was delighted by what he called the freedom of the exchange. A moderator on one of panels, he suggested that some of the views expressed -- such as Mr. Saunders's statement that he does not "do black art" -- would have "caused fury in some academic circles in the United States."
Ms. Ringgold, whose colorful quilts have gained a wide following in the United States, expressed a rather different view from Mr. Saunders. "I don't believe that to say you do black art means you're segregated," she said. "There is no art that comes out of nothing. Images have a color, and the most significant image is one's own. Mine is black. That's good and I love it."
Having first visited in Paris in 1961, when she found herself more welcomed as a black woman than in many parts of the United States, Ms. Ringgold was struck by the changes that irked Professor Gates.
"In 1961, I could just walk into any hotel here and that was groovy because that wasn't the case in America," she said. "I felt freer. But today I don't think African-Americans come to Europe to gain recognition. It's easier to establish yourself in America. If anything, you just come here to broaden your scope."

HEADLINE: H.M.O.'s That Offer Choice Are Gaining in Popularity

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Addressing one of the thorniest issues in the debate on health care, employers across the country have found a way to tame rising costs while still allowing their employees the freedom they covet to choose their own doctors and hospitals.
Often called open-ended H.M.O.'s, or point-of-service plans, such plans have gone from a little-used option to become the fastest-growing type of health plan in the nation. Open-ended plans gained more than 3.4 million members from January 1992 to June 1993, including half of all people who joined health maintenance organizations in that period. The country's largest H.M.O., Kaiser Permanente, started offering an open-ended plan to some of its members just last month. 
 The plans have also made their way into the Clinton Administration's health proposals and, if adopted, would be offered to every American. Both the White House and private insurers are pressing for the open-ended approach as an inducement to win over skeptical consumers who fear they may lose control of their health care if they join an H.M.O.
 
Escape Hatch from H.M.O.
 The plans are hybrids, combining the economic discipline of an H.M.O. with some of the free-wheeling latitude of a traditional health plan. The hybrid plans have the tight restrictions common to H.M.O.'s, which offer treatment from a network of doctors and hospitals. But there is an escape hatch. Members can ignore the network at any time and go to any physician or hospital, if they are willing to pay extra for the privilege.
It can be expensive to switch back and forth. Instead of the usual $10 charge for an office visit in the network, a patient seeing an outside physician typically pays the first several hundred dollars of the bills, and then 20 to 50 percent of the remainder, up to a maximum of about $1,200 a year. The employer pays the rest.
Lauren Johnson, who recruits employees for Resource Bancshares Mortgage Group, a financial services company in Columbia, S.C., said she paid the first $400 a year and then 30 percent of each bill to visit her general practitioner, who charges about $40 for a basic visit and is not in her company's open-ended network.
"A lot of times money isn't the factor," she said. "I've been going to him for so long that I really didn't want to change."
But Mrs. Johnson pays only $10 a visit when she sees her obstetrician-gynecologist or takes her daughter to a pediatrician, both of whom are in a United Healthcare Corporation H.M.O. "You get the best of both worlds," she said. Services provided by plan doctors and hospitals are not subject to a deductible.
Though only about 20 percent of the people in these plans ever use the escape hatch because of the expense, they still want the freedom to choose. It is this sense of control that is making the plans, which were introduced a few years ago, so popular.
"There's a segment of people who have a claustrophobic feeling about being locked into a health program," said Mike Israelite, an assistant vice president of Cigna Healthcare, which operates a big network of open-ended H.M.O.'s. "These plans break through that psychological barrier."
Although some managed-care experts deprecate the effectiveness of the hybrid plans, saying the choice is often a delusion for low-income employees who cannot afford to pay for extras, advocates say their role is crucial as the country moves toward managed care.
 
A Favorite in Washington
 The Federal Government has been promoting H.M.O.'s since the Nixon Administration, contending that disciplined groups of doctors following certain rules of practice can slow the upward medical cost spiral and improve the quality of care. But H.M.O.'s that are not open-ended still cover only about one in four insured Americans.
There have also been less rigorous attempts to manage health care. Many traditional plans now require doctors to get approval from a designated expert before expensive treatments. And loosely managed networks of physicians and hospitals, called preferred-provider organizations, accept reduced fees from employers, who pass the savings along to their employees as an incentive to use the doctors in the organization.
Under the Clinton health bill, every health plan would offer a hybrid H.M.O. along with other types of managed care. It would also offer traditional insurance, in which patients could choose any doctor and pay 20 percent of the charges.
"Patients will be able to go see the providers of their choosing," said Dr. Arnold Epstein, a senior White House health care adviser. "People tend to think of the point-of-service plans as the best of both worlds."
The membership of the hybrid plans has tripled in the last two years, said Jon Gabel, benefits research director of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting and benefits consulting firm. He said traditional insurance had lost ground, dropping to 42 percent of health plan members last year from 53 percent in 1991.
The loosely managed physician networks also seem to be losing favor, and Mr. Gabel said a growing number had changed into hybrid health plans. They are adopting features similar to those of H.M.O.'s, sometimes paying doctors a fee for each patient, instead of for each service, and increasing the network's control over the way its doctors practice medicine.
Stanford University, for example, abandoned its discount network last month. It offered its 9,500 employees new choices that Barbara Butterfield, a university vice president, described as "pretty close to what the Clinton Administration is hoping for."
Stanford employees have three choices, with graduated payments. An H.M.O. is the least expensive, while going outside the H.M.O. to a Blue Shield-approved doctor costs a bit more. The most expensive choice is consulting any doctor and paying a $500 deductible and 40 percent of the cost.
Southern California Edison is also planning to drop its version of the discount networks. Its 17,000 employees will have to choose between a hybrid H.M.O. or one without the escape hatch, Margaret Jordan, an Edison vice president, said.
New enrollment in hybrid plans provided half of the increase of nearly 7 million people, to 47 million, in all types of H.M.O.'s from December 1991 to June 1993, according to the latest survey by the SMG Marketing Group, a market research firm.
These hybrid plans had 6.8 million members last June, up from 4.9 million in December 1992 and 3.4 million in the beginning of 1992.
Nearly all large health maintenance organizations offer a hybrid program, according to the Group Health Association of America, an H.M.O. trade group.
The latest is Kaiser Permanente, which announced last month that it was offering a hybrid plan to some of its 6.6 million H.M.O. members.
Managed-care experts said large employers that offered the hybrid plans included A.T.& T., Chevron, Marriott, Mobil, Procter & Gamble and Rockwell International.
Most employers say these plans cost them no more than ordinary H.M.O.'s because the few employees who use the escape hatch end up paying the difference in higher charges by outside doctors.
"It's cost-neutral for us," said Sean Healy, a spokesman for Allied Signal, a diversified manufacturer, which started one of the first big hybrid H.M.O.'s in 1988.
At Advanced Flex Inc., a printer of circuit boards, which has 300 employees, "no one has ever chosen to go out" and bear the extra cost, said Mary Pat Pearson, corporate manager of human resources.
But David F. Simon, a senior vice president of the U.S. Healthcare Corporation, a large H.M.O., said the hybrid plans could be deceptive. Although U.S. Healthcare has its own hybrid plan, he said that some companies' versions were "incredibly limited" by the high charges.
Still, the United Healthcare Corporation, a big diversified managed-care company, based in Minnetonka, Minn., said the hybrid H.M.O.'s appealed strongly to small and midsize employers.

HEADLINE: In Rate Move, Fed Tries to Address Fear of Future

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Behind the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates on Friday -- and its precedent-shattering decision to announce the move -- lies a striking phenomenon: despite years of slowing inflation, the American people do not believe that prices will stay fairly stable and that interest rates will stay low.
The evidence for this sentiment can be found not in polls but in the decisions that millions of Americans make on consumer credit every year. Consider home loans. Four-fifths of all home buyers take out fixed-rate mortgages, even though such loans have interest rates nearly twice as high as those for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages. 
 In other words, Americans are so sure that interest rates will rise in coming years that they choose not to save themselves a lot of money at the outset. As recently as the mid-1980's, two-thirds of American mortgages were adjustable-rate mortgages.
When Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before a Congressional panel last Monday, he made no secret of his concern about Americans' persistent expectations that inflation would return. He highlighted the fact that long-term interest rates for Government bonds have been much higher this year than short-term rates.
 
 
Fed Under Attack
 Yet fear and skepticism over the future have come at a politically awkward time for the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank. On the one hand, it is in charge of holding down inflation -- and indirectly long-term interest rates -- by raising short-term interest rates when the economy appears to be growing too quickly. On the other, the Treasury Department and some powerful members of Congress are trying to shear the Fed of some powers, and interest-rate increases are seldom popular in Congress.
The Treasury wants to take away many of the Fed's powers to regulate banks, while Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, the Democratic chairman of the House Banking Committee, is seeking to curb the Fed's secrecy and autonomy.
The Fed managed on Friday to address the fear and skepticism without antagonizing Congress much or the Administration at all. It did so by raising interest rates for overnight loans between banks by a modest quarter of a percentage point while announcing the move, something the Fed had never done before in its 80-year history.
 
 
Same Effect as a Half-Point Move
 The result was that investors took notice, and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 96.24 points on Friday. John P. Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said that by announcing the quarter-point move, the Fed had the same effect on the financial markets as if it had raised short-term interest rates by half a percentage point without an announcement.
"They were able to get the markets' attention, in a rapt way, with the most modest move they could have considered," he said.
Fed officials said the decision to announce the interest rate increase was made without regard to the politics of the issue. "Chairman Greenspan decided to announce this action immediately so as to avoid any misunderstanding" of the Fed's intentions, given that the Fed had not tightened monetary policy since early 1989, the agency said in a statement.
But few people on Wall Street or on Capitol Hill believed the Fed this weekend. Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the House Banking Committee and the Fed's closest ally in Congress, said politics had indeed played a role in the Fed's decision to announce the rate increase.
"I think it was a factor, but probably not the dominant factor," Mr. Leach said in a telephone interview today, while hastily adding that Fed officials had not asked his advice on the announcement despite frequent meetings with him.
In any case, the Fed did manage to forestall most criticism. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who waged a personal campaign this winter to try to strip the Fed of most of its bank regulatory powers, avoided endorsing the Fed's move when he appeared on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" this morning, but was complimentary all the same.
"We want to see a long-term, sustained growth for our country's economy, with modest inflation, and that's what we're striving for, and I think the Fed is, too," Mr. Bentsen said.
Mr. Leach said, "I personally think it's an appropriate thing to do."
Mr. Gonzalez issued a carefully worded statement on Friday that applauded the Fed for its prompt disclosure while including his customary criticism of any restriction on the growth of bank reserves, which is how the Fed raises short-term interest rates.
"Slow money growth will drag down the economy -- not a wise or compassionate move when millions of Americans are in dire straits and nearly 7 percent of the labor force is unemployed," he said.
But Mr. Gonzalez was unusual in publicly reacting to the Fed's actions. Most members of Congress have abstained from such a step, at least as long as a rate increase does not cause the stock market to collapse.
A few economists attributed the Fed's moves on Friday simply to a bureaucratic interest in reassuring markets that it was still alert to the risks of inflation even though it had not changed short-term interest rates in nearly a year and a half.
"The Fed apparently came to the conclusion that it had to demonstrate to the public that it was alive," Milton Friedman, the noted economist and historian of the Fed, said.

HEADLINE: Storm Warnings on Health Care

 BODY:
President Clinton's health care bill was roughed up several times last week. Splashy opposition came from three business groups. But the more damaging blow came from the state governors, who adopted principles strikingly different from the President's.
Debate is raging at two levels. There is dispute over purpose: Should every American be guaranteed coverage? And there is dispute over architecture: How should health care institutions be configured? The President promised to veto any plan that fails to provide universal coverage, but will negotiate over architecture. He learned last week that two powerful constituencies have not accepted either part of the bargain. 
 It might seem odd that the Business Roundtable, an organization of 200 of the largest corporations, voted in favor of Representative Jim Cooper's bill over Mr. Clinton's. Mr. Cooper's bill would raise taxes on these corporations because they provide workers with expensive coverage, whereas Mr. Clinton's bill offers them a bribe by promising to absorb their huge costs of insuring early retirees.
True, Mr. Cooper would not require employers to buy insurance for their workers as Mr. Clinton would. But these Fortune 500 companies do not fear employer mandates because they, unlike many small companies, already cover their workers.
The Administration attributes the Roundtable decision to pressure by pharmaceutical and insurance firms. But that explains few votes. More likely, the mostly Republican C.E.O.'s preferred Mr. Cooper's more market-based approach to the President's price controls and heavy-handed regulation. Whatever the reason, the business group most likely to embrace Mr. Clinton's bill turned its back.
But the Roundtable at least voted for something constructive -- even though Mr. Cooper's bill does not provide universal coverage. By contrast, the Chamber of Commerce, which represents many small businesses, rejected every bill in sight -- putting short-term profits above solving the nation's foremost domestic problem. The National Association of Manufacturers also rejected Mr. Clinton's bill, but with more conciliatory language.
Mr. Clinton might be able to survive business opposition. Not so the governors. Washington will find it hard to overhaul one-seventh of the economy without the states' enthusiastic support. Though the governors embraced some key principles of the President's bill, they rejected price controls and what they feared would be job-threatening employer mandates.
And bravely, the governors sided with Mr. Cooper in calling for tax hikes on expensive health care policies -- the best way to compel buyers to pay attention to costs and raise money for subsidizing the poor.
The President can work with the governors and groups like the Roundtable, which are willing to back responsible alternatives. His first task is to heed the call to strip away numbingly complex and needlessly regulatory provisions. In return, he can push his critics to move all the way to universal coverage. With that strategy, last week's setbacks need not derail eventual victory.

HEADLINE: Racketeering Ruling Leaves Some Uneasy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"When Is Protest Not Protest? When You Call It Extortion" (The Week in Review, Jan. 30) lists Greenpeace as co-signer of a friend-of-the-court brief for respondents in National Organization for Women v. Scheidler, on anti-abortion protests. Greenpeace made no submission to the Supreme Court in this case. 
 The question presented to the Court (does the Federal racketeering statute require economic motive?) did not require consideration of First Amendment issues of nonviolent, peaceful protest. As expected, the Court did not address those issues.
In a concurring opinion, however, Justices David Souter and Anthony Kennedy gave voice to the fear of many who filed briefs that racketeering actions "could deter protected advocacy." The Justices cautioned "courts applying RICO to bear in mind the First Amendment interests that could be at stake."
As an organization that has never condoned violence or destruction of property, Greenpeace does not expect the Supreme Court decision to affect its own peaceful, nonviolent protests against environmental degradation. We would be foolhardy, however, not to recognize the potential for serious harm that polluters and others could inflict simply by burdening with racketeering suits those who protest their destructive activities, while First Amendment issues are still being sorted out by the lower courts.
Congress may well want to reconsider what its broad racketeering law may reap.

HEADLINE: Where Three-Strikes Plan Takes Us in 20 Years

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is disheartening to see intelligent political figures like President Bill Clinton and New York's Gov. Mario M. Cuomo embracing with shameless enthusiasm the "three strikes and you're out" proposal. 
 Despite the broad public appeal of it, these leaders must surely realize that locking up three-time violent offenders for life would do nothing to control crime, would wreak havoc on our prison systems and would result in squandering huge amounts of government resources.
In New York State, such a proposal would affect 300 offenders a year. In the short term it would have no effect on crime or prisons because these people will be incarcerated under existing laws anyway. But the long-term consequences would be calamitous. In 20 years, for example, New York would have in custody 6,000 people who would have to stay confined, at state expense, not only past, say, 40 years old, by which time virtually all of them will have aged out of any inclinations to additional violence, but also for their entire lives.
Prison officials would be charged with running geriatric institutions, instead of correctional facilities, for thousands of inmates no longer dangerous to public safety, and taxpayers would be picking up the tab involving billions of dollars in operating and construction costs.
So, of course, less money would be available to support measures that actually stand a chance of reducing crime, ranging from drug rehabilitation and community policing to economic development programs. It should also be noted that most jurisdictions already have on their books mandatory sentencing statutes that will send three-time felony losers away for a long time.
"Three strikes and you're out" represents extension of a policy that has proved a failure: prison expansion. Since 1973, New York's prison population has grown more than 500 percent, from 12,500 inmates to 64,500 today. But can anyone argue that the streets are safer, or that drug abuse and violence are less a threat to the quality of our lives?
It is time for the American public to see past the pandering of political leaders and understand that tough-sounding baseball metaphors are no substitute for smart, effective anti-crime policies.
