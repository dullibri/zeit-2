HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ELECTORATE;
Bush Loses Luster in a Poll As Gore Sheds Poor Image

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE with JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
As Gov. George W. Bush of Texas finds himself in a rancorous primary struggle, voters' impressions of him nationally have diminished so substantially that now as many people dislike him as like him, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
These findings are particularly striking given that for months Mr. Bush towered over the Republican and Democratic fields in poll after poll. But Mr. Bush's Republican challenger, Senator John McCain of Arizona, is in a markedly improved position after his 19-point victory in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 1. In November, voters knew little about Mr. McCain; now, more people like him than do not, by nearly 3 to 1. 
 In contrast to Mr. Bush, Vice President Al Gore has enjoyed some success in overcoming a decidedly negative image and has benefited from a huge proportion of Americans who credit President Clinton for a flourishing economy.
The most heartening news for the vice president and for the Democratic Party were several signs in the survey that Republicans might find it daunting to compete with Democrats next November on both the presidential and Congressional levels.
During the Republican debate in South Carolina on Tuesday night, both Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain presented themselves as best prepared to steer the country out of the Clinton era. But that may not be such a prudent selling point, especially among Democrats and independents, because the poll found that the president still draws high marks for his job performance.
Although only 43 percent of those polled said they liked Mr. Clinton personally, his job approval rating stood at 60 percent and his stewardship of the economy drew a 73 percent approval.
This is all encouraging for the vice president. When registered voters were asked why they liked Mr. Gore, the highest proportion, 22 percent, said it was because of the Clinton administration's record, more than double since last November. An additional 17 percent said it was because of Mr. Gore's experience as vice president.
The results are quite a turnabout from last year, when Mr. Gore was struggling to contain the surge by his Democratic opponent, former Senator Bill Bradley, while also keeping a distance from the scandals at the White House.
Mr. Clinton remarked on the Democrats' good fortune at his news conference in Washington yesterday. Asked why the two Republicans had condemned him in the debate, he said: "I have a lot of sympathy with Governor Bush and Senator McCain. It's hard for them to figure out what to run on."
Complicating Mr. Bush's challenge is that registered voters polled are now as likely to hold a negative view of him as a positive one, a pronounced shift from late last year, when he was far more popular. Mr. Bush has suffered in part, the poll found, because voters do not link him with a particular set of policies and are not enamored of his tax-cut plan.
As Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush compete ferociously in the run-up to the primary on Saturday in South Carolina, the Democratic contest nationally seems to have evaporated in the eyes of many voters. Mr. Bradley's losses to Mr. Gore in New Hampshire and Iowa have made him less of a factor in the Democratic race; the vice president has enlarged his lopsided lead among Democrats.
About as many people have a favorable image of Mr. Gore as unfavorable, not an altogether enviable position, but a notable shift from last December, when a far higher proportion viewed him negatively.
The nationwide telephone poll of 1,225 adults, including 979 registered voters, was conducted Saturday through Monday. The entire sample has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Because of its broad national scope, this survey is not a reliable measure of the Republican contest in South Carolina.
If the general election were held today, the survey found, it would be a dead heat, with Mr. Bush drawing 45 percent and Mr. Gore 44 percent. Last November, Mr. Bush was ahead of Mr. Gore, 50 percent to 41 percent.
Despite Mr. McCain's surge in popularity, he would do no better against Mr. Gore than Mr. Bush would. Mr. McCain would receive 42 percent; Mr. Gore, 41 percent.
But in a sign of Mr. McCain's potency, and success in courting independents and Democrats, he would beat Mr. Bradley, 45 percent to 31 percent. In November, Mr. Bradley led Mr. McCain, 47 percent to 30 percent.
In the primaries, Mr. Bush is still favored by more than half of the Republican voters. But Mr. McCain has cut into Mr. Bush's once-tremendous lead. The poll shows that Mr. Bush is now the choice of 53 percent of those who plan to vote in Republican primaries, and Mr. McCain, 33 percent. In November, Mr. Bush was the favorite of 68 percent, and Mr. McCain was the choice of only 8 percent.
Still, many registered voters said they are only beginning to focus on the race. Only one-third of Mr. Bush's backers, and of Mr. McCain's, said they had decided for certain.
On the Democratic side, Mr. Gore's national lead has grown. Sixty-four percent of Democratic voters back Mr. Gore; 25 percent support Mr. Bradley. In November, as Mr. Bradley was drawing national notice as a threat to the vice president in New Hampshire, 56 percent favored Mr. Gore and 30 percent supported Mr. Bradley.
Another comforting sign for Mr. Gore is that the voters polled said they no longer expected a Republican victory in the presidential race. Now, they say, it is a tossup.
In many ways, Mr. Clinton's popularity is helping Democrats in the same way it did when Washington was distracted by the impeachment proceedings: The public likes the policies of the administration despite the reservations about Mr. Clinton's personal qualities.
"As vice president, he's had a part in the success of the economy," said Kelly Rinaldo, an independent who was questioned for the poll and explained in a follow-up interview yesterday why she liked Mr. Gore. "He's on the right track. And if he follows through on Social Security and health care, he'd be great."
Ms. Rinaldo, 36, a homemaker from Patchogue Village, N.Y., added, "When you're a vice president, you always play second fiddle, but he has the upper hand because of this experience."
The danger for Mr. Bush is that the more people get to know him, the more he seems to lose support.
"Bush seems to waffle more on the issues," said Mark Giloican, 27, a poll respondent who is a student in Savannah, Ga., and plans to back Mr. McCain. "All of the candidates tend to say what we want to hear. But Bush seems to do it more. My opinion has changed recently simply because I've heard more about him. He seems to have a little more charisma than McCain, but that's not what matters to me."
Indeed, the findings suggested that Mr. Bush's positions were a growing vulnerability. Registered voters in the poll said they were more drawn to Mr. McCain's campaign reform mantra than to Mr. Bush's signature tax proposal.
Asked what any budget surplus should be used for, 56 percent of the respondents said it should go to Social Security; 17 percent to pay down the debt; and only 13 percent to cut income taxes.
But respondents seemed more interested in campaign finance reform, which has been Mr. McCain's major theme, although Mr. Bush announced a campaign finance proposal of his own this week.
Forty-two percent of the respondents said the campaign finance system had so much wrong with it that it needed to be completely overhauled. Another 44 percent said fundamental changes were needed.
Of course, Mr. Bush's tax-cutting message still appeals to many Republicans.
Louise Cassan, 78, a retired clothes presser who backs Mr. Bush, put it this way: "McCain has come out for campaign finance. But if it was passed the Republicans wouldn't have a chance because the media leans heavily Democratic. He's also more liberal than Bush. He doesn't support as big a tax cut that Bush does, which the people need and deserve." She added that Mr. Bush "wants all the things I want, such as tax cuts and smaller government."
On the Democratic side, Albert McCloud, 63, a retired shipworker from Hampton, Va., said he would back Mr. Gore. "It appears that Bill Clinton is going to try to win the election for Al Gore, and it appears that Al Gore is going to try to continue some of the successful policies of the Clinton administration, like paying down the debt, keeping the economy steady by working with the Federal Reserve, and strengthening the education budget."
Beyond the presidential race, the poll found that Democrats were better positioned for the November elections than Republicans. Sixty-one percent of registered voters said they had a positive view of the Democratic Party; 31 percent had a negative view. By contrast, 49 percent had a positive view of Republicans; 41 percent a negative view.
While national polls have little predictive value for the outcome of local House races, they do offer a sense of public sentiment about the parties. In the poll, 33 percent of registered voters said they planned to vote for the Republican candidate in their district; 44 percent for the Democrat.
More than anything else, Democrats are buoyed by the roaring economy. In 1992, when Mr. Clinton triumphed over President George Bush, only 23 percent of those polled said the economy was in good shape. Now, 88 percent hold that view.

PATH Trains Continue To Gain Passengers

 BODY:
Ridership on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's PATH trains was 67.3 million last year, a rise of 3 percent over 1998 and a continuation of a steady increase in passengers since 1996.
Michael P. DePallo, general manager of the trans-Hudson tubes, attributed the increase to the strong economy in the region as well as to sharp rises in weekend traveling on the rail line, which runs between Newark, Jersey City, Hoboken and five Manhattan stations. 
 With its fare set at $1 since 1987, Path remains a money-losing operation. In 1998, the PATH lines had a net loss of $184 million.

ShrinkingTreasury Debt Creates Uncertain World

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Lawrence H. Summers, secretary of the Treasury, is clearly relishing his role as the man who put the nation on a no-debt diet. In Congressional testimony last week, Mr. Summers predicted that by 2013, the $3.6 trillion in Treasury debt held by the public would be eliminated, repurchased by funds from budget surpluses that the roaring American economy has wrought. The result, he said, will be an even stronger economy and lower interest rates for all.
Maybe so. But in the meantime, the Treasury's plan to reduce its debt is roiling the financial markets and raising the prospect of far-reaching, unintended effects on the economy and investors. 
 One immediate effect of the shrinking Treasury debt market, economists say, is to make it tougher for the Federal Reserve Board to cool the economy because as it raises short-term interest rates, long-term rates are not rising in tandem.
In addition, the debt securities that remain in the shrinking market are expected to be much more prone to wild swings in price and thereby riskier for investors.
Finally, corporations will probably issue more debt to fill the public demand for bonds, creating a debt burden that could make it much more difficult for the nation to shake off a downturn in the economy.
"The surplus has forced the Treasury to change the way they do business, and we are looking at the consequences," said Ward McCarthy, principal at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. "It affects everybody."
Because the market for Treasury debt is the largest and most heavily traded in the world, and because investors evaluate almost every other type of bond using a Treasury security as a benchmark, even the smallest change in the government's financing has effects at home and abroad.
"One of the reasons the U.S. has been the dominant factor in the world is we were the only place with a deep, liquid debt market," said Stan Jonas, managing director at FIMAT U.S.A., a brokerage firm in New York. "We would not be the leader in the financial marketplace if we hadn't had the advantage of a huge, rich Treasury market. Now that market is disappearing."
The ripples from a vanishing public market for Treasury debt have begun to hit investors who buy bonds and the companies that issue them. Last month, when the Treasury outlined its aggressive plan to reduce the debt it issues and to buy back debt already in investors' hands, the market went haywire. There was a mad rush for long-term government bonds, driving down interest rates on long-term government debt even as the Federal Reserve Board was raising short-term rates to try to cool down an overheated economy.
This created significant losses for investors, who had bet that the Fed's increases in short-term rates would cause rates at the long end of the market to rise as well. Instead, the effective rate on 30-year bonds fell well below that of 2-year notes. Normally, investors are given extra incentive in the form of higher rates to lock up their money for a longer period.
More important, economists and market strategists say, the Treasury's plan and the ensuing rush to long-term bonds are throwing sand into the gears that the Fed uses to keep the economy perking while protecting against inflation.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who is scheduled to testify today as part of his twice-a-year report to Congress, has raised short-term rates three times since last June in an effort to slow the economy. But rates on long-term Treasury securities have fallen.
"It poses a little bit of a challenge for monetary policy," said Henry Kaufman, the noted Wall Street economist.
Few economists say the Treasury's overall plan to reduce the nation's debt is wrongheaded. Last year's budget surplus of $124 billion, the largest ever, was a direct result of a supercharged economy and a roaring stock market, which generated huge tax receipts. As long as the economy and stock markets remain hot and Congress keeps a lid on spending, budget surpluses will continue. Reducing debt, the government argues, is a natural use for these funds.
To be sure, the government will still issue debt to be held by the Federal Reserve and the Social Security trust. It is the publicly held debt that is set for extinction.
Although the Treasury securities market is the world's largest and most influential, it wasn't always thus. In the 1960's, for example, when an investor asked what the bond market was doing, the answer usually involved the price action in an AT&T bond or an obligation of a highly rated electric utility.
But as the United States government grew and the Treasury began to borrow more to finance the growth, the significance of the Treasury securities market rose as well. In the 1980's and 1990's, the Treasury raised trillions of dollars each year from investors by issuing bonds, notes and bills; the peak came in 1996, when the Treasury auctioned $2.5 trillion in securities.
By fiscal 1998, according to the Treasury, federal debt held by the public had risen to $3.7 trillion, up from $2.1 trillion just 10 years earlier.
But the days of ballooning Treasury debt are over. Eliminating the publicly held Treasury debt by 2013, Mr. Summers said, will put downward pressure on all interest rates, helping to reduce consumer payments on home mortgages, car loans and other forms of credit. This has not happened yet. Most consumer borrowings are based upon shorter-term interest rates -- even 30-year mortgage rates are based on shorter-term rates because homeowners typically pay off their loans well before their term is up -- and these are rising because of the Fed's recent actions.
Where the effects have been felt sharply are in the corporate bond and mortgage markets. A 30-year corporate bond is usually judged against a 30-year Treasury. But with Treasuries being hoarded ahead of a possible shortage, the rates on the bonds no longer represent a good comparison. As a result, the private debt market has lost its anchor.
Wall Street will undoubtedly create a new security to use as a benchmark for bond issues soon. But until then, uncertainty will rule the market.
As a result, investors are having trouble assessing new bond issues and are acting with caution. "I think everybody has thrown up their hands at the moment," said Carol Levenson, editor of Gimme Credit, a research service that analyzes high-grade corporate bonds. "The market is waiting to see if things are going to return to normal."
Trading has also dropped off recently in the vast market for mortgage obligations, which are backed by consumer loans, according to Mickey Levy, the chief economist at BankAmerica. "With higher risk in this market, it could make rates higher on the margin," he said, for the moment, just the opposite of what Mr. Summers has predicted.
Some strategists suspect that the bond market may never return to normal. "One byproduct of a consequential shrinkage of the Treasury market is that the U.S. debt markets will be increasingly comprised of a variety of securities that are riskier than Treasury debt," Mr. McCarthy said. "So in addition to increased volatility, we are dealing with almost by definition a riskier bond market as well."
This is quite a change, given that much of the bond market has been a refuge for investors seeking safety and security in their holdings. Few are confident that investors have recognized the increased risks they will need to take when they invest in bonds as the Treasury bows out of the market and corporate issuers take its place.
Moreover, investors may not recognize the implications of a big increase in corporate debt when the nation experiences a recession. "When you go into an economic slowdown and there is a large amount of government debt outstanding and a small amount of corporate debt outstanding, that's not a problem," Mr. Kaufman explained. "All you need is an easing in monetary policy and off we go again. But when the private sector is heavily burdened when we slow down, that will require more stimulation. This is a concern."
One economist worried that using the budget surplus to finance a buyback of existing Treasury debt could cause inflation. Robert H. Parks, a professor of finance at the Lubin Graduate School of Business at Pace University, said: "This increases the money supply, and it also increases the reserves of private financial institutions. It is highly expansionary and potentially inflationary in an economy that is roaring ahead."

Europeans Celebrate Their Freedom to Dwell in Hollywood's Shadow

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 16

 BODY:
For its 50th-anniversary edition the Berlin Film Festival has moved its headquarters from the former West Berlin to Potsdamer Platz, a new urban complex that symbolizes the unification and rebirth of this long-divided city. Yet while the festival now has a home fit for the 21st century, the Berlinale, as it is widely known, is still struggling to find a new identity 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Yes, things were often easier in the past. Veteran movie directors from Eastern Europe can still be heard lamenting that capitalism has proven to be a stricter censor than Communism. It was always possible to find obtuse or allegorical ways of telling the truth under Communism, they say, but there is no way of circumventing the restrictions imposed by commercial budget and distribution systems. 
 And there is a parallel in the Berlinale. When this was a divided and occupied city, the West Berlin festival had a clear political mission, first as a showcase of democratic freedom, then as a cultural bridge between East and West. Now, with Berlin reunited and the Soviet bloc a thing of the past, the festival seems to be adrift in the no man's land that divides the global movie industry between the United States and the rest of the world.
This year's 10-day festival, which ends on Sunday, is therefore a less than satisfying compromise. It is presenting a half-dozen big-budget American movies, which have been released in the United States and are merely using this festival as a springboard for European distribution. But the Berlinale needs the glamour of Hollywood stars: the world learns about it only because photographers are willing to mob the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio (here to promote "The Beach") or Gwyneth Paltrow (here for the showing of "The Talented Mr. Ripley").
This in turn reflects a reality beyond the festival's control: the United States so dominates world cinema that it leaves little room for anyone else. In most of Europe, including Germany, American films account for 80 to 90 percent of ticket sales; only in France, where government subsidies have kept the movie industry alive, does the American share drop to around 70 percent. Thus if few foreign-language movies reach the United States, few also find markets elsewhere.
In presenting scores of smaller movies from around the world, the festival offers ample evidence that cinema is alive and well outside the United States. Actors and directors from Spain to Japan may wander around Berlin unnoticed, although even winning the festival's awards, known as Bears, is no guarantee of wider recognition. The talents and concerns of moviemakers working outside the glare of Hollywood can nonetheless be seen here. Perhaps surprisingly, politics are still an issue. A comedy from Croatia called "Marsal" (known in English as "Marshall Tito's Spirit"), directed by Vinko Bresan, illustrates that country's confused transition from Communism to capitalism by telling of an apparition of Marshall Tito on a Croatian island. The mayor, having privatized government properties and bought them on the cheap for himself, now spots a new business opportunity: he invites veteran Tito loyalists to contact the ghost and turns the island into a Communist theme park.
Certainly the Balkans have proven adept at tackling their recent tragedies with dark humor. "Nebaska Udica" ("Sky Hook"), which was made by the Serbian director Ljubisa Samardzic during NATO's bombing of Belgrade last April, tells of a group of beer-swilling layabouts, including Kaja (Nebojsa Glogovac), whose 7-year-old son has been struck mute by the bombing. Their main concern is to rebuild their devastated basketball court, but the underlying theme is their inability to influence the conflict disrupting their lives.
"Piao Ling Ma Ma" ("Breaking the Silence"), directed by Sun Zhou, also deals with contemporary events, this time in a China hurriedly embracing the profits and perils of capitalism. This serves as the background to a touching tale of a divorced mother, played by the Chinese star Gong Li, as she struggles to have her deaf 8-year-old son accepted in a regular school. Even with cuts demanded by the Chinese authorities, the film captures the hardship faced by many ordinary Chinese with the arrival of a market economy and unemployment.
In contrast, "Russkij Bunt" ("The Captain's Daughter"), directed by Aleksandr Proshkin and adapted from two stories by Pushkin, is a "Dr. Zhivago"-like epic set in the 18th century. It blends a love story with an account of the peasant uprising led by an impostor posing as the czar, Yemelya Pugachev (Sergei Machovecki). For all the film's snow, beards, swords and horses, however, the director believes it to be topical. "Our age, like the times of Catherine II, is an age where morals have lost their value, an age of swift career making and instantaneous downfalls," he said.
A certain nostalgia also permeates Akira Ogata's first film, "Boys' Choir," which is set in a Japan of the early 1970's where a student movement with revolutionary dreams is facing defeat and leaving an entire generation feeling pessimistic about the future. The story focuses on two boys in a Christian boarding school where a young pastor is trying to create his own version of the Vienna Boys Choir. His past as a radical, however, catches up with him.
Volker Schlondorff's new movie, "The Legends of Rita," also goes back to the radical movement of the 1970's, this time in West Germany. When the movement collapses, Rita Vogt (Bibinana Beglau) flees to East Germany, is given a new identity as a factory worker and confronts the grimness of life under Communism. But when East Germany finally implodes, she cannot escape responsibility for her earlier terrorism in the West.
Still, most new movies from Europe show little interest in politics, although several reflect the gradual blending of European culture. Francois Ozon, an up-and-coming young French director, has adapted an unstaged 1970 play by the German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, "Water Drops on Burning Rocks," for the screen. Even more of an international cocktail is "Signs and Wonders," a new film by the American director Jonathan Nossiter: it was financed by a French company, made in English and set in Athens. It stars a Swede (Stellan Skarsgard), a Briton (Charlotte Rampling), an American (Deborah Kara Unger) and a Greek (Dimitris Katalifos).
These films also offer human close-ups rather than social statements. Mr. Ozon's movie, for instance, tells of a middle-aged man who takes a young male lover only to find their menage a deux disturbed by their former girlfriends. In "Signs and Wonders" a man leaves his wife for a younger woman; when he decides to return home, his wife has found happiness with another man, but his pre-teenage daughter proves to be a perverse ally.
Rudolf Thome's "Paradiso" tells of a composer who celebrates his 60th birthday with the seven most important lovers in his life. Some critics described the film as a male fantasy; Mr. Thome said he was being ironic.
Apart from the festival's Hollywood imports, which also include "Three Kings," "Magnolia," "The Hurricane," "Any Given Sunday" and "Man on the Moon," there are other English-language movies, not only small independent films from the United States but also fare from the British Isles, including "Saltwater," an impressive directing debut by the young Irish playwright Conor McPherson ("The Weir"), who also wrote the screenplay.
Kenneth Branagh's latest Shakespeare, "Love's Labour's Lost," though, seems closer to Hollywood in the 1950's than London in 1600. Starring Alessandro Nivola as the King of Navarre and Alicia Silverstone as the Princess of France, with Mr. Branagh's Berowne busily wooing Natascha McElhone's Rosaline, the film is peppered with songs by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and George Gershwin and dance numbers inspired by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. In a nod to Esther Williams, one scene even has the princess and her ladies in waiting performing synchronized swimming. All of which goes to prove that Shakespeare can survive anything.

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 12.
 
Now Playing
 
* "AMERICAN BEAUTY," starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Mr. Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
 
"THE BEACH," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton and Robert Carlyle. Directed by Danny Boyle (R, 120 minutes). Mr. DiCaprio plays Richard, a young American vacationing in Thailand who is given a map that leads him to an island paradise. All of Mr. DiCaprio's charisma and the director's savvy are used to divert us from the fact that there's not much going on here. While Mr. DiCaprio shows some talent, the movie is simply a Colors by Benetton take on "Lord of the Flies," with the imperious paradise ruler (Ms. Swinton) holding court as the Promised Land crashes around her. Richard finds himself living the aphorism that has ruined the life of so many film protagonists: paradise breeds callousness, a marginal rethinking of beware of the things you want, for you shall have them (Elvis Mitchell). 
 
* "BOYS DON'T CRY," starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of last year's best (Maslin).
 
* "THE CIDER HOUSE RULES," starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes). Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the world. Mr. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms. Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940's "David Copperfield" (Stephen Holden).
 
"EYE OF THE BEHOLDER," starring Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd. Directed by Stephan Elliott (R, 105 minutes). Mr. McGregor is a British surveillance expert and Ms. Judd the serial-killing femme fatale he falls in love with (while observing her kill a boyfriend) in this ludicrous psycho-thriller. As Mr. McGregor's character, known only as the Eye, follows the object of his obsession from city to city, the movie tries futilely to capture some of the mystique of "Vertigo." But the film, by the director best known for "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," is so garish, disjointed and incoherent that it feels like an extended music video posing as a movie (Holden).
 
"FANTASIA/2000," with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and introductions by Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Mr. Levine, Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the original film (the wonderful "Sorcerer's Apprentice," starring Mickey Mouse). Despite the science fiction title and the Imax-size screen on which it is shown, "Fantasia/2000" is more backward-looking than futuristic. The two best segments are "Rhapsody in Blue," a witty Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's "Firebird" Suite), in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around the globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the planet's life forms. Celebrity introductions lend the film the feel of a deluxe corporate promotion. At the Sony Imax Theater, Broadway at 68th Street (Holden).
 
 "GIRL, INTERRUPTED," starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen, a college-age girl who lands in a Massachusetts mental institution in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on Ms. Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Jolie as a charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's best friend (Holden).
 
"THE GREEN MILE," starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments, the director of "The Shawshank Redemption" could have managed more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock. Still, this long film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man (Mr. Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Mr. Hanks, as a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly good that it's redundant to say so (Maslin).
 
* "GUN SHY," starring Liam Neeson, Oliver Platt, Jose Zuniga and Sandra Bullock. Written and directed by Eric Blakeney (R, 102 minutes). Last spring saw both a film comedy ("Analyze This") and a cable series ("The Sopranos") about gangsters forcing themselves to unload to a shrink. This year, in "Gun Shy," we get a shaken undercover fed, Charlie Mayo (Mr. Neeson), seeing a psychiatrist on the down-low. Charlie, a wreck who has lost his nerve after he was exposed during an undercover operation, is assigned to a job that involves his acting as an organized-crime envoy. He moves between the preening Fidel (Mr. Zuniga), a yuppie Colombian thug, and Fulvio (Mr. Platt), whose vulgar pride in his violent streak is perverse. Mr. Blakeney has come up with one of the subtlest and most inspired comedies you'll see this year in his feature-film writing and directing debut (Mitchell).
 
"HOLY SMOKE," starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously through North Africa as a young hippie mother in "Hideous Kinky," Ms. Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth Barron, a headstrong young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother coaxes her home, where a "cult exiter" named P. J. (Mr. Keitel) is waiting to wean Ruth from her Indian guru. But as the film moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't help that Ms. Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Mr. Keitel's P. J. looking overmatched (Maslin).
 
* "THE HURRICANE," starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a movie redeemed by Mr. Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian commune who took up Mr. Carter's cause and all but eliminating his heroic co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still inspiring (Holden).
 
* "SCREAM 3," starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox Arquette. Directed by Wes Craven (R, 116 minutes). At this point it goes without saying that the "Scream" movies are like episodes of "Scooby Doo." Like the others, "Scream 3" belongs on the Cartoon Network. This time for a better reason: the film is funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jolts to the spine. Mr. Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real competition is not the recent hit films "The Blair Witch Project" or "The Sixth Sense" but rather "Scream" itself. "Scream 3" doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much a personality show as it is a slasher film (Mitchell).
 
* "THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY," starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of "The English Patient" was no fluke, Mr. Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually charged adaptation of Patricia High smith's fascinatingly reptilian murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Mr. Damon as the dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic magnetism. Ms. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness of a fine character actress, while Ms. Blanchett makes the delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante. As the story's odious playboy-snob, Mr. Hoffman is scene-stealingly wonderful. Gorgeously photographed in Italy by John Seale (Maslin).
 
* "TITUS," starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R, 160 minutes). Ms. Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who created transfixing stage pictures in "The Lion King" and "Juan Darien," has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, "Titus Andronicus," into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge enacted throughout history. Mr. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation. Ms. Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back. Although the movie's British theatrical and American film acting styles don't mesh, Ms. Taymor's vision is realized with a shattering force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome with Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash (Holden).
 
* "TOPSY-TURVY," starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent. Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Mr. Leigh's grandly entertaining "Topsy-Turvy" is one of those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities, much as "Shakespeare in Love" did last year. Instead of a love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing, frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they held sway (Maslin).
 
Film Series

A Texas-Style Bashing: Double-Teaming 'Dubya'

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI 

 BODY:

SHRUB
The Short but Happy
Political Life of George W. Bush
By Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose
179 pages. Random House. $19.95.
"Shrub," the title of this new book about George W. Bush, says it all: the dismissive nickname, first coined by former Gov. Ann Richards of Texas, is a tip-off that this isn't going to be a nonpartisan assessment of this Republican presidential candidate; it's going to a sassy, sarcastic indictment of Mr. Bush and his policies. In fact the book reads like a long, editorial rant against Mr. Bush's political record, a rant that's sometimes persuasive, sometimes unfair, if almost always entertaining.
Molly Ivins, a columnist for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and Lou Dubose, editor of The Texas Observer, make no secret of their liberal bias in the pages of this book. "The dirty secret of Texas government," they write, "is that we keep our 'low tax, low services' tradition going by cheating the poor." 
 They depict Mr. Bush as a "wholly owned subsidiary of corporate America": "We don't think this is a consequence of political calculation; it is more a consequence of his life experience, political thinking and party affiliation. We can find no evidence that it has ever occurred to him to question whether it is wise to do what big business wants. He is perfectly comfortable, perfectly at home, doing the bidding of big bidness."
Using the legwork of other reporters from both the national and Texas press as a springboard for their commentary, Ms. Ivins and Mr. Dubose argue that as a candidate Mr. Bush benefited, at crucial points in his career, from family influence and the largess of corporate interests. They observe that most of the money for his failed oil business ventures was raised during the years when his father "was either running for president or serving as Ronald Reagan's vice president," and contend that he sold his stock in one of those companies shortly "before news of the company's precarious health was made public." He "walked away from the whole mess," they coyly add, "with more money than Bill Clinton ever dreamed of making on a little real-estate deal now known as Whitewater."
As for Mr. Bush's foray into baseball, which enabled him to turn a $600,000 investment in the Texas Rangers into a $15 million profit, Ms. Ivins and Mr. Dubose write that "the team increased its book value from $83 million to $138 million by convincing the city of Arlington there would be no more baseball unless local taxpayers sprang for a new stadium." In short, they observe, this anti-tax politician personally benefited when residents of Arlington, worried about losing their franchise to another city, voted "to add a half-cent to one of the highest sales taxes in the nation in order to raise the $191 million needed to build the Ballpark at Arlington."
It is the view of Ms. Ivins and Mr. Dubose that George W. Bush -- or "Dubya," as they call him -- has successfully straddled "the divide between the Christian right and the economic conservatives in the Republican Party" by giving the members of the Christian right "just enough to keep them in line."
"He talks the talk but rarely walks the walk," they write, and still gets the support of the Christian right because it wants to be on the side of a winner. These observations, needless to say, went to press before Mr. Bush's loss to John McCain in the New Hampshire primary, a loss that has not only put Dubya's front-runner status in question but has also heightened his tilt toward his party's right wing.
In any case, Ms. Ivins and Mr. Dubose argue, Dubya's real concerns have less to do with "God, guns and gays" than with the issues "dearest to the business community," namely "tort reform, lax regulation of industrial polluters, tax cuts for the oil and gas industry, electricity rates that place the interests of industry far above the interests of consumers, and privatizing welfare for huge profit." Taking care of business, they argue, is Dubya's No. 1 priority, a position that has had particularly serious consequences, they contend, in the area of environmental protection.
As governor of "the state with the highest volume of air pollution in the nation," Ms. Ivins and Mr. Dubose write, Mr. Bush "accommodated the state's biggest polluters" by implementing a program of "voluntary compliance." The companies that helped to design that voluntary program, they add, showed their support for Mr. Bush by contributing $260,648 to his 1998 gubernatorial campaign, and $243,900 to his presidential campaign within a month of the opening of his exploratory committee.
They argue that even more financial support (as much as $4.5 million by one estimate) has come to Mr. Bush from business, medical and real estate groups intent on promoting tort reform that would help insulate "corporate interests from lawsuits filed by consumers, workers, injured parties and the survivors of those killed through malice or negligence."
In depicting Mr. Bush as a friend of big business, who is "blind to the difficulties of life in the nation's underclass," Ms. Ivins and Mr. Dubose rely upon a blend of sarcasm and down-home Texas invective to make their points. Though this makes for a highly readable narrative, it can also backfire on the authors when they overstate their points. In discussing Mr. Bush's reported distaste for reading policy books, for instance, it seems quite gratuitous to add that "people who have read only one book can be quite dangerous -- witness Timothy McVeigh and all those poor citizens who read Ayn Rand and are stuck like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus."
The one area in which Ms. Ivins and Mr. Dubose give Mr. Bush high points is education, writing that "he has been attentive, consistent, and a hard worker to make public schools a higher priority for the state." But they add that the weakness of the Texas governorship -- the office, they write, ranks "behind lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller and land commissioner" in terms of actual power -- means that "it is impossible to give him the lion's share of the credit for any single initiative -- too much of the heavy lifting has been done by others."
For that matter, they argue, Mr. Bush's record as governor indicates that "he doesn't know much, doesn't do much, and doesn't care much about governing." So much so, they conclude, that "it's kind of hard to figure out why he wants a job where he's expected to govern."

HEADLINE: Producer Price Index Is Flat As Cost of Cigarettes Drops

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers were unchanged in January as the cost of cigarettes unexpectedly fell, the government reported today. Other prices were tame, a sign inflation is being kept in check.
The Labor Department's Producer Price Index held at the same level last month as in December, when it had risen 0.1 percent. The core index, which excludes food and energy, fell 0.2 percent after growing 0.1 percent in the prior month. 
 "There is still no general inflation problem in the U.S.," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.
The producer index was held down by a 4.9 percent drop in wholesale cigarette prices. The data was collected before midmonth price increases of 13 cents a pack by Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds Holdings, the two largest United States cigarette makers, a Labor Department spokeswoman said.
Because of different survey methods, those increases could be reflected in the Consumer Price Index for January, which the department issues Friday. Today's report also did not pick up an increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.
Excluding cigarettes, the overall index would have risen 0.2 percent and the core rate would have increased 0.1 percent.
The Labor Department, in annual revisions this week, had lowered the December increase from 0.3 percent. The core rate for December was left unchanged.
Even with tame inflation, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, told the House Banking Committee today that interest rates would have to rise further to prevent the economy from overheating. He expressed concern that consumer spending was growing at a faster pace than incomes.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported today that regional manufacturing expanded at a faster pace in February and that its index of prices paid by regional manufacturers was close to a five-year high. The general economic index rose to 13.3 this month from 9.1 in January. The prices-paid index leaped to 40 from 29.9, for the highest reading since 42.5 in March 1995.

HEADLINE: Twilight Of Turboprops?;
Passengers Go Out of Their Way To Catch Jets

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
Like many other airline passengers, Michael Gallagher has gone out of his way to avoid flying a turboprop plane. When he attended an Orbital Sciences shareholder meeting a few years ago in Washington, for example, he changed his schedule at the last minute to fly on a jet.
"I have always been a nervous flyer," said Mr. Gallagher, who lives in Cortland, N.Y. "On a turboprop plane, you just get bounced around too much." Mr. Gallagher and others may soon find an easier path to a smoother flight. The battle to attract more passengers from smaller markets has become so intense that airlines are now scrambling to replace their turboprop planes with jets. 
 Within the next three years, Continental Airlines will spend around $2 billion to supplant all its turboprops with regional jets: twin-engine planes carrying up to 70 passengers. Delta Air Lines will pay $4 billion for 200 regional jets and start service to 100 cities.
Virtually every major airline is stocking its fleet with regional jets. According to estimates by PaineWebber, American, Continental, United and Northwest Airlines will more than double the number of regional jets operated by their feeder airlines in the next three years, giving passengers in smaller markets more flight choices than ever.
The orders are going primarily to the two big makers of regional jets, Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, or Embraer, of Brazil and Bombardier of Montreal.
Though the average regional jet costs $20 million, nearly double the price of a comparable turboprop, the airlines feel the switch is well worth it. "Turboprop planes are not an attractive product," said Leo F. Mullin, chief executive of Delta. "Passengers view them as second-rate service. With a regional jet, passengers are more comfortable, and we can use them to serve more markets."
An informal survey by Delta recently found that its passengers hate turboprops so much that most are willing to drive two to five hours to avoid flying in them. Most major carriers depend heavily on their regional fleets for feeder traffic -- passengers from a smaller market who connect to the major carrier at a hub airport. American Airlines, a unit of AMR, and Delta, for example, each receive about $1 billion in annual revenue from their regional fleets.
There will still be a place for turboprops, primarily on short flights provided by independent regional carriers. At the end of last year, in fact, there were about 1,350 turboprops in use compared with about 410 regional jets, according to the Regional Airline Association.
The switch to regional jets should, however, significantly increase the major airlines' sales in smaller and midsize markets.
Turboprops have a flight span of only 500 miles, about half that of regional jets, which can serve markets that had been beyond a turboprop's reach. They are also cheaper to operate on longer routes. And they are expected to attract passengers close to small airports who have been reluctant to fly primarily because of a fear of turboprops.
"The important thing about regional jets is not that they are more cost efficient than turboprops," said Samuel Buttrick, an airlines analyst with PaineWebber. "The airlines expect to get more revenue from regional jets by selling more seats in what is a preferred product."
The major carriers also hope to swap larger jets with regional jets on flights that do not sell out. But that is not likely to become a common practice anytime soon.
The Airline Pilots Association, which covers most major carriers in the United States and Canada, is so fearful that regional jets could take work away from its members that most labor contracts with the airlines restrict how many such aircraft an airline can own as well as the number of seats on each plane. After receiving its shipments for 26 new regional jets next year, for instance, United Airlines, a unit of UAL, will not be able to buy another without permission from its pilots.
Assuming that the pilots' resistance and other barriers could be overcome, the airlines would like to develop "on-demand dispatch," industry code for a last-minute equipment swap. If a flight from La Guardia to Chicago on a Boeing 737 was, say, only a quarter full, the airline could substitute a regional jet. Such a swap, of course, is likely to irritate passengers.
Airline executives are confident, however, that regional jets will become popular alternatives to their propellered predecessors, though there is less consensus on what constitutes a regional jet. Most industry executives agree that its flight span is 1,000 miles or less, but they are less clear on the number of seats the plane can contain. Some said regional jets could have as many as 100 seats, while others deferred to their pilots' contracts, many of which dictate no more than 70.
"The definition of a regional jet can get fuzzy," said Tom Bacon, a senior vice president at American Eagle, the regional carrier of American Airlines. "But we're beginning to think of regional jets in terms of the new service with the cities that we can connect."
The number of passengers on regional jets has begun to surge, increasing 20 percent in the first nine months of 1999 over the corresponding period a year earlier, according to the Regional Airline Association. The number of seats available increased 18.2 percent, while the length of the average trip rose 9.1 percent.
"Passengers have clearly decided that they do not want to fly on turboprop planes," said Susan Donofrio of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "But the regional jets offer other advantages. The airlines can make sure that they have quality feeder service. When passengers start a trip, they are more likely to stay on that airline to make connections."
In the scramble to gain more passengers from smaller cities, the regional jet is fast becoming the airlines' most effective weapon.
Airline executives have known for decades that passengers avoided turboprops like the flu, but used them anyway, in part because second-tier cities were not important enough for the $20 million capital investment required to buy a new regional jet.
In the last decade, however, markets that were once shunned as too small have grown rapidly. And executives from these smaller markets had the same turboprop complaints as their big-city counterparts.
"There is the perception among some passengers that turboprops are not safe," said Glen Hauenstein, a vice president at Continental. "Turboprops vibrate and the passengers can see the propellers. "
(The rate of accidents involving turboprops in 1996, the latest year data are available, was small, only 3.62 for every 100,000 miles flown, but more than twice the accident rate of turbojets, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.)
Regional jets can also fly farther, faster and more smoothly than turboprops. But even more important for attracting passengers from smaller cities is that the airlines can use them to create more nonstop flights. Executives, who buy only 20 percent of the airlines' tickets but account for about half of the industry profits, avoid multistop flights as much as they shun turboprops.
An example of the scuffling over smaller markets has been playing out in Greenville-Spartanburg, an area of two counties with about 650,000 people in the South Carolina foothills. Years ago, Spartanburg was known primarily as the hometown of Claudia Turner-Wells, the first runner-up in the 1970 Miss America Pageant, and the textile mogul Roger Milliken.
But in the last 10 years, the area has become a manufacturing mecca, where Michelin, the tire maker, is planning a big expansion and where roadsters are built for BMW.
The area was served primarily by Delta, through its hub in Atlanta, until Continental began nonstop Continental Express service to Newark from Greenville a few years ago and then between Greenville and Houston. The combination of more flights from the Northeast and an opening to the West lured many passengers away from Delta. Within a year, Delta's share of the Greenville-Spartanburg market plunged from 84 percent to 23 percent.
Delta has not taken its massacre in Greenville-Spartanburg lightly.
Through its regional fleet, Delta Connection, it has begun a push to expand its presence in smaller markets. After spending $2.6 billion last year to buy two of its regional carriers -- Comair and Atlantic Southeast Airlines -- Delta recently replaced American Eagle as the nation's largest regional carrier, according to the Regional Airline Association.
By the end of this year, Delta Connection will own more regional jets than any other airline. And it is wasting no time deploying them. The airline recently started service between Worcester, Mass., and nine cities, including Denver, Atlanta and Myrtle Beach, S.C. Within the next two months, it will start regional jet service with daily flights from La Guardia to six cities, including Richmond and Savannah, Ga.
"What happens with a regional jet is that you can give some smaller cities big-market access," said Frederick W. Reid, Delta's chief marketing officer. "The next step in our expansion will be to start connecting some of the smaller cities with each other."
The connections are some of the least expensive deals the airlines have been able to make. Because they are very fuel efficient once they reach cruising altitude, regional jets cost only 10 cents an air mile on longer routes, those that are 500 to 1,000 miles long, compared with 19 cents for turboprops. (Turboprops are, however, a lot less expensive to operate on shorter hops.)
When replacing larger jets, regional jets can also save money at the gate. Delta said it could park three regional jets in the space that it uses to park, say, a 737. Analysts estimate that could reduce gate fees by some 10 percent a year.
Delta recently made such a swap on its routes between Atlanta and Grand Rapids, Mich., after too many seats on the 737's were left unfilled. To draw more people, Delta added three daily flights.
Given the advantages of regional jets, airline executives may soon be more irked that they cannot deploy more. But they are not likely to press the issue too hard, at least for now, with the airline pilots unions.
In any case, the love affair with regional jets is not shared by some passengers.
"I don't fly turboprops or regional jets," said Paul Tauger, a lawyer in Costa Mesa, Calif. "I took a regional jet from Fort Lauderdale to Dallas, and the luggage compartment was not big enough for my carry-on bag. After that, with airplanes, I don't downsize anymore."

Responding to passengers' objections to turboprop airplanes, the nation's major airlines plan to acquire hundreds of small jets over the next few years. Beyond replacing most of their turboprops, the airlines are also counting on the regional passenger jets to expand their reach in smaller markets.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Greenspan Remarks at Congressional Hearing

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, presented his semiannual report on the economy to the House Banking Committee yesterday. Following are excerpts from his testimony and an exchange between Mr. Greenspan and Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the committee, in a question-and-answer session that followed the testimony, as recorded by Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription agency:
There is little evidence that the American economy, which grew more than 4 percent in 1999 and surged forward at an even faster pace in the second half of the year, is slowing appreciably. At the same time, inflation has remained largely contained. . . . 
 Underlying this performance, unprecedented in my half-century of observing the American economy, is a continuing acceleration in productivity. . . . Yet those profoundly beneficial forces driving the American economy to competitive excellence are also engendering a set of imbalances that unless contained threaten our continuing prosperity. Accelerating productivity entails a matching acceleration in the potential output of goods and services and a corresponding rise in real incomes available to purchase the new output. The problem is that the pickup in productivity tends to create even greater increases in aggregate demand than in potential aggregate supply. This occurs principally because a rise in structural productivity growth has its counterpart in higher expectations for long-term corporate earnings. This, in turn, not only spurs business investment but also increases stock prices and the market value of assets held by households, creating additional purchasing power for which no additional goods or services have yet been produced. . . .
Imbalances in the labor markets perhaps may have even more serious implications for inflation pressures. While the pool of officially unemployed and those otherwise willing to work may continue to shrink, as it has persistently over the past seven years, there is an effective limit to new hiring, unless immigration is uncapped. At some point in the continuous reduction in the number of available workers willing to take jobs, short of the repeal of the law of supply and demand, wage increases must rise above even impressive gains in productivity. This would intensify inflationary pressures or squeeze profit margins, with either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity to an end. . . .
The recent good news on the budget suggests that our longer-run prospects for continuing this beneficial process of recycling savings from the public to the private sectors have improved greatly in recent years. Nonetheless, budget outlays are expected to come under mounting pressure as the baby boom generation moves into retirement, a process that gets under way a decade from now. Maintaining the surpluses and using them to repay debt over coming years will continue to be an important way the federal government can encourage productivity-enhancing investment and rising standards of living. Thus, we cannot afford to be lulled into letting down our guard on budgetary matters, an issue to which I shall return later in this testimony. . . .
However, to date, interest-sensitive spending has remained robust, and the F.O.M.C. Federal Open Market Committee will have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of potential supply, even should the acceleration of productivity continue. Achieving that alignment seems more pressing today than it did earlier, before the effects of imbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depth of our various buffers against inflationary pressures.
MR. LEACH: If I could turn to another subject, oil is on the minds of many people, with the price of oil going above $30 a barrel. And you've indicated that in a percentage basis, some of that was factored into the last half of last year's inflation index. Are you concerned that another oil shock could have deterring effects on our economy?
MR. GREENSPAN: Mr. Chairman, I've been through too many oil shocks to take them unseriously, even if the evidence does fairly conclusively indicate that the proportion of both the American economy, and indeed the rest of the world, that is dependent on oil for energy sources, is declining and has declined very measurably.
The problem that I think we have is that even in its reduced status, it is a very important element within an industrial system. And if the price changes fairly rapidly, it has a major impact on the structure of our economy. I think we're all acutely aware that the inventory levels of oil, both crude and products, in the United States has been driven down very substantially, well below normal. Indeed, some are joking that we need to measure the fumes to get any measurable inventory at all these days.
And what we know about very low inventories of any commodity is that if an untoward pressure, an unexpected pressure of demand, surges there is no buffer. And the result is a very substantial spike in prices with fairly substantial negative consequences to the economy.
I don't forecast that; I merely recognize that the inventory levels worldwide -- the so-called commercial stocks, which is those stocks available as a buffer to unexpected demands -- are exceptionally low. And even though we are moving into a period when the normal pressures begin to ease, we're starting from a very low base. And the simple answer to your question is, yes, I am concerned about what's happening to oil prices. . . .

To the Editor:
Re "World Bank Unit to Join in Internet Start-Up Finance" (Business Day, Feb. 14): The claim by James Wolfenson, the World Bank president, that the lack of Internet access is "one of the greatest impediments to development" trivializes the complex and enduring problems in developing countries. 
 The first world has tried to "develop" the third world since the 1960's, with little success. Problems of tribal warfare, exploitation and corruption and lack of educational opportunities vastly outweigh the new problem of the digital divide.
In Pessare, the village in Togo where I lived for two years, people farm by hand. There is no electricity or running water. The junior high school has only one book, a dictionary. How would Internet access help?

Nasdaq Surges as Dow Drops After Greenspan Comments

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Shrugging off the ever-more-likely prospect of additional interest rate increases this spring, technology stocks powered the Nasdaq market to a new record yesterday as turnover surged past two billion shares for the first time.
The Nasdaq composite index jumped 121.27 points, or 2.74 percent, to 4,548.92. 
 Other stocks, however, particularly those of the so-called Old Economy, languished once again. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 46.84 points, or 0.44 percent, to 10,514.57, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index barely managed to stay in positive territory, rising 0.59, or 0.04 percent, to 1,388.26.
The latest government report of minimal inflation spurred a general early rally, but Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, soon dampened sentiment with an unusually direct warning that higher rates would be needed to slow an overheated economy.
"For once, I thought I understood what he was saying -- that he will continue to increase interest rates until job creation slows," said Robert Bloom, president of Friends, Ivory & Sime, an investment management company. As a result, Mr. Bloom added, stocks are now on the defensive and 2000 is "a year to try to preserve gains."
The blue-chip index, which had been up more than 110 points, swung to a loss of nearly 107 points at midday and then clawed back part way in the afternoon.
Wal-Mart Stores and other retailers were once again prominent casualties; the discounter dropped 3 15/16 , to 48 15/16 , 30 percent below its Dec. 31 peak. Gap lost 6 7/8, to 42 1/8, and American Eagle Outfitters 4 15/16 , to 20 15/16 .
Financial stocks were also weak, especially American Express, which sank 5 29/32 , to 147 15/16 . Bank of New York, at the center of a money laundering case, fell 2 7/16 , to 35 1/16 .
But technology, both in the Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 -- the latter up 1.95 percent, to a second consecutive record -- was largely untouched by concern over rising rates.
Microsoft, which introduced Windows 2000, climbed 2, to 99 5/8; Intel, 2 13/16 , to 110; Qualcomm 8 1/8, to 130; Cisco Systems 3 21/64 , to 130 1/2; Juniper Networks 20 3/4, to 241 1/4; and eBay 4 9/16 , to 145 1/4.
DoubleClick, though, skidded a second day as the online advertising company faced a federal investigation into its collection of data on Internet users. The shares fell 15 3/4, to 90 3/4.
Cablevision Systems, the cable TV operator in the New York City area, fell 2 5/8, to 68 3/8, after reporting a widened fourth-quarter loss.
Rite Aid, facing a fraud investigation, fell 5/16 , to 6 5/8, down from more than 45 a year ago.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Treasury Prices Mixed
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices were mixed after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the Fed would keep raising interest rates as long as the economy showed no sign of slowing.
"We're apprehensive of rising inflation and interest rates," said Randy Bateman, who helps manage $1 billion for SunTrust Private Capital Group in Orlando, Fla.F
Two- and five-year Treasuries led the decline, with two-year yields rising to 6.67 percent, and five-year yields rising to 6.74 percent.
The 30-year bond rose 17/32 , to a price of 1007/16 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.22 percent from 6.26 percent on Wednesday. Two-year yields are now 45-hundredths of a percentage point above their longer-term counterparts -- the biggest gap since 1989.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 69-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Schwarz Sues Chief for Move To Toys 'R'Us

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
In what amounts to a grown-up toy war, F.A.O. Schwarz is suing John Eyler, its former chairman and chief executive, for jumping to the rival Toys "R" Us last month. The complaint says Mr. Eyler violated the terms of his employment contract, which required him to provide a year's notice before any departure and barred him from working for a competitor for two years.
The suit, filed on Jan. 26 in state Supreme Court in Manhattan by Schwarz and its parent company, Vendex KBB of the Netherlands, also faults Mr. Eyler for walking away with $2.4 million that, it contends, was paid in essence to keep him around. Mr. Eyler, 52, who became the top executive of Schwarz in 1992, was traveling yesterday and could not be reached for comment. Schwarz is seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent him from working at Toys "R" Us. A hearing has been scheduled for Wednesday. 
 A Toys "R" Us spokeswoman denied wrongdoing by the company and on behalf of Mr. Eyler. "We firmly believe the case has no merit whatsoever, and we will, of course, vigorously defend the matter," the spokeswoman, Rebecca Caruso said. Janis Meyer, a lawyer with Dewey Ballantine, which is representing Schwarz and Vendex, said her clients declined to comment.
Among the interesting details in the court papers is that Toys "R" Us and Schwarz held merger talks last year. The suit names Toys "R" Us, of Paramus, N.J., as a co-defendant and says it violated an agreement reached last June not to solicit or hire any Schwarz officers or senior employees for two years. At the time, Toys "R" Us was negotiating a possible purchase of the chain or an Internet partnership. Though no deal resulted, Toys "R" Us agreed not to court Schwarz employees for two years, according to the complaint.
While the toy sellers engage in their own wrestling over how far an employment contract can go, companies of all types are using "noncompete" and other restrictive employment contracts. And increasingly, in a vigorous economy and a tight labor market, companies are taking a tough stance on these agreements.
"I assume there might be more impetus, as a practical matter, to keep people on the reservation if they are harder to replace," said Don Collins, a New York University Law School professor. "I don't think that matters to the court much."
For some companies, the goal is to send a message to executives considering jumping ship. Other employers are seeking to prevent executives' expertise from benefiting a competitor for as long as possible. "The theory of it is to starve you into submission," Mr. Collins said.
The enforcement of such contracts varies greatly by state, with spurned companies finding their cases stronger if they can show harm or the loss of confidential company information.
In the toy case, Schwarz contends that Mr. Eyler's move gives Toys "R" Us an unfair competitive edge because he departed with knowledge of trade secrets and other confidential information.
The big payment that Mr. Eyler received in January was intended as a "golden parachute," should he leave after a change of control at Schwarz. Vendex merged with the toy seller's former owner in November 1998. Under his contract, he was entitled to $2.4 million if he left within 12 to 18 months of that change, the suit says.
Because of the potentially rich severance package, Mr. Eyler expressed "serious concern" to Vendex that he would have no choice but to leave to collect it, according to the court filing. Eager to keep him, the company agreed to give him the money by the end of 1999 to negotiate a new employment contract.
Toys "R" Us hired Mr. Eyler to help revive its business after five months without a chief executive. The company said at the time that it had hired Mr. Eyler for his "passion and energy for the toy business" as well as his experience in electronic commerce and catalog businesses.

HEADLINE: Technology Investors Tune Out Greenspan

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
When Alan Greenspan speaks, the Old Economy trembles. But the new one thinks it is impervious to higher interest rates, and shrugs off warnings from the Federal Reserve chairman.
That has been the pattern since the Fed began to raise interest rates last summer, and it continued yesterday. Mr. Greenspan's stark warnings that short-term interest rates would continue to rise had only a brief effect on the Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by high-technology companies that are benefiting from the digital revolution. 
 That index then shot up 121.27 points, or 2.7 percent, to a new high of 4,548.92, as the Nasdaq market traded two billion shares for the first time. The index is up 69 percent since June 30, the date of the first of the Fed's four rate increases.
But the story was different for the Dow Jones industrial average, which is far more dependent on stocks that are liable to be hurt as higher interest rates slow the economy.
It fell 100 points within minutes after the Fed chairman began testifying; while it recovered some of that, it ended down 46.84 points, or almost half a percentage point, at 10,514.57. It is down about 4 percent since June 30.
The consensus reaction on Wall Street seemed to be that little was new in the chairman's testimony. "Maybe he's raised his own estimate" of how high interest rates have to go to slow the economy, said Robert DiClemente, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. "But he didn't say we needed to get there faster."
For some time the fixed-income markets have been expecting at least two more increases in short-term rates by the Fed, with the first one, of at least a quarter percentage point, expected next month.
"The chairman's comments did not trigger any massive re-evaluation of where the Fed is going," said Louis Crandall, the chief economist of Wrightson Associates, a bond market research firm. "If anything, it may have made people a little more nervous" that the next increase might be a half percentage point, rather than the quarter-point raise seen in the previous increases.
Short-term interest rates rose moderately yesterday, though it is unclear how much of that was caused by Mr. Greenspan's remarks and how much by other factors, including a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia that indicated rising price pressures for manufacturing companies.
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan noted the willingness of many stock investors to shrug off the risk of higher interest rates.
"To date, rising business earnings expectations and declining compensation for risk have more than offset" the effect of higher rates, he said. But he forecast that, at some point, rates would rise enough to have an effect on the expectations of stock market investors.
"Greenspan seems dead-set on taking the punch bowl from the party," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief equity strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "The market is understanding that interest rates will continue to head higher."
Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, agreed. Mr. Greenspan, he said, "is committed to ending, for a time, outsized gains for the equity market."
Stocks, though, do not stop going up just because interest rates rise. They stop going up because investors stop bidding them up. So far, it appears, higher interest rates have alarmed investors in many industries. General Electric, Coca-Cola and Citigroup were among the Dow stocks that fell at least $1 yesterday.
But those losses were partly offset by gains in Microsoft, Intel and I.B.M. Technology stock investors are not worried about higher interest rates, and yesterday's forceful testimony from Mr. Greenspan did not change that.

HEADLINE: Iran Election Today a Referendum on Reform

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran, Feb. 17

 BODY:
At the age of 19, Abdi Manoumshah found himself at the epicenter of revolution. An Iranian Army officer, he was on guard duty outside the United States Embassy in the fall of 1979 when student firebrands seized what they called the "nest of spies" and took American diplomats hostage. Loyal to the new Islamic Republic, he stepped aside.
In the years since, he has fought in the war with Iraq, abandoned a law practice because it could not provide for his family, and tried to sustain the hopes kindled in those heady days when the powerful were humbled by the powerless. 
 "I thought the revolution would change things, but in a different direction, not where we have ended up," said Mr. Manoumshah, a pensive man of 40 who runs a tiny three-table restaurant shop near Tehran's central bazaar. "We wanted freedom to think and act as we liked. That is very much what people are asking for now."
The parliamentary elections on Friday have emerged as a referendum to define just whose ideals were at the heart of the Iranian revolution 21 years ago. The vote has become, as well, a popularity poll for President Mohammad Khatami, the reformist theologian who was swept into office in 1997 but has yet to realize much of his liberal social agenda or achieve his stated goal of improved relations with the United States.
For Iranians like Mr. Manoumshah, who is a Khatami supporter, the election for the Parliament, or Majlis, is a way to release the religious monopoly's brakes on everything from a free-market economy to a free press. "If the president has the Majlis behind him, nothing can stop him," he said. "And if he can achieve just 50 percent of what he has talked about, he will be a great success."
But the Old Guard that has resisted all reconciliation with the West and Western culture remains a powerful force. It lost the presidential election two and a half years ago, but has not lost power -- yet.
Mr. Khatami's promises to open Iranian society have already alarmed those right-wing forces, which include elements in the security forces blamed for killing several reformers last year, the state-sponsored vigilante groups that attacked student demonstrators last summer and the conservative clerics who have closed down a succession of independent newspapers.
"The election of President Khatami opened a vista, and from that time on, people started to criticize the system more objectively," said Hermezans Vavand, a professor of international relations at Tehran University. "The conservative movement then hardened its positions and reacted with violence toward anyone who was critical.
"But a great number of them are time-servers and opportunistic," he added. "They might end up getting on the bandwagon."
Whichever ideological faction wins control of Parliament, it will face the same mundane problems that have dogged Iran for years. Its economy has not grown fast enough to keep up with its ballooning population growth, with unemployment and poverty rising. Nearly 38 percent of its population is 15 or younger, a group that will also strain the job market. Much of Iran's production, meanwhile, is in the hands of secretive religious foundations that pay minimal taxes.
Mr. Khatami has proposed widespread privatization of industries that were nationalized after the revolution, and he has had some success in pushing his economic plans through Parliament.
"In general the Majlis has been fairly cooperative with him," said Ardavazd Baghoomian, who has served in Parliament for 16 years in one of two seats allotted to the country's 200,000 ethnic Armenians. "But if Khatami had a majority, he might have been able to push through more fundamental changes."
None of the political factions vying for seats in Parliament have talked about an economic plan, either for or against Mr. Khatami's. But the reformers have said they want to open the way for a frank public debate on all matters of public policy.
They have talked of reforming the court system, encouraging the formation of a range of political parties, and openly permitting satellite dishes and other elements of foreign culture that are officially prohibited but widely embraced.
Still, the powers of Parliament are limited, although in many ways untested. It approves and can impeach ministers. It approves the budget and economic policy. But no law is enacted unless it is also affirmed by the 12-member Council of Guardians, experts in Islamic law who have acted as a damper on change.
But a victory for the reformers in Parliament could upset even this venerable institution of the religious right wing. While half of the council's members are appointed by the Supreme Leader, the other six are selected by Parliament itself.
"Reforms will be done slowly, step by step," said Mohammad Reza Khatami, the brother of the president and one of the reform candidates for the Parliament in Tehran. "It's hard to say now in what order they would happen."
The one-week election campaign has skirted some of the more volatile issues that many Iranians avidly discuss in private, particularly the Constitution designed by the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that assigns ultimate authority over religious matters, foreign policy, security and much of the judiciary to a nonelected Supreme Leader. The current leader is Ayatollah Ali Khameini, who has condemned liberals, although not the president, as the agents of evil foreign powers.
The campaigns of all factions have dealt with generalities: helping the young, improving the economy, upholding Islam. Many candidates have also tried to capitalize on Mr. Khatami's image as an intellectual and a good-natured man, unlike the stern ayatollahs of the revolution whose pictures adorn buildings all over the country.
The Iranian news agency IRNA reported this week that 12 candidates in the northern city of Meshed were arrested on charges of election fraud because their campaign materials understated their ages.
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and Parliament speaker, has also tried to present a kinder face. He sent flyers to more than 2 million households in Tehran that show him bareheaded, without his black clerical turban, lounging in a garden with a little boy. "I will stay with you in winter and deliver you to the spring," the leaflet said.
Even the conservatives have flung around the word "freedom."
"We have no problems with the idea of freedom," said Mohammad Reza Bahonar, a member of the current Parliament and a key strategist for the conservative faction. "Our main slogans during the revolution were independence, freedom and an Islamic republic. After all, God created people as free beings."
Mr. Rafsanjani has become a pivotal figure in the campaign because he has been endorsed by several conservative factions even as the reformers vilify him as a man with no ideals. But for many Iranians he represents stability and a familiar face for a transitional time.
"People are tired of this right-left fight, which is really among the clergy and not relevant to the general public," said Sohrab Alizadeh, who is running a lonely and underfinanced race as an independent environmentalist in Tehran. "But Rafsanjani has been in power since the revolution, so in a way people feel like he has to be kept in the game."
More than 38 million Iranians are eligible to vote, and strategists in several parties have said a high turnout will favor the reform candidates, as it did Mr. Khatami in his presidential race.
The government first announced that the ballots from 36,000 polling stations across the country would be counted by computer, but the clerical body that oversees the elections said this week that they would be counted by hand. The final count may not be known for at least a week.
Some 6,000 people are running for the 290 seats, although the exact number was not known today because hundreds of candidates dropped out during the campaign week. And the day before the campaign began, a council of clerics dropped 777 candidates from the ballot, citing their views on the relationship between religion and government. Still, with so many candidates -- up to 100 for each seat in some districts -- pinpointing their positions based on their backgrounds has been difficult.
Those running as pro-Khatami candidates or making speeches in their support include former government officials forced out for espousing a free press, a film director who hopes that economic reform will revitalize the struggling Iranian cinema, a cleric whose job is to safeguard the writings of the late Ayatollah Khomeini, a post-revolution intelligence chief, a writer who led the student hostage-takers in 1979, and some high-ranking religious figures.
No one exemplifies this jumble of pedigrees better than Zahra Eshraghi, a 37-year-old employee of the Ministry of Interior. She is married to the president's brother and has campaigned with him. She is also the granddaughter of Ayatollah Khomeini, known as the Imam and the virulently anti-Western hero of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic.
"What is important is that if the reformers win, there will be a good balance between the Majlis and the Government," Mrs. Eshraghi said. "We have had a Majlis that was very monotone, with all the same kind of people. We should have a Majlis that is in keeping with the times."
She has campaigned for her husband and the reform list of candidates and said her grandfather would approve of her husband's bid, just as he had encouraged her to marry into the Khatami family.
"The government of President Khatami," she said, "is the same as the governments of the period of the Imam. The Imam himself had a high degree of trust for Mr. Khatami."

HEADLINE: Nassau Has Worst Credit Rating in Nation Among Wealthy Suburban Counties

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Feb. 17

 BODY:
The downgrading of Nassau County's bond rating to the level just above junk-bond status leaves it with the worst credit rating of any New York State county and makes it the lowest-rated wealthy suburban county in the nation, analysts said today.
When Moody's Investors Service downgraded Nassau's bonds on Wednesday from Baa2 to Baa3, it put the county's bond ratings more in line with those of poor rural counties in Mississippi and Alabama than those of similar rich suburbs. 
 "This is a spanking," the county comptroller, Frederick E. Parola, said of the downgrade. "They are fed up with lip service, and I think they are right."
Now, as the county prepares to sell more than $200 million in bonds at the beginning of next month, it will most likely face significantly steeper costs for insuring its bonds and be forced to offer higher interest to entice buyers to take the risk. Just how much that will cost the struggling county remains to be seen.
"We're not going to have any trouble borrowing, but it makes it more expensive," Mr. Parola said. "That is just more money we'll have to spend on debt service."
Nassau has become a paradox: a county with a well-heeled populace and fat tax rolls that consistently runs up deficits. The 2000 budget is already projected to fall between $120 million and $190 million short.
"From a resource standpoint, it has always been one of the mysteries of the municipal market," said Brad Gewher, the director of the municipal research group at PaineWebber.
As the latest downgrade sent jitters through county government circles, county officials took aim at government waste in the form of county cars.
Democrats on the County Legislature said today that they would work to root out waste in the government by auctioning off one-third of what they counted as the county's 486 cars, which does not include the Police Department's fleet.
Judith A. Jacobs, the presiding officer of the Legislature, said her staff had found that county cars were being used by a mail clerk in the Parks Department, the commissioner of jurors and people in the county's Cultural Development Office, among others.
She noted that even the Legislature gets eight cars. "There's no reason for that," she said.
So the Democrats proposed selling some cars to produce an estimated $1 million, not to mention savings in fuel costs and maintenance.
They also proposed a law that would reduce the fleet by one-third. And they called for every county car not used in undercover operations to be marked with a sticker, to discourage people from using their cars on personal business.
County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, meanwhile, said that he had already told his staff to turn in seven cars that had been deemed unnecessary and that he was evaluating whether or not the county's cars were needed.
A county vehicle should not be a perquisite, he said, adding that he agreed with the Democrats' motivation but questioned whether new laws were needed.
But an auction of county cars, while of symbolic importance, would bring in less than 1 percent of what the county needs to balance its books. Both the county executive and the Democrats in the Legislature have hired consultants to help them come up with recovery plans.
Ms. Jacobs warned that the solution would not come overnight. "It took years to get the county into this mess," she said.
County officials said it was difficult to quantify how much the latest downgrade was likely to cost the county. Peter White, the county's bond counsel, said it would be impossible to guess what it would do to the county's interest or insurance costs. But most analysts said those costs could only rise.
It is a strange situation for any wealthy suburb to find itself in. Even Orange County, Calif., home of one of the best-known fiscal crises in recent memory, has a much better bond rating now than Nassau does.
Unlike other fiscally troubled municipalities, Nassau County has not suffered a significant loss of population, industry or tax base. Rather, analysts say, it has consistently mismanaged its finances with unrealistic budgets in which the revenues do not cover the costs.
In downgrading the county's bond rating, Moody's signaled that it was not impressed with the measures the county had taken so far to cut costs. It singled out the loss of a $60 million land transfer tax that the old, Republican-controlled County Legislature enacted last year to balance the budget but then repealed after losing its majority on the Legislature to the Democrats in November.
And it noted in a statement that "the county faces a difficult political environment within which any plan for financial recovery will have to be formulated."

Greenspan Hints That Fed Will Increase Rates More
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the economy showed few signs of slowing despite four interest rate increases in eight months, and he warned in unusually direct terms that the central bank would probably raise rates further to avert inflation.
In testimony to the House Banking Committee, he also set what amounted to a speed limit for Wall Street, saying that wringing the risk of inflation out of the economy would require that stock and other asset prices rise no faster than household incomes. Page A1. 

Daft Heads Coke Ahead of Schedule
Douglas N. Daft, left, became chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola as M. Douglas Ivester moved up his retirement date. Mr. Ivester said in December that he would retire after two years in the company's top job, but agreed at the time to remain until April to smooth the management transition. Mr. Daft quickly took charge, eliminating the need for Mr. Ivester to remain. C9.
 
Nasdaq Breaks Record as Dow Falls
Technology stocks powered the Nasdaq composite index to a record, as investors shrugged off the ever-more-likely prospect of additional interest rate increases this spring. The Nasdaq jumped 121.27 points, or 2.74 percent, to 4,548.92.

America's Rags-to-Riches Myth

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Americans cling to the conceit that they have unrivaled opportunity to move up and, alas, down the income ladder. This notion, that families that occupy the bottom rungs of the income ladder readily exchange places with those that occupy higher rungs, breeds indifference to the most glaring economic fact of the past quarter-century: widening inequality. The gap in earnings, for example, between college and high school graduates has more than doubled.
Yet in a recent Op-Ed piece in The New York Times, W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm acknowledge that the wealth of poor families has been falling at the same time that the wealth of rich families has been rising, and ask, "So what?" 
 Mr. Cox and Mr. Alm suggest that mobility along the income ladder is serving as an antidote to inequality. But exactly how much mobility is there? According to them, quite a lot. "America isn't a caste society," they say, citing a study by the Federal Reserve that shows that only 5 percent of the poorest 20 percent of people stayed in that lowest income group over a 17-year period. Everyone else moved higher.
But this stunning statistic is stunningly misleading. Prof. Peter Gottschalk of Boston College points out that the Fed study counts teenagers and young adults from upper-income families who work part time while in school as moving upward when they find higher-paying jobs after graduation. This upward mobility of students hardly answers the enduring question: How many grown-ups are trapped in low-paying jobs?
The answer is, a lot. America's conceit is just that -- a conceit.
Mr. Gottschalk and Prof. Sheldon Danziger of the University of Michigan have looked at the plight of children during the 1970's and 80's. They separate children into five groups according to their family's income. About 6 in 10 of the children in the lowest group -- the poorest 20 percent -- in the early 1970's were still in the bottom income group 10 years later. Almost 9 in 10 children in the bottom group remained in the bottom two income groups 10 years later. Neither of these figures budged in the 1980's, providing solid evidence that mobility did not rise over the 20-year period. About 70 percent of poor black children in the early 1970's were still poor a decade later.
The upshot is that few families occupying the low rungs of America's income ladder get rich.
Economists provide no rule for figuring out how much mobility a society needs to counter the impact of any given amount of inequality. But there is indirect evidence that mobility is not high enough in this country to provide an adequate safety valve for those on the bottom rungs. Even if mobility was high enough 30 years ago to justify a so-what attitude toward inequality, it seems improbable that it could be high enough today, given that mobility has remained constant but inequality has reached extreme levels. Another sobering indicator: Mobility is no higher in the United States than in Western Europe, where living standards are comparable and there is only a fraction as much inequality.
Some inequality is essential for capitalism. High incomes are the reward for studying long hours, working hard and investing in risky businesses. But high incomes can result for reasons that have little to do with merit, reflecting rich parents, luck or manipulation of the political process. Inequality driven by such factors can breed social division, anger and a politics of resentment. It also belies the notion that America gives everyone a fair chance.
Economists are in general reluctant to tamper with market-driven incomes. The risk of squashing incentives and innovation can be great. But there is a compelling case for eradicating one virulent form of inequality: poverty. The richest country in the history of the universe tolerates a poverty rate of about 20 percent among its children, and about 35 percent among its black children. No conceit about mobility, real or imagined, can excuse that unconscionable fact.

HEADLINE: GREENSPAN WARNS OF ANOTHER RISE IN INTEREST RATES

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that the powerhouse economy shows few signs of slowing despite four interest rate increases over the last eight months, and he warned in unusually direct terms that the central bank would probably raise rates further to avert a buildup of inflation.
In testimony to the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan was also blunter than normal in suggesting that one of his primary targets in raising interest rates was the stock market. 
 For the first time he set out what amounted to a speed limit for Wall Street, saying that wringing the risk of inflation out of the economy would require that the prices of stocks and other assets rise no faster than household incomes.
Last year, household wealth -- a broad measure that captures the persistent gains in most stock prices -- grew twice as fast as income, according to figures often employed by economists at the Fed to gauge the effects of the market on the economy.
Mr. Greenspan did not specify what his arcane equation meant for popular measures of stock prices like the Dow Jones industrial average or the Nasdaq, although he emphasized that it would "not necessarily imply a decline in asset values."
Investors in blue-chip stocks seemed to heed the Fed chairman's warning, sending the Dow industrial average down 46.84 points, to 10,514.57. But investors in technology stocks -- as they have done repeatedly over the last few years -- thumbed their noses at Mr. Greenspan by driving the Nasdaq index up 121.27 points, to 4,548.92, another record.
The Fed next meets to consider monetary policy on March 21, and economists said the tone of Mr. Greenspan's testimony today all but ensured that the central bank would act then to raise its benchmark federal funds target rate by another quarter of a point, to 6 percent. They said additional increases could follow through the spring and into summer if the economy did not slow.
In a nod to the good news the nation has enjoyed now for years, Mr. Greenspan said the current combination of strong growth, low inflation, declining unemployment and improving efficiency among businesses and workers was unprecedented in the half-century he has spent monitoring the economy.
But he stressed that the good times could fall victim to gradually mounting inflation pressures if the Fed did not act to take some steam out of the expansion, which this month became the longest on record at eight years and 11 months. The previous record period of economic growth without a recession lasted through much of the 1960's.
In an appearance that touched on a wide array of topics, Mr. Greenspan brushed aside concerns that the recent turmoil in the bond market was making the Fed's job harder. Yes, he acknowledged, investors had driven down the interest rate on 30-year government bonds at a time when the Fed was trying to use higher interest rates to slow the economy. But the important thing, he said, was that rates paid by private-sector borrowers, especially corporations, had risen substantially. Mortgage rates, too, while not yet significantly slowing home building, have now reached a three and a half year high.
But in the formal report on monetary policy that he submitted to Congress today, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that aspects of the economy were making the central bank's job more complicated. In particular, the report said, the rise in the growth rate of productivity -- the amount that each worker produces per hour -- made the economy so resilient that the scale of interest rate increases needed to bring inflationary growth under control "may have increased substantially."
Mr. Greenspan reiterated his position that the federal budget surplus should be used to reduce the national debt rather than for tax cuts or new spending. And he said he was somewhat worried by the recent sharp rise in oil prices, but advised against selling the government's oil reserves to try to bring the price down, saying such a move would be ineffectual.
But his focus was on the risk that the economy was simply too strong for its own good.
The strains on the economy might soon become evident in the labor market, he said, where a rapidly declining pool of jobless workers could force employers to begin raising wages at a pace that could ignite a widespread and destabilizing rise in prices. The nation is also bumping up against the limit of how much it can afford to import from other countries, he said.
But he traced the underlying problem to the stock market. Buoyant stock prices, he said, were fueling consumer spending and business investment to such a degree that overall demand in the economy was outstripping supply. The only way to resolve that fundamental imbalance, he said in so many words, was to sharply curtail the relentless rise in equity prices.
"There is little evidence that the American economy, which grew more than 4 percent in 1999 and surged forward at an even faster pace in the second half of the year, is slowing appreciably," Mr. Greenspan said at the beginning of his twice-a-year testimony to Congress on monetary policy.
Some of the very factors underpinning the nation's remarkable economic performance -- falling joblessness, accelerating productivity, an improved outlook for corporate earnings -- "are also engendering a set of imbalances that, unless contained, threaten our continuing prosperity," Mr. Greenspan said.
The pressures on the economy have been eased so far by a surge in imports, which have made up for the inability of domestic producers to keep up with demand, and by the willingness of people who had not previously been in the labor force to get a job.
But those "safety valves," he said, could not contain inflationary pressures forever, especially since the rate increases so far have done little to rein in growth.
The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee "will have to stay alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with that of potential supply, even should the acceleration of productivity continue," Mr. Greenspan said.
"Achieving that alignment seems more pressing today than it did earlier, before the effects of imbalances began to cumulate, lessening the depths of our various buffers against inflationary pressures," he added.
Part of rebalancing the economy, he said, would be limiting or ending the rise in stock prices.
The remarkable run-up in stock prices over much of the last decade has been tempered or even reversed by some measures over the last six months, though it remains almost as breathtaking as ever by others. Mr. Greenspan made clear that he was not predicting a downturn in the market, emphasizing only that it would be difficult to achieve the kind of moderation he wants to see in the economy without a leveling off of stock prices.
"This does not necessarily imply a decline in asset values, although that, of course, can happen at any time for a number of reasons," he said, "but rather that these values will increase no faster than household incomes."
G. David Orr, an economist at First Union Securities, said, "If that is not targeting the stock market, what is it?"
Mr. Greenspan has long worried aloud about what economists call the "wealth effect," the idea that rising stock prices translate into higher spending levels by consumers. In his testimony today, he said historical evidence suggests that three to four cents of every dollar in additional stock market wealth is reflected in increased purchases by consumers.
The Fed chairman said he tracked the wealth effect by looking at the ratio of household net worth, or wealth, to income. According to data collected by the Fed, net worth was 4.88 times disposable income in 1988. By 1998, net worth was 5.95 times income.
The Fed has not yet released figures for 1999. But economists said wealth last year grew at about 11.3 percent, while income grew about 5.7 percent.
While the Fed's interest rate increases so far do not appear to have slowed demand, the inflation that Mr. Greenspan fears has also been a no-show. Just today, the government's report on prices at the producer level showed that inflation remained tame.
Indeed, the Fed's own forecast, submitted to Congress today as part of the monetary policy report, concludes that consumer prices this year will rise 1.75 percent to 2 percent, compared with 2 percent last year.
The report also forecasts that the economy will expand 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent, down from 4.2 percent last year. That implies that the Fed now believes that the economy has the capacity to grow at better than 3.5 percent a year over the long run without producing inflationary pressures, well above what economists believed possible not that long ago.

HEADLINE: Country's Time of Plenty Leaves Some States Behind

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: CHEYENNE, Wyo.

 BODY:
The nation's record economic expansion has left most states so flush with tax revenues that lawmakers argue over how to spend a surplus.
Not here. 
 These days, Wyoming's elected officials are debating how large the budget deficit could become and what services might be cut if dramatic new measures -- including taxes -- are not passed to raise revenues.
Did someone say new taxes? That is almost incomprehensible to people in Wyoming, who pay no personal income tax to the state and, overall, a lower percentage of their income in taxes than residents of any other state. That is why many of them live here.
But Wyomingites are not alone confronting difficult choices. While many Americans are growing wealthier and Congress debates how much of the federal surplus should be returned to taxpayers, a handful of states are facing choices that more commonly arise during recessions. Their lawmakers are deciding whether to raise taxes or cut spending because their state economies are not diversified enough to reap the full benefits of the boom.
In Louisiana, unstable oil prices and marginal increases in tax revenues have left the state facing a potential deficit of $540 million for the fiscal year beginning in July, state officials said. Mark Drennen, the commissioner of administration, said spending caps and cuts, including the dismissal of recently hired state employees, could offset much of it.
But a deficit of $275 million left after the cuts, he said, would require new revenue sources, including the possibility of a new business tax, which is supported by Gov. Mike Foster, or a penny increase in the 4 cent per dollar sales tax..
In Tennessee, Gov. Don Sundquist has been fighting for more than a year for tax changes to help cover increased spending in areas like education. After the Legislature rejected his proposals last year, he tried this year with a package that includes a 3.75 percent flat-rate state income tax. He challenged lawmakers to adopt his plan, find other revenue or cut spending by $342 million.
A slow rate of economic growth in Iowa caused by depressed farm prices, nearly full employment, a lack of new industries and an aging population forced Gov. Tom Vilsack to cut $30 million in spending from the current fiscal year budget of $4.5 billion.
"There is not a lot of room for growth if you are not able to add new jobs," said Randy Bauer, the Iowa budget director.
Some of the same factors forced the Kansas Legislature to reduce its current fiscal year budget of $4.45 billion by $65 million. "Actual revenue collection came up short of revenue forecasts, and that is what caused us to go back and reduce the level of spending," said Duane Goossen, the state budget director.
No state faces a more precarious economic situation than Wyoming, the least populated state with just 479,000 people, about the population of Denver. It is one of seven states with no personal income tax levied by the state and one of four with no corporate taxes, major windfalls in other states.
In addition, almost two-thirds of Wyoming is owned by the federal government, which means only a small part of the state budget comes from property taxes. The largest single source of tax revenues is from mining, as much as 60 percent in some years, followed by revenues from sales tax.
But state officials say Wyoming has grown too reliant on global markets for commodities that are found in vast abundance around Wyoming, including natural gas, coal and minerals.
When natural gas prices are booming, for example, Wyoming's budget is stable. The only reason the state is not facing a deficit for the fiscal year beginning July 1 -- after deficit projections of $127 million a year ago and $183 million six months ago -- is a recent surge in coal prices.
Those kinds of gyrations have forced state leaders to cut many programs, like services for the elderly, from the state's $4.1 billion two-year budget. They have also prompted Gov. Jim Geringer, a second-term Republican, to lead efforts to wean the state off the uncertainties of volatile markets.
"He's been out front on this, with the need to do something," said James King, a professor of political science at the University of Wyoming in Laramie.
"He realizes you can't put a Band-Aid on this. But whether he can truly get a long-term solution ... remains to be seen."
Part of Governor Geringer's campaign has been traveling the state, selling "a sense of responsibility" to people who have grown accustomed to low taxes. As he said in his state of the state address this week: "In order to create a long-term solution, we must make some difficult choices."
They may be on the way.
After state lawmakers returned on Monday for the 20-day budget session that is held every other year, House members approved one major revenue-raising measure for introduction as legislation, an extension of the state's 4 percent sales tax, which was scheduled to expire in 2002.
Votes on another proposal, a new tax on services, were held back until Friday to give lawmakers time to generate more support. But a raft of other proposals failed, including ones that would have created a personal income tax and a tax on electricity production and separate measures that would have increased taxes on fuel, cigarettes and property.
Still, in tax-loathing Wyoming, even one new tax is dramatic.
"I'm an optimist," said House Speaker Eli Bebout. "I think we're on the path toward long-term solutions."
Mr. Geringer said the Legislature is "a little bit gun shy" about long-range solutions. But he held out hope, saying it was just a matter of finding mutually agreeable approaches.
But even new taxes might not be enough to keep Wyoming stable in the long run. Other than scenic beauty, recreation and the tax base, Wyoming has few advantages for prospective residents and businesses over neighboring western states. Only one airport in the state, Jackson's, accommodates commercial jets..
Two years ago, a new state agency, the Wyoming Business Council, was formed to attract businesses, but some lawmakers are trying to eliminate its $21 million budget.
Leslie A. Ball, a council board member, says that would be a mistake. A former executive with Macy's who moved from New York to Cheyenne six years ago to become chief executive of a western wear company, he said the council has already landed eight new companies, bringing in 800 new jobs, and has prospects for more.
"There are a lot of obstacles here, but the state is starting to move a little bit," Mr. Ball said. "For the first time in a long time, all the economic categories are moving; I think the state has a fairly positive future."

HEADLINE: The Other Oil Economy;
Barrel Costs $30 but the Benefits Aren't Trickling Down

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Oil may not hold sway over the nation's economy the way it once did, but in places like Houma, La., it still, to a large degree, is the economy. Houma, 50 miles southwest of New Orleans, is a major center for oil drilling and oil field services -- the work of helping oil giants like Exxon Mobil find and produce oil.
So with oil prices surging, these should be boom times, right? Not necessarily. "It's picked up to some degree, but it's definitely not reflecting $30-a-barrel oil," said Robert Bergeron, Houma's mayor, who spent 40 years in the oil business, starting as a roughneck. "You hear more conversations about the positive future than any actual increase" in activity. 
 Even as oil prices hover at the highest levels in nine years, pushed by OPEC production cuts and recovering global economic activity, companies plan only modest production increases.
Worldwide capital spending for exploration and production will rise no more than 10 to 15 percent from last year's depressed levels, according to several predictions.
"This is probably the longest sustained, dramatic upturn in price not followed by a dramatic upturn in investment," said Joseph A. Stanislaw, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a research firm in Cambridge, Mass. "It's a degree of caution that hasn't been seen in the industry before."
The tepid spending means that oil-patch economies that rely on drilling and services, like parts of Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma, are not getting the lift they normally do when prices rise.
"I probably don't answer any question as much as, 'Gee, with oil prices high, shouldn't we be seeing the economy and oil patch take off?,' " said Timothy Ryan, dean of the University of New Orleans college of business. For us, it's the worst of all worlds. We end up with high crude oil prices, and high gasoline, but we don't get the positive effects that at least some states get from the boost in the economy that generally results from high oil prices."
Oil service stocks also reflect uncertainty about whether big oil companies will greatly increase capital spending soon. After OPEC announced production cuts last March, indexes that track the oil service industry nearly doubled in six months, as fears of cheap, $5-a-barrel oil evaporated. But lately oil service stocks have fluctuated wildly, only recently returning to their September highs, as investors try to figure out just how much the price surge will help. Yesterday, they fell sharply, along with the rest of the market.
There is always a lag between prices beginning to rise and companies committing greater sums to find more oil. But as large producers report their anticipated capital expenditures for this year, with some even disclosing decreases, many analysts and executives say the industry's muted reaction to this price spike is highly unusual.
A big reason is that a lot of companies appear unconvinced that oil can stay close to $30, the current price for crude, or even the low $20's. Their skepticism derives from a belief that OPEC cannot keep member nations from cheating on production limits for long when prices get this high. Moreover, pressure from the United States and other countries to lift output appears to be having some effect. On Thursday, the Saudi oil minister said oil should ideally trade between $20 and $25, while his counterpart in Venezuela said action needed to be taken to stabilize prices.
That would be good news for consumers squeezed by costly heating oil and gasoline. But even if OPEC decides at its March meeting to increase production, it could be too late to lower gas prices by summer, as inventories have fallen sharply in recent months.
Some analysts say that even if OPEC lifts production, oil prices could still rise. Philip K. Verleger, a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., said $40 oil would still be feasible later this year if Iraq cut off its supply to protest United Nations sanctions. "It's almost too late to avoid this impending dependence on Iraq, barring an economic slowdown," Mr. Verleger said.
And even if domestic oil producers reverse course and seek out new sources aggressively, it would not have much of an effect on world supply and demand anytime soon: Total domestic oil production is about 6 million barrels a day, out of more than 70 million worldwide.
Aside from skepticism about OPEC's resolve, other temporary factors have led oil companies to rein in spending, like the rapid pace of mergers forcing producers to focus on integrating newly bought companies.
But the restraint also has deeper reasons, analysts and industry executives say. Some producers, rethinking the growth-at-all-costs strategy, now preach "capital discipline."
That means giving careful consideration to options like debt repayment and stock buybacks. Investors, meanwhile, have shut off the flow of fresh capital to many exploration and production companies. And some producers say the huge recent price swings have shaken out many longtime drilling and service workers, leading to labor shortages.
All that could change quickly if oil prices keep rising, or if OPEC continues to curb production and the industry persuades itself that this time the cartel can keep its members from cheating.
But for now, signs are that capital spending growth will be soft. John S. Herold Inc., an industry researcher in Stamford, Conn., forecasts that worldwide spending on oil and gas exploration, development and proved acquisitions will rise 14 percent this year, to $86 billion -- far less than the $108 billion spent as recently as 1998. The number of active rotary drilling oil rigs in the United States has risen 38 percent in the last year, to 153, according to Baker Hughes, a Houston oil services concern, and is still far below its highs for the decade.
"What you're seeing is companies being a whole lot more discriminating in the projects they pursue with excess capital," said Bobby S. Shackouls, chief executive of Burlington Resources, a large independent exploration and production company in Houston that expects to lift capital spending this year by about a quarter, to $1 billion.
A number of independent companies, his included, have abandoned strategies that focused mostly on production growth, Mr. Shackouls said. "Companies have delivered volume growth in the past," he said, "but many times that volume growth has been delivered with returns that were less than the cost of capital required to generate it. The market just doesn't like that."
The same is true at some larger companies. "The major companies that spend most of the money have been recently focused more on returns," said J. Michael Talbert, chief executive of Transocean Sedco Forex, in Houston, the nation's largest offshore driller.
Many of Mr. Talbert's customers have been undertaking big projects only after deciding they would still make financial sense even if oil fell to $13. "They've heightened the bar," he said.
But Mr. Talbert added that his company was beginning to see an uptick in activity. "I'm surprised that some of the capital plans seem to be as limited as they are," he said. "If prices stay at $30 a barrel, somebody is going to draw an awful lot of new wells."
The push to make producers rethink capital allocation is also coming from Wall Street. A Goldman, Sachs analyst, Donald Textor, suggested in a report this month that many independent exploration companies would benefit from large-scale stock buybacks to soak up profits rather than pouring the money into the ground. "Higher sustained share prices," Mr. Textor concluded, "will depend on management's ability to invest cash flow wisely, either in their respective businesses if opportunities are present or alternatively in their own shares if valuation justifies this capital allocation."
For the moment, most independents, still recovering from the earlier era of cheap oil, are focused on paying down debt, and otherwise improving their finances.
On Wall Street, only the larger exploration and production companies are finding investors willing to buy shares or lend money. Last year, just $125 million was raised in initial public offerings, while debt issuance fell sharply, the Herold firm reported. Not long ago the spigots were wide open: In 1997 and 1998, financing from Wall Street helped exploration and production companies make capital investments $40 billion higher than their operating cash flow, the firm reported. In contrast, 1999 was the first time in five years that capital spending did not exceed cash flow -- in other words, companies did not binge on easy money.
To be sure, the Internet craze has drawn money from oil and other slower-growth industries. But so has oil's sister business, natural gas, a fuel used to power everything from power plants to kitchen stoves. To many investors, demand for gas is easier to quantify than oil, and is not dependent on the whims of OPEC ministers half a world away.
"Natural gas prices are quite strong and the percentage of capital dollars being directed toward gas is greater today than at any other point," said Ken Hersh, managing director of Natural Gas Partners, a $950 million venture equity fund in Fort Worth focusing on oil and gas.
Paradoxically, some oil producers that do have money to spend say they have been hamstrung by a shortage of skilled oil services workers. Danny Biggs, vice president of Pickrell Drilling, in Wichita, Kan., said longtime oilfield workers had been taking jobs that pay less, like hospital maintenance. "We just can't find the help," Mr. Biggs said. "These guys working on the rigs, they get laid off, then they work, then they get laid off. A lot of them have decided they want steady work."
The talent outflow has been speeded by demand for labor in other fields. "With the economy outside the oil industry doing quite well, it's awfully difficult to convince someone to stay on and count on this business to feed and support their family," said Stephen Layton, chief executive of Equinox Oil, a private concern in Woodlands, Tex. "Six months or a year from now we could be right back where we were in 1998," he said, making it "a very hard sell."
Still, demand for workers would be greater had the industry not suffered through $12-a-barrel oil, said Mr. Layton, who likens a typical independent producer to a man standing on the foundation of his recently demolished house: "The storm has passed, the sun is shining. Aren't things wonderful? No. He's got to rebuild his house."

HEADLINE: A Year in Which Political Bluebloods Are Leaders of the Pack

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C.

 BODY:
For a country like the United States that has kings only on chessboards, where nobility is a trait rather than a social class, where pedigrees typically concern dogs, there are a couple of peculiar things about this presidential contest.
The first is that most of this year's major presidential candidates arose from a privileged elite vaguely reminiscent of the nobility that the United States has always forsworn. This is easily the most patrician cast of contenders in many decades, and the November general election could pit George W. Bush, a third-generation politician who is the grandson of a senator and son of a president, against Al Gore, the son of a senator. 
 The second thing is that nobody seems to care.
"My dad was a truck driver," said Robert Despres, a truck driver who watched a speech by Mr. Bush in New Hampshire. "When I was 6 years old, I knew I was going to be a truck driver, too. So if he wants to follow his dad and he does well, it doesn't matter to me."
In Delaware, a white-haired welder named Fred Dobrzynski said that he worked for a company that had been passed down from father to son and said of the political dynasties: "That's America! I don't really have a problem with nepotism."
Halfway across the country in Iowa, a retired teacher named Larry Hamilton shrugged at the thought of political dynasties in the United States. "We have this idea in the U.S. that anybody can grow up to be president, but we also know that's not quite right," Mr. Hamilton said. "It doesn't really bother me."
And in the hamlet of Wolfton, in central South Carolina, Wanda Reese stood at the counter of her little general store and put it this way: "You can't hold it against them, just because they got some advantage. If somebody came in here and gave me a sack of gold, I'd take it."
In interviews in recent weeks, many voters said that the candidates had enjoyed a leg up because of their parentage. But instead of being uncomfortable with this, some regarded a candidate's blue blood as a plus.
"It would probably be an asset that his father had been president," Debra L. Devine, a former nurse who is now a stay-at-home mother, said after a Bush rally in New Hampshire. "Maybe he's had more firsthand experience."
It is not just Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore who grew up with famous names that helped them launch political careers. Senator John McCain's father and grandfather were both well-known admirals and public figures. Steve Forbes, who recently dropped out of the race, inherited his wealth and fame.
Among major candidates, only former Senator Bill Bradley is an exception. His father, a banker, was a big man in a small town but not a politician.
Paradoxically, although Americans sometimes poke fun at political nepotism in countries like Japan or at the doddering heirs who until last year filled Britain's House of Lords, it is probably the United States that throughout its history has had the most political dynasties.
John Adams and his son John Quincy Adams were both president and three other Adams descendants sought the presidency or vice presidency. William Henry Harrison was the grandfather of Benjamin Harrison, and Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt were distant cousins.
Stephen Hess, a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, calculated in a 1965 book, "America's Political Dynasties," that, until then, 17 percent of members of Congress had come from families that had sent at least two members to the House or Senate.
"It's fascinating to see this in a country that in its Constitution prohibits titles of nobility," Mr. Hess said in a telephone interview. "Of course we have created a nobility."
Yet he cautioned that while a famous name helped, a rule of thumb was that it simply allowed a candidate to start a career one rung higher than would otherwise be possible -- for a Congressional seat, say, instead of one in the state legislature. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore may have been initially helped by their names, he suggested, but since then have emerged as contenders largely on their own strengths.
The success of second- and third-generation politicians this year may also reflect the good economic times and less resentment of privilege. Certainly none of the candidates seem bashful about their family backgrounds, and Mr. Bush in particular refers to it in speeches in ways calculated to win applause.
"When it comes to selecting parents, I did a fabulous job!" Mr. Bush sometimes tells audiences, and they roar back in approval.
Still, there has been speculation that former President Bush's campaign appearances for his son in New Hampshire may have undermined the younger Mr. Bush, by reinforcing the perception among some voters that he is a lightweight riding on his father's shoulders. Since then, Mr. Bush has been more restrained about having his father make campaign appearances.
Some voters said that they thought there was something vaguely undemocratic about a system that produced so many second- and third-generation politicians, but they said it lightly and did not seem much perturbed.
"It bothers me, because it's not democracy," said Bradley J. Wilson, an Iowa farmer. "But I realize that you can be from that background and still have good views."
While it may be that neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gore would have entered politics had their fathers not been politicians, there are also liabilities associated with the genes. Mr. Bush wrote in his autobiography that when he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1978, Ronald Reagan endorsed his primary opponent -- possibly because of fears that a victory would have helped Mr. Bush's father if he had challenged Mr. Reagan in 1980.
It is difficult to describe the political aristocracy in this election as a trend, both because of the historic strength of political dynasties and because the last presidential election featured a race between two self-made men, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole.
So why are this year's candidates so drawn from the Social Register?
Perhaps it is a fluke, or perhaps it reflects the importance of money and name recognition in campaigns today.
Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause, said that the prevalence of familiar names underscored the pressures these days of campaign fund-raising and, in his view, the need to change the system for financing campaigns.
"If you don't have the money, you can't compete," Mr. Harshbarger said. Noting that several credible candidates had dropped out even before the primaries, he added, "The presidential selection process was bypassed."
Bill Sousa, a social studies teacher in Merrimack, N.H., said that this year's election might make it a bit more difficult to teach students that anyone can become president. But, he quickly added, he already emphasizes to students that the political playing field tilts here and there.
Mr. Sousa said that today's political aristocracy was not unlike the situation a couple of centuries ago in America, when wealthy plantation owners regarded themselves as an elite who would serve the country with honesty and dedication. Referring to today's second- and third-generation candidates, Mr. Sousa said, "That's what the founding fathers intended."

HEADLINE: Chechnya: Steps To Peace

BYLINE: By Andrew Bennett; Andrew Bennett, a professor of government at Georgetown, is the author of "Condemned to Repetition? The Rise, Fall and Reprise of Soviet-Russian Military Interventionism 1973-1996."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With the inevitability of a Greek tragedy, Russia's military intervention in Chechnya has followed the script rehearsed in the war in the mid-1990's.
As in February 1995, Russian soldiers are picking over the ruins of Grozny, the Chechen capital, after a costly fight and are facing a vicious battle in the mountains of southern Chechnya. Russia must now decide if it wants to repeat the closing act of the previous war, when it rejected negotiations with the Chechens after taking Grozny. It only conceded to a peace agreement in 1997, after two years of guerrilla warfare and terrorist attacks by Chechen rebels. 
 Negotiations would require both sides to take political risks and face down their hard-line factions. But there are good reasons to think that this time both sides may try to make a deal.
Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president, is in a stronger position to seek negotiations than Boris Yeltsin was in 1995. Mr. Putin's ruthless offensive in Chechnya has won him much higher approval ratings than Mr. Yeltsin had after his ill-prepared assault on Grozny five years ago. Mr. Putin also knows that recent polls have shown that the Russian public's support for the war has softened as casualties have increased. And some Russian leaders, including Sergei Stepashin, a former prime minister, and Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow have begun to criticize the continued use of force in Chechnya.
The greatest risk to Mr. Putin's election as president next month is not a backlash from hard-liners for negotiating an agreement, but a terrorist attack or counteroffensive in Chechnya.
The Chechens, too, might be more likely to seek a truce this time around. President Aslan Maskhadov does not control all of Chechnya's factions. But he remains the republic's most legitimate leader, and he is far more reasonable that Dzhokhar Dudayev, the breakaway republic's leader five years ago. Mr. Maskhadov has never supported terrorist tactics, and has criticized radical Islamic leaders like Shamil Basayev. Last fall he even said that he might be willing to part with Mr. Basayev, but couldn't do so as long as he faced a Russian invasion.
It would be politically risky for either Mr. Putin or Mr. Maskhadov to be the first to seek a settlement. Thus the first tentative steps toward negotiations might depend on the unlikely person of Malik Saidullayev, a Chechen who made his fortune running Moscow's largest lottery. Mr. Saidullayev is the head of the Chechen state council, a shadow government appointed by Moscow, which is viewed by many of the republic's leaders as a puppet regime. But Mr. Saidullayev has established some credibility with the Chechen people by forcefully criticizing Russian atrocities in the recent offensive. Speculation is that he might make a legitimate intermediary between Mr. Putin and Mr. Maskhadov.
It is clear what the outlines of any mutually acceptable agreement must be. Russia will demand security from Islamic terrorism, including a buffer zone in northern Chechnya manned by Russian troops. A new Chechen government would likely insist on autonomy for the rest of its territory, as well as reconstruction assistance from Moscow and possibily military help in getting rid of extremist holdouts.
And both sides would likely demand the expulsion of the hard-liners from Chechnya -- meaning not only Mr. Basayev and other warlords but also the most overeager of Russia's generals.
What can the United States do to tip the scales toward peace?
President Clinton has until now wisely avoided a confrontation over Chechnya. He has delayed several loans from the International Monetary Fund and the Export-Import Bank but has cited Russia's economic mismanagement and corruption as the reason rather than explicitly mentioning the war in Chechnya. Perhaps now is the time to inform Russia's leaders that American-backed loans will become inextricably linked to Chechnya if Russia fails to seek a settlement.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Donations to Needy Fall Behind Last Year's Tally

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Since The New York Times Neediest Cases appeal of 1994-95, the amount of money readers have given to the fund has increased year after year.
But in a turn of events that bodes ill for the fund, for the first time this season, the amount of money received to date has fallen well behind the total at this point during last year's campaign. 
 By March 8, 1999, when the Neediest Cases Fund closed its coffers for the 1998-99 appeal, it had received $6,701,122.57 in donations.
This year, the fund has $539,370.93 less than the amount that had been raised by this point a year ago, $6,148,774.55.
At the seven agencies that are supported by the fund, the news that there may not be as much help for them this year was greeted with sadness.
"It would be a blow to us," said Donna Santarsiero, executive director of the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the agencies. "Across the board, our programs for children and disabled adults rely heavily on the proceeds from The New York Times and its generous readers. If there were a reduction in funding from last year's level, we would have to take a careful look at all our programs, all of which are critical."
Among other things, the bureau helps deaf and mentally retarded New Yorkers find meaningful employment, prevents children from going into foster care by assisting parents who are struggling to make ends meet, and provides homeless women with a place to live.
At the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, another of the agencies supported by the fund, worries about the shortfall were equally poignant.
"Since the money we get goes to individuals and families," said Megan McLaughlin, executive director, "it means that fewer individuals and families would get the direct assistance that they need to help them over the hurdle that they're facing. Fewer families in crisis would get the help they need."
The federation uses money provided by The Times to prevent struggling families from becoming homeless, usually by giving them a one-time rental assistance check to tide them over.
"In this time of plenty, we're all blessed," Ms. McLaughlin said. "The economy is humming. Employment rates are higher. But the reality is that there are still those among us that need our help."
One family from Great Neck, N.Y., recently took a step toward helping the less fortunate. Jon R. Cohen and Karen M. Kostroff, both surgeons, held a black-tie millennium party for 150 friends and relatives in tents set up on their lawn. Guests were encouraged to make a donation to the Neediest Cases Fund instead of giving a gift to the hosts.
"We have always been impressed with the heartwarming stories about those people helped by support from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund," Dr. Cohen and Dr. Kostroff wrote in a letter to the fund on Jan. 1.
Guests were asked to give $200, but many gave hundreds more, Dr. Kostroff said. All told, the party raised $12,500.
"It went above our greatest expectations," Dr. Kostroff said.
The fund needs more than $1 million to match last year's total, but that goal could be reached before the campaign concludes in early March if enough readers contribute.
"We're hoping for a burst of generosity that will permit us to do better than last year," said Jack Rosenthal, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the Neediest Cases Fund.

HEADLINE: A Rebuke for Mr. Mugabe

 BODY:
When Zimbabwe achieved independence from white minority rule in 1980 in what had been Rhodesia, its newly elected leader, Robert Mugabe, held out the promise of transforming a state that was not only racist but brutally authoritarian. Many hoped he could make Zimbabwe a model for what was then still an apartheid-ruled South Africa, on its southern border. The former guerrilla leader made progress in dismantling the legacies of racism, but he maintained the machinery of authoritarianism that he inherited from Rhodesia's last white leader, Ian Smith, including sweeping emergency powers.
It has been two decades since independence, and President Mugabe has long since grown accustomed to autocratic power. He presides now over a corrupt, sclerotic and repressive state that is rapidly driving Zimbabwe into economic ruin. But Mr. Mugabe's disappointing dominance of Zimbabwean politics is now under attack by his countrymen. This week they convincingly defeated a constitutional referendum that would have strengthened his executive powers and allowed him to confiscate white-owned land without compensation. The vote was both a stinging rebuke to Mr. Mugabe's leadership and a victory for democracy. 
 The fledgling opposition Movement for Democratic Change is led by trade-union activists, church leaders and domestic human rights organizations. It cuts across racial, ethnic and class divisions. It had abundant ammunition with which to attack Mr. Mugabe's leadership: fuel shortages, 60 percent inflation, more than 50 percent unemployment in urban areas, and pervasive corruption. His costly military intervention in Congo is deeply unpopular.
The referendum did not signal the demise of Mr. Mugabe's government. It still enjoys extensive powers of patronage and coercion, as well as a monopoly on broadcast media. But Mr. Mugabe now faces the prospect of elections for Parliament in April in which his dominant ZANU-PF party will probably encounter its toughest challenge since independence. He is expected to seek a fifth five-year term as president in 2002. He has reason to cling to power. In today's climate of prosecutions against former heads of state, he could face criminal liability, both at home and abroad, for abuses committed by his security forces.
The precipitous decline of Zimbabwe's economy and fears of political turmoil could undermine the hard-won stability of its closest neighbors and trading partners, notably Mozambique and South Africa. The United States and other democracies can help by using their influence to discourage Mr. Mugabe from manipulating the democratic process. This week he sounded a conciliatory note and promised to "respect the will of the people." Perhaps he has gotten the message that his countrymen have lost patience with his autocratic rule.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Set Record in '99, But Narrowed In December

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit in goods and services narrowed in December, as rebounding economies abroad kindled record demand for American goods, government figures showed. Still, the trade gap for all of 1999 set a record.
The December deficit slipped to $25.5 billion from $27.1 billion in November, the Commerce Department reported. While imports rose 1 percent to a record, they were outpaced by a 3.2 percent jump in exports, led by commercial aircraft. 
 The 1999 deficit totaled $271.3 billion, almost two-thirds larger than the previous record of $164.3 billion in 1998, as imports surged 12 percent. Economists say the gap showed how goods made elsewhere played a role in meeting consumer demand in the United States during a record expansion that is now in its 107th month. This year, rising exports will increase United States factory output, they said.
"Certainly as the global economy recovers, this is going to provide increased export markets for U.S. manufacturers," said William Sullivan, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. That and the damping effect on consumer spending of further interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board should reduce the deficit this year, analysts say.
The trade imbalances with Japan, China, Western Europe, Canada and Mexico grew to their widest ever last year.
In December, imports of goods and services rose to $110.7 billion, reflecting demand for consumer goods, autos and parts, and industrial materials. Exports increased to a monthly high of $85.2 billion in December. For all of last year, imports rose to $1.23 trillion, the largest increase in five years. Exports in 1999 climbed 2.6 percent, to $958.5 billion.
Auto imports rose 3.4 percent in December after gaining 2.9 percent in November, the Commerce Department reported.
Oil prices had a role in the wider trade gap as well. The United States imports more than half its crude oil.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last year agreed to limit output in an effort to eliminate a global oil surplus. That caused crude oil prices to more than double from a 12-year low of $10.35 a barrel in December 1998. This week, they topped $30 a barrel. The trade deficit with OPEC's member nations narrowed to $1.2 billion in December, from $2.8 billion in November, while rising from $109 million in December 1998. For all of last year, the deficit with OPEC nations rose to $21.7 billion, the highest in three years.
The deficit with Japan grew to a record $73.9 billion for all of 1999. The trade deficit with China last year expanded to a record $68.7 billion.
Few people express alarm over the trade deficit the way they did in the 1980's. "In the 80's, we worried about the trade deficit because foreign production was displacing domestic employment," said Christopher Low, an economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York. "Now it is offsetting a shortfall of domestic workers."

HEADLINE: Prices Show A Small Rise For January

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Consumer Price Index, the nation's best-known inflation measure, edged up only 0.2 percent in January -- the fourth consecutive mild increase -- undercutting numerous forecasts that the booming economy is creating shortages that must inevitably show up in more rapidly rising prices.
Apparel and cars helped to keep inflation in check in January. Prices fell in both categories, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday, with apparel prices dropping 1.1 percent, the biggest one-month decline since February 1989. Energy prices jumped, of course, rising by 1 percent, but that was a smaller increase than many analysts had expected given the steeply rising cost of crude oil. 
 "Other than petroleum-based energy -- mainly gasoline and heating oil -- there has been no steady price acceleration in any sector of the economy," said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist at the bureau's consumer price division.
The Commerce Department, in a separate report yesterday, said that the nation's trade deficit had narrowed to $25.55 billion in December from $27.1 billion in November, largely because exports jumped. The export rise suggested that the economy had expanded more rapidly in the fourth quarter than the government had originally thought. The gross domestic product may have grown at a 6 percent annual rate, some analysts said, rather than the 5.8 percent estimate announced last month by the Commerce Department. A revision of this estimate is to be published next Friday.
Several Wall Street economists reacted to the inflation report with more alarm than Mr. Jackman did, seeing in the details signs of accelerating inflation. Since October, consumer prices have risen each month at the same mild 0.2 percent, and over the previous 12 months the rise has been only 2.6 or 2.7 percent. The annual rise is much less when two elements that fluctuate considerably -- food and energy -- are excluded. Then the increase in "core inflation" was 2.1 percent in October and November, falling to 1.9 percent in the last two months.
But service sector prices and housing costs have edged up after falling during the summer and fall, and several economists pointed this out, among them Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, a Wall Street firm. "There are some things in the C.P.I. report that I really do not like," he said. "The overall numbers are still mild, but there are bits and pieces that suggest an upward push."
The latest C.P.I. report was issued the day after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress that the demand for goods and services had been rising faster than the supply, a condition that cannot continue indefinitely. The stock market has played a big role in generating so much consumption, he said, and he suggested that the Fed would push up rates to slow the economy, and the market, until supply and demand were once again in balance. "Real long-term rates will at some point be high enough to finally balance demand with supply," he said.
Real interest rates have already risen steeply in the last year. Real rates are what people pay for a mortgage, for example, minus the inflation rate. The reasoning is that inflation offsets the cost of a loan because the value of the home purchased rises with inflation. So does the debtor's income, which means that loan payments become a smaller percentage of the person's income. Real rates then represent the true cost of a loan.
They are up a steep one percentage point in less than a year. The Fed has raised short-term loan rates by that much, to nearly 6 percent, while the core annual inflation rate has remained at 2 percent. Mr. Greenspan's Congressional testimony suggested that the Fed's policy makers planned another rate increase for March 21, their next meeting. The Consumer Price Index report for February will be published four days earlier.
That next report is likely to show higher gasoline and heating oil prices, and higher cigarette prices, just on the basis of price increases since late January, Mr. Jackman and other economists said.
The January report showed the same scattered mix of higher and lower prices that has characterized the monthly reports since last summer. New and used car prices, for example, fell mainly because of a $500 "loyalty" rebate that was offered by General Motors, Mr. Jackman said.
Education costs jumped in January primarily because encyclopedia companies eliminated a price discount that drew buyers in December. Apparel prices almost always drop sharply in the weeks after Christmas, although last month's decline was greater than usual. "These are your post-holiday sales," Mr. Jackman said.
Cigarette prices rose a steep 1.7 percent, partly because of recent tax increases. Airline fares, however, fell in January despite temporary surcharges to cover rising fuel prices. Supersaver discount fares more than offset the surcharges.
"If you are looking for trouble, you can always find items that suggest that inflation is rebounding," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown. "But inflation is defined as a broad increase in prices, and that has not happened."

HEADLINE: What I Saw at the Revolution

BYLINE: By Donald J. Trump; Donald J. Trump is the president of the Trump Organization.

 BODY:
Don King, the boxing promoter, has stated that my recent presidential exploratory campaign was one of the greatest promotions of all time. Sadly, many have agreed with him and have thought that my foray into presidential politics was done for the purpose of further heightening the Trump name, helping to sell my new book and building even greater awareness of my various real estate developments.
That, however, is not the case. I seriously thought that America might be ready for a businessman president, someone with an eye for the bottom line, someone who has created thousands of jobs and isn't part of the "inside the Beltway" buddy system. I also thought that Americans might be ready for straight talk and that they would find an unscripted candidate appealing. 
 Jesse Ventura's victory in Minnesota served as my model. A nonpolitician celebrity who spoke uncommonly straight to the voters, Mr. Ventura came out of nowhere to beat two experienced, big-name politicians at a time of economic prosperity, and he did so as the nominee of a fledgling third party.
The Reform Party was my chosen vehicle because its nomination process does not involve a long string of early primaries, but instead culminates in one national primary conducted by mail and e-mail in August. Refreshingly democratic, the Reform Party process would lend itself to a candidate with national name recognition and the financial resources to flood the process with new people.
A presidential exploratory campaign is the greatest civics lesson that a private citizen can have. In the course of my exploration, I met dozens of talented, dedicated Reform Party members who were involved, with little reward or recognition, solely because of their commitment to cleaning up the American political system. I marveled at the long and thankless hours put in by people like the New York Independence Party chairman, Jack Essenberg; the former national chairman, Russ Verney; and the Minnesota Reform Party chairman, Rick McCluhan.
I also saw the underside of the Reform Party. The fringe element that wanted to repeal the federal income tax, believed that the country was being run by the Trilateral Commission and suspected that my potential candidacy was a stalking horse for (take your pick) Gov. George W. Bush, Senator John McCain or Vice President Al Gore.
When I held a reception for Reform Party leaders in California, the room was crowded with Elvis look-alikes, resplendent in various campaign buttons and anxious to give me a pamphlet explaining the Swiss-Zionist conspiracy to control America.
Three things happened to destroy any viable chance that I may have had to run an insurgent candidacy in the fall. The Commission on Presidential Debates, made up solely of Republicans and Democrats, produced debate criteria specifically designed to keep the Reform Party's candidate out of the fall debates. I felt confident that I could sell the American people if I could get into the debate, but my lawyers told me that was unlikely.
I preferred a race against Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, two establishment politicians whose nominations looked certain and whose issue positions seemed virtually indistinguishable; both support America's current trade policies, including Nafta and the World Trade Organization.
I felt confident that my argument that America was being ripped off by our major trade partners and that it was time for tougher trade negotiations would have resonance in a race against the two Ivy League contenders. The rise of John McCain, running on a reform message, made the opportunity for this contrast difficult, and depending on the outcome of the South Carolina primary, perhaps impossible.
Finally, the fratricide in the national Reform Party drove the party's most prominent star, Jesse Ventura, out of the party and culminated in a nationally televised meltdown at the national meeting last week, in which the proceedings grew so unruly that someone called 911 to ask the police to restore order.
Although I am totally comfortable with the people in the New York Independence Party, I leave the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company I wish to keep.
In the days before I decided to end my presidential exploratory effort, I was watching CNN and saw Vice President Gore trudging through the snow in subzero temperatures, knocking on doors in New Hampshire -- an obvious look of drudgery on his face. My experience was quite different. I had enormous fun thinking about a presidential candidacy and count it as one of my great life experiences. Although I must admit that it still doesn't compare with completing one of the great skyscrapers of Manhattan, I cannot rule out another bid for the presidency in 2004.

HEADLINE: Oregon's Governor Favors Breaching 4 Major Dams

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Lending political momentum to an idea that would have been unthinkable in a different era of Pacific Northwest history, Gov. John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon announced today that he favored breaching four large federal dams on the Snake River in Washington State in an effort to restore endangered salmon populations.
Mr. Kitzhaber, a Democrat, became the first major political figure to endorse the controversial dam-removal proposal, which is passionately favored by many environmental groups, American Indians and commercial fishers, but opposed with equal fervor by farmers and many others in the interior Northwest who now rely on the tamed Snake River for barge shipping and electricity. 
 The debate will almost surely wind up in Congress, sometime after the Army Corps of Engineers, which operates the dams, issues its own opinion on the proposal next year.
Just how much influence Governor Kitzhaber's stand will have remains to be seen, but it is nonetheless an intriguing reflection of change in man's relationship with the rivers of the Northwest, where some hydroelectric dams generate enormous amounts of power but have also proven lethal on a major scale to the region's fabled salmon runs.
"In the end, the answer will be a political one -- informed by good science -- but based on a set of values and on the degree of economic and ecological risks the region is willing to accept," Governor Kitzhaber said in a speech to the American Fisheries Society in Eugene, Ore. "It is time that we shoulder our responsibilities and develop a blueprint for action."
Construction of Northwest dams was an undeniably epic engineering achievement, celebrated in Woody Guthrie's songs more than a half-century ago. But for the last several decades, the Corps of Engineers has been laboring under federal requirements to help dams and the salmon coexist on the Snake but has met little success.
Despite spending more than $3 billion on projects like fish ladders, hatcheries and even a truck-and-barging system that a Corps brochure describes as "custom-made to make the trip as safe and comfortable as possible" for the fish, the salmon populations have declined.
The Snake's coho salmon have already been declared extinct, and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is now listed under the Endangered Species Act. In the early 1800's, when the explorer William Clark discovered a river crowded with salmon, about 2 million adult salmon a year completed the trip back to their spawning grounds, biologists estimate.
Ed Bowles, Idaho's manager of anadromous fish, those that hatch in fresh water and migrate to the sea, said today that 3,276 Snake River adult spring and summer chinook returned last year, down from 8,426 in 1998. Fall chinook returns were estimated to be about 400, slightly up from 306 in 1998.
Under the dam-breaching proposal now being considered by the Corps, earthen portions around the dams would be removed, rendering the dams themselves inoperative and restoring 140 miles of the Snake River in eastern Washington to a wild, free-flowing condition. Many scientists and biologists have endorsed dam breaching as the step that would have the greatest odds of saving the salmon from extinction.
The dams -- Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite -- would be the biggest federal dams ever slated for removal. But there is no guarantee that the plan would work, and it would take out of service dams that provide about 4 percent of the Pacific Northwest's electricity. (Unlike other dams in the region, the Snake dams are not used for flood control.)
The dams were also constructed to turn Lewiston, Idaho, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and nearly 500 miles from the Pacific Ocean, into the West's most inland seaport. But virtually all barge traffic to and from Lewiston would stop if the dams were breached.
Lawmakers in eastern Washington have opposed any breaching. Republican lawmakers throughout the region have been generally united against the idea. Senator Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican who is running for re-election this year, said taking down the dams would be "an unmitigated disaster and an economic nightmare" for the region.
Many Democrats have been noncommittal, but in his speech today, Governor Kitzhaber said that the region was required to try to save the fish under the Federal Endangered Species Act, and he warned that if dam-breaching were not tried, other alternatives might be even more expensive and disruptive.
"All I am saying to you today is that we have to stop deluding ourselves into believing that our choices will be easier and cheaper if we just leave the dams alone," he said. "Our choices won't be easier. They'll be just as tough."
Mr. Kitzhaber, who was elected in 1994 and re-elected in 1998, also criticized, by implication, a range of state and federal officials who have called for more study of the issue.
"Some will say that we have not done enough science," Mr. Kitzhaber said. "I say that we can always play that card as an excuse for inaction and as a justification for avoiding tough choices. But exactly what additional scientific experiment is necessary to demonstrate that it is easier for salmon to migrate in a free-flowing river than to negotiate a several-hundred-foot-high concrete barrier?"
Environmentalists praised Mr. Kitzhaber. "The governor is providing what the Snake River salmon need most right now, and that is political leadership," said Rob Masonis, regional director of dam programs for American Rivers, a group that favors dam removal on many of the nation's rivers.

HEADLINE: After Pushing Oil Prices Up, Mexico Has Second Thoughts

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: VERACRUZ, Mexico, Feb. 18

 BODY:
For two years, Mexico has worked with other oil-producing nations to lift prices, and their efforts have borne fruit. But in an about-face, senior Mexican officials are now trying to talk prices down.
The problem is that lofty oil prices conflict with Mexico's new economy, propelled by exports of cars, televisions and other manufactured goods. 
 "Mexico is now so integrated into the U.S. economy that it's no longer in Mexico's interest to rock the boat on oil prices," said Eduardo Lopez, a Mexican who is an analyst at the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a consulting firm in Washington.
The turnabout has put President Ernesto Zedillo's government in a ticklish predicament. Leaders of the industrial world are glaring at Mexico, complaining that petroleum prices are aggravating inflation. But the Mexican left is accusing the government of relinquishing a bonanza and giving in to the imperialists.
That is the incendiary context for Energy Secretary Bill Richardson's visit to Mexico on Saturday.
The Clinton administration has promised to take a variety of actions to alleviate a big increase in heating oil prices in the Northeast. Mr. Richardson will discuss the higher oil prices with the man who helped shape the trend, Energy Secretary Luis Tellez.
At an oil industry convention today in Veracruz, on the gulf coast, Mr. Tellez said he hoped that oil prices, now above $30 a barrel, would soon drop below $25. And he paused to dwell on the new reality: that manufacturing is a star performer and oil a bit player in his country.
"Mexico is mainly an industrial producer and a provider of services," Mr. Tellez said at a news conference. "We're not a petroleum country anymore."
The oil equation for Mexico used to be simple: the higher the world price the better. Oil production contributed nearly 6 percent to Mexico's total economic output in 1983, but during 15 years of economic modernization, including the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, oil's contribution has withered to just 1.7 percent.
So although high world petroleum prices mean that Mexico will receive billions of dollars in unexpected revenues this year, they also threaten to worsen inflation, drive up interest rates and slow world growth.
If that happens, economists say, Mexico's losses from forfeited exports will far outweigh the short-term profits from $30-a-barrel oil.
"That's what many Mexicans don't understand," Mr. Lopez said. "People are still thinking in terms of national sovereignty and national interest. And those concepts are out of touch with the changes that have taken place."
Oil remains a potent patriotic icon because a high point for Mexican nationalists came in 1938, when President Lazaro Cardenas expropriated the country's petroleum industry. The identification of oil with popular well-being was strengthened in the 1970's, when high prices and discoveries of huge petroleum reserves led President Jose Lopez Portillo to predict an end to poverty. Mexico's new challenge, he said, was to "administer abundance."
If oil revenues have never eradicated poverty, they still finance the government: 33 percent of the government's operating funds come from oil taxes. And when the Asian economic crisis in 1997 cut world demand for energy, prices for Mexico's extra-heavy oil plunged to below $7 a barrel, causing a crisis here.
When price levels are so depressed, "We as producing countries have every right to defend our national interests, and that's what we did," Mr. Tellez said in an interview today.
In those circumstances, Mr. Tellez established secret contacts with the Venezuelan and Saudi Arabian oil ministers, initiating talks that eventually included the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Norway. The countries announced an agreement in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in March 1998 to raise prices by slowing production.
Early last year, prices began to rise sharply, but only since December have dangers become apparent. In recent days the Federal Reserve and central banks in Europe and Japan have warned that petroleum prices may contribute to inflation, and Mr. Tellez, along with the Saudi and Venezuelan energy ministers, have done their policy pirouettes.
"These prices are too high," Mr. Tellez said today. He said a consensus had formed among the ministers who had forged the Riyadh agreement that production should now rise, allowing prices to pull back.
But how soon? The ministers are to meet on March 2, but the commitments to cut production are to continue through March 31. Might the ministers decide on March 2 to short-circuit the Riyadh agreement and boost oil output immediately?
"Whatever I say would be very delicate," Mr. Tellez said. "But let me put it this way: we need flexibility."
Mexico's role in influencing world oil prices is surprising, given its trade partnership with the United States, its repeated previous refusal to take part in OPEC and President Zedillo's outspoken advocacy of free markets.
"Mexico's economic policies had been been well known," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economic consultant based in Mexico City. "Mexico stood for free trade and had spoken out against price volatility.
"Now the government has helped restrict the market to raise oil prices, and suddenly officials are getting messages from Washington: 'Hey! You're hurting us. You're fueling inflation. You're playing with fire!' And they're trying to back out of this with the least embarrassment possible." But the discomfort already appears intense.
"It seems absurd, idiotic and contrary to our national interest that there could be more revenues and the government says they don't want them," Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate heading a leftist coalition, told 10,000 supporters at a rally in Monterrey on Thursday.
"If there was nothing to spend the money on," he said, "I could think that increasing the oil exports could be logical. But I've never seen anybody whose product is selling at a high price say, 'I want you to pay me less.' "
Mr. Cardenas is the son of the former president.
"The man in the street thinks Cardenas is right, that we need that money to build schools and pave streets," said Jorge Montano, a former ambassador to Washington.
"They don't understand," Mr. Montano said, "that weeks from now, if these high prices continue, the interest rates will rise, our stock market will fall and we'll all sink."
Political cartoons have lampooned Mr. Tellez as a puppet manipulated by the United States. "Richardson Comes to Pressure Us Over High Crude Prices!" said a headline in the leftist daily La Jornada.
But if Mr. Richardson intends to urge higher production to ease prices, he will be preaching to the converted.
"We're going to tell Mr. Richardson that we'll take measures that are good for Mexico, not only for the oil sector, but also for the growth of the rest of our economy," Mr. Tellez said.
Mr. Tellez is hoping that Mr. Richardson will help him convince 100 million Mexicans of the wisdom of forgoing short-term profits for the greater economic good.
"It's important that the Mexican public understand that there is a real possibility that world economic growth will slow," Mr. Tellez said. "I hope Mr. Richardson will say this loud and clear."

Head of W.T.O. Expects China to Gain Entry in 2000
The head of the World Trade Organization, Mike Moore, said he was optimistic that China could be admitted to the group this year.
Mr. Moore, speaking at a news conference in Beijing, also made clear that China must enter the trade organization before Taiwan does. China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, has warned that any efforts to secure Taiwan's earlier entry would cause a serious confrontation. Page A4. 

Bass Considers Selling Beer Unit
Bass, faced with a falling stock price and dwindling British beer sales, said it was considering "all the options" for its brewing business, Britain's second largest, raising the prospect that it will be sold as the company concentrates on its hotel and leisure chains. Possible buyers include Heineken and South African Breweries. C2.
 
1999 Trade Deficit Set a Record
The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services narrowed in December, as rebounding economies abroad kindled record demand for American goods. Still, the trade gap for 1999 was its widest ever. C14.
 
Gore Backtracks on Trade Issue
Just a day after reassuring union leaders that he would negotiate a tougher trade deal with China if elected president, Vice President Al Gore was forced to write a letter reiterating his support for the trade pact President Clinton is trying to push through Congress. A1.
 
Loss Increases at Global Crossing
Global Crossing said its fourth-quarter loss more than tripled because of costs to expand its undersea fiber optic networks and absorb recent acquisitions. Sales to consumers fell, but sales of communications services to other carriers and large corporations rose. Web-related sales soared 196 percent. Shares of Global Crossing fell $8.6875, to $52.375. C3.
 
Mexico's Too Successful Oil Policy
For two years, Mexico has worked with other oil nations to increase petroleum prices. After a successful campaign, senior officials have done an about-face and are trying to talk the world price down. This has put President Ernesto Zedillo's government in a delicate position: Leaders of the industrial world are complaining that petroleum prices are aggravating inflation, while the Mexican left is accusing the government of giving up an oil bonanza by yielding to the imperialists.

Swiss Bank Replaces Executive
UBS of Switzerland replaced the head of its private banking business and announced a reorganization to stem the loss of wealthy clients. The move highlighted the extent to which rivals in Europe and the United States have been able to chip away at one of Switzerland's most valuable franchises: the discreet care of the world's richest people.

Profit Declines 38 Percent at Saab
Saab, the Swedish military company with products ranging from warplanes to radar systems, said its fourth-quarter profit fell 38 percent on reorganization costs and costs for preparing a fighter for export. C2.
 
Brazil Keeps Interest Rates High
Brazil's central bank left interest rates unchanged at 19 percent for the fifth time since September, angering many Brazilians who are growing impatient with the austere monetary policy. Under the guidance of the bank's president, Arminio Fraga, the bank has managed to restore confidence in Brazil's currency, which was devalued a year ago. But the bank's efforts to contain inflation, using rates that are among the highest in the world, are increasingly viewed as radical medicine for an economy that has stagnated for two years. C2.

HEADLINE: South Carolina's Showdown

 BODY:
Rarely in recent presidential elections has there been a more pivotal vote than the one in the South Carolina primary today. The entire Republican presidential selection process seems balanced on a knife's edge, with a possibility of either Gov. George W. Bush or Senator John McCain emerging as the overwhelming favorite to win the nomination. The verdict in South Carolina could also shape the party, its demographic composition and perhaps even its philosophy for a long time. Yet the outcome on the eve of the election is entirely unpredictable.
Until his disastrous defeat in New Hampshire two and a half weeks ago, Mr. Bush was the prohibitive favorite to win in South Carolina. But Mr. McCain's Granite State triumph fired up his campaign, and for a time he surged ahead of the Texas governor in South Carolina opinion polls. Now the polls are extremely close, with some showing Mr. Bush ahead again. At the least, the governor's barrage of negative attacks appears to have stopped the stampede to Mr. McCain. A sweeping Bush victory might revive his status as front-runner. A big victory for Mr. McCain might well make him unstoppable, as he said this week. But a squeaker might redouble both men's efforts in other states where Mr. McCain has been moving upward with his brand of maverick and moderate politics. 
 As many analysts have noted, the uncertain factor in South Carolina this year is turnout. Mr. McCain has stirred support among independents and Democrats who say they plan to vote in the Republican contest, many for the first time. If their participation swells the turnout above normal levels, it could put the Arizona senator over the top even though he is well behind among Republicans alone. The contest has thus evolved into a curious clash of two visions for the party. Mr. McCain's encompasses the old Reagan-era coalition, which brought in people not normally Republican in the past. Mr. Bush's vision is more exclusively focused on the party's traditional base.
Lately Mr. Bush has also begun to complain about Democrats voting in the Republican primary, as state rules allow, presumably to choose a weak nominee for the fall. That interpretation is probably a misreading of a phenomenon that could bring new voters into the G.O.P. fold. It is also an ironic switch for the Texas governor, who started out last year by presenting himself as the one who could broaden the party to include minorities and others.
Although South Carolina is not especially representative of the ethnic and ideological mix in the rest of the country, its primary election offers a fascinating snapshot of what could become larger trends this year. Like voters in much of the country, South Carolinians have become more prosperous, high-tech-oriented and moderate in their political and economic views. Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush have had to move beyond tax cuts to emphasize education and retirement benefits, a rising theme among suburban voters in the post-segregation South and in other parts of the United States. In Washington, Congressional Republicans are taking note of the trends and moderating their own positions, to the point of promising to spend more money on education than President Clinton proposed in his State of the Union Message.
The political forces ebbing and flowing in South Carolina are making the Republican race unsettled and exciting. Even for Democrats and others who do not agree with much of what either Mr. McCain or Mr. Bush say, this is a healthy contest of ideas that is likely to clarify the choice that voters will be making in November.

HEADLINE: GORE BACK IN STEP WITH WHITE HOUSE OVER CHINA TRADE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18

 BODY:
Just a day after reassuring union leaders that he would negotiate a tougher trade deal with China if elected president, Vice President Al Gore felt obliged to write a letter today to reiterate his support for the trade agreement that President Clinton is trying to push through Congress.
The letter, to a leading business lobby, underscored the difficult position Mr. Gore finds himself in as he tries to mollify two groups he desperately needs in the election, business executives who have pressed for the accord and union members who want to defeat it. 
 In trying to court both, Mr. Gore has in the last few days led each side to believe that it has his support in one of the nation's most contentious debates over a trade agreement.
Mr. Gore's letter was sent after White House officials had been left fuming by his appearance before the A.F.L.-C.I.O. on Thursday in New Orleans. Although Mr. Gore told the union officials that he supported the China deal, the labor leaders said he had also affirmed that, if elected, he would negotiate tougher accords that include guarantees that countries like China would respect labor rights and environmental standards.
The Gore campaign played down any apparent conflict in Mr. Gore's positions, but it was clear that his statements had unsettled the White House, which was eager for him to clarify his position. But campaign officials did not elaborate on any political considerations behind the letter.
As Mr. Gore's comments in New Orleans circulated here on Thursday, some administration officials who are working to win passage of one of the biggest trade deals in history expressed fears that his implicit criticism of the shortcomings could give ammunition to those looking to sink the pact.
"It wasn't exactly deft," an economic adviser to Mr. Clinton said today. "There was a clear argument to make about the national security importance of this agreement, and he failed to make it."
A Democratic leader who has spoken to Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton said: "He's in an agonizing spot. He can't afford to alienate the unions, and they've made this deal public enemy No. 1. And he can't break with the President. So he's all over the place."
Even in the letter to the National Association of Manufacturers, he tried to walk a fine line. "As I have said publicly and privately," he wrote, "I support the agreement reached by our administration on the terms under which China will be permitted to accede to the World Trade Organization."
But in an effort to keep union supporters from bolting, he added: "I agree with President Clinton that future trade negotiations ought to include in the fabric of the agreement both labor and environmental components."
"In the future," he added, "I will also insist on the authority to enforce workers' rights and environmental protections in those agreements."
A spokesman for the business group, Michael E. Baroody, said: "Gore's comments made a tough job even tougher. We were worried that people who were looking for a plausible way out or even to delay the vote could draw some aide and comfort from Mr. Gore's comments. The letter removes that worry."
It remains to be seen how actively the vice president will push the accord, because he cannot afford to alienate organized labor. But the manufacturers lobby was thrilled that the letter put him on the record as clearly supporting the Clinton agreement.
Although Mr. Gore insists that he would revisit China's adherence to labor and environmental standards, as a practical matter he will have little leverage. After China is a member of the W.T.O., Washington will have lost its main negotiating leverage over Beijing, entry to the organization of trading nations.
And after China is a member, it will join the other developing nations that argue that "labor rights" and "environmental standards" are simply code words for a Western conspiracy to force them to pay higher wages and spend billions of dollars on environmental measures.
Arguments about whether the W.T.O. should even examine the links among labor standards, environment and trade sped the collapse of the trade talks in Seattle in December. Administration officials now concede that that meeting was among their biggest blunders of Mr. Clinton's second term. Mr. Gore, sensing the clash, carefully skipped the event.
But the A.F.L.-C.I.O., among other groups, was greatly emboldened by the Seattle demonstrations, where the protests led by union members "shifted the debate about globalization," John J. Sweeney, the president of the union federation, said this week in New Orleans. "Coming off of Seattle, we are at a historic turning point."
Sinking the China deal is clearly the next objective, he said.
Tonight, Mr. Sweeney, who received a copy of the letter, disagreed with those who believe that Mr. Gore had said anything to the unions that undercut Mr. Clinton or the trade agreement.
"The vice president has been consistent," Mr. Sweeney said. "His letter reiterates the position he took at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Los Angeles in October. When the vice president addressed the Executive Council on Thursday, he took pains to tell the council that he supported the president on the deal with China."
In October, even before the China deal had been signed, Mr. Gore had called for enforceable labor protections in trade agreements.
Union leaders are focusing on members of Congress in pivotal districts, an effort that makes many Democrats wary of signing up with the White House. And for the first time, the unions are trying to create alliances of convenience with conservative Republicans who oppose the China deal on the grounds of national security.
The unions are clearly overjoyed by Mr. Gore's vacillation. No one expected him to break publicly from the White House, and in fact he has repeatedly said he favors China's admission to the W.T.O. But his willingness to talk about the need for a tougher deal sends a signal that this one is flawed.
The White House disagrees. "This is an agreement that helps American workers here and that ultimately lifts the standards of workers in China over time," Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said in a recent interview. By gradually enveloping China in a system largely run by Western standards, Mr. Berger argued, China will see the benefits of changing its ways. In any case, he added, "this agreement can't be renegotiated."
Clearly the unions hope that it can be. The president of the United Steel Workers, George Becker, who has been pressing Mr. Gore for two years to stop low-cost steel imports, said this week his union would do its best to sink the efforts to win approval of the trade deal. Then, he said, "We're going to give the Gore administration an opportunity to deal with it."

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Here I sit overlooking the Presidio in San Francisco, one of the most extraordinary urban spaces in the world, reading "Death of a Garden" (editorial, Feb. 17), which condemns Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's recent order to demolish Esperanza Garden on Manhattan's Lower East Side. You are right: green spaces make cities livable, and housing and open space should not be seen as competitive. 
 Enhanced public spaces increase the economic stability and property values of a neighborhood. Just look at Bryant Park in Manhattan, Metrotech and Prospect Park in Brooklyn, and Juniper Valley Park in Queens. The property owners adjacent to the now-destroyed Esperanza Garden should be as distraught as the park users.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
In Carlstadt, Industrial Space for Cyberspace

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
IN an area around Central Boulevard in Carlstadt dotted with low-slung warehouses and manufacturing complexes the steel skeleton rising on a 12-acre site at the far western end of the thoroughfare is an anomaly. For it has more to do with cyberspace than industrial space.
Comdisco, the company that will occupy the site, will use the new building to house its clients' duplicate files to provide continuity services, formerly called disaster recovery services. If a client's computer files are wiped out or if the client's business results in an overload at its office the client can transmit data without interruption from the Carlstadt building. 
 The 302,000-square-foot building will be the Northeast technology services center for the international technology management company, based in Rosemont, Ill. Comdisco provides data services to businesses that range from banks and stock brokerages to dot-com companies and manufacturers.
The new structure will use raised floors to run the tangle of wires required by the high-tech equipment that will fill much of the space.It will also have enhanced heating and air-conditioning systems and a substation for additional electrical power -- as well as an independent power source with six diesel-fueled generators -- to keep the machines humming.
The Russo Development Company of Hackensack, which owns the development site within its 44-acre industrial park, is constructing the shell of the building and will lease it to Comdisco for 15 years with two five-year renewal options. Comdisco will pay to improve the interior space. No one involved with the project would disclose the overall cost but commercial brokers estimate it to be between $42 million and $63 million.
Brokers say the project is indicative of the appetite for industrial space -- and to a lesser degree office space -- by companies like Comdisco that are involved in servicing the technological and telecommunication needs of today's businesses.
A booming economy and the growth in technology-based companies have all combined "to bring more cerebral white-collar users into the industrial setting," said Jonathan S. Meisel, associate director at in the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the international commercial brokerage.
This is "only the beginning" of the activity, which "will grow exponentially as the use of the Internet grows," he said.
According to state figures, the number of high-tech related jobs in New Jersey, including telecommunications and computer software development and services, have grown by 25 percent from 1994 to 1999. As a result the number of such jobs grew by a total of 59,000 to 295,000 as of last year.
AMONG the companies that are taking or are expected to take industrial or commercial space are those that will provide Internet data centers, also called "server farms." Such centers manage Internet sites for businesses.
One such company, brokers said, is Exodus Communications, based in Santa Clara, Calif., which set up such a center in about 230,000 square feet at 300 Boulevard East in Weehawken. The 311,000-square-foot building, once used by the Metropolitan Opera for storage, is near the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.
Other uses, they said, are so-called "telecommunications hotels," which are outfitted with the requisite equipment and electrical power for telecom companies to set up operations, including switching stations. One such "hotel" has taken shape on the upper floors of the former 1.2-million-square-foot Macy's department store building at 165 Halsey Street in downtown Newark. Tenants such as Level 3 Communication, and MCI/Worldwide have leased a significant amount of space in the building over the last 18 months, according to Cushman & Wakefield's year-end 1999 market report.
Now a group of Manhattan developers want to set up other telecom hotels in the state. The group -- comprising Young Woo, a principal of Young Woo & Associates, and a venture of Angelo Gordon & Company and Belvedere Capital -- has closed on a 240,000-square-foot warehouse off Exit 12 of the New Jersey Turnpike in Carteret. It also has signed a contract to buy a nearly 900,000-square-foot warehouse on Jersey Avenue in Jersey City, said Mr. Meisel, who with James Quinn, a senior director at the brokerage, is representing the group in the transactions.
Such users, in turn, are helping "to fuel the state's industrial real estate market by reducing the supply of properties and making a tight market even tighter," and Paul E. Giannone, a principal at Jacobson, Goldfarb & Tanzman Company, L.L.C, a Woodbridge brokerage which represented Comdisco in the Carlstadt project.
For instance, in the Meadowlands region where Comdisco's center is situated, his firm put the industrial vacancy rate at 6.37 percent at the end of 1999, down from 7.8 percent the year before. Over the same period, average asking annual rents rose to $5.50 a square foot, from $4.75; the rental rate for new buildings is $6.50 to $7.50 a square foot.
Mr. Giannone added that while such users conduct different businesses they are drawn to the high ceilings and raised floors that industrial properties provide, in order to accommodate "the high-powered guts in a building" needed to support their operations, which run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, he said, they also need to be situated near a high-speed fiber-optic network.
THOSE factors were involved in Comdisco's decision to go forward with the build-to-suit project in Carlstadt, Mr. Giannone said. The company, he said, surveyed 25 properties, some as far west as Parsippany, but "none had everything the company needed."
Patricia M. Knoll, director of global real estate for Comdisco, said the Carlstadt site was chosen because it had all its approvals in place, was suitable for the size of structure the company wanted to build and its location. It is within a few miles of four of Comdisco's existing operations elsewhere in the Meadowlands, close to its client base in Manhattan and the rest of the New York metropolitan area and accessible to a fiber-optic network, she said.
Comdisco will consolidate operations that are now in the four nearby structures, together totaling just under 200,000 square feet, into the new building and still have 100,000 square feet left "to grow in the future," said Steven Harris, Comdisco's director of project planning.
With the growth in dot-com and e-commerce companies, which "are looking to back up their data, we have a new market segment," Mr. Harris said. The building, which 65 employees from the other locations will move to in phases from next December through July 2001, will be the largest of the 32 centers Comdisco operates in North America.
Mr. Harris said the centers his company operates have in the last three years moved away from the "old model" of such buildings being used only in the event of a disaster.
The new model, he said, is that businesses will also use the center to test their data systems or as a back-up data site.
Since computers are now a common workplace business tool the centers "also have evolved to be more people friendly," places and no longer have that bunker-like look of the past, Mr. Harris said.
As now envisioned the outside of the Carlstadt center will be faced in brick on three sides and have large windows to allow natural light inside. Also planned is a nearly 42,000-square-foot mezzanine at the front of the building. "We want it to look like an office building not like a concrete box," said Ms. Knoll.
Inside, along with the data center, the building will be divided into rooms for testing systems or conducting business, including a work and trading floor area with 1,000 seats and personal computers. There will also be conference rooms, lounges, T.V. rooms and canteens, Mr. Harris said. He added that his building would be "completely up and running" by July 2001.

HEADLINE: Warm Welcome in the Jungle

BYLINE: By CONNIE ROGERS; CONNIE ROGERS is a book editor in New York who is studying primatology.

 BODY:
SURINAME'S rain forest, one of the least traveled places in the world, spread out beneath my airplane like a great green sea with island mountain ranges and gray granite outcrops rising like surfacing whales. Water glinted through the trees. Few people had been here, and the immensity of it was exhilarating and daunting.
While rain forests all over the world are imperiled, Suriname's has been protected until recently by its remoteness and inaccessibility -- and the country's low profile. Tucked between Guyana and French Guiana on the northeast coast of South America, it's known as the Alternative Caribbean by those who don't venture beyond the coast. 
 But that's like judging Brooklyn from the bridge. Four-fifths of the country, an area about the size of New England, is roadless, pristine jungle with much of the biodiversity of the Amazon. The people who live here are as interesting as their natural setting, but their cultures are threatened as they become part of the 21st century.
In late August, Russ Mittermeier, a friend who is president of Conservation International, a Washington-based organization concerned with preserving biodiversity, was headed on a weeklong trip to visit some of its field programs. He knew of my interest in the area and said that if I could sleep in a hammock, I was welcome to come along. Since tourism is in its infancy in Suriname and tours are rare, I quickly accepted.
We arrived in Paramaribo, the coastal capital, at night and I was surprised by the dim outlines of Hindu temples that lined the road into town. Suriname's population of 412,000 is an odd mix of Hindus, Africans, Javanese, Chinese and Europeans whose ancestors arrived over the last 300 years to work in a plantation economy under the Dutch. More than 90 percent of the people, who gained full independence in 1975, live in in or near the capital. Our driver boasted that they prided themselves on getting along. He detoured to show us a mosque and a synagogue standing side by side and said that they shared a security guard.
We flew the next day to Asindohopo, a village 135 miles south in the interior. Its African founders had fled slavery on the Dutch sugar, coffee and timber plantations in the 17th century. They learned how to survive in the forest from the Indians and fought pursuers until they won their freedom in 1762.
Living in relative isolation, slaves who escaped from the same plantation became families, which grouped themselves into tribes like the Saramaccans we were visiting. Now numbering 50,000, the slaves' descendants have knitted customs from different homelands into a Pan-African culture.
It takes at least a day to get to Asindohopo by land from Paramaribo, but I arrived in an hour. From the air, the settlements look like barnacles fastened to the rivers. In two and a half centuries, they've barely made a dent in the forest. We landed on a loosely defined grass airstrip near town and came to rest halfway up a hill, narrowly missing a woman harvesting peanuts. Two men and an eager troop of youngsters greeted us and took us by boat to our lodging on an island in the Pikin River. The island stretched the length of a city block, with a cluster of tree-shaded, one-room wooden bungalows, which mirrored the village on the opposite bank.
With only the briefest pause to tidy up, we went to meet the Granman, or paramount chief, an essential courtesy in the jungle, where the chief would be responsible for a search party if we didn't arrive when expected. The chief sat in a palm thatch meeting house framed by photos of an African statue, Dutch royalty and the Surinamese president, Jules Albert Wijdenbosch.
As lengthy introductions were routed through his headmen and circled the room in a language I couldn't understand, my attention wandered to the nine bats hanging upside down in the palm thatch eves. It was hot in the hut and I was sleepy but the longer the ritual went on, the more securely I felt bound into the community.
That's a comfortable feeling in the middle of a wilderness. The river serves as the only road here and is the center of village life. Within hours, I was floating in its blissfully cool current trying not to think about the stingrays, electric eels and piranhas that were sharing the water. We retreated to our island in the evening, and I faded into sleep listening to African drums in the village.
The next morning, I woke to the sound of someone sweeping leaves on the ground outside my bungalow. A few yards away, the river was in full voice, with women washing pots and doing laundry on the rocks and children bathing on steps carved out of the riverbank. Outboard motors roared.
Within the hour we were in our own boat, heading upstream to explore the Gran Rio, which meets the Pikin at Asindohopo to form the Suriname River. Seven of us, including our crew, were packed into a pencil-thin 30-foot canoe. Petrus, our navigator, sat in the bow signaling directions to Sami, who was steering in the stern and couldn't see around us or hear above the aged Evinrude. We rocked alarmingly as we threaded through the rocks, and I wasn't encouraged to see the river pulsing though a hole in the side of the boat. A boy at Sami's feet bailed with a gourd.
Very shortly, we came up to some magnificent falls and rock-strewn rapids with swaying pink flowers growing out of the water. This was the tamest of a gantlet of rapids that are typical of Suriname's rivers and guard the interior as effectively as castle ramparts. Sami asked us to carry our things around them and we watched as the three of them motored and muscled the sliver of boat through the current.
In the peaceful interludes, the jungle closes in on the river. Yellow orchids and purple flowering lianas mix with the trees in hanging tapestries. Chattering squirrel monkeys jostled them from behind like a troupe of children eager to perform. White-banded swallows skimmed the water in front of us, passing electric blue butterflies that flashed like river beacons.
A hammering noise announced the village of Cayana. We landed and slid up the muddy steps. Almost immediately, we ran into the headman, humming to himself as he used an adz to shape a boat out of a tree trunk.
He was hugely amused by our admiration. Art is an integral part of Saramaccan life. Women draw designs on their cassava cakes, embroider capes and sew a kaleidoscope of color patches into the cloth they wear. The men are wood carvers, and when we asked to see some of their work, a flood of decoratively carved peanut boards, paddles, stools and stirrers was unleashed.
I wandered off to look at the individually carved door frames on each hut. The ground in the village was immaculate; it's swept several times a day. In a clearing, I ran into a life-size, cotton-draped ancestor figure with cowry shell eyes standing like a ghostly guardian over this quiet sense of order.
Tradition is dying faster in Kwamalasamutu, an Indian village 25 miles north of the Brazilian border in southwestern Suriname. We flew to this nearly impenetrable corner of the country the next day in a cargo plane. Kwamala, as many refer to it, appeared suddenly, a bald spot in the boundless green canopy where dozens of acres of forest had been cleared. The Tirio Indians normally live in small family groups, but since the 1970's, missionaries bent on efficiency have gathered them in a supervillage of more than 1,000 people.
The airstrip ran downhill, and we came to a halt in the bosom of an eager crowd. They unloaded our duffels, hammocks and food to make room for the macaws, monkeys, reptiles, headdresses and handiwork that they were sending to the capital for sale.
We headed off to our allotted house, which was famous for the tarantulas that were once found nesting in its roof. It was a flimsy looking two-story wood-and-thatch building on stilts. By now our group had grown to 10, and we all raced for a space upstairs, crowding out the breeze and threatening to overload the support poles with our hammocks. I sorely missed my bed, but took comfort in the ear plugs someone lent me.
Nine tribes -- some from Brazil -- live together in this village, though their differences are not immediately apparent. A few years ago, the missionaries gave out T-shirts and shorts from some global wardrobe and everyone was dressed alike. Kamanya, a shaman in a baseball cap, came to our house offering to give us a tour of medicinal plants.
We followed him past a huge conical palm thatched meeting house, where young voices piped out hymns, and past boys shooting arrows at lizards. After walking more than a mile through abandoned fields, we reached some new-growth forest. Because of language problems, I missed the fine points of the botanical tour, though it was clear from Kamanya's pantomime that he could cure most any part of my body -- or poison me, if he chose. He was fastidious about his jeans and polo shirt, and I wondered how much longer his people would care about this botanical treasure house.
By now, I was ready to see uninhabited rain forest, and we flew the next day to Raleigh Falls in the Central Suriname Nature Reserve. Last year, the government expanded this park, making it possibly the largest protected area of rain forest in the world -- four million acres, bigger than New Jersey.
The view out the Cessna window was primeval. Outcrops of the Guayana Shield, a two-billion-year-old geological formation, rise above the rain forest in tabletop mountain ranges where scientists believe unidentified plants and animals are waiting to be discovered. Vertiginous waterfalls pound down their slopes and are swallowed up in the forest. Poised above the treetops at the edge of a cliff sits an eerily eroded land form called the Devil's Egg, seemingly left behind by a giant pterosaur.
We landed on a barely visible grass strip, and as we prepared to carry our gear to a camp three miles away, we heard some strange hooting in the forest. Recognizing a monkey when I hear one, I raced down the muddy path and off into the woods, only to stumble on three researchers, who'd been signaling each other. They were gathered around a mixed troupe of squirrel monkeys and tufted capuchins waking up from an afternoon siesta in a swamp.
A diminutive fur ball with a long loopy tail sprang into a nearby tree. It flashed its white face and gray cap in our direction, and I was captivated. Suddenly, the trees began to dance, and shapes flew around like spitballs in an unsupervised classroom. On the ground, the two kinds of monkeys wrestled together in a ball before disappearing into the jungle.
I rejoined the others to climb the towering, granite Voltzberg -- 750 feet straight up -- in time to see the sunset. The top afforded us a view of rain showers and sun, and mist and clouds competing for domain over different parts of the forest. Immediately below us, spider monkeys called to each other as they fed in the treetops. Flocks of emerald parrots and screeching scarlet macaws flew by.
Then the unearthly roar of a howler monkey rose up from the forest, and I felt as far away -- and yet as much at home -- as I could be.
 
A land of deep jungles and friendly people
Guidebooks to Suriname are hard to come by, but a few good ones are "Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice" by Mark J. Plotkin (Penquin, 1994, $11.95), "Maroon Arts" by Sally Price and Richard Price (Beacon, 1999, $37.50) and "The Guide to Suriname" by Roy Tjin and Els Schellekens (Brasa, 1999), $15 from Sranan Sari, Post Office Box 6545, San Rafael, Calif. 94903 or by e-mail at sranansani@aol.com.
When going to any tropical rain forest, you should consult with a doctor about taking malaria medicine, and that is the case as well in the Suriname interior.
 
Getting There
All flights to Suriname from the United States leave from Miami. Suriname Airways, (800) 327-6864, and Air ALM, (800) 327-7230, fly to Suriname via Curacao every Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday in a code-share arrangement. Round-trip fares, based on a week's stay, start at $655.
A visa is required and costs $45 from the Suriname Consulate, 7235 Northwest 19th Street, Suite A, Miami, Fla. 33126, (305) 593-2697, or the Suriname Embassy, Van Ness Center, Suite 460, 4301 Connecticut Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20008; (202) 244-7488.
The Oceanic Society, Fort Mason Center, Building E, San Francisco, Calif. 94123, (800) 326-7491, fax (415) 474-3395, offers package tours to Suriname. One to the interior is planned for March 2 to 17. Others to the coast are hands-on research trips offering the chance to escort turtle hatchlings to the sea. The cost of a 15-day trip is $2,590, including air fare from Miami and in-country travel and lodging.
There are no roads in 85 percent of Suriname, so independent travel requires flexibility and time. Travel agencies in Paramaribo organize visits to the nature reserves and villages in the interior for roughly $100 a day, including air and boat travel and lodging.
The best-known of these agencies in Paramaribo are the Movement for Ecotourism, known as Mets, Anton Dratenweg 7, (597) 477-088, fax (597) 422-332, www.metsresorts
.com, and the Foundation for Nature Preservation in Suriname, or Stinasu, Cornelis Jongbawstraat 14, (597) 476-597, fax (597) 421-850, www.stinasu.sr. Trips take place when there enough participants, and river excursions depend on water levels.
 
Where to Stay
Kumalu is a well-staffed tourist lodge at Asindohopo that is run by Mets. It has comfortable basic accommodations in six tree-shaded bungalows with small porches. Each house has two beds with mosquito netting. Take a flashlight; the only light is a single kerosene lantern. Showers and toilets are in a spotless separate building. Meals are served in a palm-thatched patio dining room, where we ate good, but nondescript chicken-and-rice dishes with fresh cucumber and fruit. Mets also runs the accommodations at Palumeu and other Indian villages.
Visits to Kwamalasamutu can be arranged through Roderic Mast at Conservation International, 2501 M Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20037; (202) 429-5660, fax (202) 887-5188. Prices vary, but a week's trip would cost at least $6,000 a person to cover charter flights, village visitation fees, and food, lodging and travel in the interior.
Stinasu runs the accommodations at Raleigh Falls, in the Central Suriname Nature Reserve. Near the airstrip is the Foengoe Island Lodge, with two long houses having two or more beds per room.
A house has just been built three miles away at the base of the Voltzberg, where hammocks are needed. There, a Javanese cook made us a delicious dinner of chicken pot pie, cassava puree and Cajun green beans. Again, flashlights are required, toilets are separate and washing is in a nearby stream.

HEADLINE: The Belle of the Soft-Money Soiree

BYLINE: By Jill Abramson; Jill Abramson is the Washington editor of The New York Times.

 BODY:
The gentle ladies on both sides of the political aisle are finding that killer fund-raising is one of the surest ways to be taken seriously in politics. John McCain, who must still raise money while denouncing raising money, has a woman as one of his chief fund-raisers: Georgette Mosbacher, the flame-haired New York businesswoman and socialite who is divorced from Robert Mosbacher, the Texas oilman and financial maestro of Bush p<heart>re's campaigns. While McCain brags about his small Internet donations, Georgette Mosbacher is gathering a windfall of $1,000 checks. Bill Bradley's financial Rolodex was built by Betty Sapoch, a New Jersey grandmother. Her fund-raising team surprised everyone last year by keeping pace with Al Gore's money machine. Beth Dozoretz, a top Clinton-Gore fund-raiser, became the Democratic Party's first female finance chairman early in 1999, though she left the job 10 months later after a reshuffling of the Democratic National Committee's leadership.
Men have traditionally dominated fund-raising because they have traditionally dominated everything, but Bob Strauss, the former Democratic Party chairman and a legendary fund-raiser, says women are probably better at it than men, because they are better at making people comfortable -- comfortable with signing very large checks. "It takes a lot of care and feeding," he says. 
 Julie Finley would disagree with Strauss about a lot of things, but not about that. Finley is the co-chairman and top fund-raiser for Team 100, the elite club of $100,000-plus donors for the Republican Party. She is, you might say, the queen of soft money -- soft money being the large and unrestricted contributions that flow from the rich and powerful to the political parties, to be used for things like voter-registration drives and party advertising, much of this being barely disguised television spots for candidates. Even as Senator McCain is trying to break his party and the system of its dependence on soft dollars, Republicans are counting on Finley to help build a record war chest -- tens of millions of dollars -- to help the party maintain control of the House and Senate and win back the White House.
One Saturday earlier this month, Finley could be found going about her work at the exclusive Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, Fla. Yachts sailed by. Washington players -- Senator Pete Domenici, for instance, who wields enormous influence over taxes, appropriations and most other matters having to do with the federal budget -- strolled around in yellow-and-purple resort duds. Wealthy donors wore silver-and-black Team 100 name tags. And Finley made sure everyone mixed and mingled while she worried about the victory of John McCain -- and, by inference, his brand of campaign finance reform -- in New Hampshire.
With strawberry blond hair and piercing blue eyes, and wearing a demure blue cardigan and pressed white linen slacks, Finley, who is 62, doesn't quite fit the description of what used to be called, in the Nixon era, a bagman. Between delicate bites of her turkey club sandwich at an umbrellaed outdoor table, she dismisses the idea that soft money is "sewer money," as some reformers call it. And she characterizes McCain's talk about Big Money's corrosive influence as "strident." The vast majority of her $100,000 recruits, she says, want nothing more for their money than a Republican back in the White House.
Finley hopes that Republican will be George W. Bush. Although officially neutral until the nominee is selected -- by law, she raises money for the party, not for any particular presidential candidate -- she tells just about anyone who asks, "Privately, I am with Bush." She blames his recent problems on handlers, noting mournfully, "Where is Paul Laxalt when we need him?" Finley's lunch companions this day -- John Payson, an art dealer who has a winter home near Finley's in Hobe Sound, Fla., and Robert Herbold, chief operating officer of Microsoft, and his wife, Patricia -- are Bush loyalists, too.
Until the meltdown in the snows of New Hampshire, Finley was counting on Bush to be a check-magnet. "I see a flood of people giving money," she crowed at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting in San Jose in January. "We just better have enough staff to process all the checks." But in Key Largo, her mood was different. In impromptu remarks to the Team 100 members, she said that should McCain win the nomination, "we're out of business."
McCain has promised to instruct the party not to raise or spend any soft money on his behalf if he is the nominee. His campaign-finance-reform proposal would ban soft money entirely, but his bill has been stalled in the Senate. Meanwhile, the Democrats, led by President Clinton, a tireless fund-raiser, are busy building up their own large bankroll of soft money, all the while paying lip service to McCain's reform efforts.
Finley doesn't see what all the fuss is about. "Why is it dirty?" she asks, her voice smoky with Marlboros and, as Fitzgerald wrote of Daisy, full of money. "Every dollar is reported. It's not like it comes slipping under the door in a bundle."
Julie Finley is sometimes referred to as the Republican Pamela Harriman. Like Harriman, who conjured up millions for the Democratic Party, Finley has raised millions of dollars for the G.O.P. But there are no Churchills or storied Broadway producers in Finley's past. She is the widow of a prominent attorney (though a Democrat) and has lived most of her life within the confines of northwest Washington.
She lives grandly near the National Cathedral in a chintz-filled house with a swimming pool. Her fund-raising hub is a cozy room on the second floor, the yellow walls of which are adorned with English hunting prints. There she sits, using a green telephone and working her way through a pack of Marlboro Lights. Still, there is only so much you can do by phone in her line of work. "When you are asking for money at this level," she says, "they like the individual attention."
That means she must adhere to a road schedule nearly as punishing as that of a presidential candidate. During one stretch last fall, she spent a week traveling from New York to San Francisco to Chicago to Atlanta, the days filled with one-on-one meetings with Team 100 prospects and some lapsed members of the club. Then she returned to Washington to usher, along with her co-chairman Stuart Bernstein, Team 100 members around as part of their annual Washington gathering -- two and a half days of issue briefings, luncheons and cocktail parties with the likes of Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Jim Nicholson, the Republican National Committee chairman.
At one Team 100 cocktail gathering, dressed in an elegant taffeta skirt, she rushed about making sure that everyone was popping cheese canapes and sipping chardonnay. She checked that a big, blue Tiffany box was ready to be presented to the hostess. She chatted with Mel Sembler, the party's finance chairman, who warmly credited Finley with raising $8.5 million in 1999, and then introduced Jim Nicholson. As the party wore down, she raced home to oversee a fund-raising dinner for Senator Bill Frist, a moderate from Tennessee who is up for re-election in the fall.
Finley is herself a moderate, and she would like to see her party show a more compassionate face to the have-nots and to shed the strident, right-wing image that has put off many female voters. This can be lonely work. On a recent wintry night in Washington, Finley could be found mixing with 40 or so Republican supporters who braved the cold to raise money and find recruits for the district's tiny Republican Party, which she has been chairwoman of since 1992. Finley also gathered signatures so that she could represent the local party at this summer's Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
The venue was the living room of Margaret Alexander Parker, a friend of Finley's who is the finance director of the Republican National Committee. Before a roaring fire, Finley greeted the two G.O.P. members of the City Council, Carol Schwartz and David Catania. Schwartz, who is firmly for abortion rights, has run unsuccessfully for mayor. Catania, a rising star, is one of two openly gay members of the council.
It may seem odd that Finley works so hard to raise soft money that in no small measure will be used to try to keep the House under the influence of those who run against homosexuals and abortion rights. But Finley has never been anything but a loyal soldier. Although members of the Christian right helped thwart her campaign to become co-chairman of the Republican National Committee three years ago, branding her a "baby killer," she says, calmly, "I don't regard that wing of the party as the enemy."
According to several of Finley's allies within the party, her defeat for co-chairman at the R.N.C.'s winter meeting in 1997 showed that no matter how loyal a Republican you are, no matter how much money you've raised for the party, the conservative wing of the G.O.P. will not tolerate a pro-choice woman in the leadership ranks. "If you don't pass the abortion litmus test, you don't have a chance," says Tanya Melich, a onetime G.O.P. official and author of "The Republican War Against Women." "Julie, bless her heart, didn't recognize how much importance the Christian right places on control of the Republican National Committee."
Finley went into that meeting three years ago with promises of support from 72 R.N.C. members. Her credentials seemed unassailable. She was a Republican delegate at party conventions in 1992 and 1996, and played an important role on Bob Dole's finance committee. Before the vote, however, some Christian conservatives spread the word that she strongly favored partial-birth abortions. (Finley says she did not and does not.) She needed 82 votes to win, but on the first ballot she received only 58. She wound up losing to Patricia Harrison, a Virginian who had worked with Finley on the Dole campaign.
It was a few weeks after that bruising election that she agreed to take the helm of Team 100. When asked how she feels about the fact that much of the money she is raising will help elect candidates who don't share her views on abortion and other social issues, she politely steers the conversation to different topics. She talks of how she is passionate about many Republican positions, especially the party's economic agenda and its priority of keeping up America's strength in the world. "I am not," she says simply, "a single-issue person. I believe in the Republican Party."
It is nonetheless true that abortion has not faded away as an issue within the Republican Party, as George W. Bush had wished it to. And the G.O.P. abortion wars do make Finley's goal of recruiting more women to become Team 100 members tougher to obtain. Jilian Manus-Salzman, who lives in California and is the president of a literary agency and a Republican, recalls how Finley tried to coax her to become a major G.O.P. donor. Manus-Salzman says she considered giving, but ultimately ruled it out because of the party's anti-abortion stand. "The party does not yet represent what I do," says Manus-Salzman. "We have to let go of the shackles the right wing has us in." Manus-Salzman has contributed to Bush and McCain. If Bush is the nominee, she says, "I want to give him the benefit of the doubt." If either Bush or McCain chooses a running mate who supports abortion rights, Manus-Salzman says, she might reconsider joining Team 100.
But if the Republicans again have a hard-line, anti-abortion platform, Manus-Salzman says she will not give money to the party. "I'm not sure Julie Finley understands my generation of women," says Manus-Salzman, who is in her late 30's. "We don't identify ourselves as Democrats or Republicans first. And if you don't get this generation on the train, the Republican Party has no future."
Women are beginning to write big political checks for both major parties, though their sluggishness on this front is a source of frustration to Finley and to other female fund-raisers. "I can't figure out why women don't get it," says Finley, who is one of only a half-dozen female Team 100 members, a club whose initiation fee is $100,000 the first year, with $25,000 due in each of the three subsequent years. "When they are asked, they say, 'Gosh, $100,000 is a lot of money.' But these are women on yachts in the Mediterranean and buying their clothes at Chanel. If I can figure it out, why can't everyone else?"
Maybe the women have been scared off by the men doing the asking. For decades, raising money was strictly alpha territory: a bitterly competitive, turf-conscious, testosterone-filled game, marked by a "my Rolodex is bigger than yours" attitude. The kings of the hill were Maurice Stans, Nixon's campaign finance chairman, Bob Mosbacher in the Bush era and Terry McAuliffe, the first pal of President Clinton who has raised a staggering and unprecedented $275 million.
"There were not women Terry McAuliffes until recently at the national level," observes Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic political consultant. "Within the next five years you'll see it change."
As someone on the cutting edge of that change, Finley seems to combine equal parts alpha and beta. She trained last summer to become a Formula Three driver, and her Christmas card had a picture of her sunk inside a spiffy blue race car. (She plans to race competitively for the first time next month in Scottsdale, Ariz.) At the same time, she can sound flirtatious softening up fat cats. Think Scarlett O'Hara trying to wheedle the money to pay Tara's taxes out of the jailed Rhett.
"Part of being successful at it is to make it fun and not be so tough and stiff," says Katie Boyd of San Francisco, one of only about a dozen female Pioneers, the top fund-raisers for George W. Bush, who together (there are about 140 of them) have helped raise an astonishing $68.7 million for him. Women are now "using our own networks to raise money," says Bonnie Reiss, a New York lawyer who is raising money for Bradley. "It used to be more of a husband's thing."
Female fund-raisers have different networks too. Nancy Brinker is helping haul in cash for Bush and is well known nationally for raising millions to fight breast cancer. She is trying to recruit more women to be fund-raisers. (She prefers to call them "friend-raisers.")
Still, political fund-raising is a rough, competitive sport that isn't for everyone. Beth Dozoretz says the best training for her job as the top money collector for the Democratic Party was working in the rag trade in New York City. "The garment center was the war zone," she says. "That's where I learned a lot of my survival skills."
Bonnie McElveen-Hunter, a North Carolina publishing executive, headed Elizabeth Dole's finance team until Dole withdrew from the race. The Republican Party has asked McElveen-Hunter to establish a fund-raising arm directed at businesswomen, modeled on the Democratic National Committee's successful Women's Leadership Forum, which has raised millions from Democratic women. If she takes the job, McElveen-Hunter will join a team that is already dominated by women, and led by Parker and Finley.
Even with their growing networks and numbers, "women are often afraid to ask for money," says Georgette Mosbacher. But she isn't. Looking like a million in a beige-on-beige ensemble, right down to her beige mules, Mosbacher makes her round of calls for McCain each day, using a list of names that her portable computer spits out each morning. The author of a financial guide for women called "It Takes Money, Honey," Mosbacher thinks women take rejection too personally. "A man isn't fazed when he hears, 'No,' when he asks for a check," she says. When she's soliciting for McCain, she says, "I don't hear a 'No.' I just talk right through it. If it's really a 'No,' I put a line through the name and move on to the next one. I don't take it personally."
Interestingly, women are diving deeper into the political money game at the very moment that some of its longtime champions are deserting the field. Dozens of corporate executives have recently endorsed the Committee for Economic Development's efforts to ban soft money. The scandals involving Lincoln Bedroom overnights and a Buddhist temple fund-raiser have scared off some prominent Democrats. And McCain, of course, wastes no opportunity to denounce the entire campaign finance system as dirty and corrupting.
Finley would like to see the campaign finance overhauled, too, but not in the way McCain would. "I'm strictly for taking off the limits and reporting everything," she says. "It's simple. You can see who's trying to influence whom and when votes are taken, who's been influenced."
There is a new club that Finley is excited about -- the Republican Regents, which is even more exclusive than Team 100. To get in, donors must contribute $250,000 over two years to the party. She says there are already 44 members, and the goal is to have at least 75 by the end of the year.
She does have one reservation about the pricey Regents Club, however. "I don't like the name," she says. "It sounds too regal."

HEADLINE: The Assault Of the Salonistas

BYLINE: By Helen Thorpe; Helen Thorpe lives in Austin, Tex., and has written for Texas Monthly, George and New York.

 BODY:
When the internet magazine Salon went public last June, nobody got obscenely rich. But the I.P.O. did underwrite a few perks that give the company the appearance of new-economy prosperity. Its swank new office in downtown San Francisco includes a communal kitchen with an impressive stainless-steel fridge and a balcony where the staff gathers for cocktails every Friday night.
On a recent day, at noon, David Talbot, Salon's chairman and editor in chief, emerges from the weekly business meeting, his blue eyes showing signs of bleariness. Driving to work earlier this morning, he heard the news that AOL was merging with Time Warner. The deal sent tremors through the whole Internet establishment, but for Salon, it's the equivalent of a full-blown earthquake. The homespun, seat-of-your-pants era of the Internet -- the era in which Salon rose to prominence and which it, in some sense, grew to symbolize -- is history. Forging strange alliances, old and new media giants seem poised to carve up the Internet for themselves, leaving maybe a few table scraps for independent outfits like Salon. 
 In his 15th-floor office, Talbot is happy to talk business. Specifically, he is intent on dispelling a myth that he fears is depressing the price of his company's stock (which has been languishing around $7 per share, about half of its peak price).
Salon is not, Talbot says seriously, a magazine.
Frankly, that's what it looks like to most people. On its Web site, Salon covers culture, technology and politics; Garrison Keillor writes a quirky advice column, and Camille Paglia fires out antifeminist provocations. At its best, it mixes polished writing and a healthy disregard for the conventions of print journalism. At its worst, the writer Dan Savage tries to infect Gary Bauer with the flu. But we'll get to that later. The point is, if Salon is not a magazine, what is it?
Talbot grabs a red marker and starts drawing a chart on a white board that stands beside his desk. It is a routine that he has probably performed countless times, but he does it with enthusiasm and vigor. He lists the key components of Salon's business, and, conspicuously, Print Content is merely one of five.
The others are as follows: Broadband, under which Talbot writes Salon TV and Salon Radio. Salon now broadcasts programming put together by the Dial, an online radio company, and later this year will introduce an original mix of talk and music. A TV program is set to make its debut in the fall on the Bravo channel.
Next on the list is E-commerce, which is essentially the site's gift shop, where it sells T-shirts, coffee mugs, Salon compilations and -- coming soon -- high-end writing utensils.
Then there's Media Sales, which means the hiring out of Salon's ad sales team to other Web ventures. This arm of the company is a work in progress, too; so far the only client is a ticketing outfit called CultureFinder.com.
And finally, there's Tech Projects: the design of Salon's Web site is highly regarded, and Talbot wants to license this architecture to other Internet companies.
So there it is, the Salon media empire. It still looks an awful lot like a magazine. But it's easy to see what motivates Talbot. As the new brand names of the industry seek to monopolize more and more of the traffic on the Internet, Talbot is fighting to prevent Salon from being marginalized as a virtuous bit player. "What I want Salon to be is a smart tabloid," he says. "I don't want to be publishing a highbrow zine for the literati. To me, the great cultural models are the Beatles, Dylan, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese. These are people who have a very strong creative vision but want a big audience. They didn't just want to stay in art houses."
As it is, Talbot is already at the mercy of forces much greater than himself: last year, he paid $250,000 to be featured on AOL, a deal that provided Salon with its greatest source of readers. Talbot declines to confirm any hard figures, but word in the industry is that when Salon approached AOL about upgrading its placement, the new price for a two-year deal was in the mid-seven figures. Given that AOL is acquiring all those Time Warner magazines, eventually Salon may not be able to rent space on AOL for any price.
Talbot's response to all this is to set Salon on a do-or-die course to get big fast. And despite his elaborate pitch about branching off into new ventures, his greatest project will be transforming the magazine itself. Steadily, he has been devoting more and more resources to flashier news, celebrity coverage and gossip to attract a wider audience. But his nascent empire -- and along with it the whole idea of an independent Internet media company holding its own against the conglomerates -- will amount to very little if he can't strike the right balance between rewarding his loyal readers and pandering to the masses.
The first thing everybody mentions about Talbot is his charisma. There is a Clinton-like aspect to his character -- I like an audience that claps," he says at one point -- and in his presence, it's hard not to be won over by nearly everything he says. He thrives on creative tension, a talent he probably learned from being brought up in a highly polarized household. Talbot's father, a talented Hollywood actor who never made it big, was a Goldwater man and used to drag the children to Nixon rallies. His mother, an ex-showgirl, supported Kennedy, Johnson and the Great Society. (His sister, Margaret, is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine.) In terms of political leanings, David took after his mother -- he grew up into a lefty journalist, collaborated on a book about Americans' sexual habits and eventually went to work as an editor at Mother Jones. But he never did quite fit the mold; one of his articles in the early 1980's suggested that the emerging entrepreneurial culture of Silicon Valley might have socially liberating effects.
In 1986, Talbot was recruited to The San Francisco Examiner by the publisher, William Randolph Hearst III, who wanted him to shake up its arts coverage. He did just that, but to a degree that often created problems. "If you got two or three angry letters, it caused huge ripples," Talbot recalls. "I think the Internet came along at this marvelous time, because the media had become so timid, so politically correct, so dumbed down, so marketing driven." Talbot discovered the Web during a rancorous strike when Scott Rosenberg, then a film critic for The Examiner, helped publish a union paper on the Internet. It required no newsprint, no ink, no pressmen, no trucks and no drivers.
In search of liberation, that eternal California soundtrack, Talbot made the jump to the online world in 1995 -- along with Rosenberg, now Salon's technology columnist and managing editor, and Gary Kamiya, its executive editor -- and eventually he hired away some of The Examiner's most talented writers and editors. Start-up money came from Apple: first $60,000, then another $40,000 -- meager sums by today's standards, but enough to finance a modest weekly Web zine that was primarily about books. The business side evolved slowly. "In those days, you would sit down with somebody, and you weren't sure if you were supposed to pay them or if they were supposed to pay you," remembers David Zweig, Salon's first publisher. "It was like being in outer space. You had no way of getting your bearings."
Over the next two years, John Warnock, the C.E.O. of Adobe Systems, steered $5 million to Salon. The editors took advantage of freedom they never had before. A peculiarly West Coast sensibility reigned. Laura Miller, who worked for a feminist erotica cooperative in San Francisco before joining Salon (and is now the New York bureau chief), says that the staff defined itself in opposition to the "status-obsessed culture" of New York. Talbot lured new readers with coverage of family matters, technology, academia, media and sex. Courtney Weaver's Unzipped column was an early hit: it was sometimes erotic, sometimes just plain dirty. Talbot also provided an outlet for unusually intimate memoirs and stark confessionals. Anne Lamott, writing about everything from parenthood to spirituality, developed into a star attraction. So did James Poniewozik, a media columnist who was eventually hired away by Time magazine. Talbot assembled a fiercely loyal team of editors and writers -- and along with it an equally committed readership. By the time of its I.P.O., Salon was drawing 1.2 million visitors a month.
The glorious naovete of salon's early days could not last, however. Virtual magazines started popping up all over the place, and some had real business plans and ideas about making money. Salon had to get with it. Back in 1996, after Zweig and Talbot split over which commercial alliances to pursue, Talbot brought in Michael O'Donnell, a former salesman of software and computer games. O'Donnell is an evangelist of growth, and he describes Salon's target audience as "upscale mass market," a term that no one would have taken seriously until a few short years ago. "We're not really aiming to be The New Yorker of the Web," O'Donnell says. "The market we're going after is the market that watches 'Seinfeld."'
One of O'Donnell's first moves was to hire an enterprising young man named Alexander Hughes as Salon's circulation manager. Hughes viewed the Internet as "the ultimate Skinner box," by which he meant a highly accurate gauge of human behavior. Borrowing concepts from HotWired, he redesigned Salon's architecture to track the way traffic moved through the site in stunning detail. With Hughes's system, Talbot can tell exactly how many readers visit Salon, and by what means they arrive. He can tell what departments readers go to, which articles they click on and whether they make it to the last page. Most content providers have access to some traffic information, but few know as much about their flow as Salon does. "What we built allows you, on a daily, weekly, monthly or annual basis, to analyze whether you are breaking even on any given piece of content," explains Hughes, who now works at C/Net, a site for high-tech products. "For each story, you can answer the question, Did we pay for this?"
Having access to this information had a huge psychic impact on Salon's writers and editors. Suddenly they were privy to the print equivalent of Nielsen ratings. "At The Examiner, I thought: Aha, I work at a newspaper with a circulation of half a million people! Therefore, half a million people read my stories," Rosenberg says. "Of course, it wasn't true, but we never got our faces shoved in it." Lately, an average of 110,000 people have been visiting Salon per day; perhaps one-fifth of them click on Rosenberg's technology column. Knowing precisely how many people read his column "is a shock at first," he admits. "But once you know the numbers, you can't imagine doing without them."
Salon's editors have learned to be vague when speaking to writers about traffic stats. But everyone understands how the system works -- that if the word "breasts" is used in a cover link, traffic will go off the charts, and that articles about foreign news go virtually unread. The tabloidy stuff almost always scores high. The two articles Salon ran about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in August 1997 attracted record numbers of traffic. Last year, an unremarkable article about the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. was Salon's most widely read item -- it got more than 250,000 hits.
These numbers make Talbot's job easier in obvious respects, but a lot more complicated in others. "It's daunting, because, you know, if Anne Lamott's page views are going down, what do you do?" he says. "I think you don't necessarily pull the plug on someone. Garrison Keillor, for instance, started out slow, and now his column is one of our top page-drivers. Sometimes you have to be patient. Other times, if you see some long trend, it does give you a warning signal. You say, 'Well, does this jibe with your sense that the writer is running out of steam?"'
Talbot got his first real taste of what would happen if he broke news in the midst of the impeachment hearings in 1998, and he was hooked. It started with an unsolicited manuscript, an investigation into a 30-year-old extramarital affair involving Representative Henry Hyde, a Republican. A number of major publications had already seen the manuscript and passed on it, deeming it irresponsible and an invasion of Hyde's privacy. Talbot thought otherwise; he and his staff reinvestigated and rewrote the story, and he put it up on Salon under his own byline. In defense of the article, he maintains that Hyde's hard line on the president's infidelity left the congressman wide open to this type of inquiry. But it is difficult to imagine that Talbot wasn't also swayed by the publicity he knew the article would generate. When it was published, members of the Washington news corps -- including Salon's own Washington bureau chief, who quit in protest -- were outraged by what they considered Talbot's shoddy, meretricious standards. High-minded Salon suddenly seemed to be imitating Matt Drudge -- doing anything for buzz. But as stinging as the criticism was, the episode also brought Salon traffic and name recognition on an unprecedented scale. The obstreperous Web site had interjected itself into the middle of the year's biggest story.
Moving into the news-breaking business separated Salon from its traditional online rivals. The editors of sites like Feed and Word quietly cultivate their own niche audiences in the hope that someday the content business will be profitable. At Slate, the editor, Michael Kinsley, can theoretically afford to do whatever he wants because Microsoft finances his operation, but he has opted not to try to beat news organizations at their own game. Instead, Kinsley says, he tries to exploit the "Webiness" of the Web, with reporting and commentary that's more conversational.
Salon's decision to venture into news and entertainment means going head to head with Goliaths like CNN and ABC on a regular basis, which is not easy to do with an editorial staff of just 56. But Salon has had some impressive moments: last month, a freelancer, Daniel Forbes, broke the story about the collusion between network TV producers and White House policy makers to embed antidrug messages in prime-time shows. Every other media outlet in the country played catch-up, and in a matter of days the practice was halted. It went a long way in establishing Salon as a reputable news organization.
But weeks later that momentum was squandered when Dan Savage, who writes a nationally syndicated sex column, was assigned to write about the Republican presidential hopeful Gary Bauer. Savage describes himself as deeply offended by Bauer's anti-gay rhetoric, and he set out to retaliate. Masquerading as a volunteer for the candidate, he tried (unsuccessfully) to infect Bauer with the flu by licking doorknobs, pens and coffee cups in the campaign office. When Savage's bizarre account was published in Salon, Talbot was hit with a barrage of criticism; he responded in curious fashion, posting this disclaimer on Salon: "We still believe publishing the article was the right choice, but we also feel compelled to say: We didn't assign Savage to infect Bauer. We don't condone or endorse what he says he did." Salon editors, in other words, not only disavowed responsibility for their reporter's conduct, they also wouldn't vouch for the veracity of what he had written.
Toward the end of last year, Salon experienced a surge in traffic. In December, the number of people who visited Salon jumped to 3.4 million, up from 1.9 million in September. Advertising is up sharply, too: total revenues rose to $3 million last quarter, a 193 percent increase over the year before. Plus, the I.P.O. last June brought in $26 million, and just before that O'Donnell raised $15 million from private sources. But money is still going out faster than it is coming in. Salon has only enough cash on hand to survive for a year and a half.
At the moment, Talbot is pouring his time and energy into the TV program for Bravo. To produce it, he has hired Daniel Richler, the stepson of the Canadian novelist Mordechai Richler, who created a program in Canada called "Big Life," a free-form news program that Talbot describes as "60 Minutes' meets Monty Python." Salon's program should be something similarly hybrid. Richler wants to shoot most of it either on location or in the Salon offices. In addition to news segments, cultural reviews and panel discussions, he plans to follow around Salon writers as they report their stories and roll the tape at editorial meetings. Sort of MTV's "Real World" visits an online magazine.
"We believe American TV needs a good kick in the pants," Talbot says.
The program is intended not only to build Salon's brand -- rival Slate is doing its own program for the same purpose -- but also to prepare its print-oriented staff members for a multimedia future when they might produce video for the Web site. Another important consideration is romancing Wall Street. Talbot will have great difficulty keeping his expansion drive going if he can't change Wall Street's dim view of content. "Small Internet media companies that produce magazine-style content will have trouble over the long run, because that isn't what people do online," says Henry Blodget, an analyst at Merrill Lynch who has been credited with sending stocks like Amazon.com into the stratosphere. "What people do online is look for information, communicate by e-mail or in chat rooms and interact with a wide variety of content, such as news, games, shopping, pornography or travel."
Salon, of course, is trying to offer most of these things, but in the eyes of stock watchers, it's still just a magazine. The only analyst who has studied Salon closely at all is Carolyn Trabuco of First Union Securities, a former art history major. She recently issued a highly optimistic report about online content in which she suggested that Salon's stock was worth $15 a share. "I think the idea that content has no value is changing," Trabuco says. "But I'm very early, in terms of getting on this bandwagon."
Worrying about stock prices, poring over traffic numbers, hawking fancy pens online -- is this what liberation is all about? "To me, it's fun," Talbot maintains, sitting forward in his chair, ignoring the bleeps of his Macintosh. "I'm combative by nature, and I want to show the world that we can pull this off, on our own terms."
Meanwhile, takeover rumors circulate. In the past, both Amazon.com and Time Warner have tried to buy Salon; last year, Bravo expressed interest in a bigger piece of the company. So far, Talbot and O'Donnell have rebuffed all offers. This may be because the bids were low: for a while, Salon's market capitalization was stuck at two times revenues (the average for content companies is 15 times revenues), which must have made it hard to get a sweet price. Or perhaps Talbot is stubborn enough to hang on to his creation. "My dream is that I would pass it along to the next generation, and that they would keep it independent," he says. "It would be a shame if Salon were gobbled by a major media company." Yes, it's not too hard to imagine what a bunch of suits would do with that artfully constructed "Skinner box."

HEADLINE: Hip Vs. Stately: The Tao Of Two Museums

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
AS two of the most prominent figures in the New York art world, Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Thomas Krens, the director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, oversee distinct and often opposing museum models. The Manhattan-bound Met, ensconced in Central Park, and the global Guggenheim, with branches in four countries. The encyclopedic Met, whose territory covers five millenniums, and the contemporary Guggenheim, an evangelist for modern art. The stately Met, which attracts huge crowds for exhibitions on Impressionism, ancient Egypt and Renaissance art, and the hip Guggenheim, where spectacles like "The Art of the Motorcycle" and jazz on Fridays are as big a draw as scholarly shows.
When they met over breakfast recently at The New York Times to talk shop, it was not, as Mr. Krens suggested, "because we're the two oldest guys around." Mr. de Montebello, 63, has run the Met for 22 years, and Mr. Krens, 53, has headed the Guggenheim for almost 12. Their views on expansion, exhibitions, financing, the Internet -- excerpted here -- matter in what some call a golden age for art museums. JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

Q. Philippe, you have said that there will be no satellites for the Met. Do you still feel, in this era of mergers and linkups, that the Met will remain only on Fifth Avenue?
DE MONTEBELLO. We have vast collections, the strength of which is the ability to move from one civilization to another under the same roof, and that we don't want to lose. Dispersal would be a great weakening of the institution.
Q. Tom, what are the benefits of a global museum?
KRENS. It's access to audience. In New York we have about a million visitors a year. In Bilbao there are now about 1.3 to 1.4 million. In Venice, it's about 300,000. And then in Berlin, our limit's a little less than 200,000. So you have almost 3 million visitors, which makes it a fairly substantial cultural force. And it's still a fairly small space. Now, you can argue that maybe we shouldn't be programming as aggressively as we are, but the growth of the collection is related to programming. Donors are drawn to more challenging institutions.
Q. Do you see a limit on the number of branches? Can you bring us up to date on South America and Liverpool and wherever else you're looking?
KRENS. We're not really looking. If I were to show you a list of proposals or letters, it probably would be more than 50, but they're not solicited. We don't have any plans for any further expansion. There is a kind of public relations bounce to this. We were doing an exhibition project in Brazil, and I went to Brazil with a team of three. It was a major story in every newspaper. There were calls from governors of at least seven states in Brazil. But that doesn't translate into anything.
Q. The Met is constrained by its footprint in Central Park. How does it maintain its pre-eminence when it is so constrained?
DE MONTEBELLO. Well, I don't think you measure pre-eminence by square footage. We already are, with the Hermitage and the Louvre, the largest museum structure in the world. We have 2 million square feet. And our collections fit, if not capaciously, at least comfortably, in the building. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to have to develop plans that call for amelioration rather than aggrandizement. The public has demonstrated that it likes a sense of vitality and change in any institution, even one encased in stone as we are.
And there are any number of configurations that you can give to collections within a place as large as the Met. This fall, for example, to celebrate the millennium -- we had to do something to celebrate the millennium; I caved in -- we're doing a show called "The Year One," calculated as 50 B.C. to A.D. 50. "The Year One" is rich in South America, the Mediterranean world, India, China. So we're regrouping what man created at the highest level of visual perception in the Year One.
Q. How much of your collection can be shown at any one time?
DE MONTEBELLO. I would say 90 percent of what you'd like to see.
Q. Do you ever feel the temptation to just spread it all out and say this is everything?
DE MONTEBELLO. No. The Met was already too big a museum in the time of J. P. Morgan. The moment you're too big, you might as well get much better, because what you are is a series of individual destinations within the same place.
With major collections that we might be interested in, we might consider working with other institutions. Maybe, in the future, strict ownership of a work of art will be an outmoded concept. A kind of a general global understanding of trusteeship for works of art rather than ownership may develop.
Q. Museums all over the country are expanding, and yet surveys show that only about 10 percent of the population goes to art museums. Does enlarging the audience mean changing the kinds of shows you do?
DE MONTEBELLO. The predisposition to come to something as recondite as an art museum requires a whole set of things that a museum itself cannot give. We can help -- we can have as many educational programs as possible, we can promote, we can introduce artists in the schools, and so forth, but society has to do its bit as well.
KRENS. If you look at a snapshot of a museum audience, it tends to be tourist-driven. Why? Because we're all busy. Visiting a museum tends to be a leisure-time activity, so to the degree that education stimulates awareness, and prosperity stimulates mobility and the desire to experience these cultural activities in different places, potentially the audience is very, very large.
Q. Some theorists believe that museums are going to have to get people participating in the museum's life. One museum had visitors vote on which of two African sculptures to buy, another had ordinary people writing museum labels. Is that the way museums are going?
DE MONTEBELLO. The notion of opening to popular suffrage decisions that require a great deal of knowledge and discrimination is one that I don't understand.
Q. Yet people are voting with their feet. If there is a show of the Impressionists, it will become a blockbuster and that will look good on the balance sheets. Isn't there a danger in having popular suffrage determine blockbusters?
DE MONTEBELLO. A terrible danger. Do you realize how it limits your options? Picasso, Matisse, Impressionism and Egypt -- is that a way to represent the world? Our obligation is to broaden appetites, to cause more people to come in and see the show we have on Tilman Riemenschneider. One of the reasons I speak a lot about the need for our institutions to become better capitalized, to have larger endowments, is for us to be able to have the integrity and the independence to continue to present things that are not obvious subjects for the public.
KRENS. Our attendance is stronger than it's ever been. It's hard to say exactly why. Is it a function of general prosperity? Of a larger institutional awareness? Bilbao has been such a successful enterprise in Europe -- does that translate to, "Well, when I'm in New York, I'll go to the Guggenheim"? There may be some of that.
As much as I would hesitate to say that the motorcycle exhibition is symptomatic of anything, it attracted a lot of attention, and it wasn't designed to stimulate audiences. We did the same kind of research for that project that we would do for any. It was presented in a very elegant way. And it generated a new audience for the museum.
Q. Are any of them coming back?
KRENS. We don't tag them like whales and find them. But I do have a general sense that increased attendance may be a combination of the programming, the prosperity and image awareness.
DE MONTEBELLO. To me, audiences are second. What distinguishes an art museum from a university or a hospital or any other kind of institution is that we collect works of art. Works of art are the tangible manifestation, the highest aspirations, of man as he expresses himself in visual terms. Our primary responsibility is to the works of art. We are responsible for the guardianship, for scholarship. Then comes the matter of bringing it to the public. The public is the ultimate beneficiary of our primary purpose.
Q. Does an institution like the Guggenheim have a special relationship with its hometown? Would it bother you to see works of art go from here to Bilbao permanently?
KRENS. I find myself lining up with Philippe, referring to what he said earlier about how issues of ownership might be changing. There may be, finally, a community of institutions that, because of standards and compatibility in collections, decide, in effect, to pool their resources. It's a fairly different concept from outright ownership. But right now, our strength as an institution is very much a function of what we do in New York City. If we are to consider serving our collection, we have to consider doing it in New York first.
Q. What are you doing with the Internet?
KRENS. In 10 years it's going to be so different that there is a huge challenge as to how to use this. In terms of Web sites, probably the best I've seen right now is the Met's.
DE MONTEBELLO. I view the Web site and most technological initiatives as forms of marketing, promotion. I want it as marvelous as possible. I want as many images on it as possible. Just as audiences after World War II swelled in part because of those wonderful little Skira books, I'm convinced that Web sites that provide an enormous amount of information will tip the scale for thousands of people who are thinking, "Maybe I'll visit a museum someday," but have never done it.
KRENS. The Internet's a curious thing. It doesn't at all replace the experience of the museum as we know it. Yet there are certain things you can do with the Internet that you can't do for a work on view. One is, with the proper photography and the right bandwidth, you can look in extraordinary detail at various parts of a work of art and have access to the scholarship, stories, histories and conservation records and provenances that surround it.
On the other hand, it still is a screen in a room, and people, at the end of the day, are social beings, and part of the attraction of going to a museum is being in the presence of the actual object.
Q. If the technology continues to improve and the image is virtually 100 percent, what remains to keep the original original?
DE MONTEBELLO. The notion of authenticity. Take a Rembrandt like "The Man With the Golden Helmet" in Berlin, which everybody admired but which is no longer attributed to Rembrandt. The picture hasn't changed. It was beautiful before. Why isn't it beautiful now? The answer is simple: you've changed. The day before, you were admiring something painted by Rembrandt. The moment you know it's not painted by Rembrandt, you changed toward it. And so the picture does change.
Q. The public was surprised, during the "Sensation" show at the Brooklyn Museum, at how museums raise money from people who have commercial interests in the art being shown. Do you think there need to be new conflict-of-interest rules?
DE MONTEBELLO. I cannot answer that in the negative since it is known that the Association of Art Museum Directors has appointed a committee to review and tighten its guidelines on private collections and funding of exhibitions. There's no question that a higher alertness as to what might be conceived as a possible conflict of interest enters our minds.
Q. But the association said virtually nothing about it before.
DE MONTEBELLO. It may not say much more afterward. As far as I'm concerned, most museums have shown, over the last decades, a great deal of wisdom and care in how they've done things.
I have to caution everyone against the puritanism of a newfound sense of ethics, which to me sounds more like righteousness. One has to be very pragmatic and remember that the interests of the many should dominate over the foibles of the few.
Q. But if a fashion designer makes a major contribution and, before or after, you put on the show of that designer, doesn't that create the impression that you're caving in to financial interests?
KRENS. You're making a big leap between the reality and the impression. Hypothetically, there may appear to be danger in lots of things. If something segues from appearance into common practice, then you have a situation that may become more complex. But the fact that there is a debate, that you do have the A.A.M.D. considering tightening these guidelines, confirms the general sense of ethical operations.
Q. Why wouldn't Charles Saatchi, or whoever, want it known that he contributed to the sponsorship of a show of his works?
DE MONTEBELLO. You're going to have to invite Arnold Lehman the director of the Brooklyn Museum to answer that.
Q. Is disclosure the answer?
DE MONTEBELLO. No, but disclosure is an answer. One of the key questions is does the public benefit from the exercise? You have to weigh the degree to which such perceptions, were they to be taken too seriously, ultimately damage the public. We don't print money. And so we have to find some middle-of-the-road way that is ethical but pragmatic.
I was quite amused to read that we were taken to task because we asked Tiffany to fund the Tiffany show and Cartier to fund the Cartier show. Should we have asked Tiffany to fund Cartier and Cartier to fund Tiffany? Let's be logical. First of all, the work of Tiffany was created at the turn of the century, not any of which is still sold by the firm. The Cartier show ended in 1930, so Cartier didn't benefit. This is pushing to an extreme. This is what I call righteousness. And it's silly.
You could even make the outlandish argument that in contemporary art, whenever you show an artist, you're benefiting the artist and the gallery. You might as well close shop if you can no longer deal in that way.
Q. I wonder about the impact of "Sensation" on programming. We spoke of how Impressionism and Egypt bring in crowds. In other media, shock brings in crowds. Are we going to see this more and more in museums?
KRENS. If the material holds up over time, and there develops behind it an intellectual support, you'll begin to see it. But I don't see it as an issue, like all of a sudden there's a special space in storage for the sexually explicit imagery.
We deal with this in a certain way. For example, we received a gift of 200 images from the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation. And we've done small exhibitions selected from this collection. Some were obviously sexually explicit. We deal with that through signage, basically saying to people in advance that they're going into an area where there is some sexually explicit imagery and that parental guidance is encouraged.
Q. How do you deal with the crowds?
KRENS. There were no crowds, believe me. Would that there were.
Q. I was a little surprised to see there was an A.T.M. in Bilbao, inside the museum. I can't imagine one at the Met.
DE MONTEBELLO. Why not? I've always found it curious that we didn't have one inside our shops. We have phone booths.
Q. Are you fighting commercialism, the gift shops right next to the entrance?
DE MONTEBELLO. This is a question of aura. People who make the conscious decision to visit a museum do not want a promulgation of their daily existence. They want something different, conceivably uplifting, or at least challenging, and therefore there has to be kind of a caesura. Shops support the institution, but I certainly wouldn't put them first. I think that would defeat that impression of awe and wonder that museums should provide.
KRENS. To a certain extent, the retail activities are a necessary burden. It's absolutely for sure that museums cannot survive on admission alone. If you were to look at either of our budgets and divide by the number of visitors, the average ticket price would have to be around $75.
DE MONTEBELLO. When we had the exhibition of van Gogh in St. Remy and Auvers -- the last 18 months of the life of van Gogh -- you ended on the very moving set of the final pictures and the crows over the wheat fields. In the next room were all the catalogs and postcards. We had a flurry of letters saying, "We walked out of the exhibition in tears, a great experience ruined by the shops." And I had to say: "Look, I'm sorry we had to have the shops. Would you have preferred not to have an exhibition at all?" Because without the shops, I couldn't have afforded to do the show.
In the end, it's a matter of weighing public benefit with the evils. We are in a capitalistic society where earned income increasingly, as governments cut back, is an important part of our life. That's just the world.
 
Different Perspectives
At a 1999 lecture, Thomas Krens of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum listed "the components of a great 21st-century museum." Without knowing the contents of Mr. Krens's list, Philippe de Montebello of the Metropolitan Museum of Art agreed to compile his own.
 
Mr. Krens:
 
* A great location, with urban in teraction.
* Great collections.
* Great architecture.
* A great special exhibition.
* A great second special exhibition.
* Two shopping opportunities.
* Two eating opportunities.
* A high-tech interface via the Internet.
* Economies of scale via a global network.
 
Mr. de Montebello:
 
* Great works of art.
* Intelligent and seductive presentation with good lighting and labeling.
* Highly accomplished, public-spirited curators.
* Substantial acquisitions funds.
* An endowment large enough to ensure integrity and independence from market-driven decisions.
* Fully committed trustees.
* Staff members who believe in authority and discrimination in judging and presenting art.
* Ease of access, physically through amenities, and intellectually, through programs that deepen the experience and understanding of art.
* Ease of access fuori le mura outside the walls of services and information through the latest technol- ogy.
* An unwavering belief in the primacy of the experience of art over that of "museum as agora," mindful of Hector's exhortation in Shakespeare's "Troilus and Cressida": " 'Tis mad idolatry to make the service greater than the God.' "

It's Ben Stein's World; the Rest of Us Just Watch It

BYLINE: By JOSEPH HOOPER; Joseph Hooper is a New York freelance writer who reports on music and culture.

 BODY:
We're not afraid / We're terrified / We're not alone / We're petrified / Talk to me / Walk with me / . . . Shut up and talk.
THIS neurotic bit of free association is the theme song to Comedy Central's new talk show, "Turn Ben Stein On." Those familiar with the strange arc of Ben Stein's career will not be amazed to learn that Ben Stein wrote the song and Ben Stein sang the song, in a more gravelly version of the famous nasal drone that enabled this young Nixon speechwriter and journalist to become a deadpan comic actor and, most recently, a basic cable icon.
"My voice," Mr. Stein mused over the phone from his Comedy Central office in Los Angeles, "once my curse, now my fortune." 
 For the last three years, Mr. Stein, 54, has starred as the host of the Emmy-winning quiz show "Win Ben Stein's Money," Comedy Central's highest-rated daily show. But this winter, the cable channel decided that even 300-plus episodes of Ben Stein imperiously intoning, "I'm putting up $5,000 that says I know more than you," was not enough Ben Stein.
To date, seven installments of his talk show have run, to a mixed critical reception. Mr. Stein is a raconteur who moves best at a deliberate pace, and he sometimes seemed rushed or distracted trying to fit two guests into a half-hour slot. The mood was further ruffled by Mr. Stein's German short-haired pointer, Puppy Wuppy, who had a knack for nuzzling guests like the ex-rocker Grace Slick and the futurist Alvin Toffler just when they were finding their chatty groove. ("Get down, you fool," Mr. Stein would scold Puppy Wuppy, then in a baby voice, "Oh, she knows when I say 'fool,' it means I love her.") Ben Stein fans were not put off in the least. The show did as well as the quiz show in the ratings, and a second batch of 12 episodes has been ordered and will begin running in June.
Al Burton, the creator and co-producer of "Turn Ben Stein On" and the television executive who lured Mr. Stein to California 24 years ago, vows that the show's kinks will be worked out. At the moment he is busy putting what he says are finishing touches on a deal that will bring an interactive variation of the Stein quiz show to the Shockwave.com Web site. The show is as yet unnamed, but you don't have to be as smart as Mr. Stein -- and he was the valedictorian of his 1970 graduating class at Yale Law School -- to know that it will have "Ben Stein" in the title.
Clearly, Mr. Stein has mastered a self-reflexive style of televison in which everything revolves around a slightly absurd, slightly pudgy know-it-all named Ben Stein. But the two programs illustrate, even drive, television trends that are Bigger Than Ben Stein success of "Win Ben Stein's Money" that set in motion the current renaissance of high-profile network quiz shows. Michael Davies, the television producer who originally greenlighted "Win Ben Stein's Money" when it was just four words in Al Burton's head, persuaded ABC two years later to remake a British show into what is now the most popular program in American television, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." "Regis Philbin has not offered to pay me a cent," Mr. Stein noted.
The rekindled rage for quiz shows is but one element in the television industry's push for the "reality" shows that are less expensive to produce than standard sitcoms and drama series. Here again, Mr. Stein got in on the ground floor -- it doesn't get any more real than "Turn Ben Stein On," which Mr. Stein stocks with his own friends and conducts as if it were his own personal clubhouse. Picture a "Wayne's World" for highbrows.
"It's like that MTV show where they hire six kids to live together," said the journalist Carl Bernstein, a recent guest on the program and a Stein buddy since their childhood days in Silver Spring, Md. "Ben is really sort of 'out there' in terms of his needs, likes and dislikes. He has formed this persona that is so fabulous because it is who he is. It's quite a franchise."
Fortunately for Comedy Central, it is its core younger audience that most vociferously responds to the gentle mockery of Ben Stein, the person and the persona.
"You should see what it's like when I go to a college campus," Mr. Stein said. "The kids go berserk. They start screaming. I think I represent the cool father they never had." An even younger audience has apparently become susceptible to Mr. Stein's monotonal charms as well. "Mothers tell me that their small children like to watch me," he said. "They cry if they don't hear my voice." Andrew Golder, the co-producer of "Win Ben Stein's Money," confirmed as much: "Ben's calming voice plays well to the toddler crowd."
Mr. Stein's transformation into the thinking child's nonpurple Barney or baritone Teletubby is all the more remarkable considering that, before his career-altering role as the boring economics teacher in the 1986 movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," Mr. Stein was known in Hollywood -- persecuted, he says -- for his conservative political views. Those, and a stream of confessional books and magazine articles that detailed his lustful feelings for attractive young women.
"Turn Ben Stein On" is Mr. Stein's loosest forum for getting in touch with the different sides of his personality. Extolling the subtle humor of his guest and friend, the comic actor Fred Willard, he can sound aggressive, even macho: "You zing it in just below the radar screen until someone says, 'Wow, what happened to my gonads?' " Pushing a clearly uncomfortable Alvin Toffler to reveal his annual income or ogling the charms of the Playboy playmate Jodi Ann Paterson, Mr. Stein strikes a naughty adolescent tone. And lapsing into baby talk while scratching Puppy Wuppy's stomach, he seems almost alarmingly connected to his inner child.
"When I was young, I was incredibly repressed and buttoned-down and lonely," Mr. Stein explained. "So I've been letting that inner child out a lot. Unfortunately, that child gets very frightened and upset when he loses a game show, but in every other circumstance, he has a pretty good time."
In contrast to the talk show, "Win Ben Stein's Money" is a precision piece of reality television. It is designed to highlight not only the host's intellectual gifts as he competes with guests for $5,000 -- Mr. Stein earns most of his paycheck by winning -- but also the underlying insecurities that are exposed when he loses. (That happens about 30 percent of the time.) Closeted in his final-round isolation booth, Mr. Stein, swigging stomach medicine and blowing answerable questions, is not pretty, but he is real.
IN his own mind, Mr. Stein is always being judged by somebody. Originally, it was his parents who held him to a high standard. ("They were a tough act in the praise department," he said.) In later years, Mr. Stein said, his father, Herbert Stein, President Nixon's chief economic advisor, became more overtly supportive. "I would call him from my dressing room after every show," he said, "and I'd ask, 'Did you know this question, that question,' and he would almost always say he didn't know the answer. I think he was being polite."
Although "Win Ben Stein's Money" might seem like a quiz show invented by Philip Roth, both of the Comedy Central shows are, in their way, reflections of, even extensions of, Ben Stein's life. However charmed that life may be, it is not immune to real sorrow. Just as "Turn Ben Stein On" was set to start shooting last September, Mr. Stein's father died. Not long after the shooting was complete, Puppy Wuppy was fatally run over by a car. Mr. Stein had her stuffed, but now can't bear to pick her up from the taxidermist. "She was my best friend," he said mournfully.
Mr. Stein will work through his losses, on television, with plenty of viewers for company. It is suggested to him that his life has come to resemble the movie "The Truman Show," but a Truman Show where the Jim Carrey character is at peace with the fact that reality is a television show about him.
"That's the thing I never understood about the movie," Mr. Stein replied. "When he found out it was all about him, why wasn't he ecstatic? If that Truman guy were me, I'd be ecstatic."

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
From an Era When Equality Mattered

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
OH, whoop-de-do and rah, rah, rah! Things are so great in New York right now! So much more excellent than before! Unless they're not. The death, last month, of the legendary city planner Ed Logue came as another grim reminder that New York's current triumphalist mood is as hollow as a plastic party horn. For many New Yorkers, Logue's name evokes an era when the quality of urban life was measured by something more than skyrocketing real estate prices, the banishment of homeless people from public sidewalks and the glitter of confetti falling from the sky. The ideal of social equality also figured in the equation.
Logue, born in Philadelphia in 1921, was among the last of the master planners to practice urban renewal on an epic scale. When he started out in the late 1950's, master planning, subsidized housing and architectural innovation had not yet become discredited concepts. They were the most effective tools used by older urban centers to reconfigure themselves in the era of mass suburban exodus. 
 Urban planning is inherently imperfect. It is also a creature of politics as well an instrument of design. Logue's failures thus attracted more attention than his successes. Because of his work, however, New York and other cities could continue to regard themselves as engines of democracy. This overarching achievement transcended the highs and lows of mid-20th-century urban renewal. It gave our dirty towns the tattered semblance of a soul.
It would take volumes to chronicle Logue's achievements, in a career that took him first to New Haven, then Boston and eventually to cities throughout New York State. Roosevelt Island, perhaps his best-known New York project, deserves a book in itself. Or, you could hop aboard the island's aerial tramway and write one in your head.
The project was conceived by Logue in 1971 when he was head of the New York State Urban Development Corporation. That agency was founded after the death of Martin Luther King, partly to honor the slain leader's memory: the word urban had already come to denote the concentration of minorities in the inner cities. Seeking to avoid the creation of high-rise ghettos, Logue envisioned Roosevelt Island as an economically and racially integrated new town of subsidized, market-rent and co-op housing. City planning, architecture, landscape design, historical preservation, technological innovation: all combined to produce Southtown, the first phase of what was originally foreseen as a much larger community of 18,000 people. The place looked good 25 years ago and has improved with age.
But I have a particular affection for a project that was widely regarded as a failure, Marcus Garvey Village in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. Completed in 1975, Marcus Garvey is a good illustration of Logue's efforts to fuse architecture's social and artistic dimensions. The group of infill row houses, distributed over seven city blocks, was designed by Theodore Liebman, an architect on the development agency's staff, along with Kenneth Frampton and other members of the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies, a nonprofit think tank that flourished in the 1970's under the direction of Peter Eisenman. Working drawings were prepared by David Todd and Associates.
Frampton, born in England, was an advocate of ideas developed by the British architects Peter and Alison Smithson in the early 1960's. Garvey Village adapted these ideas for American use. Instead of the towers-in-a-park format embraced by postwar architects of subsidized housing, Marcus Garvey employed the concept of low-rise, medium-density housing. The retention of the traditional street wall and sidewalk, the inclusion of front door stoops and the enclosed mews areas echoed ideas advocated by Jane Jacobs in her epochal 1961 book, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities." In 1973, the design was displayed in a show at the Museum of Modern Art called "A New Chance for Housing."
Logue and his contemporaries struggled against the winds of changing opinion. After Jacobs's assault on conventional planning, and with the preservation movement on the rise, planners could no longer count on the public to be grateful for their inventions. People were as likely to react as victims of government high-handedness as they were to react as beneficiaries of enlightened largesse. By the end of the decade, even many architects and planners had come to doubt the value and the intentions of urban renewal. In 1971, Robert Goodman, a Boston architect, published a book called "After the Planners." Describing planners as soft cops, Goodman pummeled his profession for undertaking projects as a means to prevent radical change and to perpetuate oppression in the cities. He accused Logue, in particular, of removing the poor to redevelop central city areas for a more affluent clientele.
Forty years after Jacobs, however, a different set of issues must be confronted. The insights of Logue's critics, however fresh they once were, have hardened into a set of assumptions that have impaired New York's capacity to reckon responsibly with change. The decentralization of authority in the planning process, for example, began with the virtuous goal of empowering local communities to shape their own futures. It has resulted in the capitulation of city planning to the private sector and its market-driven pressures. So-called contextual design, which began in part as a way to ward off invasion by urban master planners, has become a camouflage that enables the free market to conduct more tasteful invasions.
In the present dispensation, we're supposed to applaud the collapse of planning as a victory for freedom. No more big government oppressors are moving in to trash old neighborhoods and put up bleak towers to warehouse the poor, tah-dah! In this climate, the failures of postwar city planning are to be gloated over. See, government can't do anything right. Look at these awful towers with their high crime rates, busted elevators and filthy lobbies. Of course, these conditions are due more to lack of maintenance than to architectural design. But this is a mere detail to be brushed aside as neighborhood gentrification proceeds apace. And with a hard cop for mayor, who needs soft cop planners?
What's dropped out of the picture, of course, is the ideal of social equality and the energy that ideal brings to modern democracy. In the classic de Tocqueville formulation, democracy is contingent on the tension between the competing forces of freedom and equality. Without both, there is no tension. Without the tension, democracy dies.
Logue's achievement can be measured in quantitative terms. So many units of housing built. So many created. So much concrete poured. Architecture, however, exists on the symbolic as well as the material plane. The physical reality and the metaphoric value of buildings reinforce each other. In public works, architecture becomes part of the social contract. Some people can be housed. Others can see that people are being housed. From both, an entire city can derive a sense of civic pride.
SO what if Marcus Garvey was a flop? The project nonetheless embodied a faith in the city's talent for continuous reinvention. Success is a relative concept. Accusations of failure can arise from measuring new buildings against a pre-existing standard, often nostalgic, of what constitutes success. But experimentation is also a measure of success. It is a standard that gauges our willingness to venture into the unknown. This, too, is a source of civic pride.
Logue and his generation of planners can be faulted for embracing too uncritically the postwar mythology of progress. But the entire culture was trapped within that myth. It was a powerful symbolic language, drawn on by appliance manufacturers, nuclear scientists, the Mickey Mouse Club, progressive architecture and modern art. Like cultural workers in other fields, Logue and his contemporaries manipulated the symbols of their time toward the needs of an evolving present.
Today, of course, the climate of opinion has shifted to the opposite pole, trapping the city in a theme park mythology of its past. Market pressures have cultivated a demand for ersatz prewar apartment buildings. The status quo is sacred. Kneel but don't touch. Architectural preservation began as an expression of liberal conscience. It has devolved into a deeply reactionary mode of self-deception. It masks the failure of the liberal imagination to address the social justice side of the democratic equation. Who cares about housing when we can rescue a landmark building, throw a fabulous party inside it and toast our sense of public spirit?
Logue's generation can also be critized for relying too heavily on the analogy with disease. Routinely, they compared slums to cancer, and saw themselves a surgeons attempting to cut out or arrest tumors. This attitude helped to solidify the popular image of the city as a victim, a permanent casualty of the postwar decades. In fact, due in no small part to Logue's efforts, the city might better have defined itself as a survivor, a victor entitled to infinite self-esteem.
If it works, break it! That subversive message is struggling to be heard today, as the city confronts the continuing pressures of urban decentralization. Risk failure, risk criticism, risk losing it all. Rage against inertia. Revel in imperfection. Otherwise, the city risks losing its democratic rationale.

HEADLINE: In Philadelphia, a Speculative Office Project Begins

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
THE first speculative office project in almost a decade is under way in downtown Philadelphia, as a 20-story building atop a commuter railroad hub is about to be stripped down to its steel skeleton.
When the renovation at the southwest corner of 16th Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard is complete, its owners say the building, Four Penn Center, will be a brand-new structure using the steel framework of its predecessor. It will be the first office project since 1992 that was begun without tenants already signed to leases for a significant part of the building. 
 Leggat McCall Properties L.L.C., of Boston, purchased the building for $12.3 million last December from the government of Singapore, according to the contract of sale filed with the office of the city's Recorder of Deeds. Leggat McCall said it had budgeted an additional $70 million for the reconstruction. Downtown office space, in short supply after two strong years of leasing activity, has been further depleted by the removal of 15 older office buildings from the city's inventory. Six have been converted to hotels; the rest have been converted into apartment houses, with developers taking advantage of a 10-year tax abatement program.
These and other losses have depleted 10 percent of what had been in 1990 the city's 40.5 million square feet of office space, according to Grubb & Ellis, the real estate services company. As of Dec. 31, Grubb & Ellis reported, the downtown office vacancy rate was 9.5 percent, compared with 13.1 percent a year earlier.
At Four Penn Center, work began this month on asbestos removal, said C. Craig Guers, a Leggat McCall senior vice president, and the building is expected to reopen in the spring of 2001 with 400,000 square feet of space. The building, which sits above the tracks and platforms of Suburban Station, a hub for regional rail and subway lines, is just two blocks from City Hall and the municipal and criminal courts.
Mr. Guers said he expected annual rents in his building to be about $26 a square foot, nearly 20 percent less than the rents of up to $32 asked in the city's newest buildings, most of which were completed between 1989 and 1992.
There are advantages to not trying to build a new structure, however. "I shave 12 months off the project by the steel already being in place," he said. "Brand-new construction, including approvals and design, would be a 30- to 40-month process. We're doing this in 15 months and we feel that's a manageable time frame and economical because the West Market Street corridor has a 7 percent vacancy rate."
MR. GUERS estimated that the renovation, including new building systems, wiring, elevators and climate controls, would cost about $155 a square foot, adding that he looked for mid-sized law firms to be among his tenants.
He said he knew that some had leases expiring in the coming year because they had signed leases with him a decade ago, when he worked at other Penn Center buildings as a development manager for Radnor Corporation, the former real estate development arm of Sun Oil Company.
"Downtown rents were in the low $20's two years ago," Mr. Guers said. "Then, in 1999, absorption set a record for the decade and vacancy dropped by 25 percent in about six months. Leggat McCall's biggest strength is in renovation -- we do it from Boston to Washington -- and our people went through the building and figured out how to make it work."
Leggat McCall has new construction projects in the Philadelphia suburbs, including Plymouth Meeting, Pa., and Mount Laurel, N.J., that stress quick construction in established markets where there is room for relatively small buildings.
While his company is willing to take small risks for small rewards, he said, it is not willing to overextend itself on huge projects involving large loans. Now, Mr. Guers said, there is a greater emphasis than in the city's last building boom in the late 80's on smaller, more efficient buildings closer to amenities such as hotels, shops and restaurants and outfitted with premium systems such as high-speed telecommunication and computer wiring.
The Four Penn Center project is a major step in recovery for a city still shaking off the hangover of excess space that lasted from 1992 to 1996, said Wayne Fisher, senior vice president at Grubb & Ellis.
For most of those years, the city had a surplus of office space that led to price cutting and costly incentives to lure tenants as brokers worked to sublease or re-lease space vacated by takeover targets such as Conrail. In 1997, most of Conrail's operations were split between two other rail carriers, CSX and Norfolk Southern. It then became a small regional freight carrier in selected cities -- primarily in the Northeast, but including Detroit -- and subleased 100,000 square feet of its former 850,000 square feet of office space. CSX has sublet an additional 650,000 square feet, 250,000 square feet of it to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Merger announcements unsettled an otherwise positive real estate leasing picture. Peco Energy Company, the region's electric utility, is merging with Unicom Corporation, a Chicago electric utility. And SmithKline Beecham, a pharmaceutical company that last year opened an additional 215,000-square-foot building adjacent to its 598,000-square-foot headquarters two blocks north of Four Penn Center, has agreed to merge with Glaxo Wellcome, a British pharmaceutical corporation. No decision has been made on the site of the Glaxo-SmithKline headquarters, according to Thomas Johnson, a SmithKline spokesman.
More than 1.3 million square feet of downtown office leases were signed in 1999, a record year, more than double the city's average of 553,000 square feet per year, said Fisher of Grubb & Ellis. The flurry of leases leaves many potential tenants for Four Penn Center already committed elsewhere, he added.
"Rents aren't spiking the way they are in Boston or Washington," he said. "But we're getting a steady 10 percent per annum or about $2 extra per square foot. All the background statistics say now is the time if you were ever going to do a renovation."
AMONG the risks Mr. Fisher identified was a shrinking pool of prospective tenants looking to lease more than 100,000 square feet of space; the likelihood that Philadelphia will not repeat the stellar pace of 1999 and the constant exposure to mergers and acquisitions, which might open up space in otherwise fully rented buildings.
The eight-building Penn Center complex, which has a total of about 5 million square feet of space, extends from 15th to 19th Streets, between Market Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard. It occupies the former site of the old Pennsylvania Railroad's massive rail station and elevated tracks, which were demolished in the 1950's.
Begun in 1953, the Penn Center development initiated a shift of office construction from the city's geographic center of Broad and Market Streets to the Market Street corridor as far west as 22nd Street.
Even at a modest 20 stories, Four Penn Center is not overshadowed by the majority of its neighbors. This is because, for more than half a century, developers observed a self-imposed 500-foot restriction on the height of their office towers so that they would not rise higher than the 548-foot City Hall, which is topped by a bronze statue of William Penn. But in 1986 the restriction was scrapped with the completion of the 945-foot 1 Liberty Place tower.
Most of the office buildings in the central business district built prior to that date have changed ownership in the last five years, Mr. Guers said. The Four Penn Center building has been empty for two and a half years since its last tenant, the Reliance Insurance Company, moved into a tower several blocks north.
One of the greatest challenges for developers, said Glenn Mueller, managing director of Legg Mason Real Estate Research in Baltimore, is finding tenants that are viable over the long term.
"The real risk is not in whether you can rent it today but whether the company will be around two or three years from now, because of the Internet and merger and acquisition activity," Mr. Mueller said.

HEADLINE: Divided by Business Outlook, and by Race

BYLINE: By ROBBIE WOLIVER 

 BODY:
PROMINENT black business executives on the Island have a warning for the growing number of black entrepreneurs who choose not to affiliate with established civic and business associations: If you're not in the room, you won't effect change.
But some struggling entrepreneurs, like Charles Sessions of Exodus Computers, a Bay Shore technology company, fire back, "Who says it's their room I need?" 
 Despite the fact that the African-American community is aggressively promoting entrepreneurship, the social and racial integration of Long Island business has not happened.
Mistrust, intimidation, lack of interest, contrasting agendas, strained economics: these are some of the reasons black entrepreneurs give for avoiding traditional, predominantly white business organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, the Long Island Association and the Long Island Forum for Technology.
But longer established African-American business owners say that this is a big mistake, that black-owned businesses must network to survive.
Some black executives say they prefer to concentrate on their own community rather than blend with predominately white business organizations. And the makeup of these organizations reflects the trend. Although the 5,000-member Long Island Association, the area's largest civic association, says it does not track racial statistics, a spokesman, Gary Wojtas, acknowledged that black membership was "very low."
Gary Coley, the president of the Roosevelt Chamber of Commerce, which is 90 percent black, and the editor of Community Journal, which focuses on African-Americans, is one of the few black members of the Long Island Association, and he estimates black membership at 3 or 4 percent.
But Phyllis Hill Slater, one of three African-Americans on the association's 44-member board (Henry Holley and Willie B. Edlow Jr. are the other two) estimated it at 10 percent. (The Census Bureau put the proportion of blacks in Nassau and Suffolk in July 1998 at 8 percent.)
After a recent business breakfast sponsored by the Long Island Forum for Technology, the acting executive director, Patricia Howley, acknowledged that there was no black representation. She noted that LIFT had begun an outreach program to young entrepreneurs, but did not specifically seek out members of minorities. "In the long run," she said, "money has no color."
Still, she said, it is essential to the survival of black entrepreneurs to join such business associations.
Ms. Hill Slater has served on the board of the Long Island Association for nine years and has been chairwoman of its small-business committee for eight.
Her company, Hill Slater Inc., a Great Neck engineering and architectural firm, is what Ken Jenkins, chairman of the Nassau Community College African-American Studies department, calls the type of business that benefits most from traditional networking.
"The young hip-hop entrepreneurs would not be well served joining such an organization," he said.
Ms. Hill Slater disagrees. "I don't care what business you own," she said. "You must network. It's the key to survival. As people of color enter the business world in larger numbers, more people will join organizations like the L.I.A., and they'll feel more comfortable being a part of it. That's how you get contracts, information and important personal affiliations. It's how you get access to capital."
Mr. Holley, who owns Hempstead Transportation, a limousine charter company, supports this view, saying: "I joined these organizations because people do business with those who they become comfortable with. They needed to know me. I wanted to introduce myself to those who could use my services."
But Denton L. Watson, an associate professor of African-American history at the State University of New York at Old Westbury, said: "That's not really the trend within the black community. The trend is to be more individualistic. You won't find too many blacks joining organizations."
Eliza Townsend, owner of Relax for Health, a holistic medical practice in Wyandanch, takes a more personal view: "We're isolated. I never thought about joining an organization. Everything I do is on my own at a community level."
Professor Watson believes independent black entrepreneurs need to keep in mind the civil rights movement of the 1960's. "African-Americans did not get to this point by doing things on their own," he said. "It's always been about group support. No man can open doors for himself; we need some affiliation, some help."
Black civic leaders say business organizations, if they want to successfully attract young African-American entrepreneurs, need meaningful outreach programs. The Urban League of Long Island recognized the need for a technological outreach program, for example, and a state-funded computer technician training program supervised by the league teaches both technical and life skills -- like overcoming intimidation and operating in a workplace setting, tools that provide the confidence that young executives need to approach organizations like LIFT.
"Only black-run organizations operate outreach programs to black people," said Andreaus Guilty, producer of the Afrikan-Amerikan News in Roosevelt and executive director of the African-American Media Network, which plans to train black executives. "These local chambers of commerce and civic groups, they don't target the black entrepreneur. No matter how much they talk about inclusion and diversity, there is inherent racism in their organization."
No, said Eddison Bramble, owner of New Image Media and president of 100 Black Men of Long Island, "it's not necessarily racism."
"It's that our priorities are different," he continued. "Sitting at a breakfast about tourism doesn't address how I can help black men in my community. Our organization is focused on mentoring and outreach. They just have a different agenda."
Mr. Bramble ended his own membership in the Long Island Association but his group, 100 Black Men, keeps in touch through Mr. Holley, who is a member of both organizations.
Both Ms. Hill Slater and Mr. Holley agreed that there needs to be more outreach from traditional organizations. But as Ms. Hill Slater acknowledged: "People of color are intimidated. They don't always feel welcome or comfortable, so they stay away."
Some say the divisions are in fact positive for black entrepreneurs. Professor Jenkins, for example, said, "It's valuable for people to create their own opportunities within their own communities."
And Mr. Guilty, who is also known as Andreaus 13, strongly disagrees with both Ms. Hill Slater and Mr. Holley. "The people who opened the doors didn't do it so we can follow someone else's rules," he argues.
To which Sylvester Wise, professor of sociology and African-American culture at Nassau Community College, responded: "Doesn't that sound a little naive? They don't realize the significance of empowerment of organizational and institutional structures. It's the result of cultural naivete."
Mr. Sessions counters with the accusation, "But those organizations don't want to have anything to do with us." And Ms. Hill Slater comes back with, "Well, if that's true, break those myths by showing up."
Ron Strong's company, Jump Street Beauty Supplies, is in Roosevelt, on a street with many black-owned businesses, and he is not interested in affiliating with traditional organizations. "They're detached from what's going on here in my neighborhood," he explained.
He gets support from Mr. Guilty, who said: "The best way to address this is to start your own organization and push forward your own goals. We didn't break it; we're not going to fix it."
How will black entrepreneurs' opinions be respected by the establishment if they are not offered directly to the establishment? Diversity and networking may be one key to business success, but black business owners like Mr. Sessions are frustrated.
"I understand the worth of networking," he said, "but I don't want to be herded into a certain section -- a member of the black section of a predominately white organization. Most organizations are polarized. I need to be a full constituent, not an enrolled constituent.
"In my field, you see very few black faces. White technologists don't share with black technologists -- period. There is intimidation. It's not said, it's not something you can put a finger on."
But Theresa Sanders, chief executive of the Urban League of Long Island, said the league was training people in the lucrative technology field. "Young black entrepreneurs have to break that barrier," she added. "Being resistant isn't the solution."
In addition to a sense of intimidation and racial resistance, there is another obstacle black entrepreneurs find when dealing with membership organizations: the cost. Professor Jenkins said business owners find the associations a luxury.
This frustrates Mr. Holley, who understands that finances are tight, but says black entrepreneurs must find a way around it. "How will you know a contract exists if you're not networking?" he asks.
"I'm struggling all the time," said Ray Boben, 54, of Ray's Iron Works in Bellmore. "I don't have time to discuss business. Minority businesses aren't really businesses. We are self-made men who make jobs for ourselves.
"I'm nailing all day long, and there's a man who's sitting at a computer all day, and he wants to meet with me? I don't relate to young white boys whose parents put them in business, or old men who have been sitting behind a desk their whole life, people who get credit and loans whenever they ask. What can I learn from them?"
Professor Jenkins says the younger generation has the answer: "There's an energy that comes from young black entrepreneurs, and it affects people around them, not just about how to make a living, but how to make a personal statement. They are not looking for validation from America."

HEADLINE: Trek West, Commuters, Trek West

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY 

 BODY:
IT is not the run-down condition of the western end of Penn Station, nor the suffocatingly low ceilings on the New Jersey Transit platforms, nor the last-minute track information that bothers Kris Martin most about her daily commute to Manhattan.
"You know what the worst part of commuting is?" said Ms. Martin, 39, of Matawan, N.J., a database manager who rides New Jersey Transit every day. "The commuters. Everyone is so rude. Let's say you're standing and waiting for a train -- someone will come up and just push you out of the way. Everyone's jockeying for position." 
 Jeffrey N. Leibell, a lawyer and Long Island Rail Road commuter, agreed. "You become an automaton," said Mr. Leibell, 42, a family man and Little League coach in Great Neck who undergoes a Jekyll-to-Hyde transformation at Penn Station. "It's a rat race, one foot in front of the other. It turns us into unpleasant people."
But transit and elected officials are spending a lot of time and money to make things more pleasant for more than 300,000 commuters from Long Island, New Jersey, New York City, Washington, Boston and elsewhere who squeeze through Pennsylvania Station and the neighboring subway stations every day.
The commuters include about 200,000 rail passengers -- 144,000 on the Long Island Rail Road, 44,000 on New Jersey Transit and 8,200 on Amtrak, the railroads said.
Another 100,000 people use the Seventh and Eighth Avenue subway stations, and 150,000 rail commuters hop from their trains to the subways, according to the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation, which was set up by New York State to guide a vast project to build a new station to the west.
The grand expansion projects would convert half of the James A. Farley General Post Office, across Eighth Avenue from Penn Station, into a new hub for Amtrak that will also serve New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road commuters.
The 21 tracks, which are reached along 11 platforms, run east-west, passing below the post office before emerging into the Metropolitan Transit Authority rail yard west of Ninth Avenue. Even now, the post office ships some mail by rail, and, in addition to creating new ticket booths and waiting areas, the Farley project would expand access to the tracks westward. The vaulted Postal Service lobby for the public along Eighth Avenue will remain.
The project will not add any tracks or platforms. But Charles Gargano, chairman of the redevelopment corporation, said the easier access and fuller use of the existing platforms will increase the station's capacity to handle the 30 percent increase in traffice that is projected by 2010.
Transportation experts generally welcome the Farley plan. Lee Sander, director of the Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University and member of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, called the plan "a terrific project" that would improve conditions for everyone who now uses Penn Station.
But Peter Haynes, a longtime commuter and a former L.I.R.R. employee who founded the Long Island Rail Road Commuter Campaign last August, is doubtful the project will have much impact, particularly since it will not add tracks.
"I'm all for new stations, but if they don't do anything underground, it's going to be very limited in effect," said Mr. Haynes, 42, a computer consultant. "My impression is, it's sort of like window-dressing for people coming up from Washington or Philadelphia. It's a poor replacement for the old Penn Station, and meanwhile, the Long Island Rail Road daily commuters, using the station five times a week, are going to see very little change."
As the Farley project gets under way -- the target completion date is 2003 -- the railroad is also finishing up a new $37.5 million waiting area in the New Jersey Transit-Amtrak area of the current Penn Station. Its modern design is intended in part to reflect Amtrak's sleek, 150-mile-an-hour Acela trains, which began limited service on the Boston-Washington corridor this month.
In one corner of the station, behind plywood barriers, New Jersey Transit is also ripping up huge concrete slabs and taking down heavy I-beams to install new escalators, elevators and ramps to improve access to Tracks 1 through 12. This separate $105 million project -- "a station within a station," Saundra Lautenberg, New Jersey Transit's program manager for engineering and construction, called it -- is scheduled for completion in mid-2001.
In addition, the "Hilton corridor," an existing passageway that links the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit to Seventh Avenue, is to be spruced up to match the new Amtrak-New Jersey Transit space, according to Ken Miller, a spokesman for the New Jersey system.
And on the East Side, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the Long Island Rail Road, has approved $1.5 billion in its 2000-04 capital plan to cover about half the estimated cost of linking L.I.R.R. tracks to Grand Central Terminal by 2010. Because 60 percent of Long Island riders head north and east from Penn Station, the Grand Central connection should lower sharply the number who use Penn Station, said Christopher P. Boylan, M.T.A. deputy executive director.
But Penn Station will hardly be empty: the M.T.A. is working on a parallel plan to link the station to Metro North trains, for the convenience of Westchester and Connecticut residents who now arrive at Grand Central but would rather arrive on the West Side.
The current renovation of the New Jersey Transit-Amtrak waiting area and tracks, at the western end of Penn Station, mimics the $90 million project to the north that the L.I.R.R. completed in 1995. It added a fourth concourse near Eighth Avenue for access to Tracks 13 through 21.
As a measure of the improved access, the total number of elevators, escalators and stairways will rise to 160 when the two projects are complete, from 94 currently. The Farley project will add 46, while New Jersey Transit will add 20.
The new areas in the Farley building will not have direct access to Tracks 1 through 4, which do not extend far enough west, said John Gerber, executive vice president of the development corporation. But Farley will be connected to Tracks 5 to 21 by the Long Island Rail Road's west end concourse, which already runs from Track 21 south to Track 13, and will be extended to Track 5.
Reminiscent of the original Penn Station's glass train house, the project will incorporate the post office's vast skylight as the ceiling of what essentially will be a huge atrium. "It's going to be a series of balconies that descend right down to the tracks. So we're going to bring the natural light back down to the tracks," Mr. Gerber said.
Though the Farley project will further ease congestion, Mr. Boylan said, crowding is hardly the station's only problem.
An Amtrak commuter, Christina Sterner, who commutes from Philadelphia twice a week, said that arriving at Penn Station is a numbing experience at best, especially compared with what she calls the spiritual uplift she gets from the 30th Street Station in Philadelphia or Union Station in Washington.
"I think that this is one of the ugliest train stations that exist," said Ms. Sterner, managing director of Baryshnikov Productions in New York, the ballet dancer's production company. "Philadelphia has a beautiful station, Washington has a beautiful station, and New York should. There's no sense of anything at Penn Station. It's nothing."
But the Farley project is something, indeed.
Highlighted by a 150-foot-high framework of steel and glass rising 75 feet above the roof of the Beaux-Arts post office, the new station is envisioned as a return to the grandeur that was lost when the old Penn Station, on the same site, was demolished in 1963 to build Madison Square Garden and the office towers above. The Farley project is a kind of swan song for its main proponent, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, who is retiring in January.
"It's the busiest passenger transportation facility in the world, and growing," Mr. Moynihan said in a recent interview. "It's not just restoring grandeur. It's getting out of that hole in the ground."
Most L.I.R.R. and N.J. Transit riders would actually have to go well out of their way to get a glimpse of the Farley atrium. But officials insist that the Farley project does not snub suburban commuters, who will be able to buy tickets and reach their trains from the new station.
A new station could also be a key element of Amtrak's strategy, which highlights the new Acela service and aims to woo airline shuttle passengers in the Boston-Washington corridor with the convenience of downtown-to-downtown high-speed trains.
Mr. Gargano, the leader of the project, is also commissioner of the New York State Department of Economic Development and vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, other agencies involved in the Farley project. His close involvement -- he can readily recite precise dollar contributions from nearly a dozen sources of funds at the federal, state and city level -- is one reason the project's proponents are optimistic about its outcome, though some of his Republican political connections have also drawn accusations of cronyism.
The price tag, put at $484 million when President Clinton presented the plan in May, is now estimated at $788 million, including $188 million in improvements to the post office itself and track work. The direct cost of the station is $600 million, said Tony Bullock, Mr. Moynihan's chief of staff.
Ground-breaking is expected this fall, with completion planned for late 2003.
The sources of money, according to Mr. Gargano, include these:
*The Empire State Development Corporation, of which Mr. Gargano is also chairman, which will issue bonds to be repaid by the lease of retail space, $155 million;
*The federal Department of Transportation, $140 million;
*The United States Postal Service, $120 million;
*Amtrak, $68 million;
*New York State, $75 million;
*New York City, $25 million;
*The Federal Rail Road Administration, $56 million.
Additional funds will come from federal loans and lines of credit. Officials said neither the L.I.R.R. nor New Jersey Transit would contribute and the project should have no effect on fares.
Just what to call the new station -- and the current Penn Station, for that matter -- has not been decided. Senator Charles E. Schumer, New York's other Senator and also a Democrat, has introduced a bill to name the new station after Mr. Moynihan, but Mr. Moynihan said he was embarrassed by the prospect.
The annex and the main lobby of the Farley Building, named for a former United States postmaster general, will continue to be used by the Postal Service, though some operations were shifted to a nearby facility a few years ago. The Postal Service will continue to own the entire Farley complex, but will lease the station portion to the redevelopment corporation for 99 years.
The post office is actually two buildings, the original built in 1913 and an annex dating from 1934, though connecting walls make them appear as one. In the design, by the architect David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the station's main concourse will occupy the space between the original building and the annex, which is now mainly truck bays.
Plans also call for retail shopping and waiting areas on four levels stepping down to the train platforms, most of which already extend below the post office.
The main post office building was designed by McKim, Mead & White, who were also the architects for the old Pennsylvania Station, which was built in 1910, and the firm used a complementary Beaux-Arts style. Its demolition is universally reviled today as a crime against architecture..
Senator Moynihan's hope is to recapture some of the grandeur of the original station, which can be glimpsed in photographs hanging in the Amtrak ticket area near Eighth Avenue and 33rd Street. And on the walls at the foot of the escalators on 34th Street, just west of Seventh Avenue, full-sized terra cotta reliefs of toppled Corinthian columns by the sculptor Andrew Leicester commemorate the old station's bygone classicism. Another of Mr. Leicester's series, "Mercury Man," is in the main L.I.R.R. concourse, near a bakery named, perhaps suitably for the crowded station, Hot & Crusty.
Will the station succeed as a station and ease communters' pain? More tracks are a frequent suggestion, but railroad officials have said the capacity of the East River tunnels has to be addressed first.
Mr. Haynes, of the Commuter Campaign, said an East Side connection to Grand Central would also be a help for Long Islanders, but he doubts it will happen "in my lifetime."
Robert Yarrow, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a private organization, also said the lack of new tracks is a shortcoming.
Still, Mr. Yarrow said the new station's striking combination of classical and contemporary architecture, and on such a grand scale, could instill in New Jersey and Long Island commuters the same vaunted feelings that Grand Central does for Metro North riders like him.
"I do it every day," he said. "It's an ennobling experience. It makes you feel good about coming into the city."
But Ms. Martin, the New Jersey commuter, said what she looks for in a rail road is on-time performance, not nobility.
"To be honest, it really doesn't matter to me," she said. "If I had the choice between having a beautiful station and my trains running on time and being clean, I would much rather have my trains run on time."
But she did say her biggest problem with commuting was rude commuters, and proponents of the Farley project say one of its main effects will be to soothe those savage nine-to-fivers.
"People are rude, they're shoving and pushing because they're enduring an unacceptable level of discomfort," said Mr. Bullock, Mr. Moynihan's chief of staff. "What the Farley project provides is a glorious new setting."
Mr. Leibell, the Long Island lawyer, said he is no student of behavior, but that seems to make sense to him: "If it were a larger space, if it weren't as crowded, if there were more options and easier access to the track level, and maybe just having it posted where your train is, it would make the commute easier, improve the experience, kind of take the edge off."
 
Meanwhile, on the East Side . . .
WITH access from their usual tracks, 13 to 21, Long Island Rail Road commuters now crammed into Penn Station will be able to share in the grandeur of the $788 million extension of Pennsylvania Station west of Eighth Avenue.
But the railroad and its parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, are investing on a grand scale in other projects to make life more comfortable and convenient for commuters.
The M.T.A. has approved $1.5 billion in its 2000-2004 capital plan to cover about half the cost of opening up an existing tunnel under the East River to link the Island track network to Grand Central Station by 2010. Because 60 percent of the line's riders head north and east after they arrive in Penn Station, the Grand Central connection will draw away many of them, said Christopher P. Boylan, deputy executive director of the M.T.A.
Penn Station will hardly empty out. The transportation authority, which also operates the Metro North Railroad, is working on a concurrent plan to link Metro North tracks to Penn Station for Westchester and Connecticut commuters who now arrive at Grand Central but who are headed for the West Side.
The Long Island Rail Road has also added 134 double-decker coaches and 23 dual-powered diesel-electric locomotives that were purchased in 1998 for $371 million.
Mr. Boylan said that because the coaches carry one-third more passengers than the aging cars they replace, the railroad has significantly reduced the amount of platform space needed to board the same number of passengers.
Diesel trains are not permitted in Penn Station for health reasons. So a major benefit of the new locomotives, which can switch from diesel to electric power, is to spare passengers who ride the diesel-powered Montauk and Port Jefferson trains the time and inconvenience of switching to electric trains in Jamaica.

HEADLINE: Adopting Teaching as Second Career

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
IT is not quite the same as sitting in a corner office evaluating corporate loans, but Mary Sykes would not trade her current clients for anything.
Mrs. Sykes, a former Citibank lending officer, returned to school to add a master's degree in education in school guidance to her master's in business administration. 
 She is now a guidance counselor at Rye Neck High School -- and one of a growing number of people to make the switch to education after having a successful career in another field.
Mrs. Sykes is quick to point out the similarities in her career choices. "As a lending officer at Citibank, I was making loans to corporations and it was very much an outreach situation," said Mrs. Sykes, a mother of three who has worked at Rye Neck for two years.
As a banker, Mrs. Sykes said: "I had to analyze the clients' needs. In the college realm, I'm also doing outreach to colleges, trying to package a particular student to a particular college. You have to be able to speak well and be presentable, and in both you have to like people. I love what I'm doing. I like this so much more than working in finance."
People who switch to careers in education can easily find jobs because teachers are already in short supply, and the situation is expected to get worse. Within the next decade, it is projected that schools will have to find nearly two million new teachers nationally.
"Fifty percent of our teachers are eligible for retirement in five years," said Rita Golden, president of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association in Larchmont. "The New York State School Boards Association supports incentives to attract teachers in certain subjects like math, science and foreign language, where there are staffing shortages."
Meanwhile, some states like New Jersey and New York have developed alternative certification programs to make it easier for people who have been trained in other fields like law or business to switch into elementary and secondary school teaching.
Some experts say that the teacher shortage -- and proposed remedies -- are nothing new.
Dr. Joan Weber, assistant superintendent of personnel and administration in the Scarsdale school district, said: "Back in the 1980's, when we were also facing a teacher shortage, there was a strong push to encourage folks from other fields to enter teaching. This is not a brand-new initiative. What we're seeing now are people who have been in business and law who have taken a second look at what is meaningful in their lives and have retrained to come in as teachers."
In many cases, second-career teachers work for significantly lower salaries than they did in their previous occupations. New York state's average beginning salary for teachers was $30,204 for 1997-98, according to a survey conducted by the Washington-based American Federation of Teachers. In Connecticut, the average beginning salary for teachers was $29,506 and in New Jersey, it was $28,318, both for 1997-98, according to the federation.
The New York Board of Regents has encouraged efforts to encourage those seeking to switch careers to teaching.
"The Regents do endorse this," said Bill Hirschen, a spokesman for the State Department of Education. "They're working with colleges to develop these people who already have a master's degree."
At the School of Education at Manhattanville College in Purchase, for example, more than half of the candidates for master's degrees are second-career teachers, Dr. Sylvia Blake, the dean of the department, said.
"We have Saturday and Sunday classes to accommodate them," Dr. Blake said, "and one of the strengths of our program is that our advisers are trained to talk to this segment to figure out what they need to do. Districts are extremely interested in these people. They show a degree of seriousness that is impressive."
Dr. Jan McDonald, dean of the School of Education at Pace University in White Plains, said the master's degree program at the university was aimed at people who are changing careers. "They bring a knowledge base of the world and the working world," she said, "and certainly a level of maturity that is valuable."
Concern about attracting qualified professionals to teaching has led to a variety of other efforts to address the problem. Kelly Services, the temporary employment agency, recently began a program to provide substitute teachers to school districts. Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed a series of legislative efforts to encourage people to enter teaching, including tuition subsidies for college students who would work in public schools. One proposal would allow retired state employees to be able to continue to collect their pensions as well as a paycheck for teaching, if they become certified.
Many people have made the transition to teaching. In Scarsdale, former lawyers and bankers and people from other professions are working in the elementary, middle and high schools, a trend echoed in other districts. At Ridgewood High School in Ridgewood, N.J., two former lawyers teach social studies.
Among the career changers is Elizabeth Iadavaia, who, as a candidate for a master's degree in education from Pace University, is an intern in the Pelham school district. Ms. Iadavaia, who has a bachelor's degree in economics from Georgetown University in Washington, spent 15 years in the business world, holding responsible and well-paid jobs with companies like Merrill Lynch and Equitable Life.
"There was a real enjoyment in being in business, and I enjoyed the challenge," Ms. Iadavaia said. "But there was an empty component. We made more money for businesses, but after working for 15 years in business, I knew there's more to life than money. I have a real love for children, and I think there is an altruistic component in teaching."
Another person who changed careers is Sasha Davies, a third-grade teacher at Coman Hill Elementary School in Byram Hills. A former singer, radio show host and recreation therapist at a hospital, Mrs. Davies said she had never considered being a teacher until she had her own children.
"I was at a point of my life where I thought, What did I want to do with the rest of my life?" Mrs. Davies said. "I wanted to give something back. I wanted to teach younger kids, where it's fun and exciting."
Stuart Horlacher, an intern at Rye Neck High School through the University of Bridgeport's graduate program, had been a money market trader at Goldman, Sachs and an assistant trader at J. P. Morgan & Company. His new ambition is to be a high school biology teacher.
Mr. Horlacher said: "I got sucked into Wall Street for three years, but I started to dislike it. I didn't enjoy what I was doing. I love science, and I want to turn other people on to science."
Such enthusiasm is one factor that makes second-career candidates appealing to school districts.
"In my experience, it has always worked well," said Dr. Barbara Ferraro, principal of Rye Neck High School. "We're looking for people with an extraordinary energy level who have sensitivity. Their experiences in the world of work give them flexibility and an ability to do team work. You don't want a staff of all second careers, because you want a staff with different experiences and perspectives. You have to look at the person and the position, to see how they fit into the fabric of the school."
People who change careers often find a welcome in school districts, but cannot be expected to solve the teacher shortage problem by themselves.
"Second-career people will be more than a Band-Aid, but I'm very cautious about saying that this will solve the problem," said Dr. Blake of Manhattanville College, who observed that schools of education are also hard pressed to find qualified faculty members. "I don't know where you'll find the people you need. You have to make teaching attractive. You want to have your finest and your brightest do teaching."

HEADLINE: Towns Maneuver to Protect Scenic Roads

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MAKER 

 BODY:
IT was a breezy, gray day in January when 21 wild turkeys trotted their prehistoric-looking black bodies down Stilson Hill Road in New Milford, past a large yellow and green diamond-shaped sign that reads "Scenic Road, 15 M.P.H." A few sounds competed with the turkeys: whinnying horses, the wind in the trees, everything one would expect to hear on a back road in Litchfield County.
But drowning out the gobbles was the boom of backhoes and bulldozers. 
 Stilson Hill Road, one of 24 roads in New Milford noted by the town's Scenic Road Ordinance, is undergoing residential development despite the protection the ordinance was supposed to give.
"It makes me weep, what's happened up there," said David Hubbard, director of town planning and economic development for New Milford, pointing out that 15 new houses have been built along the 2.2-mile road during the past 18 months, and scores more are either under construction or being planned there. "Stilson Hill is a charming road that's being burdened by the kind of development that we had hoped the Scenic Road Ordinance would soften. But we've learned that the ordinance itself is not enough."
Across Connecticut, 37 cities and towns have adopted scenic road ordinances since the General Assembly adopted a statute in 1981 allowing municipalities to do so. Preserving rural roads has taken on greater importance as many municipalities face increased development.
Newtown, with 60 square miles and a population of 24,000, has topped the state in issuing residential home building permits over the past three years, about 250 each year, according to William Rodgers, chairman of the town's Scenic Roads Ordinance Committee.
And New Milford, the geographically largest municipality in the state at 64 square miles, issued 168 building permits from fiscal 1999, the busiest home building year in its history, according to the town's Building Department. Ray Foote, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based organization Scenic America, a nonprofit group that supports the protection of natural resources, said that Connecticut is a pioneer in the preservation of scenic roads.
"States with local scenic road designations are pretty uncommon, actually," Mr. Foote said. "But there's a definite momentum building right now; people are realizing that when it comes to preserving scenic and rural roads, the most effective control is at the local level. And Connecticut is sort of leading the way."
The state ordinance allows towns to designate roads scenic if they meet one of seven or so criteria, like being unpaved, being lined with old stone walls or mature trees, being no more than 20 feet wide, offering views, or running by streams, lakes or ponds. In most towns, residents petition the town to put a road on the scenic list. The ordinance allows municipalities to limit or altogether prohibit alterations to scenic roads.
State law focuses on the preservation of scenic roads, but many towns are using the law to hinder development along the roads. Some developers say that's wrong. Towns have found, as New Milford did with Stilson Hill Road, that the ordinance can't stop development.
While towns including Bethany, Bridgewater, Newtown, Norwalk, Wilton and Washington report varying degrees of success with the ordinances they have passed, some officials said they would like to find a way to strengthen the law.
New Milford is considering a proposal to take scenic road preservation a step farther: working with Harrall-Michalowski Associates, town planning consultants in Hamden, New Milford officials have crafted a proposed ordinance called the Scenic and Rural Country Road District; it would reduce the number of driveways and access ways cut into scenic roads and protect some of the land around these streets. It also calls for any new houses built on a scenic road to have a minimum property frontage along the road of 400 feet or have a minimum frontage of 200 feet and a shared driveway with the lot next door. There are no specific regulations regarding property frontage or front yard set-backs for homes in the current law.
The new proposal would also require a minimum front yard set-back of 100 feet for new houses along scenic roads. "Landscaping of lots along a designated road shall avoid clear-cutting and preserve existing stone walls and natural vegetation along the roadway within the 100 foot setback, which shall be a buffer," the proposal says.
People who want to preserve scenic roads applaud New Milford's proposal.
"It sounds like a good way to protect the land, since the scenic road ordinance only deals with the road itself," said Mary-Michelle U. Hirschoff of Bethany, a chairwoman of Residents for Rural Roads, a group that lobbied the state legislature to enact the statute. "This is an important issue all over the state and we sort of have to all learn from each other," she said.
What New Milford has learned is that flat-out prohibition of changes on these roads can leave towns liable for litigation. It has been fighting for 13 years with Laurie Gonthier of Morris, a stockbroker who develops houses as investments.
"This has been the longest, most expensive, most complicated, most exhausting case I've ever handled," said Jeffrey Sienkiewicz, a former town attorney who represents New Milford in the case.
Mr. Gonthier sued the town in 1988 after the Planning Commission denied his application to build two subdivisions totaling 29 lots on Rooster Tail Hollow Road, a scenic road designated in 1987. The land is zoned for residential use.
The Planning Commission had argued that the road's scenic status prevented it from being widened or improved to handle traffic from the subdivisions.
Mr. Gonthier appealed in Litchfield Superior Court, which ruled in his favor in 1991. But town officials continued to deny his request, until they signed a court-supervised stipulated judgment in 1997, agreeing to relocate part of Rooster Tail Hollow Road and to approve the subdivisions.
But now, nearly three years later, the Planning Commission is still denying Mr. Gonthier's plans, this time because of questions over septic issues.
Planning Commission members declined to comment on the case because it is still pending.
"The entire Scenic Road Ordinance was adopted in New Milford to prevent me from developing that property as it was zoned," Mr. Gonthier said. "They're still trying to throw hurdles at me, despite the court judgment. So I'm suing the town again. My attorney just filed an appeal of the Planning Commission's last decision.
Mr. Gonthier had no problem winning approval for 10 lots he recently subdivided and developed on Stilson Hill Road.
Mr. Sienkiewicz said the case has cost the town close to $100,000 in legal fees and will cost at least an additional $500,000 for road design and construction fees.
The litigation led New Milford to revise its Scenic Road Ordinance in November so it no longer strictly prohibits changes on such roads, Mr. Sienkiewicz said.
The Scenic Road Ordinance was also at the center of a lawsuit in Newtown, only it was the residents living on the road who sued a developer.
The First Selectman, Herb Rosenthal, said that a developer had proposed a nine-lot subdivision on a triangle of land between three roads: Echo Valley, Tamarack and Sanford. But residents on Sanford Road -- the only designated scenic road in town since its ordinance was enacted in 1997 -- sued the developer last year because he had planned to widen the dirt lane from 10 feet to 30 feet and put five driveways onto the road.
Following a series of appeals, the road was left untouched. The subdivision, now in its final stages of construction, has been built with driveways going only onto Tamarack and Echo Valley Roads, with a cul-de-sac accommodating traffic on Tamarack.
Some opponents claim such regulations deny people their rights to develop their land to its full economic potential.
"It's hypocrisy, is what it is," said Thomas Pilla, a New Milford developer. These people have their houses on their scenic roads, but want to keep everybody else out. It's all about exclusivity. That's the travesty of it all.
Mr. Pilla called the proposal to establish a Scenic and Rural Country Road District bizarre and unfair. "People should have a right to develop their land the way its zoned," said the developer, who is building four new houses on Legion Road, which is also has a scenic designation.
"The way the Scenic Road Ordinance stands right now, it does absolutely nothing, at least on this road," said Renee Bradley of Stilson Hill Road. "These houses are going up so fast, you can't even keep track of them. The ordinance was supposed to protect the road from being widened, but Stilson Hill is twice as wide now than when we moved here 10 years ago."
Nancy Mascio of Stilson Hill said her front lawn and garden keep getting eaten away by the widening road. "I used to have a four-foot-deep strip of day lilies in front of the house, but they came and graded most of it away. One day, they're going to knock on my door and say, 'Excuse me, but we're just going to grade through your living room, okay?' "
For New Milford's Scenic and Rural Country Road District to be enacted, it must be approved by the town's Planning and Zoning commissions, which are considering it now, Mr. Hubbard said.
"At the end of this process," he said, "New Milford will have among the most, if not the most thoughtful regulations in the state, preserving our rural roads and invaluable New England charm."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
About Sam Shepard's Kitchen

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
WELCOME to Sam Shepard's designer kitchen in "Curse of the Starving Class."
It's where father (Weston) "passes out on the floor for three days, then disappears for a week." That's mother (Ella) talking. All she wants is to run away; that is not simply her want, it is her philosophy of life. "Everybody runs away," she says. 
 And she wants to do it alone, or with an Anyman who'll pay her way. Leave her son (Wesley) and younger daughter (Emma) to their own devices.
In a daze, Emma walks about carrying hand-painted charts on the correct way to cut up a frying chicken (visual aids for her demonstrations at the country fair). That's Emma's device -- for the moment. When she spreads those charts out on the kitchen floor, Wesley urinates on them.
Which certainly gets Emma out of her daze, just like the time she discovered that Ella took the last of the chickens she raised "from the incubator to the grave" and boiled it.
Wesley, ever the obliging brother, tells Emma that she should have put her name on that chicken, even though the fridge is otherwise and always empty -- "All it's good for is slamming" -- until Weston makes one of his periodic appearances and fills it all up with half-price artichokes. Ella, who calls him pathetic, takes them out and dumps them all over the floor.
In Mr. Shepard's kitchen the stove is grimy, the floor is a receptacle, not just for artichokes, and the table is a resting place, by turns for Weston and for Ella as well as a maggot-ridden slaughtered lamb.
It's no wonder Emma asks, "What kind of family is this?"
And that's way before she's been dragged through the mud by a horse (offstage), shoots a fortunately empty nightclub full of holes from horseback (assumedly another horse, also offstage) and is reported to have been indicted on many criminal charges, including "violation of equestrian regulations."
When Mr. Shepard wrote "Curse of the Starving Class" in 1976, his vision of the spiritual starvation of America and the American family imprisoned in smithereens on a farm, with land developers on the prowl, was an artist's cautionary take on the spreading cancer of consumerism.
Although Mr. Shepard has always been loathe to analyze his work, it's not without reason that the farm is near the freeway. But then one can easily fall into an academic trap, dissecting the playwright's wordplay, innuendos and their implications. Taylor, a lawyer, talks about the marvelous location of the land, about investing in the future of America.
But bear in mind that Mr. Shepard himself remarked, some 20 years ago, that he had no "idea about how to shape an action," so that "the so-called originality of my early work just comes from ignorance."
Now that Mr. Shepard's theatrical techniques are nothing new, and his economic and psychological foretellings are shrugged off by numbed realists, the play's effect is more depressing than prophetic.
"Buried Child," "True West" (the latter now in previews for a Broadway opening on March 2) and "Curse of the Starving Class" are a family trilogy, sort of. The three, with "Fool for Love" (recently revived at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J.), are among the more coherent works by Mr. Shepard.
Only its rock underscoring, at once filmic, integral to the action as well as a commentary upon it, communicates what comes close to a Shepard style. The music, composed and arranged by Steve Bargonetti and Diane Gioia, is played on guitar by Mr. Bargonetti and it is not just a series of riffs. Sometimes, an actor stops or cues the musician to telling effect; when Weston goes to sleep on the kitchen table, the guitar segues into an eerie, dissonant lullabye.
But where's the fun?
Mr. Shepard's loony family occupies a funhouse quite as much as it is ready for a nuthouse. But the director, Jim Simpson, appears to be taking it all too seriously, and the cast too literally. Such idiosyncratic actresses as Olympia Dukakis and Kathy Bates have played Ellas, neither so straightforwardly as Kristine Nielsen who appears resigned to futility all at once, with nowhere for her performance to land.
The other actors are variously in limbo, though Guy Boyd (Weston) reaches an iota of pathos, folding laundry and filling the fridge with real food, in his vain attempts at cleansing and rebirth. It is too late for him, for them all.
An impotent performance of a play that was once prophetic suggests, damagingly, the hopelesness of making a socially essential statement. Is it too late for us all? If a playwright ahead of his time comes off as a voice in the wilderness, why should anyone listen?
"Curse of the Starving Class," Yale Repertory Theater, 1120 Chapel Street, New Haven. (203) 432-1234. Performances through Saturday.

HEADLINE: For 1930's Behemoth, a New Upscale Life

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
TALK about turning the Queen Mary on a dime. The Starrett-Lehigh Building, a leviathan from the 1930's whose titanic proportions rival the ocean liners that once berthed nearby, is rapidly being transformed from a somnolent, $6-a-square-foot industrial loft and warehouse into a home for the likes of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Hugo Boss Fashions and ScreamingMedia, which are paying rents in the $20's and $30's for bare-bones space with drop-dead views.
It is a measure of the superheated market and the growing allure of Chelsea and the far West Village that such an unlikely structure at such a remote location, 26th Street and 11th Avenue, should be considered the building of the moment. 
 For older tenants, the change has been just as wrenching and surprising as one might expect when a 652-foot-long vessel displacing 26 million cubic feet suddenly shifts course 180 degrees.
Industrial and arts-related businesses whose rents are far below market rates -- including Day for Night, the photo studio that helped put Starrett-Lehigh on the fashion map -- have found themselves moved around the building or bought out of their leases as the landlords consolidate vast tracts of floor area for new arrivals. Some tenants have charged the owners with harassing tactics, alleging that they were denied electricity or elevator service. Lawsuits have been flying back and forth.
For their part, the owners said that no services had been denied to bona fide tenants who paid their rent and abided by building rules and regulations. "Clearly our goal is to get higher-paying tenants," said Mark Karasick, one of the owners. "But anybody who has a lease which is in full force and effect is entitled to all the rights and services that lease provides."
There is no doubt that life at Starrett-Lehigh is more taxing for everyone than it used to be, at least in the short run. Four passenger elevators are not nearly enough to serve the burgeoning population in a 19-story building with 1.8 million square feet of space, so the decrepit little lobby is jammed with crowds. The owners are adding four elevators, beginning in May, and that will help. But two of those new cars are replacing a jumbo freight elevator, meaning that deliveries take more time.
Yet there is undeniably a buzz in the air as the long-neglected landmark -- a memorable sight on the West Side waterfront with its undulating bands of ribbon windows and red brick -- is resuscitated by a team including Harry Skydell, who renovated the Puck Building at Lafayette and Houston Streets and Christodora House on Tompkins Square Park in the 1980's.
The owners say they are spending about $20 million to upgrade Starrett-Lehigh, which they bought for $152 million in 1998. The architect Ludwig Michael Goldsmith has designed a new facade for an expanded lobby. As many as nine new cooling units will be added on the rooftop. Louvers are to be installed in window bays throughout the building to accommodate extra air-conditioning and ventilation.
No amount of renovation, however, not even the 50-by-17-foot wall of etched glass in the new lobby, designed by Maria Hellerstein and Nikolai Katz, will change the raw-edged quality of Starrett-Lehigh, nor will it erase overnight the legacy of years of neglect under the ownership of Helmsley-Spear, like leaky pipes and drafty windows.
None of this discouraged Ms. Stewart. "She understood, with that incredible laser vision she has, that this was the office space of the new economy," said Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairwoman of Insignia/ESG, who negotiated the 150,000-square-foot, 10-year deal on behalf of Martha Stewart, along with Andrew P. Sachs and Gregory A. Tosko.
Initially, the brokers were put off by the building's grittiness, Ms. Tighe admitted. "The point we were missing was that it was precisely its industrial character that was part of its attraction to creative industries," she said. "It took Martha to say, 'Wow, I can bring my truck up in the elevator.' It was mine to say, 'This is a good idea?' "
"It was not only a good idea," Ms. Tighe said. "It was a fabulous idea."
The Architectural Forum magazine thought so in 1931, when it described Starrett-Lehigh as a "vertical industrial thoroughfare" in which every floor is a ground floor because trucks could be driven from the street right into the freight elevators and hoisted directly upstairs to specially depressed loading pits in which their tail boards aligned with the floor level.
Starrett-Lehigh was a joint venture of the Starrett Investing Corporation and the Lehigh Valley Railroad, whose open-air freight rail yard occupied the block between 11th and 12th Avenues, 26th and 27th Streets.
IN 1930, Starrett made a deal with Lehigh to construct an enormous warehouse and factory on the yard, reserving most of the ground floor for the railroad's use.
The structure was built by Starrett Brothers & Eken, founded by Paul and William A. Starrett, which was simultaneously at work on the Empire State Building, the McGraw-Hill Building and 40 Wall Street. The architects of Starrett-Lehigh were Russell G. and Walter M. Cory, with Yasuo Matsui.
One of the greatest challenges the architects faced was to bring daylight as deep as possible into the massive structure, where floors are up to three acres in extent.
Their solution yielded the building's most distinctive aesthetic feature: sinuous ribbons of steel casement windows that wrap around the curved corners, unbroken by columns. This curtain wall was made possible by cantilevering the facade from within, where mushroom-topped concrete columns vaguely recall the inverted bell capitals of Egyptian architecture.
Recognized immediately as a masterpiece, Starrett-Lehigh was included in the Museum of Modern Art's influential 1932 exhibition on the emerging International style of modern architecture. And it was photographed by Berenice Abbott.
Starrett-Lehigh was designated a landmark in 1982. A year later, rounded corners and ribbon windows turned up on the Saatchi & Saatchi building at Hudson and Houston Streets. "It was truly inspired by Starrett-Lehigh," one of the architects, Lee Harris Pomeroy, recalled.
As an economic model, however, Starrett-Lehigh was less successful. The Port Authority's Inland Freight Terminal at 111 Eighth Avenue, between 15th and 16th Streets, could offer rates that undercut the Starretts. (Owned by Taconic Investment Partners, it too now caters to telecommunications and office tenants.)
The Starrett Corporation, which still exists, sold its interest in the namesake building in 1932. The Lehigh Valley tracks were torn out in 1966, though the pattern they formed can still be traced in the odd plan of the ground floor. The railroad itself was absorbed into Conrail in 1976.
Starrett-Lehigh maintained its industrial character during many years of ownership by Helmsley-Spear. One of the last old-line businesses to arrive was Pollack Graphics, a printing, jobbing, graphic design and office supply concern. It signed a lease in 1992 for 1,400 square feet at $6 a square foot.
At that time, Starrett-Lehigh was still a manufacturers' building, said Glenn Pollack, president of Pollack Graphics. In fact, one of his larger vendors, Dovelin Printing, was in the building, as it had been since 1946.
By the mid-1990's, arts-related tenants were claiming their niche.
Barbara Moore moved Bound and Unbound, a book dealership specializing in avant-garde art, into Starrett-Lehigh three and a half years ago, after a sculptor in the building told her: "They're dying to have people there. They can't give space away."
Ms. Moore combined forces with the artist Larry Miller and another book dealer, Jan van der Donk, to lease 5,000 square feet on the 12th floor for $7 a square foot. "It's a very collegial group here," she said.
Down the hall is Leslie Tonkonow Artworks + Projects, a gallery that arrived in 1997. "At the time, 26th Street was hooker paradise," Leslie Tonkonow said. "It was really unpleasant around here but I fell absolutely in love with this building."
When Posters Please, dealers in antique posters, moved into an 8,500-square-foot space in 1997, the only other big tenant on the 13th floor was a hospital supply depot. "No one came up here," recalled Terry Shargel, vice president of Posters Please.
Not that Starrett-Lehigh was entirely empty. "There were, until recently, virtual shantytowns in the building, people living in the stairwells by the dozens," said Andrew Bordwin, an artist and photographer who moved in 1997 into 1,000 square feet of sublet space, at $12 a square foot.
"The vast, Soviet city-state scale of the place brings with it all sorts of peripheral habitation," he said.
Bob Weinstein, the founder and president of Concrete Brand Imaging Group, said the building felt "very much like a war zone or the set of the movie 'Brazil' " when his company arrived in the summer of 1998, in one of the last deals done at Starrett-Lehigh before Leona Helmsley put it on the block.
Concrete, which develops brand identity programs for fashion companies, took a $25-a-square-foot sublease from the enormous Day for Night photo studio on the 18th floor.
In June 1998, a group of investors headed by David Werner and Mr. Karasick, and financed by Credit Suisse First Boston, won the bidding for the property. Mr. Skydell was brought aboard as a development consultant, followed by Rob Kurtz and Peter Thorsen as leasing and managing agents.
At the time, Starrett-Lehigh was 40 percent vacant and losing money.
"Most everybody thought we were crazy, especially when they heard we didn't have a prime tenant before we bought it," Mr. Kurtz said. "It's literally been on a wing and a prayer. A lot of prayer."
Their prayers were answered with the arrival in January 1999 of Network Plus Corporation, a telecommunications carrier based in Quincy, Mass. Having started at 37,000 square feet on the fourth floor, the Network Plus data center has already grown to 90,000 square feet. Williams Communications has taken 150,000 square feet for its electronic switching equipment and HarvardNet, another telecommunications company, has taken 70,000.
ALL of this equipment must be cooled and ventilated. And that means exterior louvers are needed. The Landmarks Preservation Commission has approved a plan that would allow the replacement of up to 25 percent of the windows above the eighth floor and 30 percent of the windows below that.
"We worked out this formula to achieve a balance so the building would not be overwhelmed by louvers," said Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the commission.
Louvers must be recessed behind the steel window sash, preserving the rhythm of the 20-pane frames. No more than three contiguous window bays may be taken for louvers in any given location. No louvers are allowed on the curved corners.
In any event, Mr. Kurtz said, telecommunication companies will not predominate. "We could have filled the building with telcos," he said. "But that wasn't the dream. The real dream was a coming together of media, art and technology."
Those deals began happening early last year. Met Merchandising Concepts of Chicago took 6,000 square feet on the 15th floor, including a terrace, for its New York showroom. The company designs and manufactures retail installations within larger stores for Tommy Hilfiger, Liz Claiborne, Benetton and the like.
Then came ScreamingMedia, headed by Jay Chiat, founder of the Chiat/Day advertising agency. It signed a lease in March 1999 for 10,000 square feet on the 13th floor. The company, which provides editorial content for Web sites, has since expanded its space needs to more than 40,000 square feet.
The arrival of these tenants seems to dispel the notion that Starrett-Lehigh's fatal flaw is its location, almost three-quarters of a mile from the nearest subway stop. (That's like getting off at Times Square to go to Carnegie Hall; not impossible, but not exactly convenient.) The building operates rush-hour shuttle vans to and from Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal. There is a 300-space garage on the second floor. And cabbies, ever alert for opportunity, now line up on 11th Avenue.
Michael Ippolito, senior managing director of Newmark & Company, who brokered the Hugo Boss and ScreamingMedia deals, discerns a sociological trend, too. "People are spending so many hours in their offices that the quality of the space and the working environment is more important than the general location," he said.
All told, the amount of space under lease at Starrett-Lehigh has increased in the last 14 months from 60 percent to 85 percent, Mr. Kurtz said, and would grow to 95 percent with the completion of three pending deals.
It was the Martha Stewart deal, however, that riveted outside attention.
"The fact that they were interested in the building confirmed our own idea that it was a place where well-known companies could exist," said Marty Staff, president and chief executive of Hugo Boss Fashions.
Hugo Boss is now in Olympic Tower at Fifth Avenue and 51st Street, surroundings that are a bit more opulent and staid than the image it wants to project. It certainly did not hurt, Mr. Staff added, that the company would double its space, get an ample terrace -- and actually reduce its rent by about 20 percent in the bargain. It will occupy 40,000 square feet on the eighth floor, beginning in June, with 65 employees.
About three months later, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia will begin moving in upstairs. Its presence in Starrett-Lehigh goes back several years, since the company used the Day for Night studio not only for photo shoots but for its 1998 holiday party, which attracted about 600 people. "That's how that space stuck in Martha's mind," said Peter Mark, executive vice president for corporate infrastructure development.
The company, of which Ms. Stewart is chairwoman and chief executive, publishes Martha Stewart Living and Martha Stewart Weddings magazines and produces the "Martha Stewart Living" television show and "askMartha" radio show, as well as a syndicated newspaper column, mail-order catalog, online merchandising and Web site (www.marthastewart.com).
The company discussed a broad range of possibilities, from simply consolidating its photo studios at Starrett-Lehigh to moving the entire operation, headquarters and all, from 11 West 42nd Street.
In the end, it settled on moving its studios, and its retail, catalog and online merchandising divisions. The company expects to begin occupying the space this fall and will eventually have up to 350 employees and contributors at Starrett-Lehigh.
The studios will handle photography and digital imaging and include a test kitchen and a kitchen in which food can be photographed, a set construction shop, prop library and flower preparation room.
The architectural centerpiece of the space is a double-height clerestory not unlike the nave of a church, reaching skyward and flanked by column-filled aisles. Almost any spot on the floor commands a panoramic view that runs from the Statue of Liberty to the George Washington Bridge.
"The radical thing we're doing is trying to preserve the essence of that space as you see it," said Daniel Rowen, the architect for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. "We are going to make sure that the generosity of light and views is not encumbered."
Mr. Mark said the company sees its operation in Starrett-Lehigh as an extension of the building's utilitarian spirit. "The product is no longer sheet metal," he said. "It's editorial and Web content."
EIGHT or nine tenants have been relocated to make way for Martha Stewart. One tenant, Chelsea Moving and Storage, has thus far refused to move. But the others, mostly printers and bookbinders, are gone.
Mr. Pollack watched as Dovelin Printing, faced with a quadrupling rent, left the building. And he has been told that new leases on his floor run from $24 to $30 a square foot. But he also finds that new tenants are new customers. "We're doing so much business in the building that I may have to stay here, even at $24 a square foot," Mr. Pollack said. "I may have no choice."
Concrete Brand Imaging seems bound to lose its space since Day for Night is out, after a legal battle over the how the space was used. The new owners have refused to accept the studio's subtenants.
Leslie Tonkonow will be gone in November, when her sublease expires. "It's an amazing building and I wish I had a longer lease," she said. Though elevator overcrowding has discouraged gallery-goers, she said, young dot-com employees stop by to visit. "I've had really stimulating conversations," she said. And with more people around, she added, security is less of a concern than it used to be.
With seven years to go on their leases, Ms. Shargel of Posters Please and Ms. Moore of Bound and Unbound can afford to marvel at the rapidly changing scene.
"There's a huge energy," Ms. Shargel said. "Everyone is in black and looks like they're 12 years old." She sees caterers' carts rolling out of the elevators, headed for fashion photo sessions, laden with "gorgeous strawberries and kiwis and whatever else it is that models eat."
The transformation, Ms. Moore said, is "going at 10 times the speed of SoHo."
As happened in that neighborhood, the second-wave settlers at Starrett-Lehigh -- the ones between the factories and fashionistas -- are feeling squeezed by the very forces of attraction, gentrification and colonization they helped unleash.
"The ones who made it look appealing are the ones being forced, in different ways, to vacate," said Mr. Weinstein, of Concrete Brand Imaging. "I really feel the spirit is leaving. I moved here because it was edgy. I'm not sure how edgy it is now."

He's Looked at Life From Both Sides Now

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
SPENDING half your life among the dead teaches you something about living.
So it has been for Randy Niederer, superintendent for almost 30 years of the Riverview Cemetery, one of the state's oldest and most beautiful resting places, a 40-acre Victorian Garden-style park incorporated here in 1858 on the banks of the Delaware River. 
 "I frequently think of death and dying and my own mortality, and I believe I've been liberated by it," said Mr. Niederer, an amiable man of 53 whose duties include selling burial plots, supervising employees, managing the grounds and overseeing burials.
"About 20 years ago I made up my mind and convinced my wife that there is no point in waiting for retirement to do those things we want to do and go to those places we want to visit and see," he said. "I believe we should make the most of our lives while we have our health and while we can do it."
But on this cold day, when the trees stand gaunt against a February sky over smudgy remnants of snow, Mr. Niederer's heart is light.
He has glimpsed immortality. He and his wife, Deborah, have just returned from a week in Los Angeles, where they saw their first grandchild, Savannah Rose, born on Jan. 19 to their eldest child, Tara Shaw, thus taking their bloodline into the 21st century. They also have a son, Justin, who is a captain in the Air Force, and another daughter, Katherine, who is a freshman at Pepperdine University in California.
"What was really interesting was that her appearance was so similar to her mother's when she was born," he said. "It was just like reliving a moment of our lives."
While he is talking, he is wandering among the 27,000 tombstones, monuments and statues, each representing a life lived.
What causes a person to choose one path over another? Certainly Randy Niederer, descendant of farmers, student of agribusiness, had no intention of becoming a cemetery superintendent.
Born March 20, 1946, he grew up on a farm in Titusville that is now part of Washington Crossing State Park. His father, Herbert, was a farmer, as was Herbert's father, Otto.
"I never really had a date until I was 17 years old, because I was on the tractor all the time," Mr. Niederer said, recalling what life was like after school and on weekends.
He planned to study agriculture at Cook College of Rutgers University, but a mistake by the testing service -- which delayed his College Board scores from getting to the university -- sent him instead to North Carolina State University, where he studied agricultural economics.
Mr. Niederer's grandfather created an egg grader that sorted eggs by size, and he built a business around it, Otto Niederer Sons Inc. On graduating from college in 1968 and marrying Deborah, his childhood sweetheart, Mr. Niederer fully expected to join the family business. But there were already many relatives on the payroll and an uncle who was chief executive stunned him with the news that there was no job for him.
Mr. Niederer spent a year working for a bank and another at an engineering company, but he realized he had no future in either field.
One day, his oldest brother's father-in-law, a director of Riverview Cemetery, advised him to look for a classified advertisement in The Trenton Times that turned out to be for superintendent at Riverview. Despite a lack of experience, he got the job.
"Quite frankly, nobody else applied for the job," he said. "I didn't hear that right away. Of course, when we were negotiating I was told there were many fellows who wanted the job."
At 25, he was the youngest cemetery superintendent of a dozen in the Trenton area.
"The cemetery business is not glamorous, and in fact, until I became used to all of the jokes and the side remarks," he said, "it embarrassed me to tell people where I worked."
In 1971, when he took over the cemetery, graves were still being dug by hand, and he immediately began to buy equipment, including a backhoe, which he had to learn to use himself because no one else could or would. "For the first five or six years," he said, "I opened all the graves."
The current cemetery laws, which were passed in 1971, increased the amount of paperwork. Where he once spent 90 percent of his time working on the grounds, Mr. Niederer today spends 90 percent of his time in the office.
As the cemetery has filled, there have been fewer burials (650 in 1950, 180 in 1971 and 52 last year) and fewer employees (three full-time gravediggers and more than a dozen summer workers in 1971 to two full-timers and three seasonal employees now).
Plots in the older cemeteries are becoming more scarce. A percentage of every plot sale is put into trust funds.
"The older the cemetery is, the greater is the reliance on the trust income to operate it," said Mr. Niederer, who also administers the nine-acre Harbourton Cemetery in Hopewell Township, which Riverview assumed in 1986. "So theoretically, a cemetery -- if it has been healthy and viable-- eventually will sell all of its property, will have no more interments and must rely on the money that has been set aside in trust funds to generate income to maintain it."
Charles D. Webster IV, a former Trenton historian who gives tours of Riverview, said Mr. Niederer took pride in keeping the cemetery pristine "like it's his back yard." Mr. Webster added: "He combs the cemetery every day. You run into him walking the paths or riding his bicycle, inspecting to make sure it is just right."
A major part of his job is helping -- and consoling -- people who have lost loved ones. Often they are angry over the death and find things at the cemetery to complain about.
Edie Spalding of nearby Yardley, Pa., who was visiting the grave of her husband, Carl, on this day, stops into the office to say hello. She recalls showing up in tears to buy a plot for her ill husband two years ago. Mr. Niederer was kindly and patient, she says. Later, she complained about how the stone was placed. He was willing to move it. And as she continued to grieve, he assured her the pain would ease with time.
"He's a very warm and caring person, which you don't necessarily expect to find when you do this kind of thing," Ms. Spalding said.
Mr. Webster saids: "Death is so final and he makes it not so final. He makes people understand, 'Your relatives may be dead, but we're here to take care of their graves and we're going to make sure this stays a beautiful place to honor your loved ones.' And he strives to make that happen."
Of the job he once was too embarrassed to discuss, Mr. Niederer said: "I enjoy it immensely, more now than when I started. I felt I should be more ambitious and go after a job with more potential. But that was a long time ago. We look at life differently when we're young."
"I like the people who I've met," he added. "And I like helping people work through the problems they have with the death of the people they love. It's obvious when they need help and want someone to listen to them."
Mr. Niederer, who is a member of the First Brethren Church in Sergeantsville, believes in an afterlife.
"I am a Christian and I believe there is existence after death," he said. "And I also believe that our body is too complicated to have happened out of mere chance; the world is too beautiful to have been left to that same chance, and there is a purpose to life."
Despite his faith, is he afraid of death?
"I still don't like the idea," he said with a slight chuckle. But, he adds, "Dying is as natural as being born. And it's the pattern of life."
 
A Celebrated Past, but Not Much of a Future
TRENTON'S largest outdoor museum" is how Riverview Cemetery is described by Charles D. Webster IV, who was the city's official historian for eight years.
"It's one of the most historically significant sites in New Jersey," said Mr. Webster, 37, a news anchor for WZBN-TV25, who gives tours of the 40-acre "Victorian garden of stone" that was designed in the 1870's by Calvert Vaux, the landscape architect who with Frederick Law Olmsted created Central Park.
Believed to be built on an ancient Indian burial ground, it dates as a cemetery to 1685 when it began serving as a Quaker graveyard for the Society of Friends. In 1858, Riverview Cemetery incorporated and bought the Quaker gravesite as its first section.
Several well-known figures are buried here, most notably John A. Roebling, the engineer who designed the Brooklyn Bridge, and George B. McClellan, the Union army commander in the Civil War who fell out of favor with President Lincoln, challenged him for the presidency in 1864 and lost, later to became governor of New Jersey.
Buried here too is William Lewis Dayton, the first Republican vice presidential candidate who defeated Lincoln for the position in 1856 but lost the presidential nomination to him in 1860.
Also here are Walter Scott Lenox, the founder of Lenox China; John Taylor, founder of Taylor Provisions Company, which gave the world Taylor Ham and numerous others whose stones tell their stories.
For instance, a memorial to Washington Roebling II, the grandson of John A. Roebling and creator of the Mercer automobile, appears on the gravestone of his father, Charles G., and reads: "March 25, 1881. Perished and lost at sea on the steamship Titanic. April 15, 1912."
Carved in another gravestone, Mr. Webster said, is a letter from a wife to her husband who died during a trip to Baltimore, in which she laments not having had a chance to see him one last time.
Why do these things have the power to fascinate?
"I believe it's our own mortality," said Randy Niederer, the superintendent of Riverview Cemetery. "We have no idea what is beyond the grave, and I believe we like to speculate about people who lived before. And we really don't believe we're going to end up where they have."

Signs of Life Stir in Trenton

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
From the Trenton Convention and Visitors Bureau, Sally Lane can see the parking lot that is supposed to turn into a Marriott and make her job easier. And recently signs appeared there warning of a street closing, the first move on the ground toward the first hotel that Trenton has had since 1985.
"I've always understood why there's a market for a hotel here," Ms. Lane, the bureau's director, said. "I get the calls." 
 And while waiting for the financing to firm up, she has been feeling pressed by some good news: a wave of visitors.
This year, the city expects more than a million, largely because of two new, long-awaited and expensive entertainment anchors. The restored Trenton War Memorial, which opened in March, had ticket sales of 85,000 for its theater in 1999, with thousands more at other events there, and managers estimate that the numbers will double this year. The Sovereign Bank Arena, which opened in October as home to minor-league hockey and basketball teams, is expected to have combined attendance of about 600,000.
These are not numbers that would impress most state capitals. But the signs of life have amazed a city of 88,000 that was happy to land a McDonald's and still doesn't have a movie theater or a bookstore.
In concert with Trenton's thriving baseball stadium, the new attractions have led restaurants to open, brought in suburbanites after dark and generated traffic jams that boosters only dreamed of a year ago.
David Schure, the executive director of the Trenton Downtown Association, said, "We've even had the Gap looking" for space in the city -- space that Mr. Schure is so intent on filling that he gives prospective entrepreneurs tours in his own car.
A few years ago the association would go for months without a single inquiry, Mr. Schure said, "but now, between the arena and the hotel, people are looking at properties all around."
The revival has warmed Chambersburg, the Italian neighborhood near the arena that had clung to life with a handful of popular restaurants. Now, "on any given weekend night when you drive through downtown to get to Chambersburg, you go right past the arena and there are people coming from all around," Mr. Schure said.
Across South Broad Street, the Urban Word Cafe, which opened in the bleak months before the arena was finished, is jammed on weekend nights. Another restaurant, the South Bank, opened in December.
Alan Meinster, owner of Marsilio's restaurant in Chambersburg, said that after a 16 percent increase in business last year, he was moved to write to Mercer County Executive Robert Prunetti to thank him "for creating such a great opportunity."
It was Mr. Prunetti who set out to arrange county financing for the arena, built for $50 million in an industrial complex already under redevelopment. Mr. Prunetti said last week that he was talking to developers who were suddenly interested in neighboring property and that he expected major deals within six months.
Mr. Prunetti was also a godfather of Mercer County Waterfront Park, home of Trenton's minor-league baseball team, the Thunder. The stadium almost immediately drew capacity crowds when it opened in 1994, and last year had attendance of 440,000.
Trenton, it seemed, could be a destination, and the park would become one point of a triangle in a new tourism economy. The second point was the arena and the third was a Marriott hotel and conference center next to the War Memorial.
In three months last year the arena's attendance was about 200,000, the general manager, Scott R. Sloman, said. Mr. Sloman said promoters had drawn some hugely successful events: Tickets for a Shania Twain concert were gone in 90 minutes, he said, and a World Wrestling Federation event sold out in 42 minutes.
The War Memorial has had a rougher start, enough that the state, which owns the building and spent $35 million restoring it, is negotiating a transfer of some operations to Marriott. Still, traffic backs up for performances by the Greater Trenton Symphony Orchestra and the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, and with banquets, meetings and the like, attendance is expected to exceed 200,000 this year.
All the while, Mayor Douglas H. Palmer has spent much of his three terms in pursuit of financing for the hotel. His vision was not just to replace the Holiday Inn that closed 15 years ago but to build a first-class hotel and conference center to compete with those outside the city on Route 1.
The city created a nonprofit corporation to oversee the development, which has a Michigan-based developer and contractors lined up for the 199-room hotel that Marriott International has agreed to manage. The excruciating part was arranging financing for the $46 million project, pieced together with funds from the state and city and $31 million from bonds.
Last week, the preliminary offering statement was distributed, and several members of the development board said they expected a sale this week. Ms. Lane, meanwhile, hears from travel agents trying to find rooms here, mostly for clients who do business with the state but also from tourists. "They look on Web sites and nothing comes up under Trenton," Ms. Lane said. "They don't understand it."

A City Always Reinventing Itself

 BODY:
HERE are two sociological looks at New York City. One examines how political and cultural forces have influenced the development of the Lower East Side; the other is a sober explanation of how and why New York City became a place of continuous rebuilding. In O. Henry's succinct phrase, "It'll be a great place if they ever finish it."
 
SELLING THE LOWER EAST SIDE: CULTURE, REAL ESTATE AND RESISTANCE IN NEW YORK CITY
By Christopher Mele
University of Minnesota Press
(Hardcover, $49.95; Paperback, $19.95) 
 The burgeoning East Village art scene of the 1980's invented new forms of cultural and economic linkages between the avant-garde and urban space. Artist and contributing editor of "Art in America" Walter Robinson claimed that the East Village art scene was "about making an 'art movement' seem more real by anchoring it to a concrete physical area." The commercial art scene that developed in the East Village was short-lived, lasting roughly from 1980 to 1984. In the late 1970's, the East Village's profusion of underground subcultures offered an environment where artists could exhibit work that was experimental, untried, and, consequently, ill suited for the established corporate art market centered uptown in SoHo. The first galleries were makeshift exhibition spaces started by artists or their friends in apartments and eventually in storefronts. By 1984, however, the East Village art scene was fully entrenched within the workings of the New York art world with over seventy commercial galleries located in the space of fourteen blocks.
 
THE CREATIVE DESTRUCTION OF MANHATTAN, 1900-1940
By Max Page
University of Chicago Press
(Hardcover, $27.50)
During his brief return in 1904 from self-imposed exile in Europe, Henry James played an eloquent variation on a powerful theme about New York: The city is "crowned not only with no history, but with no credible possibility of time for history." New York is, always has been, and always will be, wrote James, a "provisional city," defined by a "dreadful chill of change." From the time of nineteenth-century New York's great diarist, Philip Hone, who first declared New York's favorite maxim to be "overturn, overturn, overturn!" to today's Luc Sante and his biting critique that in New York the "past has no truck," New York has lived up to its cliche. It is a city where the physical remnants of early generations are repeatedly and apparently inevitably visited by the wrecking ball.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD;
In Brazil, Investing For the Good of Nature

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
SEATED in his office in a gaudy new skyscraper here, wearing a tailored suit and cuff links, John Michael Forgach seems every bit the conventional investment banker. Then he starts talking about babassu coconuts.
Mr. Forgach beams as he describes the exotic projects in which he invests: a sustainable timber operation in the rain forest, a plantation producing carbon filters from coconut husks, a company with a plan to export acai, the protein-rich purple Amazonian fruit. 
 "We're not really into stocks and bonds here," said Mr. Forgach, the managing partner of Banco Axial, a three-year-old investment bank. "We're into profiting from the idea that the world would like to consume the 59 other types of potato that are not on the McDonald's menu."
With Mr. Forgach, 51, at its helm, Axial is at the forefront of biodiversity investing, a trend that began with "socially conscious" investors in the United States and Europe over the last 20 years. Unlike most of the field, though, Banco Axial fits the same description as its investments: it is a home-grown product of a developing country.
In fact, Axial is probably the leading example of how some Brazilians are harnessing market forces to help protect the country's environmental assets, especially its rain forests, from depredation. In short, these investors are backing projects that profit from preserving those assets.
Thanks to an adventurous culture inspired by Mr. Forgach at the bank, Axial's forays into far-flung parts of Latin America to seek out viable projects are gaining considerable attention. "There is really nothing like Axial around anywhere," said Bryan Husted, a professor of management at the Technological Institute of Advanced Studies in Monterrey, Mexico. "It's like they're putting the Indiana Jones into investing."
The analogy of the intrepid explorer is not all that far-fetched. Mr. Forgach hires young people fresh out of college or graduate school to scout projects, dispatching them on expeditions deep into rough terrain to study possible investments, like an organic soybean operation in eastern Bolivia. Sometimes he goes along on the trips, to size up a project's viability firsthand.
When the scouts, few of whom have banking or finance backgrounds, find something promising, Axial makes an equity investment. Typically, it risks around $1 million on behalf of the investors in its $15 million Terra Capital fund, including the Swiss government, the World Bank and other institutions and private investors.
"It's not enough to just like environmental issues," said Patricia Moles, 32, a Mexican who came to Axial as a fund manager after working as a consultant for environmental groups. "It's about balance sheets and taxes and educating people about equity."
AXIAL came to biodiversity investing by trial and error. The bank was the brainchild of Pierre Landolt, a Swiss billionaire who lives in Brazil. It was originally intended to focus on privatizations and mergers and acquisitions in Brazilian regions ignored by large investment banks, like Paraiba in the drought-prone northeast, where Mr. Landolt produces cheese in a demonstration project on his estate.
But many of its early deals proved unprofitable, and Axial lost money each year. So Mr. Forgach, who had previously worked for Chase Manhattan, sought to reposition Axial as a specialized money manager, investing its own capital and that of clients in what he calls "green things."
So far, most of Mr. Forgach's green things have been organic foods for export, a market with booming demand. In the United States, consumers bought $4.7 billion of organic food last year and sales are growing at 24 percent a year, compared with about 1 percent growth in conventional foods, according to the Organic Trade Association in Greenfield, Mass. More than half of Axial's investments have been in organic food companies, including a cranberry farm in Chile and a plantation in the Amazon producing hearts of palm.
But Axial has also found other kinds of environmentally benign enterprises in which to invest, like the timber and coconut-fiber projects and eco-tourism businesses in Ecuador and Brazil.
THE company's agility has a lot to do with Mr. Forgach's peripatetic history. Born to Hungarian parents in southern Brazil, he earned an undergraduate degree at Harvard before going into banking and, later, the oil business, working for the reclusive commodity trader Marc Rich in Switzerland.
After forming his own Geneva-based oil-trading outfit, a business that required him to travel extensively in Africa and Latin America, Mr. Forgach developed a passion for rare birds, amassing a personal collection of more than 200. He created an organization, the Hyazinthinus Foundation, to contribute to the protection of endangered tropical birds.
When the growing use of futures contracts began to squeeze margins in 1985, Mr. Forgach left the oil business and moved into money management. He returned to Brazil in 1995, initially intending to create a nonprofit organization to combat illegal trade in rare animals. Soon, though, he was approached by Mr. Landolt to run Axial. "I got to combine my banker and romantic ecology hats," Mr. Forgach said in English so faintly accented that its influences are hard to pin down.
His current challenge is to make Axial not just green but also profitable. He expects Terra Capital to show a small loss in its first full year -- figures are not available yet -- but annual returns of 20 to 30 percent in the next few years as investments start paying off. If successful, Axial plans to raise $300 million more to create similar funds specializing in sectors like food and timber.
But fresh investment opportunities may prove harder for Mr. Forgach's young scouts to find, since Axial's success in attracting capital has lured other entrants to biodiversity investing in Latin America. The playing field was virtually empty a couple of years ago, but there are now about eight funds seeking viable investments in environmentally benign enterprises in emerging markets, and more may be on the way.
"The use of venture capital to support ecologically sound businesses is growing fast," said Tammy Newmark, manager of the EcoEnterprises fund in Arlington, Va., which invests in eco-tourism and "alternative" agriculture.
Ms. Newmark's fund, created at the beginning of this year with $10 million in capital, much of it from the Nature Conservancy, focuses on projects undertaken by local environmental organizations in collaboration with the private sector, an area she says Axial neglects. "Axial is the big kid on the block compared to us," Ms. Newmark said.

An Online Matchmaker Of Athletes and Schools

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN; Laura Pedersen-Pietersen is a Manhattan author and public speaker. Her column profiling people whose work is their passion appears the third Sunday of each month.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
WHEN someone makes a big profit on Wall Street, traders like to say, "Don't confuse brains with a bull market." And when a corporate climber in most any field hits a home run, business friends are apt to attribute it to being in the right place at the right time.
But for Lisa Henderson, 37, founder of LevelEdge.com, an Internet service that matches young athletes with colleges and scholarships, it took nearly 20 years for her own lucky break on the high school playing fields to germinate into a hot business proposition. 
 That business -- solidly financed and widely praised, though still unproven -- demonstrates how well some entrepreneurs can reach back into their pasts for the Big Idea. For all the material rewards of success, venture capitalists say, it is business founders with a profound motivation to change the world, or at least a portion of it, who are the most successful. Ms. Henderson, considering herself lucky, wants to create such kismet for others.
Ms. Henderson's break came in 1980, when she was a high school senior of modest means in the small town of Pontoon, Ill., near St. Louis. Two girlfriends invited her to watch their preseason soccer tournament at Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Mo. When the team suddenly ran short of players, someone tossed Lisa a jersey and sent her onto the field. She scored two goals, prompting the coach to offer her a $2,000 scholarship.
That, however, was not enough money to send Ms. Henderson to college. So the coach set up tryouts on the basketball and softball teams, and she got offers of $4,000 more in sports scholarships. After selling her car, Ms. Henderson had enough money to enroll. In the next five years she earned a bachelor's degree in finance, an M.B.A. and the school's "athlete of the year" award.
Recruited directly out of college by Ralston-Purina as a marketing research analyst, she spent five years working her way up to brand manager and introducing products from the company's headquarters in St. Louis. In 1992, she moved to San Francisco to run the Mexico operation of Del Monte; a year later, she became an executive vice president at Specialty Brands, which sells spices and food ingredients.
In 1997, Ms. Henderson made the leap to technology, joining the software developer Autodesk as head of its consumer products division. Seeing firsthand how the Internet could break down economic and geographic barriers, she began thinking about going into business for herself.
She often talked to friends and colleagues about young people who were not able to fulfill their potential because of where or how they had grown up. "Kids like me are invisible," she said. "And we're forced to rely on luck as a means of getting a good education."
So in 1998, Ms. Henderson wrote a business plan for LevelEdge, a start-up that would use computer technology to match promising high school and junior college athletes with four-year colleges and universities. The company is intended as an alternative to the unseemly practices that Ms. Henderson and others feel are widely prevalent in the college athlete recruiting process. Instead, LevelEdge is a clearinghouse, allowing its subscribers to get a broad view of prospective graduates and promising athletes without an intermediary who might take advantage of unsuspecting families.
Living in the shadow of Silicon Valley, Ms. Henderson didn't need long to round up $2.7 million in seed capital and recruit such high-visibility investors as the retired tennis champion Billie Jean King, who has since become co-chairman. "LevelEdge shares my vision of providing equal opportunities across the board for athletes," Ms. King said in an interview. "I came up through the public parks system, not the country club, and it's much tougher if you're not part of a highly visible program."
The service has also attracted support from coaches. "I will subscribe to LevelEdge because it will allow me to find talent that may have otherwise been unknown to me," said Scott Thompson, the men's basketball coach at Cornell University.
Ms. Henderson wants to raise the visibility of all student athletes. "Everyone knows the top 50 players for each position," she said. "Only there are 21 million high school students, and 33 percent play sports."
While most students and parents know how to fill out college applications, she added, not many understand the complicated sports recruitment process. Students who participate in LevelEdge need file only one profile of academic, athletic and personal information for posting on the site. They can also request that it be sent by e-mail to specific coaches.
The matching service will be free to students and parents. The plan calls for financing through subscription fees from schools that use the site for recruiting, and through advertising from companies offering athletic goods and services.
The site's database of potential basketball recruits will be unveiled next month at the National Collegiate Athletic Association during the men's and women's Final Four basketball tournaments.
"We're very excited about LevelEdge because it removes economic and geographic barriers for athletes," said Beth Bass, executive director of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association. "A student doesn't have to pay to travel to an elite camp in order to be seen by coaches." After the basketball rollout, Ms. Henderson plans to extend LevelEdge to 20 other sports.
Last month, Ms. Henderson was one of 27 chief executives of start-ups chosen from 350 applicants to present business propositions to several hundred potential investors at Springboard 2000, a venture capital forum for women entrepreneurs. The fair, in Silicon Valley, was championed by Kay Koplovitch, chairwoman of the National Women's Business Council, a government advisory panel. There, Ms. Henderson lined up her next round of capitalization -- $10 million from a group of backers. (The fair, by the way, proved such a success that three more are scheduled this year, for Washington, New York and Boston.)
Aside from building a thriving business, Ms. Henderson has three other goals. First, she hopes not to receive any more heartbreaking phone calls from low-income parents who have handed over big up-front fees to freelance "recruiters" of dubious reputation. Second, she eagerly awaits the first e-mail message from a student who has found a scholarship through LevelEdge, resulting in opportunities like the ones Ms. Henderson had.
And, finally, she hopes not to be called a "former athlete." In a match last week, she scored two of the three goals for her local indoor soccer team.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Net's Rise Keeps a Lid On Prices, For Now

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago, I went shopping for a 32-inch television set. I visited a couple of local electronics superstores, read Consumer Reports, talked to friends. And I searched the Internet, where I found just the highly rated, feature-laden model I wanted, for $750, shipping included. No tax.
The salesman at Circuit City was willing to match the price, but with the sales tax it would still cost me more. So I bought the TV set from an e-commerce site called 800.com. It arrived recently and works perfectly. 
 This was a great deal for me. And by making it, I participated in a grand experiment that is helping to hold down inflation while sustaining the booming economy. Too bad it can't last.
Let me explain. There are several big reasons why the American economy has managed in recent years to defy the rule of thumb that strong growth and low unemployment inevitably lead the general level of prices up an accelerating escalator. Perhaps the most crucial factor lately has been fierce competition from Internet shopping sites willing to sell goods at a loss in order to lure customers from traditional retailers.
While comparatively few people actually buy much yet online, the cut-rate prices widely available in the virtual economy have forced many companies operating in the bricks-and-mortar world to respond by keeping their prices low, too.
As Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis, recently noted in just one example among many: "Many people check toy prices on the Internet and ask toy stores to match them. Or they see the merchandise at a store and go home and buy it for less on the Internet."
This is heaven for consumers. While the general price level for all goods and services has been rising for the last few years at what is still a very modest 2 percent or so, prices in many of the most competitive arenas are actually down. The price index for toys, as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has been falling since 1995. Books, on average, cost less today than in 1997. Prices for audio and video equipment, which just joined the e-commerce rush, dipped last year by 0.38 percent.
BUT it is hell for retailers. Despite the benefit of a sales tax exemption, e-commerce companies selling everything from Harry Potter and Pokemon to DVD players and the "Saving Private Ryan" disks to watch on them -- all at big discounts -- are losing tons of money. Some say they are inherently more efficient, and it is just a matter of time before they turn a profit. Others, like Buy.com, argue that they don't need to make money on products they sell to consumers, because they expect to make plenty selling ad space on their sites.
Either way, merchants on the Web don't really care, as long as investors remain willing to bid up their stock, making it easy to raise even more cash to cover their losses.
This situation is bound to come to an end. It won't happen immediately, but even Internet companies cannot continue to lose money indefinitely.
"There's going to be a shakeout," said Jose A. Rasco, an economist at Hoenig & Company in Rye Brook, N.Y., who wrote a short report last week on what he calls "digital deflation."
"I'm not a big believer in the model that says you can sell at a loss but make it up on volume," Mr. Rasco added. "And ad spending won't hold up in a downturn. So when the consolidation takes place -- and it will -- suppliers will regain some pricing leverage over consumers."
NONE of this diminishes the extraordinary economic benefits to be derived from the commercialization of the Internet. Even after many of the Web sites that cannot generate a profit disappear, the Internet will remain a powerful tool for bringing together potential buyers and sellers from anywhere in the world. The Web will continue to empower consumers by giving them a lot more information to use in bargaining for the best price.
Cars, for example, are not sold online, but sites like Autobytel (www.autobytel.com) and CarPoint (www.carpoint.com) allow buyers to solicit bids from a number of dealers from the haven of their own desks. And there is now a wealth of once-secret wholesale price information available online. "I remember when the Edmunds Blue Book was practically the holy grail," Mr. Rasco said. "Now you can get it everywhere online for free."
This free-for-all has forced every supplier that wants to survive to become more efficient, enhancing economic growth in myriad ways. And consumers, taking advantage of their savings, have more money left to spend freely on all kinds of things.
But the current arrangement, in which many Web shopping sites are practically giving away their products, is too good to last. Enjoy it while you can.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Scary Stuff,Indeed: Halloween as Bellwether

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week.
E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SELL in May and go away.
That bit of investor folklore lies near the heart of one of the latest market-timing strategies to capture public attention. It's an incredibly simple idea, involving just two moves a year: Sell all your stocks at the very end of April and reinvest the money on Oct. 31. 
 I confess to having been skeptical several months ago, when I started receiving e-mail messages about the strategy, which is sometimes called the Halloween Indicator. But I have since come to believe that there is something to it. Indeed, the concept has withstood a considerable amount of statistical scrutiny.
Consider, first, the historical record from year end 1925 through 1998, as compiled by Ibbotson Associates, a research firm in Chicago. Over those 73 years, large-capitalization stocks returned 4.9 percentage points more, annualized, between Nov. 1 and April 30 than they did between May 1 and Oct. 31. The difference is even more impressive for small-cap stocks, for which the difference has been 18.2 percentage points.
Much of the seasonal pattern is attributable to the so-called January effect -- the tendency of all stocks, especially small caps, to perform especially well during the first month of the year (the overall market's sad January 2000 notwithstanding). But even if January is ignored, stocks have still performed significantly better in the colder months than in the May-October period.
Nor does the pattern merely flow from the fact that the stock market has twice crashed spectacularly in October -- in 1929 and 1987. The Halloween Indicator persists even after those years are removed from the calculations.
Still, some researchers suspect that the indicator may be a statistical fluke. After all, they contend, many money managers program their computers to continually search history for price patterns, so it is quite likely that many of those turn out to be meaningless coincidences. Indeed, researchers often advise that we ignore patterns that aren't also found in other places and times.
The Halloween Indicator acquits itself quite well in this regard, according to a new study conducted by Sven Bouman, a portfolio manager at Aegon, an insurer based in the Netherlands, and Ben Jacobsen, an assistant professor in the department of economics and econometrics at the University of Amsterdam. Of the 36 stock markets they studied outside the United States, they found the seasonal pattern in 35 of them. It was especially pronounced in Europe, where the contrast between stocks' summer and winter returns was even greater than in the United States.
Moreover, the Halloween Indicator is not a modern phenomenon: It has been present in Britain, for example, since 1694.
Another way to guard against spurious price patterns is to find a plausible explanation for why an apparent pattern should exist in the first place.
In the case of the Halloween Indicator, Mr. Bouman and Professor Jacobsen have such an explanation. They have found that the magnitude of the Halloween Indicator in a given country is highly correlated to the length and timing of that country's average summer vacation.
How would that help explain the Halloween Indicator? Through extensive surveys, they found that many investors reduce their equity exposure before taking their summer holidays. Such selling puts a damper on the stock market's return during the summer months and the reinvestment provides an extra push in the fall.
Before selling all your stocks on April 30, remember that transaction costs and taxes can take a big bite out of the Halloween Indicator's advantage. That said, however, the pattern seems real, and might provide this general advice for investors:
If you are ready to invest in the stock market and are looking for the right time to do so, the Halloween Indicator suggests that autumn offers a better climate than the spring. Conversely, if you're going to be selling some stock, springtime is the most favorable season.

For the 73 years from 1926 through 1998, stocks have returned far more, on average, from November through April than during the rest of the year. The phenomenon is known as the Halloween Indicator.

What Must He Do to Get Their Attention?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
HIGHER interest rates, dead ahead.
That was the uncharacteristically frank message relayed by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, in his testimony before Congress last week. What Mr. Greenspan could not say is what investors really want to know: how much higher rates have to go before Fed policy makers can be sure that economic growth is not inflationary. 
 Bond traders are betting that there will be three more one-quarter-point rate increases by July, raising the Federal funds rate to 6.50 percent. It was 4.75 percent last June.
Whether this will be enough to slow the supercharged economy is, of course, an unknown. But Gemma Wright, interest rate strategist at Aubrey G. Lanston in New York, sees several key areas of the economy that must cool before the Fed can relax. "Housing should begin to slow; auto purchases and revolving credit need to decline," she said. "And consumer sentiment should taper off as well."
The stock market is an increasingly important part of the mix that determines Fed actions. Mr. Greenspan even detailed how frothy stock prices have contributed to excess demand for goods, despite rising interest rates.
Because this demand could spawn inflation, it makes Mr. Greenspan worry. Yet since June 30, when the Fed began raising rates, the Dow industrials are down only 6.8 percent. And the Nasdaq composite is up a blistering 64 percent.
Stocks fell sharply on Friday. Midway through the rout, William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said: "The stock market is not yet that scared of the Fed because the Fed is still in fine-tuning mode. They're trying to find a neutral monetary policy to make growth rates acceptable."
If the market's swoon proves temporary, Mr. Greenspan will have to be more aggressive on rates than many investors expect, Mr. Dudley contended. "Either the Fed has to raise rates quite a bit, or the stock market has to go down quite a bit," he said.
To reduce economic growth by 1 percentage point in a hot stock market, the Fed would have to raise short and long-term interest rates 1.4 percentage points, he believes. Alternatively, a 20 percent decline in overall stock prices could accomplish the same slowdown in growth, Mr. Dudley said. He believes aggressive tightening by the Fed is more likely.
One reason that the economy and the stock market -- or segments of it -- can roar as rates rise is that the Fed continues to increase the nation's supply of money. "The rise in interest rates has been a reflection of strong economic performance," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at the Bank of America. "But it's been associated with strong money growth that is continuing to pump liquidity into the system, fueling consumption and domestic demand."
A broad money-supply measure, called zero maturity money, is growing at an annualized rate of 8.7 percent. Although that is down from the 14.5 percent growth at the end of 1998, it is still much too rapid if the Fed wants to curb demand, Mr. Levy said.
Pushing up interest rates while keeping the money spigots wide open may reflect Mr. Greenspan's deep aversion to playing the role of market spoiler. He wants to protect the nation from the ravages of inflation, but also wants investors to party on. Trouble is, even the mighty Mr. Greenspan can't have it both ways.

Dynamo And Microchip

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
You might have expected that in this election year the economic report of the president -- a survey published each February -- would be a highly political document, eagerly claiming credit for our giddy prosperity. But say what you like about their boss, Bill Clinton's economists have always been admirably honest and evenhanded in their reporting. The self-congratulatory boilerplate is actually minimal, and the thrust of this report is that technology, not policy, is the main source of good news.
This is surely right. A technology-driven surge in worker productivity is directly responsible for about two-thirds of the acceleration in our economic growth from the 2.5 percent norm of the 70's and 80's to the 4 percent of recent years. The report plausibly argues that our unexpected ability to get unemployment down to 30-year lows without inflation is also an indirect result of the productivity boom. So there is no mystery about why we are doing so well: the microchip did it. 
 The real mystery is why now -- and not much earlier.
After all, gee-whiz information technology is not new. The microprocessor itself was introduced in 1970. Digital faxes, video games and the personal computer all date from the late 70's and early 80's. Businessmen and politicians alike were excited by the possibilities. (Does anyone remember the "Atari Democrats"?) But until 1996 or so, there was simply no sign of a fundamental improvement in economic performance; there were recessions and recoveries, but no change in the trend. (Those are fighting words, but I'll take on the myths of Reaganomics some other day.)
And then, suddenly, the fancy technology started to pay off. What took it so long?
Well, after looking at the economic report, I dusted off my copy of a 1989 article by the Stanford economic historian Paul David, which made a big impression on me when I first read it. And "The Dynamo and the Computer" makes even better reading today.
Mr. David pointed out that although the light bulb was invented in 1879, the big economic payoff from electrification didn't come until after World War I. The problem was that simply replacing steam engines with electric motors didn't do much: businesses had to rethink the whole concept. Traditional factories were compact, multistory buildings -- the optimal design when power had to be conveyed via shafts and belts from a steam engine in the basement. Only when manufacturers realized the advantages of a sprawling, one-story structure, with each machine driven by its own motor -- in particular, the benefits of having plenty of room to move people and materials around -- did electrification really show what it could do. And this took decades.
The parallel is clear. Putting a computer on every desk didn't do much by itself. Only by changing the whole organization of work could business really reap the rewards of the digital age. It is simply Bill Clinton's good luck that America Inc. finally figured it out on his watch.
Is that it? Is the economic history of the United States these past two decades just a matter of technological determinism? To a first approximation, yes. Oh, some of the really bad policy ideas of the 80's -- the heavy-handed industrial policies urged by the Democratic left, or the return to the gold standard urged by the Republican right -- could have derailed us. But since such policies were never really on the table, politics had little if any effect on economic growth. Even if Jimmy Carter had been more likable, even if George Bush the elder had had the vision thing, the American economy would have ended up in more or less the same place.
What about the future? If the technology gurus are to be believed, there are more payoffs to come as the Internet goes wireless and all that. If they are right, then at least as far as the economy is concerned we don't need to elect a great man as president; all we need is somebody who won't do too much damage.
Given the likely choices, that is what I would call a reassuring thought.
In my Feb. 13 column I described the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 as a legal impediment to sales taxation. In fact it only prohibits taxes on Internet service providers.

How Slow Can Your Paycheck Grow?

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
AMERICA'S nine-year economic expansion is now the longest in history. Companies everywhere are thriving and sharing this prosperity with workers clamoring for raises. So paychecks must be ballooning, right?
Not exactly.
Pay should be climbing faster and faster as the unemployment rate falls and companies raise wages to lure new workers or to retain the ones they have. But wage increases, instead of getting bigger, are getting smaller. 
 What a puzzle that is for policy makers. Anticipating faster wage increases, the Federal Reserve has begun to raise interest rates to slow the economy, a strategy that will continue, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, suggested in Congressional testimony last week. A slower economy, the thinking goes, reduces the demand for workers, taking pressure off employers to raise wages. Less pressure to lift wages means less pressure to raise prices to cover the higher labor costs. A major source of inflation is thus contained.
Strangely, though, wage growth is slowing even without higher interest rates. When economists first spotted the smaller raises in government statistics last summer, they thought it was a fluke. But now all the numbers for 1999 are in hand, and there is no mistake. Nearly everyone who earned $26 an hour or less -- 90 percent of the work force -- found that their pay last year, adjusted for inflation, rose by far smaller amounts than in 1998.
"It is a mystery," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. "The usual preconditions for wage pressure have existed for some time, but the behavior that we expected, based on behavior in the past, particularly in the 1960's, has not been forthcoming."
WAGE growth had accelerated rather smartly in 1997 and 1998 as the economy boomed. But the expansion was even stronger last year, with even lower unemployment, and yet wage growth perversely slowed down. That happened whether the pay was for flipping hamburgers or designing machines and whether the measure was wages or a broader category that also includes bonuses and cashed-in stock options.
Only people earning north of $65,000 -- fewer than 10 percent of all workers -- found their incomes growing faster last year after adjustment for inflation.
Caught off guard, economists are reaching for explanations. High on the list is job insecurity. Despite rising public confidence in the economy, many workers still remember the layoffs and downsizings of the early 1990's.
"Even with full employment, workers may be more timid than in earlier periods of full employment, when unions were also stronger," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
Employees have settled on annual raises of about 3 percent in the last few years. That was double the inflation rate in 1998. Inflation was a bit higher in 1999, however, so real wage growth -- adjusted for inflation -- slowed down.
But if inflation rose last year, why did workers settle for the same 3 percent when a falling unemployment rate (it's now 4 percent) increased their bargaining power? Demographics may play a role, some economists say. The work force is aging as baby-boomers move into their 50's and older workers are not as aggressive about raises. "If you are turned down, you are not going to get another job so easily," said James Glassman, an economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
THEN there is the job-mix thesis. Manufacturers have shed 350,000 jobs in the past two years, and lower-paying service jobs have replaced them. The 1996 minimum wage law also played a role, helping to push up wages at the low end in 1997 and 1998, says Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton labor economist. The effect wore off last year, however. And immigrants flooding into the work force have also held back wages.
Finally, business itself has become more reluctant to raise wages, invoking global competition as a reason and demonstrating a readiness to move operations to lower-wage regions in the United States or abroad.
Still, many economists insist that wage pressure will increase soon. "We definitely expect hourly compensation to pick up this year," said Kenneth J. Matheny, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers.

Welcome to the Onetime Fire Wall State

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS

 BODY:
A few days before yesterday's South Carolina primary, a Reuters/ Zogby poll of Republicans, Democrats and independents showed Gov. George W. Bush with 42.7 percent and Senator John McCain with 42 percent. And this was supposed to have been Mr. Bush's fire wall state -- the one he would win in a cakewalk.
Instead, it's been a nasty firefight, the sort that Lee Atwater, that son of bare-knuckle Palmetto politics, would have loved. 
 After the dull "No, you first" courtliness of New Hampshire, South Carolina brought the invigorating ugliness of "push polling," in which Bush campaign callers, posing as unbiased pollsters, did their best to trash Mr. McCain.
This primary also highlighted the increasingly independent South Carolina electorate. Transplanted business people, part of the state's growing connection to the global economy, upwardly mobile suburbanites and retirees on the coast have made politics here more cosmopolitan and less predictable. The big question all week was how many Democrats and independents might weigh in on Mr. McCain's behalf.
The religious right remains influential, but uncertainly so. Both these traits could be seen in Gary L. Bauer's endorsement of Mr. McCain. On the one hand, Mr. McCain was assumed to benefit; on the other hand, no one was sure how much; and on the third hand, it was duly noted that Mr. Bauer had endorsed a candidate who hasn't pledged to outlaw abortion or to hew to other issues dear to the religious right.
All the energy and anxiety engendered by this fluctuating environment were on display last week in a shrill televised debate ineffectually moderated by Larry King. The spectacle of a Mr. McCain smiling a tight smile to mask his famous anger and an agitated Mr. Bush sputtering in indignation -- both far less articulate than Mr. Keyes -- was compelling enough to make one forget that a couple of testy Democrats, with no primary until next month, were also campaigning somewhere or another.
Incidentally, Mr. Bush, who has already spent a mind-boggling $52 million, will soon have to ask his backers for more money. PETER MARKS

HEADLINE: The Invisible Children

 BODY:
If there is a political issue that has stirred young people in America in recent years, it is the exploitation of child labor overseas. College students have organized to ensure that their university's athletic wear is not sewn by children. Elementary school classes have petitioned Disney and Nike to keep children out of their factories. Because of consumer clout and the importance of reputation to American manufacturers, child labor in their factories overseas has indeed diminished.
The problem of child labor, however, goes far beyond the tennis shoe. A quarter-billion children 14 and under work worldwide. Unicef estimates that fewer than 1 in 20 make goods for export -- and those who do are the most fortunate working children. The vast majority are employed in far more harmful occupations. Children in agriculture are poisoned by pesticides. Prostitutes get AIDS. Miners and glassworkers inhale dangerous substances. Shoe shiners and gum sellers are at the mercy of the streets. Domestic servants live in isolation and suffer beatings and sexual abuse. Millions of children in South Asia are sold by their parents into bonded labor to work off family debts. American consumers are right to insist that the goods we buy are not made by exploited children. But these efforts will backfire if children kicked out of these factories drift to more hazardous occupations. 
 Helping children in these dangerous jobs -- where they are isolated and invisible, and have no champions overseas -- is far more complex than keeping them out of factories. Fortunately, the Clinton administration is taking a sophisticated and constructive approach. Earlier this month the White House proposed doubling Washington's spending to fight child labor. The child labor division of the International Labor Organization, which is based in Geneva, would get $45 million next year, up from $30 million this year and only $3 million three years ago. Washington is now by far the group's largest and most influential donor. An additional $55 million would go to American programs overseas. Both efforts would attempt to provide the most effective antidote to child labor -- schooling.
The vast majority of child labor occurs in places with high levels of rural poverty and lax legal enforcement. Virtually every country bans hazardous child labor and most underage labor. In most nations, however, poor enforcement leaves children to be exploited by employers -- who often prefer to hire children because they are cheaper and more docile workers than adults. But economic development and effective law enforcement are not likely any time soon. For now, the best way to reduce child labor is to make primary education cheaper, better and more accessible.
Most children who work either have no school nearby or cannot afford to buy uniforms and textbooks and pay school fees. The education available is often so terrible that parents do not believe it worthwhile to send their children to school and forsake the few dollars a month they could earn.
The I.L.O.'s flagship program, in Bangladesh, works with the government, manufacturers and citizens' groups to establish special schools for children who worked in garment factories. Their families receive a small stipend to keep them in school. About 10,000 children have attended these new schools, and child labor in the garment industry has dropped sharply since the program began.
Much child labor would be prevented if governments emphasized basic education for all. Countries that keep children in school, like Sri Lanka, have relatively low levels of child labor. But many poor nations are actually cutting education budgets and raising school fees, in part because they have overwhelming foreign debts. They, and the nations that hold that debt, are fueling a cycle of poverty and condemning children not only to misery later, but misery now.

A Sell-Off Answers a Greenspan Warning

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
Investors bit the bullet on Friday, selling shares with a vengeance and then hunkering down for a long weekend, thankful for Monday's reprieve from the spiraling market.
 But there was no escaping the words of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who issued a stark warning during testimony to the House Banking Committee on Thursday that short-term interest rates would be raised further to avert inflation. 
 Pierre Ellis, a senior economist at Primark Decision Economics in New York, told Reuters on Friday that Mr. Greenspan wants to paint a picture that excess demand is being caused by the stock market. When the Fed is saying the market is part of the problem, it's hard for the market to go up.
 So down it went: the Dow Jones industrials fell nearly 300 points on Friday, closing at 10,219.52, well into correction mode; the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 3 percent for the week. The Nasdaq composite, meanwhile, managed a fractional gain.
 Peter Coolidge, head of trading at Brean Murray & Company, told Bloomberg News, Investors are starting to take to heart that interest rates are going higher, and that's bad for stocks. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: President Clinton Announces $223 Million in Job Grants

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Although unemployment is at a 30-year low among young people, too many of those without jobs lack training, education and economic standing, President Clinton said today in announcing $223 million in grants to attack the problem.
"We need to make sure our children are prepared for this new economy by helping every child enter school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed," Mr. Clinton said in his weekly radio address, which also paid tribute to February's observance of Black History Month. 
 "More Americans -- and more African-Americans -- are going on to college than ever before," the president said. "But we must give every child that chance and we must help their families shoulder the burden."
The $223 million in federal grants are earmarked for job training and summer jobs programs in 36 low-income areas, as well as initiatives to encourage young people to stay in school and prepare for college.
The White House said the grants would help an estimated 44,000 people age 14 to 21 in places as diverse as inner-city Baltimore and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.
In the weekly Republican radio address, Representative E.Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, said that Social Security beneficiaries should not be penalized for staying on the job after turning 65.
The House could vote as early as March 2 on a Republican plan to repeal the Social Security "earnings penalty" for working Americans age 65 to 69, said Mr. Shaw, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security.
Passage could mean bigger benefit checks for older employees who continue to hold down a job.
The legislation would do away with a rule requiring the government to subtract $1 in Social Security benefits from every $3 beneficiaries up to age 70 earn over a prescribed limit, currently $17,000 a year. Earlier this week, President Clinton said he would sign the bill if it passed.
"This may sound obscure, but millions of older Americans know exactly what the Social Security earnings penalty is because they have lost literally billions of dollars in benefits because of it," Mr. Shaw said.
"What's worse, millions more soon-to-be seniors in the baby boom generation could be hit by this work penalty if we don't change the law now."
Removing the earnings limit is an issue dear to older Americans, an important voting bloc for Democrats and Republicans in their struggle for control of the White House and Congress.
More than 800,000 people lose part or all of their benefits because of the earnings limit, the Social Security Administration has reported. The earnings ceiling will increase to $30,000 by 2002 under current law.
Repealing the earnings test would cost the government roughly $22.7 billion over 10 years, according to Republican estimates.

HEADLINE: Killings in a Georgetown Coffee Shop Stir Death Penalty Debate

BYLINE: By JOHN FILES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors are pressing for the death penalty against a man charged with murdering three employees at a Starbucks coffee shop here in July 1997, clearing the way for the city's first death penalty case in nearly 30 years.
In an outline issued this week, the prosecutors said they wanted to press a capital charge because the defendant has a history of violent crime. They said he shows no remorse and poses a continuing threat. 
 Carl D. Cooper, 30, has been charged with the killings in the affluent Georgetown area of the city. The bodies of Emory Allen Evans, 25; Mary Caitrin Mahoney, 24; and Aaron David Goodrich, 18, were found by another Starbucks employee.
The case gained national attention because it involved one of the city's fashionable neighborhoods, a 34-square-block area northwest of downtown Washington known for bars, restaurants, boutiques and narrow residential streets of expensive town houses. Georgetown is home to members of Congress, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and other major political figures, as well as Georgetown University, but not to a great deal of crime or violence.
Attorney General Janet Reno decided to seek the death penalty for Mr. Cooper with advice from Wilma A. Lewis, the United States attorney for the District of Columbia. A death penalty review panel at the Justice Department concurred.
Kenneth L. Wainstein, assistant United States attorney, in a 35-page document, cited Mr. Cooper's "continuing pattern of criminal conduct," including armed robberies dating to 1989 and possession of firearms and drugs dating to 1988, laundering of money obtained from robberies, and threats to murder witnesses and law-enforcement officers.
The case moved to federal court in August with a 48-count indictment against Mr. Cooper, charging him with crimes from 1993 to 1997. His trial is to start on May 2 in United States District Court in Washington.
The last person executed in the city was Robert E. Carter, 28, an unemployed laborer electrocuted on April 27, 1957, for killing an unarmed, off-duty police officer. The last trial in a capital case was in 1972.
The city repealed the death penalty in 1980. Residents voted overwhelmingly in the 1992 election to reject a provision that would have reinstated the death sentence.
City officials criticized Ms. Reno, saying she was ignoring the views of the city's residents, and urged that the city be allowed to handle the situation with some autonomy. If Mr. Cooper were prosecuted under local jurisdiction, the maximum sentence he could receive would be life in prison without the possibility of parole.
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the city's delegate to Congress, wrote to Ms. Lewis: "The application of the harshest and most controversial penalty in our law should not depend on whether the U.S. attorney or a locally chosen prosecutor litigates the case."
Ms. Norton said in an interview that "serious equal protection questions are raised" when a high-profile case is chosen for the death penalty. She said it was disturbing that with about 300 homicides in the city in a year, most of them in poor neighborhoods, federal officials chose to elevate a case from the "most glamorous part of Washington."
Mayor Anthony A. Williams said he agreed with Ms. Reno on the need for harsh penalties, including life in prison without parole, but, he said, "I do not support the death penalty."

HEADLINE: Mayor Renews Request for Release of Oil

 BODY:
Taking his dispute with the Clinton administration over federal energy policy to Staten Island, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani met with a small group of homeowners yesterday and blamed the White House for the shock they are facing over heating bills.
Mr. Giuliani repeated his call for the Clinton administration to free up 2 percent of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to counter reduced production levels by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Having gone elsewhere in the state, taken his message to Plattsburgh and Syracuse earlier in the week, he found a highly sympathetic audience among the homeowners who attended the meeting yesterday at an American Legion Post near the Fresh Kills landfill. 
 One of them, Jaimie Gonzales, who said he bought his home a year ago, told Mr. Giuliani that his heating oil bill, which was $150 last March, soared to $226 in December and $350 in January. "It is at a point where I am just watching the bills rise and turning down the thermostat," he said.
Teresa Rafferty, a single Staten Island homeowner, told the mayor she was "trying to pay my mortgage and utilities, working paycheck to paycheck, and just hoping that oil prices will come down."
But Mr. Giuliani cautioned that the fallout of this year's price increases would be widespread, both for homeowners and renters. "Landlords have already built these price increases into their claims for a rent increase," he said.
"Everybody is going to feel it," he added. "This has a ripple effect throughout the economy."

HEADLINE: Corporations' Taxes Are Falling Even as Individuals' Burden Rises

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
With incomes rising, particularly among the wealthy, Americans are paying a lot more in federal taxes than they did before the economic expansion of the last decade. Not so, American corporations. Their profits are growing even faster than Americans' incomes, yet the taxes they pay have peaked and have begun to fall.
The changes have been striking. Almost 15 cents of every dollar of income earned by Americans in 1997, the latest year for which figures are available, went to the Internal Revenue Service, up from 13 cents in 1990. By contrast, taxes paid by companies on profits reported to the I.R.S. fell to 20 cents on the dollar in 1997, from 26 cents on the dollar in 1990. 
 A number of factors explain why the corporate tax burden has fallen, from the legitimate use of various tax credits to the deduction of the cost of stock options exercised by employees. But the most troubling factor is the rapid spread of tax shelters, especially among large corporations, according not only to experts at the Treasury and I.R.S., but to some corporations and law firms that serve them.
Some of these tactics have been found to be illegal tax dodges. Others, many of them novel arrangements, have not been tested in the courts but are raising eyebrows.
"Corporate tax shelters are our No. 1 problem" in enforcing the tax laws, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said in an interview, "not just because they cost money but because they breed disrespect for the tax system."
What particularly alarms I.R.S. and Treasury officials is what they call a growing willingness by prominent companies that are well known for guarding their public image to engage in the kind of tax avoidance tactics more characteristic of the most disreputable companies.
Among the companies that have been found to have engaged in what the courts called shams are Colgate-Palmolive, Compaq Computer and United Parcel Service. For example, the Tax Court found last year that U.P.S. engaged in a long-running sham to evade more than $1 billion in taxes.
"There is a race for the bottom," said Jonathan Talisman, acting deputy Treasury secretary for tax policy.
Compaq did not return calls seeking comment; Colgate-Palmolive declined to comment, and United Parcel Service, in a statement, said it was "deeply offended" that government officials "would even begin to equate" its tax case with evasion or impropriety.
The tactics have become widespread enough that even corporate tax lawyers are quietly alerting the I.R.S. about tax shelters they think cross the line from legitimate tax planning into illegal schemes. The New York State Bar Association's tax section, a leading organization of corporate tax lawyers, said last year that tax shelters were a growing problem and called for new legislation to combat them.
Such tax shelters differ from legitimate ones because they use accounting gimmicks intended solely to lower tax liabilities and have no legitimate business purpose. In one typical example, a company that owes taxes forms a partnership with a business, often one abroad, that for various reasons does not owe any taxes. The company then shifts its profits to the other business's books, reducing its own profits, and later takes back the money in ways that do not count as profits. Many big accounting firms and Wall Street investment houses help arrange such deals for a fee.
In one current case involving AlliedSignal, the big automotive and aerospace company that was acquired last year by Honeywell, a substantial tax bill was wiped out. In that deal, AlliedSignal sold its investment in a Texas petroleum company at a profit of more than $400 million. The company would have owed more than $140 million in taxes on the profit. But, following a plan devised by Merrill Lynch, the company shifted the profit to a partnership created with a Dutch bank. AlliedSignal later took back the profit from the partnership, untaxed, and even reported a $4 million profit from the investment in the partnership.
The Tax Court disallowed the deal as having no purpose other than avoiding taxes, and an appeals court upheld that decision this month. Honeywell said in a statement that its policy was to comply with all applicable tax laws and pay all taxes properly due.
Deals like this one, which are revealed by I.R.S. audits, have repeatedly been labeled illegitimate by the courts. But the I.R.S. may find fewer than one such deal in 10 and its auditing resources have been shrinking.
That apparently is emboldening some companies to play "audit roulette," said Larry Langdon, commissioner of the I.R.S. large and midsize business division and former tax director at Hewlett-Packard.
Last year, the amount of income taxes paid by corporations fell 2.5 percent from 1998, government finance records show, while individual income tax revenue surged 6.2 percent.
The amount of taxes paid by individuals has been growing quickly in recent years, even faster than the growth in incomes, because more people are moving into higher tax brackets, where they pay in taxes a larger percentage of each extra dollar of income. (The top tax bracket is 39.6 percent.)
Individual incomes were 131 percent higher in 1997 than in 1990, while taxes were 164 percent higher.
But that is not the case for corporations, which have a tax rate of 35 cents on every dollar. Corporate profits reported to the I.R.S. were 252 percent higher in 1997 than in 1990, but taxes rose just 191 percent.
An additional factor is lowering corporate income taxes. A Treasury Department analysis of tax returns filed by large companies found that each year from 1991 to 1996 a shrinking portion of profits reported to shareholders was reported to the I.R.S. as taxable income. This year less than 70 cents of each dollar of profit reported by companies to shareholders will be reported to the I.R.S. as taxable, down from 91 cents in 1990, Internal Revenue Service officials say.
Because of these trends, in 1997 alone, companies paid $60 billion less in income taxes than they would have if they had paid taxes at the same rate as in 1990. But individuals paid $80 billion more.
Much of the reduction for companies is legitimate. For one thing, companies report profits differently to shareholders and to the I.R.S. And some of the reduction can be attributed to a growth in tax credits taken for investing in new buildings and equipment, among other things. Also, as stock options proliferate and are exercised, companies can subtract the cost from their profits reported to the I.R.S., even though they can ignore that cost and report higher profits to shareholders.
But it is widely agreed that such factors explain only part of the drop in the corporate tax burden.
Abusive corporate tax shelters, Mr. Summers estimated, cost the government more than $10 billion a year, a figure Treasury officials call conservative. They suspect the number is much larger.
It is not just the fact that tax shelters are being created faster than dot-coms on the Internet that worries Mr. Langdon and others, it is which companies are embracing them. "You can divide the corporate world into white hats, gray hats and black hats," Mr. Langdon said.
He said the black hats had long taken aggressive postures on tax matters, pursuing schemes that white-hat companies would reject.
What alarms I.R.S. and Treasury officials is the willingness of the white-hat companies to match this conduct "because the payoff to shareholders is sufficient to make the risk to their public image worth it or because their shareholders will say, hey, everybody else is doing it, you should do it, too."
Mr. Langdon said the tax shelters arranged by accounting firms including PricewaterhouseCoopers, investment houses including Merrill Lynch, and others go so far beyond lawful exploitation of loopholes that he and other I.R.S. officials are considering calling on the chief executives of these and other companies to tell them that they consider the conduct of the companies out of line.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, asked for comment, did not issue a statement. Merrill Lynch said in a statement, "These transactions were carefully reviewed at the time by prominent outside tax counsel and accountants, all of whom gave opinions that they were proper and appropriate."
Mr. Summers is proposing a law that would require early disclosure of tax shelters and a 25 percent excise tax on their promoters and buyers. The tax lawyers section of the New York State Bar Association supports requiring greater disclosure and other steps.
But Mr. Summers's proposal has received a cold reception on Capitol Hill. Last week Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, taking note of his long experience with tax legislation, said that in the Treasury secretary's proposal, "There is a sort of an implicit indictment of the corporation for doing something, as it were, unethical or perhaps even illegal or maybe immoral, but the fact of the matter is we write the Tax Code, and any corporation ought to do what they can to minimize that cost on behalf of their shareholders."
But some tax shelters should not be confused with legitimate tax breaks, said Christopher Bergin, editor of the journal Tax Notes. They "cross the line and are pure and simple theft."
Nevertheless, corporations feel confident in proceeding with such deals because their lawyers say the deals are legal, and also because the I.R.S. does not have the resources to challenge many of them in Tax Court.
The Financial Executives Institute, a group of senior finance and tax officials at large companies, says that there is no problem that merits a new law as proposed by Mr. Summers.
Mr. Langdon said that in the last decade he had seen a disturbing shift in attitudes by corporate executives as to how aggressive to be in avoiding taxes. "The tax department is viewed more as a profit center and a place that has more of an obligation to more or less aggressively reduce the tax burden," he said. "Most companies used to worry about their image. When I was at Hewlett-Packard and we looked at one of these deals, my boss would say, 'I want you to write the article that you imagine that The New York Times or Wall Street Journal would run if they find out about this and if the article passes muster we will consider doing the thing.' The deals that couldn't pass that muster were not done."
Now, he said, corporate finance and tax officials are under such pressure to increase profits that image is hardly a consideration in whether to cheat on taxes. "Most chief financial officers these days are more afraid of the Securities and Exchange Commission than the I.R.S., because more of them have lost their jobs for violating S.E.C. rules than I.R.S. rules."

HEADLINE: Built, but Not Destined, to Last;
A Robert Moses Legacy, Coliseum Is Coming Down

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:

While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand;
When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall.
 
Lord Byron
"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage"
Good thing this is New York. Having stood 1,920 years fewer than the one in Rome, the Coliseum on Columbus Circle is about to topple. 
 Its facade is already being shrouded in the funereal pall of safety netting as workers land the first blows. The main exhibition hall, once brimming with futuristic cars, sybaritic yachts, indoor gardens, model apartments, antiques, cameras and even three-ring circuses, is dark and filled with a cartilaginous network of scaffolding. Crews are carting out drums full of asbestos and will soon be wrestling with 24-foot-high, 120-foot-long steel trusses.
But more than a structure will disappear in the next six months. Workers are taking the first big chunk out of the physical legacy of Robert Moses, the sovereign master builder who transformed New York, for better and worse, in midcentury.
"He named it the Coliseum very specifically because he wanted to be remembered as immortal as the Caesars of Rome," said Robert A. Caro, author of "The Power Broker," the definitive 1974 biography of Moses. "He believed his works would confer immortality on him."
Even New Yorkers who did not equate Moses with Titus might have had a hard time imagining on opening day in April 1956 that the Coliseum -- subject of a first-class postage stamp, self-proclaimed Exposition Capital of the World and a "$35 million investment in the gregariousness of man," in the words of The New York Times -- would be rubble before the century ended.
A symbol of Moses' "matchless imagination," Mr. Caro said, the Coliseum was the first in a series of urban renewal projects, including the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, whose social and economic reverberations are still being felt on the Upper West Side.
Indeed, the Coliseum may have paved the way to its own extinction by launching a wave of redevelopment that ultimately rendered a 3.4-acre site on Columbus Circle too valuable to sustain a relatively low-rise building.
"It outclassed itself, that's what happened," said Anthony Rafaniello, executive vice president of the HRH Construction Corporation, the construction managers of Columbus Centre, the $1.6 billion, 2.5 million-square-foot project that will replace the Coliseum and adjoining office tower, 10 Columbus Circle.
Columbus Centre, which is to be finished in 2003, will include the headquarters of AOL Time Warner, a concert hall for Jazz at Lincoln Center, a Mandarin Oriental Hotel, restaurants, stores, apartments and a garage. It is being developed by a group including Stephen M. Ross of the Related Companies and William L. Mack of Apollo Real Estate Advisors.
"It is going to tie the West Side together," said Bruce L. Warwick, president of Columbus Centre L.L.C., a unit of the Related Companies. By that, he meant it would close the geographic gap between Lincoln Center and the Broadway theater district with new performance spaces and television studios.
And it is about time, said Edward I. Koch, who sought to replace the Coliseum in the 1980's when he was mayor. He professed no remorse at the impending demolition. "While I didn't know Moses," Mr. Koch said, "I can't for a moment think that he didn't believe that you move forward and that nothing is forever."
To make an omelet, as Moses himself said, you have to break some eggs.
The Coliseum rose on a two-block site created by the closing of 59th Street between Columbus Circle and Columbus Avenue. More than 30 structures, including the Circle and Majestic Theaters and the 23-story Gotham National Bank Building, were torn down to make way for the exhibition hall and office tower, a spectacle witnessed by 12-year-old William Mack, whose father was the demolition contractor.
To earn its oversize name, the Coliseum was inaugurated with three big shows simultaneously: the Fifth International Philatelic Exhibition, the International Automobile Show and the National Photographic Show.
Among the 125,000 people at the Coliseum on opening day was Mayor Robert F. Wagner, who called the building "one of the wonders of the modern world."
Elsewhere in the crowd was Frank Lloyd Wright, who took a slightly different view. "It's a great utilitarian achievement, but architecture is something else again," he said. "I think it's all right for New York, but I hope it stays here."
Even the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which built the Coliseum under the chairmanship of Moses, could not say much more about the bland, faceless, buff-brick box, designed by Leon and Lionel Levy, than that it was an example of "conservative-modern architecture."
The Coliseum was not entirely without aesthetic flourishes, however. Paul Manship, a sculptor best known for his golden Prometheus at Rockefeller Center, designed four cast aluminum medallions, each one 11 feet square, that were hung on the facade.
Each medallion depicted a government seal. Because this was a Moses project, the emblem of the Triborough authority was given equal rank with those of the United States, New York State and New York City.
"It's a monument to his arrogance," Mr. Caro said.
In the 1,200-pound Triborough seal, laurels encircle a bridge tower that looks like the Bronx-Whitestone (built by Moses), a tunnel shaft that may be the Brooklyn Battery (built by Moses) and the waves of the sea (parted by Moses, but that's an entirely different story).
Although it had 300,000 square feet of exhibition space, the Coliseum was straining under demand even before its 10th anniversary in 1966, which Moses celebrated by carving into a large cake in the shape of the building and announcing a 22,500-square-foot expansion.
There was no Moses to celebrate the 30th anniversary -- he had died five years earlier -- nor was there any cake. The Coliseum closed in March 1986, after a men's sportswear show. The next month, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center opened, with three times the space.
At the time, it appeared that the Coliseum would be torn down imminently for an enormous project by Mortimer B. Zuckerman of Boston Properties. But that deal, beset by litigation and a plunging real estate market, fell through.
So the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, parent of the Triborough agency, reopened the Coliseum on an interim basis in 1992. One-of-a-kind events were held there, as was the New York Coliseum Antiques Show, produced three times a year by the Stella Show Management Company. The last antiques show was in January 1998. The hall has been dark since.
"It wasn't beautiful, but it was there," said Joan Tramontano, a show manager at Stella. "We mourn the loss of exhibit space in Manhattan."
Count also among mourners the longtime neighborhood opponents of the Columbus Circle redevelopment project. "We think it's wrong to take down a perfectly good building with years of life in it to put up something that will be very harmful, with traffic, air pollution, wind and shadows," said Olive Freud, of the Committee for Environmentally Sound Development.
Even the men who are about to raze the building have a respect for its heavy bones, which will challenge their demolition skills. "It's like the Rock of Gibraltar," said Mr. Rafaniello of HRH. "Architecturally, it left something to be desired, but structurally it's a magnificent design."
Most imposing -- though invisible to sidewalk superintendents -- are the 120-foot-long trusses. Seven of these monsters, each two stories high, support the roof. Mr. Rafaniello said a crane would be set up in the middle of the exhibition hall to take the trusses down in 24-by-24-foot sections.
The entire Coliseum and 26-story office tower should be cocooned in scaffolding by the end of the month. The contractor for the $17 million demolition job is the Safeway Environmental Corporation of Whitestone, Queens.
The Manship medallions were removed in September and taken to Warren, Conn., for restoration, after which they will probably be installed at the New York Transit Museum in downtown Brooklyn, said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the M.T.A.
By September, there should be nothing left of the Coliseum. But the shadow cast by the Power Broker is not destined to fade soon.
"The most important things that Robert Moses did won't go away in any foreseeable future -- the roads, the highways, the bridges; the way he made the metropolitan area so dependent on cars," Mr. Caro said. "His overall impact on New York will endure for centuries."

HEADLINE: U.N. Trade Meeting Brings Rich and Poor No Closer

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Feb. 19

 BODY:
A United Nations conference on developing nations concluded today with expressions of good will but no real narrowing of the differences that split a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle in December.
Delegates offered only general expressions of hope that rich and poor nations might eventually agree on a formula that would allow them to share the benefits of global trade. 
 "Having a success or even a relative success at this meeting and having the machine function in good order is a way of getting back on track," said Poul Nielson, the development commissioner of the European Union.
But he added, "I would warn against easy-fix approaches."
A key unresolved issue among the 160 delegations to the 10th annual meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development was a demand by poor nations that the more developed nations open their markets fully to their products, without tariff barriers.
The poor nations also reiterated their objections to standards of environmental and worker protection that the developed nations generally seek, saying such standards make it even harder for them to catch up.
The president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn, said that although technology is rapidly bringing the world closer together, populations "remain split along a fault line that separates the lives and aspirations of the rich and poor."
Although there were daily demonstrations outside the convention center where the meeting was held, they were relatively small and did not erupt into the disorder and violence that disrupted the Seattle conference.
The Bangkok meeting was the first meeting of an international trade organization since Seattle, and some participants were hoping to use it to address their grievances and heal rifts. But the United States and other major developed nations did not send high-level delegations, saying the World Trade Organization remains the proper and effective vehicle for setting standards for international trade.
The United Nations trade meetings are intended to provide information and expertise to help developing nations compete in the global trading system.
Expressing the views of many developing nations, Shri Suresh Pachouri, an Indian delegate, said, "The rules of the W.T.O. have been framed mainly keeping in view the interests of the industrialized countries." He said the standards demanded by the World Trade Organization often ignored the political, social and economic conditions of developing nations.
The emotional heart of the session came on Friday with a keynote speech by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, who drew applause when he said, "The have-nots are funding the haves."
"Regarding this new order of international economic relations and its proclaimed advantages for the poor," he said, "how can one refrain from recalling the fable of the fox offering the stork delicious meals on dinner plates, but making the food out of reach?"
Speaking as a spokesman for African nations, he said his continent, still suffering from the legacy of colonial rule, was now being crushed by a new world order of international trade.
"Ultimately, a new map of the world is being drawn up, and an entire continent -- Africa -- is purely and simply being rubbed out," he said.
Whenever African leaders try to take advantage of opportunities for international trade, he said, they run into barriers erected by richer nations as well as crippling demands for debt repayments.
He said rich nations seem to be offering "the macabre specter of someone visiting a dying man and saying: 'Well, die happy. You won't have any debts to pay.' "

HEADLINE: 'Cats,' Broadway's Longevity Champ, to Close

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
After almost 18 years, $380 million in sales and untold gallons of makeup, "Cats," the longest-running production in Broadway history, will close on June 25.
The musical, at the Winter Garden Theater, will end its run after 7,397 performances, a streak that began while much of the show's current cast was in grade school. 
 The closing, which has been rumored for several months, was confirmed yesterday by Peter Brown, the United States representative for Andrew Lloyd Webber, the musical's composer.
An audience pleaser with seemingly endless appeal for children and tourists, "Cats" will have been seen by more than 10 million people in New York by the time its final curtain falls. Since opening in 1982 it often ranked near the top shows on Broadway in gross sales. It outlasted hundreds of other musicals, and will have come close to outlasting three presidential administrations.
In recent years, however, the well of audiences has slowly run dry, leaving the theater half full on some nights, with the show's producers taking losses during the winter with hopes of making a profit during the tourist-packed summers.
Reached in London yesterday, Lord Lloyd Webber said the closing was bittersweet. "Obviously, I am sad that 'Cats' has to close on Broadway at the end of June, but it is also a day of great celebration," he said. "Eighteen is a great age for a cat."
In the end, "Cats" may have been simply done in by its own success. The musical has been produced in 30 countries worldwide and seen by an estimated 50 million people, or roughly the population of California and New York combined.
Financially, "Cats" ranks as one of the most successful musical of all time, churning millions into the pockets of its investors and making international stars and multimillionaires out of Lord Lloyd Webber and the show's lead producer, Sir Cameron Mackintosh. It also acted as an economic engine for the city of New York; a 1997 study by Audience Research and Analysis said "Cats" had contributed more than $3.12 billion to the city's economy and more than $195 million in state and local taxes.
But more than a financial juggernaut, "Cats" fundamentally reshaped the Broadway landscape by ushering in the era of the megamusicals: big, flashy spectacles that required little theatrical sophistication or knowledge of the English language to appreciate. As such, "Cats"' proved that tourist audiences could drive a show's sales. Tourists filled the Winter Garden long after "Cats" had become passe among New York theatergoers.
But "Cats," with its lavish design and elaborate special effects, also whetted audiences' appetites for increasingly complex stagecraft. Soon Broadway was witness to all variety of expensive stage magic, from falling chandeliers (in Lord Lloyd Webber's 1988 musical, "The Phantom of the Opera") to helicopters landing onstage (in Sir Cameron's 1991 production, "Miss Saigon") to the foundering of the Titanic (in the 1997 musical of the same name).
While visually arresting, these effects raised the cost of producing musicals, making producers' prospect of turning a profit -- always slim -- even more forbidding. Higher production costs led to higher ticket prices.
As the run of "Cats" continued, the musical also became a cultural touchstone, becoming synonymous with longevity -- and, eventually, longueur -- in comedians' routines and among theater gossips. Even its advertising slogan, "Now and Forever," suggested a certain eerie, inevitable immortality.
And in an industry populated by old-time showmen, "Cats" also made its mark in marketing, adopting a text-free and thus internationally recognizable logo. The production also saturated the airwaves with television commercials and made its posters a permanent fixture in New York City subway stations.
It prompted a cottage industry in show-related trivia. More than 1.8 million pounds of dry ice have been used during the show's run to create fog onstage. The sheer poundage of yak hair used for wigs, 3,247 pounds during the run, outweighs a Volkswagen Beetle. One of the musical's most popular songs, "Memory," has been recorded 180 times by different artists around the world. "Cats" has employed 284 actors, 19 of whom have died. One, Marlene Danielle, has been with the show since the beginning of its Broadway run.
"Cats" opened in New York on Oct. 7, 1982, after months of pre-show hype and a sold-old run in the West End of London. (The London production is still running; "Cats" is now the longest-running show in the history of the British theater.)
Based on "Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats," a slim volume of poems by T. S. Eliot, "Cats" follows the tale of a group of alley cats, one of whom, Grizabella, ascends to kitty heaven, known as the heaviside layer, by show's end.
But story was really never the appeal of "Cats." The musical, with a catchy, melodic pop score by Lord Lloyd Webber, had no book and little plot.
Instead, the production's focus was on theatrical spectacle. The actors, directed by Trevor Nunn, are outfitted in feline body suits, foot-long whiskers and swirling face makeup and prowl the theater's aisles, stealing popcorn from children's hands and purring into people's faces. Aiding the illusion is a series of ingenious effects by the designer John Napier, who transformed the interior of the Winter Garden into a overrun junkyard seen from a cat's-eye perspective. At the musical's finale, a giant hydraulically powered tire lifts Grizabella into the sky.
Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times: "Whatever the other failings and excesses, even banalities, of 'Cats,' it believes in purely theatrical magic, and on that faith it unquestionably delivers." He also predicted that "Cats" was "likely to lurk around Broadway for a long time."
His words proved prophetic. "Cats" won seven Tony Awards in 1983, including best musical, and in June 1997 it surpassed "A Chorus Line" as the longest-running production in Broadway history. The occasion was celebrated with a reunion of former cast members and a block party in front of the Winter Garden.
Speaking then, Lord Lloyd Webber recalled how the show, based on unorthodox material, had struggled to find investors before its first run in London.
"We had almost everything going against us," he said. "We couldn't get the investment companies interested." Theater lore holds that Lord Lloyd Webber mortgaged his house to make sure the production was financed, a bet that paid off.
There was no indication of whether similar festivities were planned for the show's closing.
The Winter Garden's stage, which was completely deconstructed for "Cats," will have to be rebuilt. The theater as a whole will probably need a good scrub.
And if Broadway tradition holds true to form, those who have never seen "Cats," or want to see it one more time, will probably buy tickets, meaning one last surge in sales. Only 144 performances now remain.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CHALLENGER;
Bradley Seeks To Get a Push In Northwest

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 19

 BODY:
Former Senator Bill Bradley's struggle to keep his presidential campaign alive seems to hinge increasingly on this state's primary.
Washington holds a nonbinding vote on Feb. 29 that will be the only Democratic contest before the so-called Super Tuesday primaries in 16 states on March 7. Having lost to Vice President Al Gore in both Iowa and New Hampshire, and trailing badly in polls in almost every state including Washington, Mr. Bradley views this state as a critical proving ground where he must regain some of the political momentum and media attention he has lost over the last month, his advisers said. 
 "What happens here if he beats Gore is that it will resonate across the country that this is a race," said Mayor Paul Schell of Seattle, who is helping Mr. Bradley here. "This is where he's going to make a stand. I think he's decided that."
Mr. Bradley is planning to lavish his time and resources on Washington in the coming week. He has also sent more than 20 aides, including some of his most seasoned organizers, to the state. By next weekend, his aides said, the full-time paid staff will probably grow to 30 people.
The group includes many of Mr. Bradley's top political aides from Iowa and New Hampshire, including Mark Longabaugh, his state director in New Hampshire, and Robert Becker, who was his political director in Iowa. Two of Mr. Bradley's senior advisers, Margy Heldring and Gretchen Crosby, have also moved to Seattle to talk about Mr. Bradley's record and agenda, particularly his plan to extend private health insurance to almost all Americans.
Mr. Bradley himself is expected to spend most of the coming week campaigning along the Pacific Coast and in heavily Democratic cities like Tacoma and Seattle.
Mr. Bradley is also preparing an advertising campaign for local radio stations and newspapers to promote his health care plan as well as his endorsement by The Seattle Times, the state's largest newspaper.
The vote on Feb. 29 will not be used to select delegates to the Democratic convention. That will be done on March 7 in party caucuses, where Mr. Gore is expected to excel because he has the support of most party officials and labor unions, groups that tend to dominate the caucuses.
But Mr. Bradley's advisers are less concerned with delegates than public relations, and they view Washington as one of their last chances to reverse perceptions that the Bradley campaign is foundering. A win here on Feb. 29, they say, could build the kind of excitement they need to go into the March 7 primaries with some sense of positive movement.
"We want this state to be able to send a message to the rest of the country," Mr. Bradley told a group of about 75 supporters this morning outside a health clinic in Seattle.
Mr. Bradley has acknowledged that he must win some states on March 7, when New York, California, Ohio and 10 other states will select 30 percent of the Democratic delegates. But while Mr. Bradley once talked of trying to contest Mr. Gore in almost every state, his campaign is trying to focus its efforts on certain states to ensure that he gains enough victories to justify staying in the race.
Mr. Bradley's advisers say that in addition to Washington, they are counting on doing well in New England, particularly Connecticut, in New York, where Mr. Bradley played pro basketball for 10 seasons, and Missouri, where he was born.
Victories in those states, combined with a strong second-place showing in California, would help insulate Mr. Bradley against pressure from other Democrats to drop out of the race. Performing well on March 7 is also important because on March 14 the campaign turns south, to Florida, Texas, Tennessee and several other states where Mr. Gore is considered the heavy favorite.
Mr. Bradley's advisers say they think he can do well in Washington in part because independents -- a group he does better among than Mr. Gore does -- are allowed to vote in the Feb. 29 primary. Thanks to a booming high-tech economy, there is also a large population of well-educated, higher income residents here, and polls have consistently shown that such voters tend to support Mr. Bradley.
Aides to Mr. Bradley have been concerned that Senator John McCain was drawing independent voters, as well as media attention, away from Mr. Bradley. For that reason, the candidate seemed buoyed tonight by Mr. McCain's loss in the South Carolina Republican primary. "We're back," Mr. Bradley told a crowd of supporters at a rally in St. Louis this evening.
During less than 24 hours in Seattle, Mr. Bradley focused on the two issues his aides think are most important to Washington voters: the environment and health care.
At a meeting with more than 800 people on Friday, Mr. Bradley talked proudly about his work on environmental issues in the Senate.

Art, in the Public Vein

BYLINE: By ERIC V. COPAGE 

 BODY:
If you open your mailbox in the coming weeks and find a postcard of eight disembodied heads, don't panic. If you find a MetroCard on the street whose cheery New York City scene has been replaced with a double helix, don't be alarmed. You are in the flow of a citywide art project.
Beginning Thursday and continuing through the spring, a group called REPOhistory, which specializes in public art, will hold a series of events and exhibitions about human blood and its economic, historic and cultural significance. The heart of this project, called "Circulation," is on its Internet site. 
 "The Web site is the only way viewers can see the entire project and how it works," said its creative director, Jim Costanzo. "A lot of the stuff will be ephemeral, or will be done in different parts of the city."
 Why blood? "Blood is a metaphor for our shared humanity and diversity," Mr. Costanzo said. "It deals with direct issues that affect us, like AIDS and ethnicity. Also, we deal with blood as a commodity, something that is sold and circulated throughout the city."
 Mr. Costanzo, who teaches computer graphics at Pratt Institute and Parsons School of Design, said an important aspect of the project is its interactive element. "We've been doing collaborative art for 11 years," he said. "The Web is a way of extending our way of collaboration to a much larger audience."
 WHAT YOU SEE -- The home page gives visitors various options. You can find out about REPOhistory, view the group's past work or check out the "Circulation" project. Click on the "Circulation" icon and there are more options. You can read about the ideas behind the project. You can view individual art works. You can learn about the history of blood.
 You can also send any of a dozen e-cards. In one, eerie cadaverlike mug shots by Tom Klem are identified by blood type to evoke the mythical connection between blood, race and purity. Another, by David Sansone, is red and black and contains the words, "it gives a body life: it gives a body death," referring to the life-giving properties of blood and to AIDS.
 Then there is "Exquisite Corpse," a cyberversion of an early 20th century parlor game played by Surrealists in which participants draw something or add a line of a story to a piece of paper that is folded so that the work of the previous contributor cannot be seen.
 LINKS -- To a literary online magazine called The Bleeding Edge, created by students from the Institute for Collaborative Education, a city middle and high school, and to a Web site affiliated with St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where there is a continuing dialogue among students about blood and ethnic identity.
 WHAT YOU GET -- A bird's-eye view of our red planet. ERIC V. COPAGE

HEADLINE: High Cost of Oil Seeps Its Way Into Everyday Lives, and Pocketbooks

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, the jump in fuel oil and gasoline prices has emerged as a potent political issue. Homeowners who rely on oil heat have had to deal with surprisingly high bills this winter, but the impact is more widespread, rippling throughout the economy in many ways. And, as with all economic dislocations, some have actually benefited from the situation.
Amid the aroma of pita breads baking at the rate of 11,000 an hour, Edward Mafoud stood on the cavernous floor of Damascus Bakeries in Brooklyn and explained how the steeply rising oil prices had taken a significant bite out of his bakery's already slim profit margin. 
The cost of producing and shipping his pitas and other Middle Eastern breads has gone up by about $40,000 in the last 12 months, he said, not only because of higher transportation costs, but also because of the rising price of plastic packaging bags -- a petroleum-based product he uses by the millions each year. Although $40,000 may seem relatively little for a company with about $5 million a year in gross revenues, it is important, Mr. Mafoud said, because "in the bread industry we work with small profit margins" on each item.
"If your profitability margins are basically running 3 percent and you chop off 1 percent, it doesn't leave you that much to operate with," he said. Less money is left to upgrade equipment, expand production or merely remain competitive.
"We're not going to go out of business overnight," he said. But if oil prices remain high or increase still more, and if the costs of ingredients and other items also rise significantly, he said, the squeeze could become more serious.
About 80 percent of the bread made by Damascus, a major pita producer, is distributed nationally, carried by independent truckers who in recent months have added fuel surcharges to the bakery's bills.
Mr. Mafoud, 39, is part of the third generation of his family to operate the 70-year-old bakery at 56 Gold Street, in the Vinegar Hill area of Brooklyn.
As the bakery's president, he was already considering whether to raise prices, a step he said he was reluctant to take, because it would mean risking the loss of some wholesalers and retailers. An increase of 2 or 3 cents on a four-pita package -- to compensate for the nearly 10 percent rise in the cost of plastic bags and the 2 percent to 3 percent truckers' fuel surcharges -- could lead distributors and retailers to say, "No, we'll buy from your competitors," he said.

Taking a Toll on Apartments

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, the jump in fuel oil and gasoline prices has emerged as a potent political issue. Homeowners who rely on oil heat have had to deal with surprisingly high bills this winter, but the impact is more widespread, rippling throughout the economy in many ways. And, as with all economic dislocations, some have actually benefited from the situation.
The spike in oil prices is punching holes in the finances of apartment buildings across the city, from small walk-ups to the giant Co-op City complex in the Bronx. 
 "It's going to bust a lot of budgets -- it already has," said Jordi Reyes-Montblanc, president of the Housing Development Fund Corporation Coalition, which helps limited-income tenants take over and run buildings whose owners default on taxes. To pay soaring oil bills, some co-ops may impose assessments or raise maintenance fees, he said. "Our co-ops operate on a very small margin, and this was totally unexpected. Many buildings can withstand the pressure for a limited time, but with others, it's like living from paycheck to paycheck, and this can break you."
At a 24-unit building he manages on West 134th Street in Hamilton Heights, Mr. Reyes-Montblanc said: "On Jan. 20, we got an 1,800-gallon delivery at $1 a gallon. On Feb. 5 we got another delivery that cost $3,600," or $2 a gallon, "and in the next few days we may have to order again."
At New York's biggest housing complex, Co-op City, the surge in oil prices hit home at an especially inopportune moment. Just getting oil -- regardless of price -- proved hard last month. "One guy had trucks and no oil; another guy had oil and no trucks," said Gary E. Friedland, the executive vice president of Marion Scott Real Estate, which manages the complex.
For many buildings, oil costs have been more of an annoyance than a crisis. "Many of our members are heating with gas, or they have a level billing plan and won't get hit for an adjustment until later on," and others are dipping into reserve funds, said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums.
But not all buildings have a cushion. Amy Rosado, who helps run a tenant-owned building on Shakespeare Avenue in the Bronx, said it could pay only half the $6,000 bill for its last oil delivery. The supplier agreed to extend credit for the rest.
"There's a lot of yelling and screaming, because this is basically a doubling of oil prices, and that's pretty significant," said Jack Freund, executive vice president of the city's biggest landlords' group, the Rent Stabilization Association. BRUCE LAMBERT

Big Tanks, Big Bills

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, the jump in fuel oil and gasoline prices has emerged as a potent political issue. Homeowners who rely on oil heat have had to deal with surprisingly high bills this winter, but the impact is more widespread, rippling throughout the economy in many ways. And, as with all economic dislocations, some have actually benefited from the situation.
The sport utility vehicle has surged in popularity in part because of its size -- taller than a speeding soccer mom, but sometimes more hungry for gas than two compact cars. That's not much of a problem when gas prices are low. 
 Now, however, drivers of sport utility vehicles and minivans are rolling their eyes as they spend as much as $50 to fill their large tanks.
Herb Castro, a stay-at-home father from Manhattan's Lower East Side, said he used to fill the tank of his minivan, a 1996 Plymouth Voyager, once or twice a week. Now, he can afford to buy only $10 worth of gas three or four times a week. When he can, he buys gas in Brooklyn to save a few pennies.
Nevertheless, he could not consider a smaller car, he said: "I have three children and my wife. Anything smaller would drive me crazy."
Mr. Castro was buying gas Thursday morning at the Amoco station on Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn, where prices ranged from $1.51 to $1.65 a gallon, generally less than in Manhattan. At a Merit station nearby, where gas was selling for a few cents less, Edward Bell of Flatbush, a mechanic for U-Haul, was filling up a rental truck. He said he has cut down on driving because of the jump in gas prices. "I don't go out of state too much anymore," he said.
To a person, drivers of sport utility vehicles said that while they were disturbed at the jump in gasoline prices, they would remain true to their vehicles.
"I think they should lower the price. If you have to buy a particular car for gas prices, that's ridiculous," said John Brutus, who travels from his home in Virginia to Kennedy International Airport and on to Buffalo to do maintenance on planes. He said it costs him $21 to fill up his 1987 Pathfinder, but because he has four children, he wouldn't be able to use a smaller car. TINA KELLEY

A Cooperative Solution

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, the jump in fuel oil and gasoline prices has emerged as a potent political issue. Homeowners who rely on oil heat have had to deal with surprisingly high bills this winter, but the impact is more widespread, rippling throughout the economy in many ways. And, as with all economic dislocations, some have actually benefited from the situation.
Marion Reinhardt of Rutherford, N.J., works hard to make her 110-year-old house more energy efficient and her heating bills affordable. A few weeks ago, she put weatherstripping around her back door. When she goes to work, she lowers the thermostat. 
 But it was the recent rise in gasoline prices that made her realize that no matter what she did to conserve, it was going to cost more to heat her home this season. "I was driving to work the other day, and I passed a gas station that was selling gasoline for $1.38 a gallon, and I was so astounded at the increase," said Ms. Reinhardt, who is 52. "I went home and called my oil dealer, and they were going to charge me $1.60 or $1.80 per gallon," she said. "I couldn't believe it."
For years, Ms. Reindhardt has been hearing of an oil cooperative from her friends and neighbors. A few days ago, when she realized how oil prices had risen, she called the New Jersey Citizen Oil Group, a nonprofit group that buys oil in bulk and sells it at a discount to its 6,000 members. Through the cooperative, Ms. Reindhardt is paying 50 cents a gallon.
Kendall Miller, the organization's director, said the cooperative sells about nine million gallons a year to its members, saving them about $1.5 million. Prices for the oil vary, but are capped at 99 cents a gallon.
Ms. Reinhardt said the winter would be hard on people with older homes, like hers, who are doing all they can to conserve. "Last month it was pretty cold," she said. "And winter's not over yet. I needed to do something." MARIA NEWMAN

HEADLINE: High Cost of Oil Seeps Its Way Into Everyday Lives, and Pocketbooks;
Cashing In on an Alternative

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
In recent weeks, the jump in fuel oil and gasoline prices has emerged as a potent political issue. Homeowners who rely on oil heat have had to deal with surprisingly high bills this winter, but the impact is more widespread, rippling throughout the economy in many ways. And, as with all economic dislocations, some have actually benefited from the situation.
As the new year opened to mild weather, Mike Ruff struggled to drum up business for his Brooklyn plumbing and heating installation company. Then serendipity struck: the recent increase in oil prices, coupled with an onslaught of bone-chilling temperatures, ushered a wave of customers his way. 
 Mr. Ruff and his company, KeySpan Energy Solutions, are among the few who have profited from the increase in oil prices. As more and more homeowners convert from oil to natural gas, some plumbing companies are finding that what began as a sluggish winter may turn out to be a boom season. "Since the last week or two of January, we've seen a big jump in the number of customers," Mr. Ruff said.
Mr. Ruff said that business has increased by about 60 percent over the same time last year. In an average year, conversions to gas heat account for about 15 percent of the company's total gross revenues, he said.
Mr. Ruff's company is a subsidiary of KeySpan Energy, which, along with Consolidated Edison, provides gas to homes in New York.
Bob Mahony, a spokesman for the parent company, said that while oil prices were hovering about $2 per gallon, an equivalent amount of natural gas cost about $1.15. Converting from oil to gas heating usually runs $3,500 to $4,500, Mr. Ruff said. And if a home does not have a gas line, it has to be installed by the utility.
Of course, those homeowners who have filled up their standard 275-gallon oil tanks will likely hold off switching, said Kenneth Lukaszewski, one of the owners of Komfort Plumbing & Heating, based in Brooklyn.
He said he already has conversion jobs scheduled for March and April, when many people will have used up their oil.
"Business is good right now," Mr. Ruff said. "We just don't know how long the oil prices will stay up. And in this business, you're always at the mercy of the elements." EDWARD WONG

HEADLINE: Productivity's Up, and What of It?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I wish to express my gratitude for Stephen S. Roach's essay ("Working Better or Just Harder?", Op-Ed, Feb. 14). I work in the field of computers (and have done my share of retail and sales), and I cannot recall working a nine-to-five day in many moons.
Over the past years my day has grown to at least 10 hours (sometimes more) and six days per week (if not seven). 
 My situation is not unique; many of my friends and colleagues work under the same pressures. It really amazes me that (according to the experts and futurists) we were supposed to be living like the Jetsons and worrying about our two-hour workdays.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
By Bus to Luang Prabang, Home of Laotian Kings

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
THE bus looked empty -- but then I spotted the chicken. Tethered in the aisle by a foot of plastic string, it squawked and skittered around my ankles as I hauled my backpack down the row of empty seats. I chuckled to myself and settled in for a long haul: an 11-hour ride through the mountains of Laos on a public bus from Vientiane to Luang Prabang.
The bus is my least favorite mode of transportation, but in many countries it is the only convenient way to get around. To my surprise, I've discovered that bus travel can be almost luxurious -- I've traveled on buses with starched cotton antimacassars, whistle-clean restrooms, attendants serving hot coffee, and movies on video. But as a general rule, when chickens are in the aisles, attendants serving free coffee are not. 
 I'd given some thought to this particular bus trip before arriving in Laos late last November. The State Department has been alerting citizens for about five years to the hazards of traveling the 300-mile stretch of Highway 13 between Vientiane and Luang Prabang, Laos's two major tourism spots. In 1995 a French expatriate travel agent and his staff were ambushed and murdered by Hmong rebels in the mountains just outside the village of Kasi, halfway between the two cities. Since then, United States Embassy personnel in Vientiane have been forbidden to travel to Luang Prabang by road.
But the only other way to get from Vientiane to Luang Prabang is to fly on Lao Aviation, an option that also carries a caveat (the embassy says that its maintenance is not up to international standards).
I was keen to get to Luang Prabang. In every account I had read, from Norman Lewis to Lonely Planet, it was described as one of the highlights of Southeast Asia. The former capital of the Laotian Kingdom, Luang Prabang commands a spectacular setting on a hilly peninsula on the Mekong River. Dozens of ancient, glittering Buddhist temples share space with elegant French-Laotian colonial buildings from the 20's and 30's that are being restored by Unesco World Heritage architects.
But I didn't want to take a foolish risk. So I made it my mission while in Vientiane to gather information. I asked all travelers and expats I met if they'd traveled to Luang Prabang recently, and by what means. Most of the backpackers had taken the public bus, and were puzzled by my questions about security. A sun-baked Australian said, with a snort, "The biggest danger on the ride is claustrophobia," explaining that there are more passengers than seats. A couple from England described the security measures the Laotian Army had put in place north of Kasi since the 1995 attack: checkpoints, patrols and an entire village of army personnel living alongside the highway.
At the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane, I learned that once a day Lao Aviation flew a French-built plane to Luang Prabang. Embassy officials occasionally flew on it. The fare was $55 each way, cash, no discounts.
I decided, finally, to go by bus and fly back on the French plane. I liked this plan -- I'd get a good look at the Laotian countryside and avoid retracing my steps by flying back to Vientiane. I'd save half the plane fare. The bus cost only $4 one way.
Actually, it cost me $8, because I bought two seats. The Australian's warning about claustrophobia struck home -- flying economy class from New York to Asia, I'd spent 15 hours crammed next to a Chinese grandmother with a squirmy 4-year-old and a five-gallon jar of pickles balanced on her lap. I didn't want a repeat experience, and so, waving the two tickets at the attendant in charge of seating people on the bus, I grabbed a window seat and placed my pack on the seat next to me.
The bus was full, and I figured we'd be off any moment. But then the attendant leaped into action, producing a stack of child-sized plastic stools. I realized then that this guy's job wasn't to collect tickets but to figure out how to jam as many people into the bus as possible (while waving them away from the empty seat that I'd bought). The aisle filled up with stools, people (mostly Laotians and about five other foreigners), packages. I could no longer hear the chicken, muffled under a sack of rice.
In Vang Vieng, a river town about three hours up the road that's become a backpacker's haunt, the flat farm scenery of lowland Laos transformed into a bizarre landscape of enormous, mountain-sized rocks that tumbled across the river plain like geological dice. After a while we entered the foothills of the mountains that range across Laos's interior, and the asphalt road began to bend and twist. This is the point, during bus trips, when my stomach generally starts to tighten, but the driver handled the dead man's curves so slowly and carefully that I relaxed -- he was a pro. The mountains, intricately terraced and patchworked farmland in the lower areas, fading out to bare rock at the top, became more gorgeous with every mile.
With each change of elevation, the village huts altered architecturally. Laos is a nation cobbled together from dozens of ethnic groups, and the ethnicity changes with altitude. So, it appeared, did the economy -- the higher we rode, the more difficult life seemed. At the very top of the ranges, I noticed that the roadside billboards advertising toothpaste and soft drinks disappeared completely. Such basic commodities were out of reach for the Hmong who live in the highest, least fertile, parts of the mountains and scratch out a bare-bones living.
After about six hours we stopped in Kasi for a lunch of sticky rice and laap (a Laotian dish of marinated beef and vegetables) at a roadside hut with outdoor tables. Then we reboarded and moved through the zone where the ambushes had occurred. The English couple's report had been accurate -- the next 15 miles were a gantlet of military checkpoints, patrols and barracks. Beyond this stretch, the mountains grew steeper, and the last four hours to Luang Prabang were all downhill. The passengers relaxed, and the driver turned on a cassette of Laotian folk songs, music soothing and plaintive, like an old country crooner's or an Irish lament. The sun set in shades of red and purple over a lumpy blanket of fog-misted mountains. I fell asleep and awakened to a put-put of motorbikes and shadows of mountains against a moonlit sky: Luang Prabang.
At 8:30 the next morning, Thanon Xieng Tong, Luang Prabang's main drag, had the bustle of a college town in September. Backpackers chain-smoked in sidewalk cafes, meandered in and out of tourist gift shops, headed down to the Mekong to bargain for passage on rice boats. I was in minor shock over the scene. Because travel in Laos is problematic, I'd figured that Luang Prabang would be nearly empty of tourists. But foreigners were everywhere, and on the main street they outnumbered locals. I sat down for a cup of cappuccino and eavesdropped on the conversation. The travelers were coming in, by sixes and sevens, on rice boats from the Thai border to the north, and by the dozens on a direct flight that operated several times a week from Chiang Mai, Thailand.
The night before, I'd arrived at the Villa Santi, the guest house where I'd booked a reservation by phone, only to find that my reservation had evaporated. Profuse apologies from desk clerk and manager increased my suspicions that the hotel had given my room away. Hot and irritable from the road, I insisted the manager call to find me a room in another hotel -- but every place he tried was full. Finally I dug in my bag and found the number of a place recommended by an expat in Vientiane, a guest house too new to be in the guidebooks. That is how I ended up in the Villa Xieng Mouane, in a sweet, tidy and spacious room with high ceilings and large wooden shutters that opened to a view of the temple across the street. My hosts, all women, lounged in the tiny lobby all day watching Thai soap operas, and smilingly collected my rent -- $25 a day, cash.
I could see how Luang Prabang had gotten its reputation as the Shangri-la of Southeast Asia. Every block of the peninsula it occupies had something to see: an enormous temple complex with low swooping gold-leafed roofs, or an ornately decorated wooden French colonial house. I spent the cool of the morning walking around the perimeter of the peninsula, on dirt streets that offered fabulous views of the Mekong far below. What I noticed, though, is that the local folk, unlike the citizens of Vientiane, did not automatically smile and say hello when one passed -- a casualty of tourism.
LUANG PRABANG is a small town, with a handful of resident foreigners, most working in projects related to tourism and restoration -- so small that when I wandered into the Unesco office I was able to chat with one of the French architects. He showed me their giant map of the town, pointing out that my guest house was a 1920's French-Laotian landmark building. Almost all the buildings in the downtown area had been cataloged and guidelines for preservation had been developed. "Our goal is to keep the historic area as a living city," he said with a sigh, "but families are selling their houses, moving out, and converting them into guest houses."
There was much to discover beneath this bustle of development and restoration, but I had only five days. I was resigning myself to a routine of sightseeing and backpackers when I remembered the other bit of information I'd collected in Vientiane -- the name of an American woman, an art restorer, who was working at Luang Prabang's Royal Palace Museum on a Rockefeller Foundation grant.
I found Bonnie Baskin in the basement of the museum, painstakingly cleaning the grit from an 18th-century Laotian sacred bronze drum with a Q-Tip. She was wearing a T-shirt and a long, gold-embroidered Lao silk sarong, called a sin. It was gorgeous. I asked her where she got it, and she smiled, put down her Q-Tip and said, "Let's go shopping."
Bonnie had been in Luang Prabang for five months with her husband, a doctoral candidate at Berkeley. The Royal Palace Museum, where she was cleaning drums and restoring wooden and gold-leafed Buddhas, is the most interesting place in Luang Prabang. The mansion, built in the 1920's, was the home of Laos's kings, and a repository for all their state treasures. For many years after the last Laotian king and his queen were whisked away by the Pathet Lao in 1975 (they died in a "re-education camp"), the palace remained empty, neglected and in disrepair. But the Laotian government is now promoting tourism, and trying to reconstruct a national identity disrupted over years of Communist rule. And so the palace and its treasures are being restored.
Bonnie accompanied me as I strolled, barefoot, around the palace, admiring the cases of bronze and crystal Buddhas, the imposing red-and-gold throne room, and the massive, Art Nouveau wooden bed of the king, with three royal elephants carved into the head. At the royal garage, we peered into a crack in the locked door and ogled the king's shiny white Edsel.
We walked to the marketplace, where Bonnie pointed out the different styles of sins, and how to spot one of good quality. I bought the fabric and hired a seamstress to sew the skirt to my dimensions (she did it overnight, and superbly, for $2). We ate laap, sauteed morning glory roots and sticky rice with our fingers at lunch for around $1.50, in her favorite stall. Together we climbed to the top of Phousi mountain to visit Luang Prabang's best-known shrine, Wat Phousi.
Sometimes you get lucky when traveling, and I felt doubly so: I'd found a guide and I'd made a friend. I was sure my good fortune had everything to do with the circumstances of my arrival. Breezing into town on a direct flight from Thailand, I could have gone for days speaking to no one but Australian backpackers.
I made a mental note: ride the bus more often when traveling, and always grab the seat next to the chicken.
 
The bottom line
I spent $33.02 a day on lodging, food, and museum and temple admissions during five days in Luang Prabang, Laos. Note that in Luang Prabang it is still uncommon for businesses, hotels and restaurants to accept credit cards.
 
Transportation
I took the public bus from Vientiane to Luang Prabang. It takes 11 hours and leaves on a very casual schedule in the early mornings from the night market in Luang Prabang. The one-way fare, bought at the depot, is $4. In its most recent Consular Information Sheet, the State Department says that people traveling on Route 13 north between Kasi and Luang Prabang "run the risk of ambush by insurgents or bandits."
To return from Luang Prabang I flew Lao Aviation; in Luang Prabang their number is (856-71) 212 172. A one-way ticket cost $55, and credit cards are not accepted. The State Department says the U.S. Embassy, citing concern about safety and maintenance, advises its personnel to "limit domestic travel on Lao Aviation to essential travel only." But I was told by an embassy spokeswoman that embassy officials do occasionally travel on the company's French-built A.T.R. plane. It is possible to request a booking on that specific aircraft.
Walking is the best way to get around Luang Prabang. Small motorcycle taxis can be hailed on the street -- rides are around 25 cents.
 
Lodging
I stayed in a pleasant, clean room with bath in the Xieng Mouane Guesthouse, 86 Ban Xieng Mouane, telephone and fax: (856-71) 252-152, a carefully restored French-Lao building dating from the 1920's. My single room cost $25 a night, cash.
The Duang Champa Auberge and Restaurant, Kingkitsarah Street, telephone and fax (856-71) 212 420, has large loftlike rooms, with balconies overlooking the river, at $25 to $35 a night.
 
Food
In the back area of the Dara market, vendors sell delicious lunches of sticky rice, stir-fried morning glory stems, and laap, ground beef or chicken marinated in lime juice and spices. I ate lunch there nearly every day for about $1.50.
At the Malee Lao, Phou Vao Road, (856-71) 252-013, and Pak Huoy Mixay (856-71) 212-260) restaurants, you can have a three-course feast for three people for around $6. At Pak Huoy Mixay my feast included purple sticky rice, a savory, not-too-hot chicken curry, and spring rolls filled with succulent peppery mushrooms.
 
Museums and Temples
Temples are the main attraction of Luang Prabang. The two best known, Wat Xieng Thong and Wat Phousi, charge a small admission fee of around 70 cents. The smaller temples are free.
The onetime home of the Laotian king Sisavangvong is being restored. Visitors should see the Royal Palace Museum, (856-71) 212-470), with its grand formal throne rooms and priceless Buddha figures. It is open from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. daily, closed for lunch between 12 and 1. Admission is $1.33. DAISANN McLANE

HEADLINE: At Penn Station, Changes, and More Changes;
After Over $100 Million in Renovations, A $788 Million Terminal, but No Tunnel

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

 BODY:
IT is neither the suffocatingly low ceilings on the New Jersey Transit platforms nor the last-minute track information that bothers Kris Martin most about her daily commute.
"You know what the worst part of commuting is?" said the 39-year-old Ms. Martin of Matawan, who rides New Jersey Transit every day to Manhattan, where she works as a database manager. "The commuters. Everyone is so rude. Let's say you're standing and waiting for a train -- someone will come up and just push you out of the way. Everyone's jockeying for position." 
 Jeffrey N. Leibell, a lawyer and Long Island Rail Road commuter, agrees. "You become an automaton," said Mr. Leibell, 42, a family man and Little League coach in Great Neck who undergoes a Jekyll-to-Hyde transformation at Penn Station. "It's a rat race, one foot in front of the other. It turns us into unpleasant people."
But a lot of time and money is being spent to make things more pleasant for more than 300,000 commuters from New Jersey, Long Island, New York City, Washington, Boston and elsewhere who squeeze through Pennsylvania Station and the dizzying network of subways every day.
The commuters include about 200,000 rail passengers -- 44,000 on New Jersey Transit, 144,000 on the Long Island Rail Road and 8,200 on Amtrak, the railroads estimate. Another 100,000 people use the Seventh and Eighth Avenue subway stations, and 150,000 rail commuters scurry from their trains to the subways every day, according to the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation, which was set up by New York State to guide a vast project to build a new station just to the west.
The grand expansion project will convert half of the James A. Farley General Post Office, across Eighth Avenue from Pennsylvania Station, into a new hub for Amtrak that will also serve New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road commuters.
The 21 tracks, which are reached along 11 platforms, run east-west, passing below the post office before emerging into the Metropolitan Transit Authority rail yard west of Ninth Avenue. Even now, the post office ships some mail by rail, and in addition to creating new ticket booths and waiting areas, the Farley project will expand access to the tracks westward. The vaulted Postal Service lobby for the public along Eighth Avenue will remain.
For all of the hundreds of millions of dollars and years of effort, the project will not add any tracks or platforms. But Charles Gargano, chairman of the redevelopment corporation, said the easier access and fuller use of the existing platforms would increase the current station's capacity to handle the 30 percent increase in traffic that is projected by 2010.
Transportation experts generally welcome the Farley plan.
Lee Sander, director of the Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University who is also a member of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, called the future station "a terrific project" that would improve conditions for everyone who uses Penn Station.
But Peter Haynes, a longtime commuter and a former L.I.R.R. employee who founded the Long Island Rail Road Commuter Campaign last August, is doubtful the project will have much effect, particularly since it will add neither tracks at the station nor much-needed train tunnels under the Hudson River or the East River.
"I'm all for new stations, but if they don't do anything underground, it's going to be very limited in effect," said Mr. Haynes, 42, a computer consultant. "My impression is, it's sort of like window dressing for people coming up from Washington or Philadelphia. It's a poor replacement for the old Penn Station."
Even before the the Farley project gets under way -- the target completion date is 2003 -- Amtrak is completing a $37.5 million renovation of the waiting area it shares with New Jersey Transit. Its modern design is intended in part to reflect Amtrak's sleek 150-mile-an-hour Acela train, which began local service between Boston and Washington this month. Yet that waiting area -- much of which is still not open to the public -- will be ripped up and turned into retail space when the Farley project is up and running.
"We anticipated being in that building with the Acela service for five years, and we had to bring it up to the same level as our trains," said Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman for Amtrak.
In another corner of the gloomy, windowless station, behind plywood construction barriers, New Jersey Transit is also ripping up huge concrete slabs and taking down heavy riveted I-beams to install new escalators, elevators and ramps to improve access to Tracks 1 through 12. This $105 million project -- "a station within a station," Saundra Lautenberg, New Jersey Transit's program manager for engineering and construction, calls it -- is scheduled for completion in mid-2001.
And on the East Side, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the Long Island Rail Road, has approved $1.5 billion in its 2000-2004 capital plan to cover about half the estimated cost of linking L.I.R.R. tracks to Grand Central Terminal by 2010. Because 60 percent of Long Island riders head north and east from Penn Station, the Grand Central connection should sharply lower the number who use Penn Station, said Christopher P. Boylan, deputy executive director of the M.T.A.
Conversely, the link would be convenient for Westchester and Connecticut residents who now arrive at Grand Central but would rather arrive on the West Side.
Officials are careful to point out that the Farley project -- which will largely serve Amtrak passengers -- will by no means snub suburban commuters, who will be able to buy tickets and reach their trains from the new station.
"It's the busiest passenger transportation facility in the world, and growing," Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat and the main proponent of the Farley project, said of Penn Station in a recent interview. "It's not just restoring grandeur. It's getting out of that hole in the ground."
For now, the renovation of the New Jersey Transit-Amtrak waiting area and tracks at the western end of Penn Station mimics the $90 million project that the L.I.R.R. completed in 1995. That modernization effort added a fourth concourse for access to Tracks 13 through 21, to say nothing of air-conditioning and better heating.
As a measure of the improved access that is envisioned, the total number of elevators, escalators and stairways will rise to 160 from the current 94 when the two projects are complete. The Farley project will add 46, while New Jersey Transit will add 20.
That said, the new areas in the Farley building will not have direct access to Tracks 1 through 4 -- frequently used by New Jersey Transit -- because they do not extend far enough west, said John Gerber, executive vice president of the development corporation. However, Farley will be connected to Tracks 5 to 21 by the Long Island Rail Road's west end concourse, which already runs from Track 21 south to Track 13, and will be extended to Track 5.
"That has always been a concern of ours," said John Gerber, the development corporation's deputy executive director.
Reminiscent of the original Penn Station's glass train house, the Farley project will incorporate the post office's vast skylight as the ceiling of what essentially will be a huge atrium.
"It's going to be a series of balconies that descend right down to the tracks," Mr. Gerber said. "So we're going to bring the natural light back down to the tracks."
Though the Farley project will further ease congestion, Mr. Boylan said, crowding is hardly the only problem as the station exists right now.
An Amtrak commuter, Christina Sterner, who commutes from Philadelphia twice a week, said that arriving at Penn Station was a numbing experience at best, especially compared with what she calls the spiritual uplift she gets from the 30th Street Station in Philadelphia or Union Station in Washington.
"I think that this is one of the ugliest train stations that exists," said Ms. Sterner, managing director of Baryshnikov Productions in New York, the ballet dancer's production company. "Philadelphia has a beautiful station, Washington has a beautiful station, and New York should. There's no sense of anything at Penn Station. It's nothing."
The Farley project, on the other hand, is something.
Highlighted by a 150-foot-high framework of steel and glass rising 75 feet above the roof of the Beaux-Arts post office, the new station is envisioned as a return to the grandeur that was lost when the old Penn Station -- a matched bookend to the Farley building when they were both completed in 1913 -- was demolished in 1963 to make way for Madison Square Garden and the undistinguished office towers above.
The new station will also be a major element of Amtrak's future, highlighting its new Acela service in an effort to woo airline shuttle passengers along the Northeast Corridor with the convenience of downtown-to-downtown high-speed trains.
Interestingly, plans for the new station include direct rail service to John F. Kennedy International and Newark International Airports -- though La Guardia, where the shuttle flights to Washington and Boston operated by Delta and Eastern arrive and depart, is left out of the loop.
Proponents of the new station are are optimistic about its outcome, particularly because it is being headed by Mr. Gargano, who can readily recite precise dollar contributions from nearly a dozen sources of funds at the federal, state and city level. Among his various job titles, Mr. Gargano is also commissioner of the New York State Department of Economic Development and vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the other agencies involved in the Farley project.
The price tag for the new station, put at $484 million when President Clinton presented the plan last May, is now estimated at $788 million, including $188 million in track work and improvements to the post office, said Tony Bullock, Mr. Moynihan's chief of staff.
Groundbreaking is expected this fall, though the completion date varies, depending upon which agency is asked.
The redevelopment corporation says at least some operations will begin in 2003, and the new stations will be fully operational no later than early 2004. But Ms. Dunn of Amtrak puts the date at 2005.
"Putting it as politely as possible, Amtrak's feeling has, all along, been that the PSRC's date of completion on the Farley project has always been very ambitions and highly unlikely," Ms. Dunn said. "So we have always worked under the assumption that we would be in the building in 2005."
Mr. Gerber of the redevelopment corporation said bid specifications, to be advertised this summer, will include his agency's 2003 time frame.
"We'll show them," Mr. Gerber said, referring to skeptical Amtrak officials.
The sources of money, according to Mr. Gargano, include these:
*The Empire State Development Corporation, of which Mr. Gargano is also chairman, which will issue bonds to be repaid by the lease of retail space, $155 million.
*The federal Department of Transportation, $140 million.
*The United States Postal Service, $120 million.
*Amtrak, $68 million.
*New York State, $75 million.
*New York City, $25 million.
*The Federal Rail Road Administration, $56 million.
Additional funds will come from federal loans and lines of credit, and officials say neither the L.I.R.R. nor New Jersey Transit will have to contribute in the form of fare increases.
Just what to call the new station -- and the current Penn Station, for that matter -- has barely been broached. Senator Charles E. Schumer, New York's other senator and also a Democrat, has introduced a measure in Washington to name the new station after Mr. Moynihan, though the senior senator insists he is embarrassed by the prospect.
The annex and the main lobby of the Farley Building, named for a former United States postmaster general from New York, will continue to be used by the Postal Service, though some operations were shifted to a nearby complex several years ago. The Postal Service will continue to own the entire Farley complex, but will lease the station portion to the redevelopment corporation for 99 years.
The post office is actually two buildings, the original built in 1913 and an annex dating from 1934, though connecting walls make them appear as one. In the new design, by the architect David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the station's main concourse will occupy the space between the original building and the annex, which is now mainly truck bays. Plans also call for retail shopping and waiting areas on four levels stepping down to the train platforms, most of which already extend below the post office.
The main post office building was designed by McKim, Mead & White, who were also the architects for the old Pennsylvania Station, which was built in 1910. In what is universally reviled today as a crime against architecture, the old station was torn down in 1963.
The post office was designed to compliment the old station, in the same Beaux-Arts style, and Mr. Moynihan's hope is to recapture the grandeur of the original station.
Some of that grandeur can be glimpsed in photographs hanging in the Amtrak ticket area near Eighth Avenue and 33rd Street. And on the walls at the foot of the escalators on 34th Street, just west of Seventh Avenue, full-sized terra-cotta reliefs of toppled Corinthian columns by the sculptor Andrew Leicester commemorate the old station's bygone classicism. Another of Mr. Leicester's series, "Mercury Man," is in the main L.I.R.R. concourse, near a bakery named, perhaps suitably for the crowded station, Hot & Crusty.
Will the station succeed as a station and ease commuters' pain? More tracks are a frequent suggestion, but railroad officials have said the capacity of the tunnels has to be addressed first.
Mr. Haynes, the former L.I.R.R. employee, said an East Side connection to Grand Central would be a help for Long Islanders, but he doubted it would happen "in my lifetime."
Robert Yarrow, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a private organization, also said the lack of new tracks was a shortcoming.
Still, Mr. Yarrow said the new station's striking combination of classical and contemporary architecture, and on such a grand scale, would instill in New Jersey and Long Island commuters the same vaunted feelings that Grand Central did for Metro North riders like him.
"I do it every day," he said. "It's an ennobling experience. It makes you feel good about coming into the city."
But Ms. Martin, the New Jersey commuter, said what she looked for in a railroad was on-time performance, not nobility.
"To be honest, it really doesn't matter to me," she said. "If I had the choice between having a beautiful station and my trains running on time and being clean, I would much rather have my trains run on time."
But she did say her biggest problem with commuting was rude commuters, and proponents of the Farley project say one of its main effects will be to soothe those savage 9-to-5ers.
"People are rude, they're shoving and pushing because they're enduring an unacceptable level of discomfort," said Mr. Bullock, Mr. Moynihan's chief of staff. "What the Farley project provides is a glorious new setting."
Mr. Leibell, the Long Island lawyer, said he was no student of behavior, but that seems to make sense to him: "If it were a larger space, if it weren't as crowded, if there were more options and easier access to the track level, and maybe just having it posted where your train is, it would make the commute easier, improve the experience, kind of take the edge off."

How Waiting Can Pay Off In a Star Role

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
CLOTHES FOLDER. Dog walker. Morning bartender. Those are a few of the glamorous professions undertaken by Mark Setlock during his self-described "squalor days" a few years back, when he was living on a "syringe-lined" street in the East Village, learning about urban ecology. "I saw mice, I saw cockroaches," Mr. Setlock said cherrily. "I saw silverfish for the first time."
 
 That was then. Nowadays, his prospects are considerably brighter, starring as he does in the one-man show "Fully Committed," a satirical look at a day in the life of a rerservations clerk at a four-star restaurant besieged by high-powered customers demanding tables. The play, written by Becky Mode, a friend of Mr. Setlock's, and directed by Nicholas Martin, opened to raves in September at the Vineyard Theater and moved to a commercial run at the 180-seat Cherry Lane in December. A representative of the show said recently that "the box-office staff have had some astonishing encounters with people who are not accustomed to being told no." Sounds familiar.
 While a steady paychecks is always nice, Mr. Setlock, 31, said his success was particularly meaningful because much of the play's fictional action was born out of his own miserable experiences as an actor and day laborer. "Oh, the things I've seen," he said wryly over breakfast one morning in the East Village. "All grist for my mill."
 The chief grist: from 1994 to 1996, Mr. Setlock, an unemployed actor from the Midwest, was a reservations clerk in the basement of Bouley, the high-end, four-star New York restaurant founded by the chef David Bouley that closed in 1996. (Ms. Mode worked there briefly, checking coats.)
 And while Bouley is never mentioned, there is plenty of obvious biography at work in "Full Committed." In the play, after all, Mr. Setlock protrays Sam, an unemployed actor from the Midwest, struggling through his reservations shift in an unnamed, famously popular New York restaurant.
 Along the way, Sam deals with, as did Mr. Setlock, all manner of the petulant and the persnickity. There is Bunny Vandevere, a monied matron from the Upper East Side; Jean-Claude, the ur-French maitre d'; and Byrce, a manic, and imaginary, assistant to the model Naomi Campbell who requests a "no-fat, no-salt, no-dairy, no-sugar, no-chicken, no-meat, no-fish, no soy tasting menu."
 In all, Mr. Setlock plays 35 characters, switching from role to role wit deadly rapid-fire accuracy. Accents - Southern, German, Southern German - roll out of his mouth synchronized with their attendant facial acrobatics. By his own account, it is a skill he discovered while growing up in a middle-class Cleveland neighborhood, imitating Bugs Bunny on the Saturday morning cartoons. "I played a lot alone," he said. "Television was my friend."
Mr. Setlock went on to study acting at Kent State University, where he once fooled a radio disc jockey into believing he was Dr. Ruth Westheimer and took questions about sex from the public. (Dr. Westheimer's voice - channeled through Mr. Setlock - is heard in "Fully Committed.")
 He continued his training at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., where he met Ms. Mode, then he came to New York in 1992 to find work as an actor. Instead, he got a job at te Gap on West 34th Street, then the largest Gap in the world. "You would live in fear that the manager would say, 'Mark, go work on the pant wall,' " he said. "It was enormous."
 He settled into a small apartment in the East Village and worked with a variety of downtown companies, including Todo Con Nada and Target Margin. But getting paid for acting proved trickier. He quit the Gap, and after stints as a "dog exercise specialist" and a bartender - "people started tapping on the window at noon" - he landed the Bouley job, juggling six phone lines eight ours a day.
 He got a final callback for the one-man show "The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me" and, more agonizingly, was cast in the workshop but not the actual production of a little muscial called "Rent." "I thought I would go insane," he said. "I was tortured."
 After "Rent" moved to Broadway in 1996, Mr. Setlock landed a role as an understudy and quit Bouley. It would prove the starting point for "Fully Committed."
 For months, he had been entertaining friends, including Ms. Mode, with tales of obnoxious restaurant patrons. He kept a list over his phone with categories of callers - "hags," "depressed secretaries," "television anchormen" - that he would point to as the calls came in.
 Ms. Mode, who had long wanted to write a play set in a restaurant, thought his experiences might be a jumping-off place. The producer Daivd Stone agreed. "I thought it was a great idea for a play," Mr. Stone said, "because everyone I knew lived their lives trying to get into restaurants."
 Mr. Setlock and Ms. Mode developed the piece together, making lists of types of characters while Mr. Setlock improvised his calls. To find the voices, he relied on his past job experiences. "A lot of the voices are really similar," he said. "My brother is just my father faster."
 Mr. Setlock is scheduled to perform until September. There is some talk that "Fully Committed" may become a television show, though Mr. Setlock is uncertain how he would fit in. "I'm not that interested in restaurants," he said. "I'm interested in freaks, the odd people in the world. I like to take them all in and see if I can spit them back out."

Whatever Happened to the Class of '93?

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
IN the fall of 1995, two years after graduating from Stanford University, Diane Barrum received a call from her sophomore roommate, Srinija Srinivasan, asking her to join a company recently founded by two other young Stanford alumni, Jerry Yang and David Filo. The deal was this: In exchange for 18-hour days, grinding away in overcrowded conditions, Ms. Barrum would get in early on a hot phenomenon called the Internet. But Ms. Barrum, happily employed by a biotechnology company based in Seattle, said, "I just was not ready to take the risk."
Ms. Barrum, as it happens, turned down the chance to be employee No. 30 at Yahoo, the wildly successful Internet portal, or gateway, which has a current market value of about $82 billion. Now she is back in Palo Alto and, after a hiatus of traveling and joblessness, has recently joined an Internet start-up, too. "Of course, I wish I'd taken it," she said of the Yahoo job. "One can only imagine what I'd be worth." 
 Such tales of quick riches and missed opportunities can be heard in many places these days, among people of all ages. But probably nowhere else was the swift, unexpected divergence of fortunes thrown into such stark relief as among Ms. Barrum and her peers in the Stanford undergraduate class of 1993, who burst on the scene just as the World Wide Web was coming into its own.
Of course, only a small percentage of recent college graduates have become Internet millionaires. But there are enough from elite universities, like Harvard, M.I.T. and Stanford, that they are influential far beyond their numbers. A look at a sampling from this one Stanford class -- among the earliest to have so many success stories -- makes this phenomenon clear.
The university says it does not track the wealth of its alumni, but school officials acknowledge that many in the class of '93 have become wealthy unusually early. It includes five of the six founders of the Internet portal Excite (now Excite@Home); three founders of the online retailer of sporting goods, FogDog; one of the first employees of Yahoo; a pioneer of Trilogy Software; and a top executive with LinkShare. Many of these 20-somethings are now worth tens of millions of dollars, if not more. When the class gathered in 1998, it donated $163,000, then the largest class gift for a five-year reunion -- only to be surpassed last year by the Internet-rich class of '94.
In part, these technology Wunderkinder strike a chord with their peers because they have achieved the dual aspirations that have defined Generation X: being passionate about work and free from authority. But their existence has also raised the whole generation's visions of early wealth and, for some, served as a nagging reminder of what might have been.
"This generation has made its money so young that it is almost unnatural," said Alan Wolfe, a sociologist who heads the Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College. "Whether you are repelled by these young millionaires or attracted by them, they cannot be ignored. In that sense they are icons for their peers."
Stanford, in the heart of Silicon Valley, has turned out a disproportionately large number of Web superstars. With top-rated programs in science and engineering -- and almost 9 out of 10 undergraduates taking at least one computer course -- the palm-lined, mission-style campus here has been ground zero for the high-technology boom.
The members of the class of '93, like Ms. Srinivasan and Ms. Barrum, have seen their fates spun wildly apart by the Internet -- not so much because of any particular differences in cleverness or ambition, but because some of them happened to be very well placed as the transformation began.
Jim Hennessey, the school's provost and former dean of the engineering school, noted that 1993 was "right on the cusp of the Internet explosion." Like others on the Stanford faculty, he is acutely aware that the success of the Internet has ushered in a new era of student life.
On its statistical face the Stanford class of 1993 was almost indistinguishable from its predecessors. It was split roughly 50-50 between men and women; about 7 percent of the class were African-American; 17 percent were Asian-American. Students' majors were not particularly skewed toward technology. Of the 1,730 degrees conferred, 6.6 percent were in engineering, 10 percent were in economics and 16.7 percent in biology or human biology.
But the more forward-looking graduates were ideally positioned for the Internet economy. Not only had they been exposed to many new technologies -- e-mail was nearly universal among Stanford undergraduates by 1992, as were experimental high-speed telecommunications lines -- but they also were entering the working world well before the Internet sector was swamped with start-ups.
Rich alumni are nothing new for the university that graduated William Hewlett and David Packard (class of '34), the founders of one of Silicon Valley's first high-technology businesses. But not so long ago, Stanford graduates expected success to take time.
Herrant Katchadourian, a sociologist, is tracking an earlier Stanford class, from 1981. In his book, "The Cream of the Crop," graduates at their 10-year reunion reported widespread contentment with their salaries, which averaged $54,000, roughly $18,000 above the average then for college graduates. Many said proudly they expected to earn as much as $1 million a year -- 10 to 15 years down the road. Perhaps when he revisits them next year at their 20-year anniversary for a new book, he will not find them so sanguine.
But the Internet has given the class of '93 and its successors a far different timetable -- and even greater ambitions. Consider Krista Rollins, 27, a 1993 graduate who is now vice president for communications at Trilogy Software, based in Austin, Tex. She once thought that her biggest career concerns would be salary, title and the number of people she managed, but her idea of success has changed. "It used to be much more about the long term," she said. "Now it is about how to become very successful in the next three or four years." By her mid-30's, or 40 at the latest, Ms. Rollins hopes to be "very financially independent" -- that is, rich enough to quit.
The Stanford faculty has noted the changing culture with mixed emotions. James Montoya, vice provost for student affairs, has sensed the acceleration in the student life cycle since the early 90's, as undergraduates have moved to "Internet time."
"It used to be 'I'll get out of school and travel and see the world before I settle down,' " he said. "But what I hear now is 'This is the time to join a start-up, before I get old and have responsibilities, like a family.' "
Needless to say, not every member of the class of '93 shares this computer-industry intensity about striking it rich. According to a class survey for the five-year reunion, some 12 percent called high technology (separate from engineering) their field of endeavor -- a big proportion, compared with most universities. But plenty of other graduates were still in medical training or had begun other careers, while some were taking time off to raise children. Still, the existence of such sharply divergent paths has made young graduates feel like players in some sort of modern lottery.
 
The Programmer
A Physics Major Makes Good
Graham F. Spencer came to Stanford in 1989 with the intention of becoming a physics major, but he was drawn more to computers. After finishing school, he formed a company with five college friends to build a software navigator for the newly emerging Web. Mr. Spencer, whose major was computer science, is now acknowledged as the programming genius behind the portal known as Excite.
In the lean first years, he worked 80-hour weeks, getting by on beans and rice. But before the company's initial public offering in 1997, Mr. Spencer netted 600,000 shares of Excite stock; his stake would be worth $64 million at the time that the company merged with At Home in January 1999.
"Do I deserve the money I have? I struggle with that a lot," the soft-spoken Mr. Spencer said. "On some level, I'd like to believe I have certain skills that have made me successful. But how can being a little more competent at computer science make you so much richer?"
He describes himself as "anti-ostentatious," saying he does not go in for "three cars a year and Champagne." He and his fiancee own a cozy new home in Palo Alto. In this money-flooded valley, of course, plain-vanilla dwellings can run $1 million, but this is no gizmo-filled palace; it is cramped enough that the dining table occupies part of the living room.
His great indulgence has been travel -- weekend trips to Vail to snowboard, or to Hawaii to surf. Recently, he and his fiancee took a two-week trip to Italy, often staying in $500-a-night rooms on the Amalfi coast. He also works at home whenever he feels like it, padding around the house in his stocking feet and keeping his Siamese cat company.
Despite his low-key lifestyle, Mr. Spencer acknowledges that money has altered his relationships with peers. He met his fiancee at Excite and said it made a difference to both of them that she had her own substantial stock holdings and had "earned" her right to partake of the lush life.
By contrast, after his hometown newspaper in Columbia, S.C., splashed his net worth across the front page last year, high school friends, he said, started treating him "like some sort of billionaire, which I am definitely not."
Mr. Spencer plans to retire by the age of 40; in the meantime, he wants to get a better sense of how to live without organizing all his time around work. "I hope I get more comfortable with spending money," he said wistfully. "The problem is that the only people I know well who have this kind of money are like me -- they just got it. None of us knows what we want to do with it yet."
It is almost as if Mr. Spencer is waiting around for legitimacy. He has sold less than 5 percent of his stock and still puts in long hours at Excite as a kind of superprogrammer. While he says he is "basically a volunteer" -- meaning that he does not have to work if he does not want to -- he says he feels inextricably tied to the long-term success of the company. "I deliberately try not to keep score on my own net worth, because that is gross at some level," he said. "I want to feel that we've built something sustainable, something great."
 
The E-Retailer
Lots of Money But No Dates
At 27, Robert Chea, founder of FogDog, does not look a day over 19 but has the poise of a 50-year-old chief executive. As the son of Cambodian immigrants who struggled to put him through school, Mr. Chea felt he had to be rich. "I'd be disappointed in myself," he said, "if I did not make a lot of money." But even as a sophomore in college, Mr. Chea wanted more than a fat bank account. He wanted autonomy.
Then, he remembers, his concept of success came from an AT&T commercial. The advertisement, which aimed to showcase the liberating power of the company's digital technologies, showed futuristic scenes of people receiving faxes in huts on tropical islands. "That was my measure of success," he said, "to be at a level where I had enough free time to sit on the beach, but was still connected to the rest of the world."
The path to controlling his destiny almost eluded him. He arrived at Stanford in 1989, interested in philosophy and archaeology. But his mother nudged him toward electrical engineering. Upon graduating, he applied to law school, thinking that he would pursue a career as a patent lawyer. But through a classmate's father, Mr. Chea got caught up in showing sporting-goods makers how to use the Internet and eventually formed the company that would become FogDog.
Mr. Chea, by his own accounting, has worked terrifically long hours seven days a week for five years. But the results are clear. Last fall, FogDog moved its headquarters from a nondescript, cramped office park outside San Jose, Calif., to a glorious, light-filled loft near Redwood City, complete with stainless-steel fixtures and blond wood desks. It is the sort of office that Heather Locklear, the "Melrose Place" diva, would inhabit if she ever signed up to do a sitcom about being chief executive of an Internet start-up. Mr. Chea owns 1.15 million shares of FogDog, which went public in December. The shares are now worth $10.25 apiece, making his stake worth $11.8 million.
There have been personal costs. In his five-year class reunion book, for example, Mr. Chea said only half-jokingly that he had not had a date in five years. "It's by choice dammit," he wrote. At a recent birthday party, his friend Andy Chen, FogDog's co-founder, felt so bad for Mr. Chea that he invited all 70 employees to write down names of date possibilities in the form of a classified ad, letting Mr. Chea choose three.
Mr. Chea no longer has any desire to live on a tropical island and talk to his officemates -- essentially his whole social universe -- by phone. And he has less desire to absent himself from the technology culture that so enthralls him. "I can't imagine what it would be like," he said, "to be a lawyer and hear about the Internet all the time and not get to participate in it."
 
The Nonconformist
Looking Beyond The Internet Life
While the potential of the Internet economy has dazzled many graduates, it has left a distinct minority of the 1993 class feeling nonplused -- and left out.
In another time, San Francisco might have seemed like a slice of paradise to Elaine Romanelli, a music major who prides herself on spontaneity and artistic aspirations.
But the Bay Area landscape has changed greatly since the 1970's, when Stanford was a center of radical student protest and San Francisco a mecca of counterculture.
Ms. Romanelli misses being part of a generation that followed its heart, regardless of money. She has tried hard to hold on and recreate a bit of that spirit. Her work life since college has included being a co-founder of a business that provided "haikus on demand" (two for a dollar) and quitting a respectable job in marketing to try her hand at professional singing. She lives in a dilapidated Victorian house in the grittier South End of San Francisco and frequents a local cafe that is a sympathetic home to creative types.
Still, as a Stanford graduate living in San Francisco, she has not been able to avoid the Web rat race. "The Internet is a pervasive presence here," she said. "Many, many jobs are Web-based, and e-commerce just sort of permeates everything."
Ms. Romanelli is a petite woman with delicate features, and her eyes flash when she is asked about the Stanford stars of the moment. She is far from worshipful. "The thing that gets to me," she said, "is that the people getting wealthy are young, single boys." In previous generations, she said, real wealth could take decades to accumulate, but her peers "don't have coping tools" for the vast sums they are now able to spend.
"They are getting rich and spending their money on 'supersoakers' " -- as exceedingly expensive toys like Jaguars and automated houses are known in the parlance of Silicon Valley. "They don't have a sense of philanthropy or giving back to the community -- or any community outside of work."
The expansion of the Web leaves Ms. Romanelli cold, even a little indignant. "A society of people who write to each other solely by computer is not my idea of utopia," she said. She has watched friends and classmates devote themselves to Internet start-ups, and she believes their lives are too narrow.
"There is an insane amount of money, but also an insane amount of work. It is like slave labor." The computer, she said, "was supposed to facilitate life; out here, it has worked the other way around."
 
The Web Editor
Feeling Fulfilled In Love of Work
Despite the financial gulf that separates Ms. Srinivasan, who joined Yahoo, and Ms. Barrum, who did not, they remain comfortable friends. There is no animosity or visible jealousy, just a tacit acceptance of changed circumstances. For a dinner of take-out Indian, Ms. Srinivasan pays and Ms. Barrum picks it up.
It helps that, like many other young Stanford millionaires, Ms. Srinivasan, who had an interdisciplinary major called symbolic systems, eschews aggressive displays of wealth. She lives in a loft-style duplex in one of the least fancy areas of Palo Alto, among graduate students and Internet worker bees. She dresses in print skirts with matching pastel T-shirts, a low-cost uniform of working women everywhere.
When she and Ms. Barrum, who majored in human biology, spread out on the tan sofas in her living room to chat, they talk about family (both are close to their parents), about friends from college and about eventually juggling careers with children (both are single). When it comes to money, both acknowledge they are more than a little stunned at the turns of fate. "Don't get me wrong -- Srinija has worked very hard and I always knew she would be successful at something," Ms. Barrum said. "But I never thought she'd be a big deal at a company at age 28, and she did not either."
Ms. Srinivasan, who as the fifth employee at Yahoo is probably worth tens of millions (she will not say), concedes that her sudden wealth has taken her by surprise.
"I've worked hard and I don't think I am dumb and I am deeply passionate about my work," she said. "But in no way has my effort been proportionately rewarded. Emotionally, that is something you have to come to terms with."
She considers herself successful, not because of what she is worth, she said, but because she loves what she does. As vice president and editor in chief of Yahoo, she leads a team that sorts the ever-expanding constellation of Web sites into categories that will make sense to subscribers. When tough calls arise at work -- like whether messianic Jews should be listed under Judaism or Christianity -- she has stomachaches that keep her awake at night.
"I honestly spend my days in ways that I feel are engaging, compelling and fulfilling and rewarding," she said.
Ms. Barrum nods at her friend's words. "When I was living away from Palo Alto, I felt there was all this excitement going on here and all these young people having a real effect on so many companies," she said. "I felt I was missing out. I came back not for the money, but for the excitement."
Still, she adds that living life in the Internet center, it is difficult to be 28 and not yet a success without occasionally feeling uneasy. "You can't deny that knowing people who have gotten wealthy changes your perspective on some things," Ms. Barrum said. "I feel like I am falling behind in the race to buy a house, a race to achieve monetary goals."
Will she have another shot at Internet riches? "Yahoo is not going to slip into the ocean," she said, "but it is not going to make a lot of millionaires anymore."

HEADLINE: In The Region/Westchester;
A Fourth Major Store for Yonkers Retail Complex

BYLINE: By Mary McAleer Vizard

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
THE first Target store to open in Westchester will be joining a growing list of retailers and other businesses in a $150 million shopping center still taking form near Austin Avenue at this city's northern border.
 
 Target, a general merchandise discount retailer that will build up to 125,000 square feet of space, will be joining two ther big-box retailers - a 103,000-square-foot Home Depot and a 135,000-square-foot Costco - at the 500,000-square-foot shopping center on its 100-acre site off exit 6-A of the New York State Thruway.
 Stew Leonard's, the Connecticut-based dairy and grocery chain known for its disneyesque touches such as talking cows and singing milk cartons, became the first store to open at the center in September. (The chain's other stores are in Norwalk and Danbury.) Costco followed in October and Home Depot opened last month.
 In addition, Sojourn Hotels, of Canton, Ohio, is close to submitting a proposal to build two hotels at the center on a site near Stew Leonard's, said Richard Altman, president of Sojourn. "It's directly next to the store, which we like since it's really not just a store, but a destination," he said. "They get tour buses of Japanese and other tourists, and those people might like to have someplace to stay overnight."
 Sojourn, which is a franchiser, plans to build a "Hilton product and a Marriott product with a total of 459 rooms," Mr. Altman said. "One will be an extended-stay, and the other a regular hotel."
 The struggle to build something on the hilly property, which is owned by the Westchester County Industrial Development Corporation, dates back almost 20 years when it was first planned as an office park.
 Those early plans were thwarted by the site's virtual inaccessibility, until 1992, when the county built a Thruway interchange, Exit 6-A, specifically to make the land accessible for an office project. By then, however, the office market had dried up and the Morris Companies, of Secaucus, N.J., which is developing the project, turned no retail.
 But the going has not been easy. First, there has been an ongoing controversy about an additional access road to the site. That issue has now been resolved with an agreement, reached last October, calling for a portion of Sprain Road in Greenburgh to be reopened. It is to remain open until another access road can be created, linking the center to Jackson Avenue, an east/west thoroughfare in Greenburgh.
 Before the shopping center materialized, the seldom-used road had been closed because it had become a junk dumping ground. The developer wanted it reopened to accommodate shopping traffic, but Greenburgh refused, contending that the road would impose an unfair traffic burden. The town sued the developer and the City of Yonkers to keep the road closed.
 The New York State Supreme Cout intervened and worked out an agreement with all parties. "We're living by the agreement," said Paul Feiner, Supervisor of Greenburgh, "and there hasn't been as much traffic as we originally anticipated."
 Now another lawsuit has been filed against the developer, concerning rent payments due the Westchester County Industrial Development Corporatin. "It's a question of when certain increases should take effect," said Robert Morris, chief executive of the Morris Companies. "I contend that they (the county) didn't complete certain things in an agreed-upon time and shouldn't get the increases now. We're hoping to settle."
 Larry Schwartz, chief adviser to County Executive Andrew J. Spano, said that the developer had been irresponsible and owed the taxpayers money. "We're suing to evict him from the property if he doesn't comply," Mr. Schwartz said. "As far as we're concerned, we're lived up to our share of the bargain."
 MEANWHILE, Target has all its approvals and is ready to take its place at the center. "It only needs to apply for building permits, which should be routine," said Edward Sheeran, Mayor John Spencer's special assistant for economic development.
Target Stores, based in Minneapolis, has been looking for a Westchester location for several years now, according to the company spokeswoman, Patty Morris, who is not related to Robert Morris.
 "We think the Yonkers site is a great location for us," she said. "We like to locate where there's already a retail presence. We like to see an established flow of traffic and the potential for growth, and Yonkers has both."
 The site where Target may now locate was originally planned to be a multiplex movie theater, Mr. Morris said. "But we couldn't accommodate the size theater operators want nowadays." The new Target store is expected to have 90,000 to 125,000 square feet of space.
 "It's probably going to be the smallest of our three prototypes," Ms. Morris said. The prototypes range from the Target Store, which is between 90,000 and 125,000 square feet, the Target Greatland, with 135,000 square feet and the Super Target Greatland, with an average of 177,000 square feet. "The Super Target is 80 percent a Target Greatland store and 20 percent a grocery store," Ms. Morris added.
 As of March, Ms. Morris said. Target will have 921 stores in 45 states. There are 18 in New York State and 7 in the New York metropolitan area, including Queens and Long Island. "And we're considering locating in two additional sites in Westchester, one in White Plains and in Mount Vernon, but those are in the very preliminary stages," Mr. Morris said.
 THE site is now zoned for office and retail use only, and will have to be rezoned to allow for the building of hotels, Mr. Sheeran said. The two hotels are expected to be eight stories in height, Mr. Altman added.
 Stew Leonard Jr., president of Stew Leonard's, said that with every new tenant at the center he's seen a uptick in his business. "It's like being on a plane and hitting an air pocket," Mr. Leonard said. "It just blips up with each new opening."
 Although the whole process wit the access road has been a "long ordeal," Mr. Leonard said, he's happy with his new 130,000-square-foot store.
 "We're projecting that we'll do over $80 million in business this year," he said. "Our experts projected that we need to do between $95 million and $105 million a year. And considering that this is our first year, we're well on our way. The first year is always lower because you're just getting started. With each new store and project that opens we're growing. I'm confident we'll meet our expectations."

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Stephen S. Roach asks whether or not what he rightly terms "the productivity miracle" is a mirage (Op-Ed, Feb. 14). The answer is simple: no -- it's real.
In manufacturing, increases in productivity are especially pronounced. Productivity in manufacturing has grown by nearly 4 percent a year during the current business cycle. It accelerated to nearly 5 percent a year from 1996 to 1999 -- more than twice the rate of productivity growth in every other sector. 
 I agree with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman: the technology revolution has been the single biggest cause of productivity improvements. Manufacturing, which contributes nearly 60 percent of all technology advances, is the single biggest contributor to productivity.

HEADLINE: A Jazz Club Turns 65, No Retirement Planned

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
As a jazz-crazed member of the Hot Club of Newark, 17-year-old Lorraine Stein made her first pilgrimage to the Village Vanguard in 1940, five years after it opened in a former basement speak-easy on Seventh Avenue South in the West Village. She and American jazz have not been the same since.
It was at the Vanguard that she met her first husband, Alfred Lion, the founder of Blue Note records. It was there, too, some years later, that she fell for the Vanguard's owner, Max Gordon, and left Mr. Lion to become Lorraine Gordon. 
 Along the way the funky, pie-wedge Vanguard, with its superb acoustics, became a jazz shrine, a refuge for musicians holing up against the onslaught of rock 'n' roll in the 1950's and 60's, a soapbox for poets and an incubator for entertainers from Lenny Bruce and Woody Allen to Judy Holliday, Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Harry Belafonte, Wally Cox, the Weavers, Bobby Short and the comic billed as Prof. Irwin Corey, the world's foremost expert.
And so, with an indomitable presence encompassing 60 of the Vanguard's 65 years, Mrs. Gordon is to preside tonight at a private 65th birthday party for the club that is expected to draw many of the artists who have played it over the years, including Roy Hargrove, Jim Hall, Tommy Flanagan, Marian McPartland, Joe Lovano, Etta Jones, Houston Person, Joshua Redman, Geri Allen, Jimmy Heath, Eric Reed, Cedar Walton and Helen Merrill.
"I've invited every musician in town," said Mrs. Gordon, 77. While a jam session is not officially on the agenda, she said, "if they don't play, this is not a jazz club."
It was in 1934 that Mr. Gordon, a Lithuanian immigrant who stumbled into the nightclub business, opened the first Vanguard on Charles Street. The police quickly plastered it with violations, and the following year he reopened at 178 Seventh Avenue South, where the club remains. Mrs. Gordon took over when her husband died at age 86 in 1989.
"You figure it out as you go," said Mrs. Gordon, who wasted little time asserting herself, replacing staff members and hiring new lawyers.
"Max was beautiful," she said. "He taught me how not to do things."
"When I have to make a decision," she said, "I ask, 'What would Max do?' Then I do the opposite."
With a throaty laugh she added, "Ahh, I say those things; I don't mean it exactly."
Nonetheless, friends say she is clearly her own woman, keeping a sharper eye on business than Mr. Gordon did, although when it came to salaries, Professor Corey cracked, "Max gave musicians jobs, and they'd still be unemployed."
Backed up by her younger daughter, Deborah, Mrs. Gordon is everywhere at the Vanguard, taking reservations over a rotary telephone in the ancient former kitchen that serves as the office, monitoring deliveries and, once the music starts, shushing talkers.
"She's tough, always has been," said the jazz writer Nat Hentoff, who credited Mrs. Gordon with "the taste and business acumen" to keep the 123-seat club clear of faddish distractions and commercialism and focused on mainstream modern jazz. Mr. Hentoff, who wrote the introduction to Mr. Gordon's 1980 memoir, "Live at the Village Vanguard," said that despite the danger of being shushed, "When somebody calls me from out of town and asks me, 'What club should I go to?' I always say, 'You can't go wrong at the Vanguard.' "
Tough? Mrs. Gordon begged to differ. "That's not tough, to tell people not to use a cell phone, not to talk while the music is on," she said. "You can cough. You can sneeze. But this is not a conversation pit."
Perched at a back table the other afternoon and sipping a vodka and soda in a wine glass, she monitored a tide of deliverymen and technicians setting up for the night's 9:30 and 11:30 shows.
"Can I help you?" she challenged one stranger.
"I'm the piano tuner," he said.
"O.K.," she said, "try."
New as she was to the nightclub business when she took over -- "He didn't really listen to me," she said of her husband -- Mrs. Gordon was no neophyte when it came to jazz. As a teenager in Newark, she and her brother, Philip, were charter members of the Hot Club, whose young jazz devotees shared an obsession for collecting recordings and frequenting jam sessions in mostly black dives like the Alcazar, then featuring a stirring trumpet player named Jabbo Smith. (To her delight, in 1979 she rediscovered him, alive and playing in the show "One Mo' Time" at the Village Gate, and helped revive his career.)
Times were hard, she said. "But we didn't know it was the Depression. We thought it was normal."
When she met Mr. Lion, a debonair immigrant from Germany, he showed her his record collection and she was smitten.
"My mother loved him, too," Mrs. Gordon said. "She said, 'He's too good for you.' "
When the war came and Mr. Lion was drafted, she followed him to Texas, where they were married. He was discharged with an eye ailment, and the couple resettled in Greenwich Village, socializing with jazz giants like Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet and Miles Davis.
They also met a struggling Hells Kitchen pianist named Thelonious Sphere Monk and, impressed, tried to sell his records. Mrs. Gordon said she had some under her arm during a 1948 visit to Fire Island where she spotted Max Gordon in a restaurant eating a danish. She appealed for a gig at the Vanguard for Monk.
"He looked me over and said, 'Well, I just happen to have a week in September,' " she recalled.
One thing led to another, she said, and by 1949 she was Mrs. Gordon. The pair became a fixture on the jazz scene, turning up at Newport, R.I., and dividing their time between the Vanguard and other clubs that Mr. Gordon opened, the Blue Angel and Le Directoire. While raising their two daughters, Mrs. Gordon became active in campaigns against nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War, joining demonstrations for Women's Strike for Peace around the world.
From her perch in the back of the club last week, Mrs. Gordon suddenly noticed that a photograph on the wall was askew. "Hey!" she called to technicians setting up. "You knocked the picture. That's Jabbo, my little Jabbo."

HEADLINE: The Microsoft-U.S. Negotiations: Tough Talk in Chicago

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The closing arguments in the Microsoft antitrust case in Washington tomorrow promise to provide moments of courtroom theater, but it is the settlement talks taking place behind closed doors in Chicago that are the greater drama.
The private deliberations, mediated by Richard A. Posner, a leading antitrust scholar and chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit there, are at the settle-or-fold stage. 
 The stakes are high for both sides in what one person close to the talks called "the ultimate antitrust poker game." Walking away from the settlement talks, under way since November, could well mean waiting a couple of years for a final outcome in the courts, including appeals.
For the government, that means the risk inherent in a change of administration, perhaps a Republican one with different views on antitrust matters. For Microsoft, the risk is a likely legal ruling that it violated the law, a wave of follow-on private antitrust suits, and the business uncertainty of whether it will eventually have to cope with severe sanctions or more modest ones.
Still, the odds are against a settlement, people close to the talks say. The trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, indicated earlier to both sides that he might delay closing arguments if the government and Microsoft appeared near a settlement. But the court issued a statement at the end of last week, detailing the itinerary for tomorrow's proceedings.
The government and Microsoft remained far apart as of last week, despite a painstaking process employed by Judge Posner to try to find common ground. Typically, he has met one day a week in Chicago with each side, not bringing the two camps together. Over the last few months, the representatives have included William Neukom, Microsoft's in-house counsel, and David Boies, the Justice Department's chief trial lawyer in the case.
Judge Posner, according to people close to the talks, has issued sets of written questions, sometimes a dozen or more to each side: How does this contract work? How does this technology work? Often, he will then ask one side about a conflicting answer from the other. The process is intellectually rigorous, these people say, and there is homework.
"His approach is iterative, step by step," a person close to the talks said. "He's not retrying the case, but he's really gotten down to immerse himself in the contracts and the technology. He's not interested in just hearing lawyers talk."
To try to encourage a settlement, Judge Posner assured both sides at the outset of the talks that if they reached an agreement, he would publicly support it, including testifying before Congress, if asked. Under the Tunney Act, a court must give at least 60 days' notice for public comment before a proposed settlement can be approved. That review period is intended for a court to hear witnesses and accept friend-of-the-court briefs. But it would also provide time for wider public scrutiny in other forums, including Congress.
The differences between the two sides -- sizable throughout the trial that began in the fall of 1998 -- grew even wider in November, when Judge Jackson issued his findings of fact. Though not a final ruling, his findings emphatically supported the version of the case presented by the Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft. He found the big software maker to be a monopolist whose business practices stifled competition and harmed consumers.
The judge's findings gave the government a very strong hand at the settlement talks. Microsoft's settlement proposals, a person close to the talks said, must "effectively address every issue raised by the government." Yet one of those issues, and an accusation in the suit, is that Microsoft tied its Internet Explorer Web browser to its industry-standard Windows operating system to unfairly squelch competition.
Microsoft denies the charge, saying that its browsing software is an integrated feature of Windows, not a separate product. Microsoft also cites a June 1998 ruling in a related case that supports its stance.
Beyond that, Microsoft has maintained throughout its long-running dispute with the Justice Department that its bedrock principle has been to defend what it calls the "freedom to innovate" -- that it must be free to design Windows as it sees fit, unfettered by government oversight.
The Justice Department maintains that a monopolist like Microsoft can indeed engage in anticompetitive product designs, and that the practice should be curbed.
What is more, the issue of linking products is just one of several obstacles. "The government has such a strong hand at this stage," said a Silicon Valley software executive who has talked to the Justice Department about legal remedies, "I can't imagine there is any settlement the government would find acceptable that Microsoft would agree to."
Judge Jackson's findings, according to government officials, suggest one of two types of remedies: a powerful set of prohibitions on Microsoft's conduct in the future or breaking up the company in some way to foster competition.
The trouble with "conduct" remedies -- like forcing Microsoft to ensure rivals access to its Windows technology and prohibiting exclusive contracts -- is that they require the government or courts to constantly police Microsoft's actions. Both the courts and the Justice Department are reluctant to take on such a role.
"A long list of serious conduct remedies really does start to look like regulation, continually looking over Microsoft's shoulder," a person close to the talks said. "You can argue that a breakup is extreme and a bit scary, but its virtue is that it is simpler and less regulatory."
Microsoft has refused to even consider the breakup option at the settlement talks. Steven Ballmer, its president and chief executive, has said it would be "absolutely reckless and irresponsible for anyone to try to break up this company."
Indeed, recent strategy within Microsoft has, if anything, drifted in the opposite direction -- to more tightly bind its various groups together. It is, for example, trying to take its Windows business model from desktop computing and extend it to the Internet with what it is calling "next-generation Windows services," a software platform for the Internet that other programs run on.
And after shifting strategies for years, Microsoft's consumer group, which includes the MSN Web site and MSN Internet access service, is adopting a course that links it closer to the software plans of the rest of the company. Asked recently if there was any consideration of making the consumer Internet unit a stand-alone company, Richard Belluzzo, head of the consumer group, replied: "Our strategy is built around software integration with the rest of Microsoft. It wouldn't make any sense if we were a separate company."
In striking Internet deals with other companies, Microsoft has sold itself as a concern that can supply the widest array of necessary software and services, from Windows to WebTV to software for smart phones. Last November, the Tandy Corporation, with its 7,000 Radio Shack stores, struck a distribution deal with Microsoft. It chose Microsoft over a competing bid from America Online, explained Leonard H. Roberts, the Tandy chairman, because he believed that Microsoft could provide the "the technology glue, the operating system" for all the Internet devices he plans to sell in his stores.
What if, as some have proposed, Microsoft is broken into three to five companies as the result of the antitrust case? "One way or another, that case will resolve itself," Mr. Roberts said. "Whatever form Microsoft is in -- and I hope it's in the same form -- they have committed that they will be able to deliver this technology."
"I've signed a contract that is 120 pages long that was also signed by Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer," he added, "and it includes ultimate issues of change of control."
Such language is reasonably standard in business contracts, Microsoft insists, adding that it has not altered its contracts with an eye toward the possibility of a breakup.
In any case, Microsoft's message to business partners is: there is no need to worry.
Some antitrust experts agree. Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department and now an economist at the Brookings Institution, personally advocates breaking up Microsoft into four companies -- three competing operating system companies and a fourth that takes Microsoft's other software businesses. "But if Microsoft fights this long and hard enough in the courts," Mr. Litan said, "I think it can avoid a breakup."

HEADLINE: Saku Journal;
A Postmodern Plague Ravages Japan's Workers

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SAKU, Japan

 BODY:
The air is remarkably crisp in this town at the edge of Japan's ski country. The streets are uncluttered with traffic. And unlike in high-decibel Tokyo, the prevailing sound here is that of silence.
But for all its appearance as a haven of tranquillity, this city of 60,000 stands on the front lines of a stress-related condition that is quietly ravaging Japan. 
 When the Japanese government announced recently that one-third of the working-age population was suffering from chronic fatigue, few stress-haunted denizens of Tokyo, with its heavy overcrowding, unrelenting pace and impersonal nature, could have been taken aback.
What is far more surprising is that quiet little towns like these are being hit every bit as hard by a poorly understood condition that leaves many of its victims incapacitated for months or years on end.
In the hulking, modern general hospital at town's edge, 32 percent of the patients hospitalized in the internal medicine and psychology ward are being treated for chronic fatigue syndrome, a diagnosis that is made only after six months of severe, continuous fatigue in the absence of any known organic illness.
Many of them, indeed, are immediately recognizable by the heavy air of weariness that surrounds them as they slump in their seats, waiting to see their doctors in the ward.
"I could not even get up from my chair before my treatment," said Hiroaki Sugihara, 36, who was hospitalized here for three months recently. "I was too tired to walk, and it was very difficult for me to get around, even in the house."
With treatments of antidepressants, biofeedback and counseling, Mr. Sugihara has found his life slowly edging toward normality since, although he says he still lacks stamina. "Of course I would like to become energetic again, but I don't think I will ever be able to work as hard," he said. "I just want to be healthy."
Mr. Sugihara's condition may have been related to the overwork that he said he once commonly engaged in as a freelance computer programmer. Indeed, during Japan's boom years, in the 1970's and 1980's, as many as 10,000 people were believed to die annually from "karoshi," or overwork.
But doctors here say that the explosion of chronic tiredness and of chronic fatigue syndrome in particular is a distinctly postboom phenomenon. More complex than simple overwork, they say, it is increasingly associated with the stresses placed on this society since it began its dramatic economic slide more than 10 years ago.
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the syndrome affects perhaps 4 to 8 percent of the population over 18. Its symptoms, which include weakness, profound lassitude, difficulty concentrating, insomnia and low-grade fever, remain equally unexplained.
But in Japan, where the condition appears to be far more prevalent, the experts lean toward explanations that emphasize societal mutations far more than their American counterparts.
"The number of patients like these is on the increase," said Dr. Toshiho Iida, a specialist in treating chronic fatigue syndrome at the hospital. "As for the causes, they are many, but we think they have to do with the changes in Japanese society which have been accelerating in the last five or ten years.
"The changes range from eating habits, environmental problems, housing, and many other things too. In the urban areas, for example, people no longer know who lives next door to them anymore, and that produces stress."
During Japan's economic downturn, many businessmen and workers have taken their change of fortune personally. Struggling against huge debts, many have found themselves working harder and harder to meet their commitments and maintain their living standards.
"Part of it is stress, part of it is depression-related, part of it may be caused by infection, and part of it is certainly overwork, because overwork is still rampant in Japan," said Dr. Masumi Minowa, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Public Health, whose recent random study of 4,000 people found that 35 percent had experienced chronic fatigue for at least six months.
Among the social factors that therapists and researchers are pointing to as potential contributing factors are family relationships, which are under great strain.
Grown children, with few job prospects are slower to leave the home. With a fast-aging population, more aged parents, too, must be cared for. And rather than committing themselves to the rat race their parents have known, many younger children are opting for unconventional lifestyles that involve far more attention to enjoyment and far less emphasis on hard work.
Satoe Yamada, 24, a rail-thin worker at a photo lab, described her condition -- which led to rapid weight loss, and left her with pronounced bags under her eyes -- as an onslaught of stress. Bit by bit, feeling exhausted by her contacts with others, she said she began to withdraw. Then, when she switched to a new job, where she was asked to work long hours, her bout began with chronic fatigue syndrome -- a condition she had never heard of.
"There were various problems at home," she said, not wishing to explain further. "I was feeling stress from my family and friends. And I had a new job.
"I couldn't sleep even when I wanted to sleep. And the food I ate didn't seem to nourish me. I lost 10 pounds in two weeks."

HEADLINE: Brazil Collides With I.M.F. Over a Plan to Aid the Poor

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 2

 BODY:
A new Brazilian government plan to spend more than $22 billion on social programs in the next decade has led to a squabble with the International Monetary Fund, which argues that the money should be used to reduce Brazil's indebtedness rather than to fight poverty.
The unusually public dispute has added to the unpopularity here of the I.M.F., which in the past has been accused of provoking recession in Brazil and trampling on the country's sovereignty. It has also given President Fernando Henrique Cardoso badly needed political help, forcing opposition parties to line up behind him and potentially strengthening his hand in continuing talks with an I.M.F. now more leery than ever of being seen as heartless. 
 Brazil and the I.M.F. reached agreement in November 1998 on an emergency three-year $41.5 billion rescue package, the terms of which were modified early last year after Mr. Cardoso was forced to allow the national currency, the real, to be devalued by 40 percent. The accord calls for the Brazilian government to cut spending and raise taxes, and sets targets and timetables for actions like reducing public sector debt and selling state-owned companies.
But nationwide municipal elections are scheduled for October, with the presidential and legislative races to follow in 2002, and the government coalition is eager to offer voters something more than continued austerity. In addition, Mr. Cardoso promised in his 1998 campaign that if elected to a second term, he would take steps to lessen the country's chronically skewed income distribution and other social inequalities.
Though living conditions for the poor improved in the 1990's, economists calculate that at least half the work force in this nation of 165 million still earns the minimum wage of $77 a month or, in the case of millions working off the books, even less. According to government statistics, the poorest 10 percent of the population accounts for only 1 percent of national income, while the richest 10 percent receives nearly half.
As presented to Congress, the government's plan calls for at least $2.25 billion a year over the next 10 years to be funneled into a Fund to Combat and Eradicate Poverty for additional spending on things like education, health and infrastructure. Minister of Finance Pedro Malan maintains that money gained from privatization and new luxury taxes will enable Brazil to finance the program without deviating from the I.M.F. agreement.
In an interview with the Brazilian news magazine Veja last month, before the dispute erupted, the United States secretary of the treasury, Lawrence H. Summers, said that the government here "in the long term, needs to invest massively in the Brazilian people," citing education as a top priority. But in an interview last week with the Dow Jones news service, the I.M.F. representative in Brasilia, Lorenzo Perez, said the government plan "established a precedent that could become dangerous."
"Brazil already spends a significant amount of money on social programs," he said. "This money has to be used more effectively."
The Brazilian reaction was sharp and immediate, with the government and the opposition demonstrating a rare unity. Leaders of the leftist Workers Party called for Mr. Perez's expulsion, while Mr. Malan said "the allocation of budgetary resources has never been a theme of discussion with the I.M.F. and is not within its area of competence."
A day later, Mr. Perez reversed course, saying that after further study of the plan, "I don't think its implementation would involve macroeconomic risks."
That appeared to be the end of the matter. But on Feb. 13, the departing managing director of the I.M.F., Michel Camdessus, left Brazilian officials seething anew over remarks he made at a United Nations trade conference in Bangkok, apparently unaware that Mr. Perez had retracted his original criticisms.
"We in the I.M.F. believe that what is important in the strategy of a country is not to get rid of the problems of the poor by doing some charity from time to time," he said. "What we see as more important is to make room in the budget of the government and of the states for increased social spending on a permanent basis."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ARIZONA TIES;
A Beer Baron and a Powerful Publisher Put McCain on a Political Path

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Feb. 19

 BODY:
When Senator John McCain of Arizona describes the people who shaped his life, he invariably dwells on the influence of his father and grandfather, both distinguished Navy admirals and larger-than-life figures. Less widely known are the roles played by two other powerful men in launching his political career.
Mr. McCain's father-in-law, a wealthy beer baron named James W. Hensley, gave Mr. McCain his first job out of the Navy and helped bankroll his crucial first race for Congress in 1982, enabling Mr. McCain, a political newcomer, to outspend and defeat better-known opponents. 
 Even today, Mr. McCain's position as one of the wealthiest members of Congress is derived from his wife's share of her family's Anheuser-Busch beer distributorship here and extensive real estate investments through the company, holdings worth more than $10 million.
In his rise to political influence, Mr. McCain, who had no ties to Arizona until he married Cindy Hensley and moved here in 1981, also won the critical blessing of the city's business establishment through his close friendship with another of the state's power brokers, Darrow Tully, the publisher then of the state's dominant newspaper, The Arizona Republic. "Duke" Tully led an ad hoc group of business executives and self-appointed political kingmakers known as the Phoenix 40, whose backing helped Mr. McCain in that first Congressional race and assured his Senate victory four years later.
Bruce Merrill, a professor at Arizona State University, who conducted polls for Mr. McCain's first Congressional race, said, "In 1982, a lot of party leaders felt John was an outsider and he won a narrow victory largely because he had access to family resources and the support of The Arizona Republic."
Today, Mr. McCain, 63, is running for the Republican presidential nomination as a champion of campaign finance reform and an opponent of special interests. Yet a look at his rapid ascension shows that his early career was founded on special-interest money, and that he might never have emerged from the competitive world of Arizona politics without the steadfast backing of this city's political and business establishment.
Many of those people have remained important benefactors. Hensley family members and employees have contributed more than $80,000 to Mr. McCain's campaigns since 1982, according to federal election records, and he has collected tens of thousands more from businesses in Phoenix.
Despite his family's financial ties to the beer business, Mr. McCain has not supported the liquor industry in Congress and has publicly excused himself from voting on measures affecting the business, according to antiliquor groups.
 
The Family Beer Business
Mr. McCain had thought of going into politics before moving to Arizona. In 1976, three years after his release from a North Vietnamese prison, he briefly considered running for Congress from Florida, where he was stationed with the Navy.
He was then transferred to Washington as the Navy's liaison to the Senate, and his appetite for politics grew. He was a charming war hero, and a skilled public speaker, and he also built up strong political connections in Washington. Still, as a third-generation Navy man, he had not lived in any one place for long, and he lacked a political base.
That changed after he met Cindy Hensley, his second wife. Mr. McCain went to work in public relations for Hensley & Company, his father-in-law's beer distributorship. It was his first job outside the Navy. People who knew Mr. McCain then said the job was merely a means for him to meet people in the state, and lay the groundwork for his political career.
"Hensley had the Budweiser distributorship for the entire state and he didn't need any PR," said William Shover, a retired executive at The Arizona Republic, who met Mr. McCain in those early days. "They created a job for him."
Acquaintances describe Mr. Hensley as an astute businessman who never sought the limelight even after he became one of Arizona's richest men. Still, while he could give his only child's husband a job, he could not give him entree into the political and business elite. The liquor industry was never part of the civic hierarchy, and Mr. Hensley's own past was not a ticket to the establishment.
In World War II, Mr. Hensley was a bombardier on a B-17 shot down over the English Channel. After the war, he went to work for Kemper Marley Sr., a rancher who had grown rich and powerful selling liquor after Prohibition.
In 1948, while working for the Marley operation in Tucson, Mr. Hensley and his brother, Eugene, were convicted of filing false liquor records and conspiracy in the illegal distribution of several hundred cases of whiskey. James Hensley received a suspended sentence and Eugene was sentenced to a year in a federal prison camp. Five years later, James Hensley and Mr. Marley were charged with violating federal liquor laws again, but they were acquitted.
In 1955, James Hensley acquired the Anheuser-Busch distributorship for Arizona, and fueled by the state's rapid growth and booming economy, he built it into Arizona's 12th-largest privately held business and one of the nation's largest Budweiser distributorships. The company sold nearly 20 million cases of beer last year and has 500 employees. It also has diversified into real estate holdings throughout Arizona.
The business remains in family hands, but Mr. Hensley, now 80 and in poor health, has gradually withdrawn from the day-to-day operations. He declined to be interviewed for this article.
Mrs. McCain draws an undisclosed salary as the company's vice chairman and a major shareholder, but she is not involved in the daily operations.
Along with contributions to Mr. McCain's campaigns, Hensley & Company employees have been generous contributors to state legislators. In 1992, a former lobbyist accused the company of making contributions to state legislators in the names of its employees, an illegal tactic known as bundling. Company officials denied the accusation, the former lobbyist withdrew it, and no one from the company was charged with any wrongdoing.
 
Last Domicile Hanoi
After his arrival in Phoenix, Mr. McCain did not have to wait long for his chance at politics. Representative John Rhodes, a veteran Republican from the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, decided not to seek re-election in 1982.
Mr. McCain defeated two longtime Mesa Republicans in the primary, including a state senator, and he went on to win the general election. He defused accusations that he was a carpetbagger by saying the place he had lived longest was Hanoi.
Records show that he outspent his opponents in part through access to his wife's family wealth. He received $11,000 in contributions from Mr. Hensley and company employees. More significantly, though he had little money of his own because he had been a career naval officer, his wife's fortune allowed him to lend $167,000 to the campaign, which was permissible under campaign laws then.
Additional money was raised by another powerful Phoenix businessman who served as a big benefactor, Charles H. Keating Jr., the corrupt savings and loan operator whose ties to Mr. McCain continue to haunt the senator. Years later, Mr. McCain intervened with federal regulators on behalf of Mr. Keating's savings and loan, an episode that has tarnished the senator's reputation as a reformer.
Mr. McCain's wife and father-in-law retained an 8 percent interest in a shopping center project put together by Mr. Keating in 1986 until the project was sold in 1998.
The senator's financial disclosure filing with the Senate indicated that the investment was sold for a profit of between $100,000 and $1 million. But Robert Delgado, president and chief executive of Hensley & Company, said that Mrs. McCain and her father had lost half of the $360,000 they invested and that the transaction was reported as a gain because of complexities in Congressional disclosure requirements.
Mr. Delgado also challenged published reports suggesting that Mr. Keating had set up the investment as a favor to the senator. Mr. Delgado said he himself had proposed the investment after a discussion with one of Mr. Keating's lawyers in 1986.
Still, thanks to her father's business, Mrs. McCain, 45, remains wealthy. She has a 37 percent share of the family business and holds a stake in its profit-sharing and pension plans worth $250,000 to $500,000, a share in the corporate jet valued at more than $1 million and Anheuser-Busch stock worth at least $1 million, according to Mr. McCain's financial disclosure forms. The couple's four children own 23 percent of the company through trusts.
The McCains live behind gates and security cameras in a sprawling house on Central Avenue in Phoenix that once belonged to her parents, who live nearby.
 
A Friend at the Paper
The Hensley money was not the only key to Mr. McCain's first victory. He gained much-needed credibility from the editorial pages of The Arizona Republic and The Gazette and their publisher, Duke Tully.
Mr. Tully was a far different patron from Mr. Hensley. A swaggering, fun-loving 6-foot-4, he was comfortable with business executives and politicians alike. Mr. Tully, an accomplished pilot, loved to regale people with tales of his exploits flying jet fighters in the Korean and Vietnam wars. His house and office were filled with photographs of him alongside all manner of military aircraft.
"He'd point to his teeth and say, 'See these? They're steel. I lost the others when I crashed,' " recalled Pat Murphy, a former columnist and editor at The Republic.
Like Mr. McCain, Mr. Tully was a recent transplant, having been hired away from the San Francisco newspapers in 1979 to modernize and improve the two Phoenix newspapers, The Republic and the now-defunct Gazette, both owned by Central Newspapers. So it was natural that Mr. Tully hit it off with Mr. McCain, the former Navy pilot and prisoner of war.
"I was introduced to John at a private club in Phoenix shortly before he married Cindy," Mr. Tully said in a telephone interview from his home in Florida. "He is an extremely likable guy and I had a lot of hero worship for him."
After Mr. McCain's marriage, the McCains and the Tullys spent a lot of time together socializing and vacationing. Mr. Tully is the godfather of Megan, Mr. McCain's first child with Cindy.
More important for Mr. McCain's career, Mr. Tully's position as publisher meant he was already a fixture among the city's movers and shakers, and he eagerly championed Mr. McCain with the Phoenix 40 as well as on the editorial pages of the newspapers.
"I was a very, very strong John McCain advocate," Mr. Tully said. "He was basically picked by the power structure as the guy who could get it done, and I helped with that."
The Phoenix 40 was an unofficial group made up of the city's leading businessmen -- bankers, partners from the largest law firms, chief executives and, of course, executives of newspapers. The group was created in the early 1970's by Eugene C. Pulliam, the conservative founder of Central Newspapers and grandfather of former Vice President Dan Quayle.
The goal was to promote policies that its members felt were good for the city and state as Arizona expanded from a quiet rural state to a Sun Belt powerhouse.
It was also the closest thing to a political machine in Phoenix, and anointment by the Phoenix 40 almost invariably translated into victory at the polls.
Mr. Merrill, the Arizona State professor and political observer, said the power was exercised quietly and effectively.
"When you control the major newspaper, the TV stations and the people who make most of the political contributions," Mr. Merrill said, "you have enormous influence"
Mr. Tully harnessed that influence to Mr. McCain's political career from the outset, leapfrogging him over Republicans who had waited patiently for a shot at Mr. Rhodes's seat in 1982.
"There was a lot of resentment among Mesa Republicans, none of whom had ever heard of John McCain until he was suddenly the designated hitter," said Terry Goddard, a Democrat and former mayor of Phoenix.
Mr. McCain won a close race for the vacant seat and retained it easily in 1984. When the opportunity arose for his next big step, Mr. Tully was ready again.
In late 1985, Senator Barry Goldwater, the state's revered Republican leader, indicated he was planning to retire, and a huge battle was anticipated for his seat. The leading candidate was expected to be the popular Democratic governor, Bruce Babbitt, who is now secretary of the interior. Mr. Babbitt, however, already had his eye on a run for the presidency, and Mr. Tully and his colleagues threw their weight behind Mr. McCain.
As Mr. Tully explained it last week, the city's elite thought it would be better to have Mr. McCain in the Senate and Mr. Babbitt in the White House.
Mr. Shover, a member of the Phoenix 40, and Mr. Merrill both said the organization's backing of Mr. McCain was instrumental in his Senate victory in 1986.
But the newspaper publisher who had helped so much was not there to savor the victory. The day after Christmas 1985, after rumors began to circulate that Mr. Tully was not all he claimed, he acknowledged that he had never served in the military, and he resigned from the newspaper and left Arizona. But the war hero for whom he had done so much was well launched on his political career.

HEADLINE: Sotheby's and Christie's Face Mounting Suits in Antitrust Case

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON and CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
In the art world Herbert Black is known as a man who loves paintings and antiques and loathes the auction houses where he buys and sells them. Suddenly he has a lot of company.
Mr. Black, a copper trader from Montreal, is suing the two major art auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's. So is a philanthropist who endowed an Arizona art museum. And a New York businesswoman once known as the Tugboat Empress. And a Minnesota art gallery. And a Florida retiree. And about three dozen other people, some of whom may have simply bought a wristwatch or sold a great aunt's antique commode. 
 All of these disgruntled customers contend they were overcharged because of collusion by the two rival auction houses, and they are basing their class-action suits on a criminal antitrust investigation the United States Justice Department has been conducting. As part of that process a federal grand jury in Manhattan is looking into whether the auction houses conspired to fix the commissions they charge buyers and sellers at auctions dating back to 1992, said people in art and legal circles who are involved in the matter.
The fallout could be not just embarrassing but also expensive for Sotheby's and Christie's, which could end up paying their clients tens of millions of dollars.
Some worry that publicity from the antitrust case will shake the public's confidence at a time when the art market has been booming. "For a lot of people to whom the art world is hype anyway, does it increase their fears and cynicism?" wondered Angela Westwater, a dealer of contemporary art in SoHo.
If the Justice Department's investigation results in criminal charges, Sotheby's could face fines and its top executives short prison terms. Last month Christie's announced that in return for immunity from criminal prosecution it was cooperating with the investigation and turning over information to the Justice Department.
Under the department's amnesty program, leniency can be extended only to the first member of a cartel to come forward and spill the beans.
Sotheby's has not commented on the investigation, except to say that it was cooperating with prosecutors; nor has it responded to the allegations of price fixing.
Sotheby's stock price has plunged, from its high last spring of $47 to $17 3/4 on Friday. Ron Baron, president of Baron Capital Management, by far the largest outside shareholder in Sotheby's, described himself as "surprised, puzzled and disappointed" at the antitrust news, though he said he was confident that the outcome would not be financially significant.
Christie's, which was bought by a French businessman for more than $1 billion in 1998, is now a private company and no longer obligated to report its financial results publicly.
Both companies, which control about 95 percent of the $4 billion worldwide auction market, will have to cope with the class-action lawsuits by disgruntled customers, who could number in the thousands. If the customers win, they could recover three times the damages they suffered. The losses for the auction houses could come at a bad time. Both businesses have just spent huge sums on snazzy headquarters, and Sotheby's is pouring millions of dollars into an Internet auction business.
The investigation could also result in increased governmental regulation. The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, which regulates auctioneers, is "following the antitrust action closely, said Jules Polonetsky, commissioner of the department. Moreover, the art dealers fear that more regulations in the auction business could hurt the entire art trade.
Many in the insular art world are riveted by the drama and waiting for Sotheby's next move. Some dealers and collectors, who generally have a love-hate relationship with the two big houses, seem to be privately aghast and slightly gleeful at their problems. Lawyers, too, are watching with interest as a patient and painstaking federal prosecutor named John J. Greene deals with some of the most experienced, expensive and aggressive defense lawyers in the country (Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom for Christie's and Weil, Gotshal & Manges for Sotheby's).
The investigation comes at a time when the art auction business seems finally to have recovered from the deep recession that followed the frenzied art sales of the late 1980's. After a drop in revenues, the auction houses began raising their fees, and by exactly the same amount. In 1992 Sotheby's announced that it was increasing the commission that buyers pay to 15 percent of the purchase price on the first $50,000 and 10 percent on the rest. (The previous fee was a flat 10 percent.)
Christie's soon announced the same increase.
That behavior raised eyebrows, but two competitors charging the same price is not enough to prove collusion, antitrust lawyers say. After all, grocery stores and gas stations match each other's prices all the time and banks all charge the same prime rate.
"There has to be a meeting of the minds, a conscious commitment to a common scheme," said Robert H. Lande, a senior research scholar at the American Antitrust Institute. In 1995, another tough year in the auction business, the pattern of price increases was repeated, this time on the commissions that Sotheby's and Christie's charge sellers. Within six weeks of each other, the two announced a sliding scale that would apply to all sellers; previously, the two had officially charged fixed commissions, but often cut them to woo big sellers.
Not anymore, or so some disgruntled customers contend. "Once they instituted that elaborate sliding scale, there was no negotiation unless maybe for the Onassis estate," said Jeffrey A. Klafter, a lawyer representing customers in some of the 40-odd class-action cases that have been filed in the last month.
Financially, the price changes worked out well for the houses. In 1996 the amount of art sold at auction at Sotheby's edged down by almost 4 percent, but its revenues from auctions rose 7 percent.
By that time Mr. Greene was already taking a close look at the art world. He had brought several cases against antiques dealers who secretly agreed not to bid against one another at auctions.
In the spring of 1997 both the auction houses and a dozen top art dealers were subpoenaed for truckloads of documents, including datebooks, phone lists and correspondence. Though the main focus seemed to be on dealers, some lawyers suggested that the Justice Department was also looking at the commission increases.
Then silence. Lawyers for several dealers who received subpoenas said recently that their clients had not heard from prosecutors for a long time, suggesting that the investigation may have stalled or that prosecutors began focusing on only the auction houses.
Meanwhile things were changing at Christie's. Francois Pinault, who owns the auction house, installed a team of accountants to comb through its books and records. He also began shaking up Christie's management.
On Christmas Eve Christie's announced the resignation of Christopher M. Davidge, who had been the auction house's chief executive for six years. Mr. Davidge's lawyer, Joseph Linklater, declined to comment on his client's departure.
A month later Christie's said it "recently became aware of information relevant to the antitrust investigation," and had turned it over to the Justice Department. Christie's added that it had entered the department's amnesty program, which allows companies to turn themselves in for antitrust violations in return for leniency or immunity from criminal prosecution. The European Union then announced that it too was investigating Sotheby's and Christie's for anticompetitive behavior.
Why would a company confess to a crime that might otherwise seem difficult to prove? The answer, antitrust lawyers said, is simple: the threat of jail time and large fines.
Criminal antitrust cases, however, are notoriously difficult to prove. The government has lost some big cases, but recently has won several major victories.
A trial is a risk for targeted businesses, especially when there is tangible evidence. So rather than recommending that their clients try to tough it out, lawyers often tell them to cooperate with prosecutors -- before someone else does. "There's a footrace to the prosecutors," said Stephen M. Axinn, a specialist in antitrust defense.
It is not enough just to turn state's evidence, antitrust lawyers said. For the courts to recognize that a conspiracy has ended, the conspirator must make an open, public break with the cartel agreement.
Earlier this month Christie's changed the commissions it charges buyers and sellers. The new rates increase the amount buyers must pay to 17.5 percent and reduce the sellers' commissions for those who do a lot of business with the house.
Sotheby's has not responded. Christie's new rate schedule makes it much more attractive to sellers, just at the time when the auction houses are trying to line up things to sell at their big spring auctions.
Then there is the broader question of what Sotheby's will do about the antitrust investigation. Some lawyers said that the auction house would reach a settlement with the government rather than go to trial. "There's no possible benefit, in terms of the art world, in having all this ugly stuff in the newspaper every day," said Mr. Axinn, the defense expert.
Whatever the outcome of the criminal case, both Sotheby's and Christie's must answer to hordes of disgruntled customers. Thirty-eight class-action lawsuits were filed in Manhattan as of last Monday, said Robert A. Skirnick, an antitrust lawyer representing some of the customers. Others have been filed in other states, and Sotheby's shareholders have also sued.
Judge Lewis Kaplan, a federal judge in Manhattan, has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to begin consolidating the lawsuits.
Some of these people, like Mr. Black the copper trader, may have had longstanding disagreements with the auction houses; last year, Sotheby's admitted that a pair of antique chairs for which Mr. Black paid about $2.7 million were, in fact, recent reproductions.
But others were simply shocked when they learned of the antitrust investigation. One is Gerard Cafesjian, a retired executive with a large collection of works in 20th-century glass, whose name is on the new home of the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art in Arizona. "I don't think he had any inkling until the first article came out," said Richard A. Lockridge, a lawyer for Mr. Cafesjian. "He was not very happy with the allegations."
Civil suits like these are common in the wake of a criminal antitrust investigation, class-action lawyers said. But plaintiffs in these cases are not just any old consumers. They are richer, and probably tougher.
Another customer is Evelyn Frank, whose family for many years ran a maritime business in New York and New Jersey. Mrs. Frank, who was known as the Tugboat Empress and the Dragon Lady, pleaded guilty in 1990 to charges that her company dumped tons of sludge into New Jersey waters.
The unusual makeup of the plaintiffs -- mainly angry rich people -- should come as no surprise, said Joseph J. Tabacco, one of the lawyers involved in the suits against Sotheby's and Christie's. After all, he said, "The zone of greatest impact is probably up and down Park Avenue."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Knicks May Shift Camp Over Confederate Flag

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS

 BODY:
After regularly training at the College of Charleston twice a year for eight seasons, Knicks players are considering whether they want the organization to continue its affiliation with South Carolina, where the Confederate battle flag flies above its Capitol even though the banner is considered a symbol of slavery and segregation to many.
The issue became a source of heated political debate during the prelude to the Republican primary there on Saturday. On Thursday, after it was reported that USA Track and Field had issued a statement in support of the removal of the flag from the South Carolina Statehouse in Columbia, the site of the United States women's marathon trials later this month, the issue was raised with the Knicks, whose roster is predominantly black. 
 Team officials declined to be interviewed on the subject, but on Friday, Steve Mills, the team's executive vice president for franchise operations, said in a statement: "The Knicks aren't prepared to make any decision right now regarding changing locales for training camp. But this is obviously an issue that concerns us."
It was an issue Coach Jeff Van Gundy addressed with his players during a team meeting on Friday.
Players said they were asked to think about their position regarding the team's association with the state and provide the organization with some feedback.
If the players are vehemently against operating their preseason training camp -- and often their workouts prior to the playoffs -- at the College of Charleston, the team may decide to look for an alternate site.
Over the weekend, several players were asked if they would prefer the team look elsewhere for a training camp.
"If you've got a state that wants to fly that flag knowing what it means to people, and me being black, I don't need to be in that state," Larry Johnson said. "As an individual, no, I wouldn't want to practice there. But if management says it's going to be such and such dollars or another place won't be as sufficient, then I don't know if we have much of a choice.
"But if we have another choice, let's get out of there."
The team has a multiyear contract with the College of Charleston but the financial toll of breaking it is said to be minimal, according to one team official. The logistics of finding another suitable site might be more complicated. As it is, the Knicks have access to a state-of-the-art training center and gym and have luxury hotel accommodations within walking distance of the college.
For eight seasons, since Pat Riley arrived to coach the Knicks for the 1991-92 season, the Knicks have packed up in October and headed to camp at the College of Charleston, where they patronize a hotel, shopping areas and restaurants, and bring publicity to the school. Last July, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People began to call for an economic boycott of the state.
The controversy surrounding the flag has left some wondering what responsibility athletes have in using their celebrity to bring attention to political and social issues. Some college sports programs have canceled trips to South Carolina in support of the N.A.A.C.P. boycott, and track and field athletes have contemplated a protest during the women's marathon trials on Saturday.
"I think the issue is something that should be brought up," Charlie Ward said. "The flag is symbolic of slavery, power, and I think we should think about it and make a statement on it. At least we can send some type of message. There are a lot of people who walk around with that flag and use it for power and racism. When the flag flies, it's more than just about slavery. There are a lot of negative images tied to that one flag."
There is a chance for a compromise to be reached in South Carolina. Reportedly, Gov. Jim Hodges has won support from some black legislators for moving the Confederate flag from the Statehouse to a monument of a Confederate general on the Capitol grounds. It is unclear when the Knicks will make a decision on whether to continue training in South Carolina, but the team is open to player input.
"Personally, I'd rather not go back," Chris Childs said. "Unfortunately, the flag is a part of life that hasn't changed in some places. It's not an issue as far as the way we've been treated down there -- because the people have treated us nice -- but just knowing the flag is flying there is offensive. The flag stands for slavery and the Ku Klux Klan, and my idea would be for us not to practice there.
"We've got a week to think about it. The guys will talk about it and discuss it, and let the organization know what our feelings are about it. It's good that we get a chance to give some input."

HEADLINE: Immigrants Rebuild a City That Others Fled

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: HOMESTEAD, Fla., Feb. 20

 BODY:
An interminably flat, hot and often windy farming town, Homestead became lodged in the annals of natural disasters in August 1992 when Hurricane Andrew, the most damaging storm in American history, destroyed this community.
Homestead has still not reclaimed its old self. The hurricane chased out much of the middle class, obliterated an Air Force base that poured more than $400 million a year into the area's economy and reduced houses, trailer parks and 3,000 acres of lime groves to a horizon of sticks. 
 Still, in the rubble of Hurricane Andrew, an entirely different Homestead has begun to bloom, a transformed community that says much about the changes that are sweeping small towns across this state and much of the South.
In accidental defiance of government planners and developers who have been repeatedly rebuffed in courting investment and big employers, the poorest of Homestead's work force, its migrant workers, mostly from Mexico and Central America, is rebuilding this town, store by store, job by job.
The town has not reclaimed its former vigor, and the rising Latin population is mainly working poor. But Homestead is hardly dying.
Among the farmworker families taking hold here are the Berroneses.
Thirty-seven years ago, Julio Berrones, now 81, his wife, Ignacia, 77, and their 12 children moved from Mexico to a barracks in Homestead's South Dade labor camp.
Following the harvest in a flatbed truck for several years, members of the family picked fruits and vegetables from Florida to Michigan. With the wages of so many, the family was eventually able to buy a four-bedroom house in Florida City, adjacent to Homestead, for $50,000.
"My mother said, 'We have to mainstream the kids,' " said Eddie Berrones, who was 3 months old when the family moved here.
Today, Eddie Berrones, a graduate of the University of Texas, is the executive director of a community service program for 500 poor children and Homestead's first Hispanic city councilman.
A brother, Julio, is a housing contractor; Lupe, a sister, owns a bridal boutique and a banquet business; Rosie teaches nursing; Anita is a nursing administrator; Cesar owns Casita Tejas restaurant on Krome Avenue, Homestead's main street; Olga has bought the beauty salon nearby; and Juan, the oldest at 54, lives on the mortgages he collects on homes he built as a contractor.
From the 14 Berroneses who settled here in the 1960's, Eddie Berrones said, "we are now 108, total," including spouses.
Homestead is an example of a change occurring in many communities, particularly in Florida and Texas, where farmworkers and other immigrants have begun to settle.
Still, Homestead's economy is not what it was before the storm. "People said, 'Three, four years, we'll be back,' " said Jack Levy, a commercial photographer, former president of the Chamber of Commerce and a Homestead "pioneer," as settlers of the first half of the 1900's are known.
"It wasn't true," said Mr. Levy, who moved from Homestead, 30 miles south of Miami, to north-central Florida the year after the storm. "My wife said, 'Enough is enough.' We lost a tremendous number of the middle class, those with enough income to spend on something more than survival." Many of those who left were retirees who lost small houses and mobile houses. Others were the 6,000 workers, civilian and military, who lost their jobs or were transferred when the air base was closed.
Homestead's other big loss was the Cleveland Indians, for whom the city had built an $18 million baseball park. The town had leased it to the team for 20 years for spring training. But fearing the loss of their middle-class fans, the team moved to Winter Haven, in central Florida. Homestead spent $9 million repairing the damage to the park but has not found another major tenant.
The pioneers' institutions -- the churches and service clubs, like Rotary and Kiwanis -- have shrunk. Curt Ivey, the city manager, said membership in the high school's honors program had shriveled because many of the new students have not had the same educational opportunities.
The year before the storm, Homestead's hospital had a profit of about $850,000, said its chief executive, Bo Boulenger. But retirees with federal Medicare coverage have been replaced by poor families who often cannot afford treatment, Mr. Boulenger said, and the hospital has struggled, losing $6 million last year. Twenty percent of the patients, he said, have no insurance.
New ventures have moved in: A stock car race track opened and a Wal-Mart department store. But they did not require the trained work force needed by companies like Lucent Technologies, which decided to build a factory elsewhere.
The population has returned to the pre-hurricane level of about 27,000, but it is poorer and less educated than previous residents. The Hispanic population has climbed to about 45 percent from 30 percent in 1990.
"We have replaced a person making 2X with one making 1X," said Bob Epling, president of the Homestead's Community Bank. "The entire community, like ships, has gone down with the outgoing tide."
Less perceptibly, however, a new tide is rolling in. On Krome Avenue, the two busiest businesses are Mexican-American restaurants: Cesar Berrones's and on another corner, El Toro Taco.
Many Hispanic doctors, lawyers and real estate agents have offices on Krome Avenue.
Nearby, along a one-block stretch of Washington Avenue, 21 of 26 shops were owned by Hispanic immigrants.
Patricia Carballo, daughter of immigrants from Ecuador, owns Agencia Azteca. She provides tax preparation services, bus tickets, photographs for identification documents, a mail drop, translation and help in transmitting money to Mexico and Central American countries.
While Homestead's economic planners contemplate schemes, like redeveloping the air base as an airport and luring factories, Mrs. Carballo said: "We're looking at the small picture. We're doing one-on-one."
Her 29-year-old Cuba-born husband, Ernesto, manages the Mexico Supermarket across the street. While other supermarkets have struggled, Mr. Carballo and his brother, Sergio, the owner, have expanded and added goods.
The butcher shop stretches the width of the store's back wall. Butchers prepare the meat on order, including flat meat, for fajitas, Mexican sausage and beef tongue. The store offers hot peppers, plantains and edible cactuses.
There is a road these entrepreneurs travel from the farm fields to main street. They set up stalls in the immense Bargain Town Flea Market on the Dixie Highway, U.S. 1, that slices through town and expand from there.
"My husband and sons have sold in the flea market for 12 years," said Maria E. Rodriguez, who immigrated from Cuba and works in the men's apparel shop on Washington Avenue that a son, Guillermo, opened a year ago. "Homestead changes every day, a little bit."
Walter Gillis Peacock, a sociologist at Florida International University, who studied the hurricane's effects on Homestead's minorities, said of the immigrants: "They're drawing on past experience. Many are from rural communities, and rural communities have marketplaces. The shops you see in Bargain Town are the same shops you see in Central America and Mexico."
Some people here seem to resent the changing face of Homestead. A white saleswoman at a retail store has kept an album with photographs of litter on the sidewalks. One showed a beer bottle by the trunk of a tree, crumpled paper in the gutter, a spent cigarette pack.
"It's the first world and the third world, and the third world is winning out," she said.
Serious conflicts among Homestead's ethnic groups -- the Hispanics, Haitians, African-Americans, whites -- are rare, city officials say.
"I grew up really never feeling any different from anyone in this town," Eddie Berrones says.
It was only after he was first elected to the city council, in 1997, that Mr. Berrones detected some resentment. "I realized something different about the perceptions, the mentality of people of other ethnic groups," he said. "I'm putting it diplomatically.
"Four years ago, before I ran for the city council," Mr. Berrones said, we had 200 registered Hispanic voters. When I ran in November 1997, there were 1,400."
Last November, when he won again, he said, "there were 2,000."

HEADLINE: Nameless in New Jersey;
In This Increasingly Suburban World, There's No Place Like Trenton

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
The city is still here. It is just the name, "Trenton," that is slipping fast.
The Trenton Times dropped the name years ago as suburban circulation grew. Trenton State College became abstracted into the College of New Jersey three years ago, when the campus administration became concerned with the college's image among suburban applicants. Mayor Douglas Palmer even had to fight the State Department of Transportation to have "Trenton" added to the signs pointing to the railroad station. 
 "It's a constant battle, just to keep the name up there," said Mayor Palmer.
What is happening around Trenton is also going on in other cities that have suffered economic woes. As population and political and financial power have swelled in the suburbs, the identities of many old cities have fallen out of fashion and, increasingly, out of the names of public and private institutions.
Partly as a marketing decision aimed at suburban consumers, partly from new suburban pride, the people who decide these things sometimes favor names that mask the urban identity of a place or an institution. In the shuffle, the geography of place becomes geographically indeterminate, as with Trenton's new downtown showplace, a $60 million sports arena, developed and underwritten by Mercer County and named , "Sovereign Bank Arena at Mercer County."
Where, Mayor Palmer wonders sardonically, is that?
"I have to admit that I was quite shocked and taken aback to see that sign outside and on the court inside," he said. "I was frankly a little surprised that Mercer County would feel so insecure about their image that they would have to put that there."
But image clearly counts for a lot these days, and the Postal Service's nine-digit ZIP codes, which permit mail carriers to ignore place names entirely, make it easier for anyone to migrate to a more fashionable mailing address without moving a single stick of furniture.
Trenton has a population of 88,000, yet the local phone book contains barely a page's worth of businesses beginning with that name. But businesses named for Princeton, one of the most fashionable addresses in the state with a population of 26,000, fill three and a half pages. How could that be? Most of the listed businesses are in surrounding suburbs, giving "Princeton area" as their address. Princeton lies about five miles from Trenton.
Ted Hershberg, a professor of public policy at the University of Pennsylvania and an advocate of tying cities and suburbs closer together, complained that the tendency to deny the identity of a region's core city amounts to a way of placating nervous suburbanites.
"It provides a very subtle and insidious way to sanitize the identity of an entire region," said Mr. Hershberg, a champion of regional cooperation in Philadelphia. "In a place where people pride themselves on never visiting the downtown, this gets them off scot-free -- they don't even have to recognize that they are part of a region that owes its identity to a city."
Mr. Hershberg offered Temple University's conference center as an example.
"It's the Sugarloaf Conference Center and it's in Philadelphia, only its stationery says 'Chestnut Hill,' which is not even a place," he said. "Here's an urban university in the heart of the Philadelphia ghetto and these guys mask the fact that this beautiful conference center is even in the city."
Harriet K. Goodheart, the university spokeswoman, said that the university wanted only to signal to visitors looking for the center that it was not at the university's main central city campus, but in the neighborhood known as Chestnut Hill. "It is a very distinct location, very much on the far northwestern periphery of the city and only a block or two from being in Montgomery County," she said. "It is certainly not for a more sinister reason than that."
The delicate nature of the name game means that it is often hard to pin down just who is making the choices.
Robert D. Prunetti, the Mercer County executive who is responsible for directing tens of millions of dollars in new investment into downtown Trenton, said the Sovereign Bank Corporation, which paid for the naming rights of the arena, was responsible for having its new arena placed "at Mercer County."
But the bank denied that.
"We did not want to appear to decrease the value of the naming rights by adding that," said Melissa Gettler, vice president of marketing at Sovereign. "It was the county's decision."
The name game has been going on for some time. Newspapers were among the first businesses to shed their urban identities in New Jersey as their readers filled the suburbs in the 1970's, said James R. Hughes, dean of the school of planning and urban studies at Rutgers University. Today only one major daily in the state, The Asbury Park Press, retains its old city name. The Newark Star-Ledger is just The Star-Ledger, the former Trenton Times is just The Times, The Camden Courier-Post moved to Cherry Hill and became The Courier-Post, and the old Hackensack Record is now just The Record.
Some public colleges also became suburbanized. Newark State College moved to Union in 1958 and then became Kean College, now Kean University. Trenton State College abruptly announced its name change to the College of New Jersey in 1996, arguing that it wanted a more cosmopolitan name to attract a wider range of students. Daryl Fair, a professor of political science there, led an unavailing fight to block the change.
"It's not that I'm necessarily sentimental about Trenton," said Mr. Fair recently. "It was just an example of the snobbery that some people feel, who think it's better to have a more suburban image."
There was a time when those roles were reversed, Professor Hughes said.
"When they were at the height of their industrial power, the names of our cities were so potent you had suburbs actually taking their names, so you have West Trenton, which is part of Ewing Township, and East Newark, and East, North and South Brunswick and so on," Mr. Hughes said.
Mayor Palmer said he was loath to bite the hand that had done so much for the city, for Mercer County not only built the new minor league ballpark (naming it Mercer County Waterfront Park) and the new arena, but it is also pushing for new housing and commercial development. Yet Trenton's mayor also remembers the little slights.
When the county helped attract a new minor league ball team to the city in 1992, some team officials wanted a generic name, "like 'The New Jersey Somethings,' " Mr. Prunetti, the Mercer County executive, remembered, while members of the Board of Freeholders wanted Mercer County in the name.
Mayor Palmer was not happy. "I went to the freeholders meeting in a Trenton Central High School baseball uniform, with Trenton across the front," he recalled. "I said, 'See? The name Trenton doesn't look so bad.' "
The team was named the Trenton Thunder.
Kevin Gaughan, a lawyer and an activist for regionwide cooperation in Buffalo, has taken on a harder task. He wants Erie County to change its name to Buffalo County, after the city at its core, as a way of affirming the link between city and suburb. "I would characterize it as a struggle," Mr. Gaughan said a little dryly, "but in this dot-com age it doesn't make sense to speak of just Erie County by itself."
So far, Mayor Palmer has had to be satisfied with the new minor league sports teams that have adopted the city's name -- the Trenton Titans minor league hockey team moved into the new arena this season -- but he hopes that Trenton's name will evoke new music.
"The cities are coming back, people are finding that they are great places, and I think people should be proud of the name and help build it, and not take it away," he said. "For a long time Trenton had a negative connotation, but now I hear people saying it in an upbeat way -- 'Trenton!' -- instead of with a sneer. And just how you say the name has a positive psychological effect."

HEADLINE: Together On the Stump: Mrs. Clinton And Gore

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 20

 BODY:
They sat with their heads together, whispering into each other's ears and at one point holding hands. They bobbed and swayed and clapped in syncopation as the crimson-robed choir rocked behind them. They invoked their college days and Bob Dylan and their 1992 bus adventure across America.
And at the end of a three-hour church service here, nothing seemed more natural than the fact that Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton would be campaigning together, reinforcing each other with their shared political heritage and their shared political desire to run on Bill Clinton's successful economic record but away from his impeachment-stained legacy. 
 Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton have left the White House nest and are learning to fly on their own. Today at the Wilborn Temple, a historic black church in downtown Albany packed with more than 1,000 worshipers, the two came together for the first time as candidates, he for president, she for senator from New York. They praised each other to the rafters and their spokesmen said the two were eager to appear together again.
Mr. Gore has been on his own a little longer and his wings seem a little stronger. He dominated the service with a rousing 25-minute sermon that prompted some in the audience to call out "Preach!" and "Amen!" as he proclaimed the nation to be at a "mountaintop moment." He exulted in the first lady's work for education and families. "I have seen her rare mix of idealism and effective leadership, of inspiration and stamina," he declared from the pulpit.
For her part, Mrs. Clinton lavished similar praise on Mr. Gore.
"No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice president," she said. "He knows what to do and how to do it, in ways visible and perhaps invisible to the general public. He has been the partner in progress that has been made with our president and has helped to lead this country to this extraordinary moment of opportunity and obligation."
The moment they were referring to was the one where the country is now, at the leading edge of the longest economic expansion in American history. But the moment that drew such attention was the intersection of these two candidates -- one a vice president who is campaigning with a new sure-footedness as he marches through the primary season, the other a first lady who is making a historic leap for political office, both of them linked to a president both hailed and scorned.
Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton had been circling each other for some time, but aides to both determined that the moment for their joint appearance was at last ripe. In other words, they would probably help each other more than they would hurt.
Long gone are the days of rumors of their rivalry for the president's attention and their competition to make major announcements. When Mrs. Clinton met Mr. Gore's limousine this morning outside the red-brick church, they hugged each other with what seemed like genuine affection.
"Just to see him was a pleasure," Mrs. Clinton said later. "I'm very fond of him personally."
They made their joint debut to an overwhelmingly sympathetic crowd, at a service for the annual meeting of the Legislature's black and Hispanic members. Black and Hispanic Americans are among President Clinton's most loyal supporters, and they make up about 15 percent of the state's Democratic voters. (Mr. Gore even dropped a little Spanish into his sermon today; Mrs. Clinton said that as a girl, she had heard the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speak and "it changed my life.")
Mrs. Clinton is enormously popular among these core Democratic voters, as is Mr. Gore. The thinking in both campaigns is that Mrs. Clinton could help boost the turnout in New York's March 7 presidential primary for Mr. Gore over former Senator Bill Bradley. Of course, Mr. Gore is already well on his way to claiming his party's nomination, so there was no real risk for him today in appearing with Mrs. Clinton.
At the same time, advisers in both camps expect that by the fall, Mr. Gore, as a Democrat, will be stronger in New York than the Republican presidential nominee, whoever that is, and that he can then help Mrs. Clinton. He may face more of a problem in aligning himself with her at that time if she has not won over at least two groups -- white women and Orthodox Jews -- who are not now enthusiastic about her candidacy.
The problem for Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton is that together, they are a double-dose extension of the Clinton era. They both played that association down today, with Mrs. Clinton brushing past a reference to "our president" and Mr. Gore paying hasty respect to the Clinton-Gore ticket.
But most striking was how very similar their speeches were, both in style and in content. Great chunks of their speeches were interchangeable with each other's and with Mr. Clinton's.
They both highlighted the economic boom, the low unemployment rate for African-Americans and the strides in helping families pay for college. They both said that while much had been achieved in the last several years, much remained to be done. And they offered the same centrist-Democratic course for the future, calling for the expansion of health care and advocating hooking up all classrooms to the Internet, making prescription drugs cheaper for the elderly and closing the digital divide, in which those with computers (who tend to be white) have economic advantages over those without computers (who tend to be members of minorities).
In reference to high rates of poverty in New York, Mrs. Clinton said, "It doesn't have to be this way." This has been a longtime campaign theme for Mr. Gore, who tells audiences, "It's not supposed to be this way." Both exhorted the audience to be vigilant against growing weary.
After they spoke, the Rev. A. R. Bernard Sr., the guest minister, took the pulpit and highlighted something else they have in common -- bad press. He said he was grateful for the chance to meet them and touch their hands. "I've learned not to let the newspapers tell me who people are," he said to great applause.
For some, President Clinton's scandals only forged a new respect for the first lady. As Gloria Davis, an assemblywoman from the Bronx, said in introducing her, "She knows what trials and tribulations are." She later added: "We understand Hillary. She may be young. But she has what it takes, because in this world you got to be strong. You got to be able to say, 'Back off.' You got to be able to say, 'Move over.' "
Many of the churchgoers seemed charmed by the event. Rodney Goulding, 66, a retired police officer from the Bronx, said he would vote for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gore after hearing them today. "This country is in the best shape that it's ever been," he said, "and you don't want to stop the ball from rolling."

HEADLINE: SURGE IN OIL PRICES IS RAISING SPECTER OF INFLATION SPIKE

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20

 BODY:
For the past year, even as the price of oil nearly tripled to $30 a barrel from less than $11, policy makers, economists and many in the oil industry itself hewed closely to the same line: Oil does not matter much anymore.
Technology, which depends much less on energy than manufacturing, now drives economic growth. OPEC, the once fearsome cartel of oil producing countries, had become impotent. And oil, the old king of commodities, seemed to have no more power to sway the American economy in the Internet age than cotton or copper. 
 Such thinking was, and to a certain extent remains, conventional wisdom. But it has taken only a few weeks of $2-a-gallon heating oil, $20 airline ticket surcharges and $60 bills to gas up the sport utility vehicle to make people wonder if oil is really so irrelevant after all.
The surge in oil prices has ignited a debate about whether the economy is as immune to an old-fashioned commodity as many had come to believe and, if not, whether oil could pose a threat to the record-long American economic expansion. The surge has also made Washington nervous about the intentions of oil-producing countries for the first time since the Persian Gulf war, when oil last crested $30 a barrel.
The Clinton administration, under pressure from Congress and angry consumers in New England, has sent the energy secretary to petition Middle East ministers, who are about to hold important strategy talks, to release more oil.
The administration also is debating whether and how to intervene in the market and push prices down, perhaps by allowing oil companies to borrow from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a stockpile generally intended for use only in emergencies like an embargo or a war.
The oil price spike has also registered at the Federal Reserve. Alan Greenspan worried this week about low oil stocks and the "substantial negative consequences" of high oil prices. Core inflation remains remarkably subdued, running last month at just 1.9 percent. When energy costs are factored in, however, inflation expanded at a rate of 2.7 percent, meaning that oil costs alone pushed inflation eight-tenths of a percentage point higher than it would otherwise have been. With the Fed already nervous about the bubbly stock market and a shortage of workers, higher oil prices seem likely to reinforce the tendency toward raising interest rates to cool the economy.
"In the macro sense, oil prices do not endanger the economy the way they once did," said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who is currently touring six oil-producing nations. "But we cannot ignore the potential for oil to have an impact on inflation. What OPEC does matters."
Oil suddenly re-emerged as an economic and political threat mainly because of things happening abroad. Some of the factors that brought oil down so sharply in late 1998 have had the reverse impact in recent months. The main one is oil-hungry Asia. The sharp recession in Asian economies beginning in 1997 brought about a collapse of oil prices. Their speedy recovery recently has created hefty demand and contributed a great deal to the price surge.
At the same time, oil-producing nations, their solidarity in tatters as recently as 1997, have engineered a period of strategic harmony unseen since the Arab oil embargo of 1973. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Mexico and Venezuela have so far stuck to production cutbacks agreed to when prices were in the cellar.
Not unlike in the 1970's, experts these days deconstruct every public statement by world oil ministers for hints that more oil will start flowing soon.
Economists and OPEC watchers are split on whether the oil problem will persist. Many believe prices have peaked, with oil ministers already sending signals that they intend to increase production. If that proves true, then today's high oil prices will probably be seen as nothing more than a temporary disturbance. The conventional wisdom about oil will seem truer than ever.
But there is also a much less rosy outlook that sees oil supplies remaining tight for a couple years, until non-OPEC producers respond by drilling for new oil. Prices would hold at current levels or even jump higher. That would fuel inflation and repeated interest rate increases by the Fed. In the worst case, higher interest rates would push the economy into recession.
In that event, oil, having helped prompt downturns in the early 1970's, the early 1980's and the early 1990's, would once again become the bete noire of the American economy.
"People have just started to wake up," said Philip K. Verleger, who monitors the oil industry for the Cambridge, Mass.-based Brattle Group. He sees oil prices rising to at least $33 a barrel by year-end if oil exporters increase production, closer to $40 a barrel if they do not. "We have a serious problem now and it could get worse."
The outcome will depend in part on a series of meetings among oil producing countries beginning late this month and ending with OPEC's semiannual strategy session in Vienna on March 27. By that time, Clinton administration officials said, it should be clear whether oil producers are willing to sacrifice windfall oil profits to help keep economic growth on track in the United States, Europe and East Asia, powerful economies that import most of their oil.
Oil ministers in Saudi Arabia and Mexico, balancing their own profits against a desire to keep Western economies strong and defend oil's share of energy production worldwide, have both said that they consider a price range of $20 to $25 a barrel more appropriate than $30 a barrel. But administration officials are pressing for details of how they intend to get there. "We are trying to pin them down on real commitments to increase output," an official said.
Mr. Richardson visited Mexico on Saturday, where he met with Luis Tellez, the energy minister. He will also see Saudi, Kuwaiti and Norwegian ministers in coming days.
Though United States officials seem optimistic that the March meetings will lead to at least some increased output, the question is how much. With oil inventories at record lows relative to demand, the International Energy Agency estimates that OPEC would need to increase output by nearly 10 percent just to keep pace with world demand.
Administration officials say oil producers are debating increases of 1.2 million to 3.1 million barrels a day, or 4.5 percent to 12 percent from production last month. Only increases at the high end of that range would alleviate the squeeze, they say.
Even then, relief may not arrive in time for the summer driving season. It takes at least six weeks for fresh production in the Middle East to pass through refineries and reach neighborhood gas stations. Some analysts believe that gas could hit an all-time high of $2 a gallon this summer, though forecasting oil prices is as much soothsaying as science.
The broader question is how long oil-producing nations will hang together. For years, OPEC looked more like a bazaar than a cartel, with nonstop haggling and rampant cheating undercutting public pledges of cooperation. But Saudi Arabia, the heavyweight of the oil-producing world, brokered a reconciliation during the Asian economic slump in 1998, after oil prices had collapsed.
Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and Ali Naimi, the country's oil minister, have restored Saudi leadership of world oil producers, analysts say. They improved relations with Iran. They lured Mexico, which is not a member of OPEC, and Venezuela into a partnership. Most significantly, the once-defiant Saudis agreed to reduce their own oil output. OPEC-wide production cuts of about 7 percent stuck.
"This is the strongest agreement oil producers have had for many years," said Luis E. Gusti, the former president of Petroleos de Venezuela, the national oil company, and now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "I think it has an opportunity to hold together, though you can never rule out leaks."
Though oil producers do not seem to agree on how much to increase production, they are not fighting the way they once did, an administration official said. "They intend to keep their unity," the official said.
None of that makes oil the threat to the United States that it was 25 years ago. The American economy has gone through a revolution since then. Manufacturing accounted for almost one-fourth of economic output in the mid-1970's, compared with one-sixth now. Factories and utilities use less oil for each dollar of production than they did then.
The decline in oil's importance is more dramatic than that. It takes less oil to send an e-mail message across the country than to send a letter the same distance, and electronic communication is a better gauge of economic activity in this country than the postal service. Over all, the United States spent about 3 percent of its gross domestic product on oil in 1998, compared with nearly 9 percent in 1980.
Still, some analysts say the lesson of the latest price spike is that oil is not yet just another commodity. Every American depends on oil products every day, to keep warm, move around, wrap food and ship packages.
Moreover, some of the most prized luxuries during this country's period of prosperity are energy hungry. Homes of 6,000 square feet with cathedral ceilings and large windows and sport utility vehicles with 44-gallon fuel tanks and 5.4-liter engines can make for alarming energy bills when oil is expensive.
"There are three things that can get people worried about inflation and spook the stock market," said Daniel Yergin, an expert on oil at Cambridge Energy Resource Associates. "They are the price of labor, the price of money and the price of oil."
Oil can also be a powerful drag on rich economies. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the club of the world's wealthiest countries, estimates that every $10 rise in the price of a barrel of oil lifts inflation by half a percentage point and reduces economic growth by a quarter-point. The O.E.C.D. also estimates that inflation in developed countries has nearly doubled to 2 percent from 1.1 percent a year ago, with the price of oil accounting for the difference.
"I've been through too many oil shocks to take them unseriously," Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week. "If the price changes, it has a major impact on the economy."

HEADLINE: The Reform Tide in Iran

 BODY:
The peaceful revolt against clerical repression in Iran that began three years ago with the election of Mohammad Khatami as president is gaining strength. Partial returns from Friday's parliamentary elections suggest that the reform coalition that brought Mr. Khatami his landslide upset in 1997 and then won a broad victory in last year's municipal elections is likely to gain control of the legislature. Reform candidates attracted support not just among women and young people, but among more traditional voters in provincial towns and religious centers as well.
The message of these elections is that an overwhelming majority of Iranians are weary of fundamentalist rule, an ailing economy and an abrasive foreign policy that has left Iran lagging behind at a time of expanding prosperity and freedom around the world. Despite rising oil prices, unemployment and poverty are pressing problems in Iran. Many foreign investors remain skittish, while much domestic industry is controlled by profligate and sometimes corrupt religious foundations. Under these circumstances, job growth has not been able to keep up with Iran's rapidly expanding population. 
 The supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, outranks the elected president and Parliament. He and the conservative clerics allied with him retain considerable power to thwart the reform agenda through their control of the security forces, the courts and special panels that review legislation. But an alliance between a reform majority in Parliament and Mr. Khatami could loosen the clergy's tight grip over Iran's political institutions and allow the president to fulfill his promises to build a society based on tolerance and the rule of law.
Mr. Khatami's parliamentary slate has promised to enact a new and more liberal press law, let multiple political parties compete and challenge the clergy's power over the courts, security police and election rules. The new Parliament will also need to come up with an effective economic program that privatizes clerical and government-run companies and attracts increased foreign investment and trade. Some bolder reformers also talk of promoting changes in foreign policy, including improved relations with the United States. Yesterday Washington welcomed the Iranian election results.
Iran's clerical leaders have shown themselves to be sophisticated politicians. In recent years they have permitted relatively free elections and have acknowledged their political defeats. Undoubtedly, they will try to use the institutions still under their control to slow the pace of change. But they should have the wisdom to recognize that the Iranian people now expect to see their country governed in a more enlightened way that respects their personal and civil liberties, promotes economic growth and moderates Iran's militant hostility toward the West.

HEADLINE: Reagan Democrats: Gone but Not Forgotten

BYLINE: By Michael K. Deaver; Michael K. Deaver is vice chairman of Edelman Public Relations Worldwide and served as President Ronald Reagan's deputy chief of staff.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the Republican primary in Michigan today, both John McCain and George W. Bush will be seeking the support of the elusive Reagan Democrat. Mr. McCain, having lost big in South Carolina when conservative Republicans turned out in force to support Mr. Bush, has a particular stake in courting this mythic bloc of voters.
But even as both candidates make their appeal, they must realize that, to a large extent, Reagan Democrats are no longer -- and the Republican Party must change its message to fit the times. 
 Michigan was once a bastion for such voters. Born in the shadows of Detroit's auto plants, the Reagan Democrats in Macomb County were always uneasy bedfellows of liberal Democrats like George McGovern and Ed Muskie, though they had instinctively voted Democratic since the days of Franklin Roosevelt.
In the 1960's and 70's, as national Democrats moved away from traditional issues like families, neighborhoods and national security, Republicans moved into places like Macomb County to pick up the conservative Democrats left behind.
In 1980, Ronald Reagan cobbled together a coalition of Republicans and disaffected blue-collar workers that propelled him into the White House and changed the face of the G.O.P.
These Democrats were generally blue-collar workers, who had seen their fathers fight and sometimes die in World War II. They were the guys who got drafted in the Vietnam War and who came back without saying a word. They packed their lunches in Igloo coolers and opened their heating bills with trepidation.
The Reagan Democrats lived in a world today's Generation X would hardly recognize. Stagflation. Malaise. Gas lines. Crime waves. The Ayatollah. Voluntary thermostat controls. One percent pay raises. Mujahadeen. WIN buttons. Hollow military. Killer rabbits. Exploding Pintos. Unemployment. Misery index. Billy Beer.
This was the stuff that drove the regular guy into the arms of Ronald Reagan. He spoke in plain language about ways reinvigorate America, about ending its four-year run as a laughing stock.
But as America has changed since 1980, so have the messages that appeal to the Reagan Democrats.
The auto and steel industries have reinvented themselves, and Joe Sixpack is now Joe Technician. The union guys who once stood with Ronald Reagan are no more. The ones who remain are now the foundation of today's Democratic Party. More than likely, they aren't coming back.
Bill Clinton said recently that he felt sorry for Republicans because they had nothing to run against. The Russians are lambs, the welfare system has been fixed, and the only pessimists are in the bond market.
Life is good, but Republicans still have something to run against. Our current political system is weakened by corruption, complacency and a lack of character.
If Ronald Reagan were running today, he'd focus on these problems and a different audience. He'd be more at home in Silicon Valley than Macomb County. His optimistic message of individuality, distrust of government and reliance on markets would undoubtedly make him a dot-comer.
These people talk an entirely different language: Signing bonus. 401(k). DVD. Lexus. Straight talk. Real time. H1 visas. Profit-sharing. I.P.O.'s. Equity. Venture capital. Angels.
Call these voters the Reagan independents. Republicans can appeal to this new generation of voters, through different, but no less appealing, messages: standing up to Washington insiders, fighting pork-barrel spending and the status quo, and telling the truth.
The candidate who best enunciates where he stands on these new issues has the opportunity to form a governing coalition that will rival the one Ronald Reagan established with those gritty guys from Michigan so long ago.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE GREEN PARTY;
Vowing to Restore Confidence, Nader Joins Race

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, announced today that he would make a second run for the presidency as a Green Party candidate and vowed, as he did in 1996, to take on big business and its influence on government.
"I can no longer stomach the systemic political decay that has weakened our democracy," said Mr. Nader, who will compete for the Green Party nomination against three others. "It is necessary to launch a sustained effort to wrest control of our democracy from the corporate government and restore it to the political government under the control of citizens." 
 Mr. Nader, 65, whose quest for the White House in 1996 earned him less than 1 percent of the vote, said at a news conference that he would raise enough money to pay his campaign workers but would not spend a nickel on polling, consulting firms or television advertisements. In 1996, he spent less than $5,000 of his own money.
First known for his crusade against the automobile industry in the 1960's, Mr. Nader founded several consumer advocacy groups over the years, including Public Citizen, which focus on corporate and government wrongdoing. The Green Party, an offspring of the antinuclear and environmental movements, shares similar goals, among them its pursuit of "ecological wisdom" and "grass-roots democracy."
Portraying himself as the only candidate willing to shake up the system, Mr. Nader said he was concerned about the growing disparity between rich and poor.
"Despite record economic growth, corporate profits and stock market highs year after year, a stunning array of deplorable conditions still prevails," Mr. Nader said in a statement posted on his Web site.
He acknowledged he would face an uphill battle as the Green Party nominee. Democratic and Republican candidates have huge campaign war chests and months of campaigning already behind them. Nevertheless, Mr. Nader said, he would be content to infuse "a powerful message" into this year's presidential election.

Bradley, Seeking Hispanic Support, Pushes Insurance Plan

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
Courting the Hispanic vote, former Senator Bill Bradley stopped at a Brooklyn elementary school yesterday morning and spoke about the need for universal health insurance, noting the disproportionate numbers of Latinos among the uninsured and questioning Vice President Al Gore's commitment on the issue.
Mr. Bradley said Mr. Gore's attacks against his plan "have cast doubt on his commitment to a basic plank of Democratic platform, which is national health insurance." 
 Mr. Bradley quoted figures from a recent Census Bureau study that found that despite a strong economy, the numbers of uninsured Americans grew to 44 million in 1998, including 11 million children. Hispanics, the study found, were least likely to have health coverage. More than a third of Hispanics were uninsured, compared with 22.2 percent of blacks, 21.1 percent of Asian-Americans and 11.9 percent of non-Hispanic whites.
"They work, sometimes two jobs," Mr. Bradley said of the uninsured. "Their employers just don't provide health insurance."
Speaking to a small audience at Public School 24, a new Spanish-English, dual-language elementary school in the working-class neighborhood of Sunset Park, Mr. Bradley also outlined his proposals to double federal Title I financing for schools in poor neighborhoods, require teachers to prove their expertise and offer incentives to recruit teachers to needy rural and urban schools.
Repeatedly, he called for the need to spread the benefits of a booming economy to the working poor.
"We should be fixing our roof when the sun is shining," he said, "and the sun is shining now. There's a difference between economic growth and broad-based prosperity."
Responding to questions, Mr. Bradley expressed his support for bilingual education programs and pledged to double a federal block grant for affordable child care. He also said he would end weapons testing by the United States Navy on the island of Vieques in Puerto Rico. Mr. Gore has adopted the same position.
"Bombing in Vieques should end," Mr. Bradley said. "We should not use it for live fire."
Last April, President Clinton ordered a moratorium on all training on Vieques after a Puerto Rican was killed in a bombing accident. In an agreement last month, Puerto Rico agreed to allow limited training, with nonexploding bombs, until the people of Vieques vote on the future of the training range.
Edmundo Quinones, 53, a social worker from Sunset Park who asked Mr. Bradley about Vieques, said he was gladdened by the vehemence of the candidate's reply.
"I just hope he follows through," Mr. Quinones said.
Mr. Bradley picked up the endorsement of Angel Rodriguez, the city councilman from Sunset Park who described Mr. Bradley's priorities on health care, education and economic development as the priorities of the Latino community.
"Our issues are the nation's issues," Mr. Rodriguez said.

HEADLINE: Hamburg Journal;
For a Fresh View, Go to Germany's West Window

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: HAMBURG, Germany

 BODY:
Hunting for the boom that never happened in post-cold-war Berlin? Try this handsome port city that purrs with prosperity.
The boutiques -- from home-grown Jil Sander to Gianni Versace, the cranes hoisting an enlarged port into being, the plans for a vast new downtown on a former dockland area, the rising tide of Internet companies: all this speaks of boomtown Hamburg and of a Germany still resisting the appeal of Berlin, its new capital. 
 The theory when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 was that German industry would return to Berlin, a city it largely abandoned in 1945, and that the bourgeoisie that Hitler's war decimated there would be partially reconstituted. Instead, what the last decade has confirmed is postwar Germany's deep attachment to a decentralized federalism.
That is evident nowhere more than in Hamburg. Its growth in recent years suggests that Berlin, for all its dreams of being a Weltstadt or world-class city, will never enjoy the dominance over Germany that Paris and London exercise over France and Britain.
"This city is booming because it has recovered its hinterland since the cold war's end," said Theo Sommer, the executive editor of the influential Hamburg-based weekly Die Zeit. "By comparison, Berlin's development seems lethargic."
That hinterland is Central Europe, which was unnaturally cut off from Hamburg by the Iron Curtain, a mere 20 miles to the east. Now the city is once again the major port of Prague, up the River Elbe, and the old trading links of the Hanseatic League have been re-established with towns like Gdansk in Poland.
As a result, container traffic at the port has increased to over 77 million tons from 55 million five years ago. Projected growth is so strong that a new port area is being built and the Elbe River deepened at a cost of $110 million.
"In 1989, we won back our neighbors on the Elbe River," said Mayor Ortwin Runde, a Social Democrat. "Trade between Germany and the Central European states that have emerged from Communism is now bigger than with the United States. As the port for more than 20 percent of German exports, we have naturally benefited."
In the self-important neo-Renaissance city hall, the offices of the Chamber of Commerce adjoin Mr. Runde's office. Nothing could more eloquently express the fierce attachment of this city to trade, its feeling of looking outward to the world rather than inward to an often despondent Germany. And it does not look only to the east.
"When it rains in London, the umbrellas go up in Hamburg," goes an old saying here. It reflects the city's sense of closeness to the British capital, with which it shares a taste for discretion, an intense pragmatism and an evident openness.
Among the statistics that Riesling-sipping Hamburg businessmen like to spout over plates of succulent sole is the fact that no other city, apart from New York, has more than 90 consulates. The consulates, of course, serve trade.
Germany is a country of both merchant cities and court cities. Among the former, Hamburg is joined by places like Cologne and Leipzig. The latter include Berlin and Dresden, places where past tragedy weighs heavy.
Although no German town has escaped this country's 20th-century trauma -- Hamburg was heavily bombed in World War II -- it often seems that the practical bent of the trading towns has enabled them to heal their wounds faster.
Berlin's repetitive bluster about becoming the new capital of "middle Europe" has remained unbacked by much solid evidence even as Hamburg has moved fast to exploit new opportunities to the east. Unemployment in the port city has fallen to 9.6 percent, from 12.6 percent, over the past two years; in Berlin it has remained at about 16 percent.
The most startling sign of Hamburg's confidence is a $10 billion development called Harbor City, planned on about 250 acres south of the city center where old dockland warehouses now stand.
Over the next 20 years, the warehouses are to be replaced by office space for more than 20,000 people, a terminal for luxury cruisers, hotels, theaters, stores and several thousand apartments. Construction begins this year.
Bernd Tiedeman, the managing director of the project, said it sums up "Hamburg's new ambitions after unification." In his vision, cruise ships will dock here bringing tourists who will go on excursions as far away as Berlin.
The notion of Hamburg as a gateway to Berlin may seem far-fetched, but if a long-planned high-speed train is ever built, the capital will be only 60 minutes away.
Meanwhile it is a measure of the continuing isolation of the capital -- deprived of its port by Poland's absorption of Szczecin (the former German Stettin) after World War II, and still lacking a direct flight to the United States -- that Hamburg may reasonably see itself as a center from which to visit Berlin.
"Look, Berlin looks east, Munich looks south, and we look to the west, which is where things are really happening for now," said Frank Sarfeld, the spokesman for America Online Europe, whose headquarters are in Hamburg.
He had a large muffin on his cluttered desk and a plate of ice cream -- "I only eat at my desk" -- as he gazed at three television screens providing news and stock prices. On his wall was a strategy chart mapping out "Operation Steady Drumbeat," a plan to keep AOL Europe in the news by providing a relentless stream of press releases.
"A lot of new media is coming here, because this is where the old media companies are and the spirit is right," Mr. Sarfeld said. "But with everyone looking for the same information-technology people, you have to have a good stock-option program. That's a must."
Stock options were certainly not in the thoughts of the Allies when, in 1946, they gave licenses in Hamburg to two of the first postwar German newspapers -- Die Welt and Die Zeit. But they did have in mind a decentralized Germany where no city could be as dominant as Hitler's Berlin. In this strategic design their success now seems conspicuous.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
With No Trading in U.S., Overseas Shares Are Mostly Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Most European and Asian stocks fell yesterday amid concerns that higher interest rates in the United States would hurt corporate profits.
Much of the fear stemmed from comments made last week by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, indicating that more rate increases were likely if the United States economy did not cool down. 
 Leading stock indicators in the United States, like the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index, tumbled 3 percent on Friday.
Asian and European markets followed suit yesterday. In London, the FTSE-100 index finished down 1.4 percent, or 83.40 points, at 6,081.6, while the Paris CAC-40 index tumbled 1.6 percent, or 95.44 points, to 5,967.28.
In Japan, the Nikkei index shed 245.28 points, or 1.23 percent, to finish at 19,543.75.
Stock and bond markets in the United States were closed yesterday in observance of Presidents' Day, giving foreign markets little guidance.
"The fall on Wall Street took people by surprise considering the economic news wasn't too bad," said Peter Caulkett, an equities salesman at Teather & Greenwood in London.
Mr. Caulkett said investors were "frightened in case it's the beginning of a serious setback" and were not likely to do any buying until New York investors returned today.
Mr. Greenspan, who said he was worried that the hot United States economy might lead to higher inflation, issued his warning in testimony last Thursday before Congress. Though they might cool the economy, higher interest rates might weigh down corporate profits as well.
In currency trading in London, the United States dollar was quoted at 111.22 Japanese yen, above its late New York level of 110.96 yen on Friday.
The euro was quoted at 98.64 cents, up from its late New York price of 98.49 cents.
In other markets, South Korean shares fell, with the Korea Composite Stock Price Index falling 33.82 points, to 845.32.
Hong Kong stocks were 1.7 percent lower, as the Hang Seng Index lost 276.79 points, to close at 16,322.37.
Germany was one of the few bright spots in Europe, with the DAX index rising 16.75 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,590.53.

HEADLINE: Is This Trip Necessary?: Clinton Risks Ire in India or Pakistan

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Will he or won't he? Should he or shouldn't he?
Those questions are the talk of the capitals of India and Pakistan as President Clinton -- who has announced that next month he will become the first president since Jimmy Carter to visit India -- makes the excruciatingly difficult decision about whether he will also stop in Pakistan, where the military seized power in a coup four months ago. 
 The downside is steep either way he calls it. India is unequivocally opposed to such a visit. Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has warned that the public here will be deeply offended if Mr. Clinton goes. Likewise, Pakistan is prepared to take great umbrage if Mr. Clinton does not pay his respects there. Pakistani officials warn that his absence could generate a vicious anti-American backlash.
There is a risk in the current angry, charged atmosphere -- one in which both sides have dug in their heels on some of the most contentious issues -- that Mr. Clinton's trip will stir resentments in both countries and leave peace just as distant as ever.
The last serious attempt at a peace initiative ended disastrously. A year ago today, the prime ministers of India and Pakistan held a news conference in Lahore, Pakistan, and promised to work out their differences at the bargaining table.
But soon the Pakistani Army apparently supported an infiltration of forces into the Indian-held part of Kashmir, a Himalayan territory that both countries claim, provoking an armed conflict there last summer that replaced the nascent good will between the two nations with bitter mistrust.
If Mr. Clinton is hoping to persuade India to return to negotiations with Pakistan, he is likely to be disappointed. Once burned and twice shy, India is unwilling to talk until it is convinced that Pakistan is no longer sponsoring attacks on Indian forces in Kashmir, which India sees as terrorism.
The Indians contend that a presidential visit to Pakistan would legitimize and prolong a military dictatorship that they say is using Islamic militants to intensify its proxy war against India in Kashmir.
Every few days, several Indian soldiers and policemen are killed in Kashmir by militants, which India says is evidence of Pakistan's continuing bad faith.
Some experts on the region also worry that Mr. Clinton is overestimating the power of his personality to get the two sides talking again.
"The president may not get the message how committed the Pakistani Army leadership is to fomenting violent insurgency in Kashmir and how readily Pakistani leaders in the past have told Americans what they want to hear, only to take advantage of their naivete later," said George Perkovich, a security analyst and the author of "India's Nuclear Bomb" (University of California, 1999).
The military government has not given ground on the major American concerns: a timetable for the return of democracy, a crackdown on terrorists operating in Pakistan and help in persuading Pakistan's allies who control much of Afghanistan, the Taliban, to turn over Osama bin Laden, the terrorism suspect who is believed to be living there.
And the Harakat ul-Mujahedeen, or Fighters Movement, is still functioning in Pakistan. American officials say the group, which is on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations, was involved in the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane in December,
Asked about the group, Javed Jabbar, a close friend and adviser to Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, said: "The acts of particular individuals who may do certain things do not necessarily reflect a particular organization's conscious policy. To focus on that while ignoring the state terrorism of 500,000 Indian troops in Kashmir is so disparate."
Pakistani officials and some experts argue that a Clinton visit to Pakistan is essential if he is serious about trying to further the cause of peace because there are two adversaries and it makes no sense to talk to only one of them.
Pakistan's military leaders, like their civilian predecessors, have sought to put Kashmir at the center of the international agenda. Earlier this month, the general went to Muzaffarabad, capital of the Pakistani-held part of Kashmir, and gave a fiery speech in support of the militants fighting Indian rule on the other side of the "line of control" that divides the territory.
But the Indians recently ruled out once again the proposal long put forward by Pakistan to have the United States or the United Nations mediate the conflict. And Mr. Clinton said he would not press for that without an invitation from both sides.
Despite the many difficulties, Stephen P. Cohen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Clinton should open lines of communication to the general that would be important if India and Pakistan end up in an armed conflict.
"The Indians will resent this," Mr. Cohen said, "but they should resent even more the long delay in going to their country. Hopefully they'll be polite hosts."
Pakistani officials warn that a presidential snub of their country, an old cold war ally, would enrage Islamic militants. "It would certainly strengthen those forces in our society that are extremist and skeptical of the United States," Mr. Jabbar said.
Some other Pakistanis go further andbrandish the specter of a nuclear-armed Pakistan threatened by rising Islamic fundamentalism and weakened by a deeply troubled economy. That irritates Indians, who see it as a kind of blackmail.
But some American diplomats find the specter real and frightening.
"There's been an element of rhetorical blackmail, but these concerns are real," a senior administration official said. "This is a country with a demonstrated nuclear capacity that has increasing concerns about terrorist organizations, about jihad, about sectarian violence."
As things stand now, it does not appear likely that the president will collect any easy victory in either country on issues of war and peace. He has hoped that both countries will sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a step that Washington says would slow the nuclear arms race here, but neither country seems inclined to do so.
The Hindu nationalist-led government of India, which sought no national consensus before it tested nuclear weapons in May 1998, insists that it must build just such a consensus now before it signs the treaty.
Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton has decided that it is in American interests to engage India, a democracy that is home to one-sixth of humanity, on issues ranging from the environment to trade.
"It would be stupid of the United States to ignore India's potential economically, or its role in dealing with global problems," said an American diplomat. "It would not serve our purpose well if we shunned India or sent it to the gulag of bad-boy nations."
Now Mr. Clinton will have to make similar calculations about Pakistan.
"Everyone recognizes that this is a close call," said an administration official.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
As BritishSour on the Euro, Blair Puts the Onus on Europeans

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Almost a year ago, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain seemed to nudge this country closer to joining in the European single currency, offering a cautious and conditional timetable for signing up to use the euro.
It was, at best, a tentative testing of the cloudy waters of British nationalism. 
 Twelve months later, even that nebulous schedule -- foreseeing possible entry between 2002 and 2005 -- has receded as the economics of the euro have sunk ever deeper into the morass of British ambiguity toward Continental Europe.
The currency itself, down more than 15 percent against the dollar since its introduction in January 1999, has lost 14 percent of its value against the pound, pushing the price of British exports to the Continent ever higher. Opinion surveys have shown sentiment in this country swinging not simply against joining the euro zone, but for a sizable minority, against remaining a member of the European Union.
Some representatives of British big business, citing the government's lack of leadership, have backed away from their previously vocal support for the single currency. And Mr. Blair's euroskeptic adversaries have delighted in developments -- ranging from the continued ban on British beef in France and Germany, to European Union calls for harmonized tax policies -- citing them as evidence of Continental malevolence.
"It was a particularly bad year for the European cause," said Ben Hall, research director at the Center for European Reform, which is pro-European, "and the decline in the euro did not make it easier to persuade the British people to ditch the pound."
And so Mr. Blair has switched tactics. Rather than try to persuade his compatriots of Europe's virtues, he is increasingly telling his European partners that it is up to them to make themselves more alluring in British eyes by embracing the kind of freewheeling economic ways that Britain has sought to import from the United States. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, he told the powerful and the wealthy: "The question for Europe is clear. Can it take on the attitudes and interests of the past and move decisively to gain a lead in the new economy and industries of the future?"
The risks of remaining outside the euro zone are clear, too. At Davos, Nobuyuki Idei, president of the Sony Corporation, bluntly told the prime minister that Sony's future investments in Britain would be jeopardized by the government's refusal to commit itself to joining in the single currency.
That raised a question about Britain's role as Europe's most powerful magnet for investment by companies who see their British operations as a springboard to the European Union's single market -- and who seek the simplicity of a single currency.
Jobs have been brought into the argument, as well. The trade and industry minister, Stephen Byers, cited recent studies today to say that three million British jobs -- one million of them in exporting industries -- depended on membership in the European single market. More than half of Britain's trade, he said, is with Continental Europe.
In some ways, these arguments fudge the issue. By portraying the euro's opponents as enemies of British membership in the European Union, Mr. Blair's government is seeking to discredit its critics as people prepared to put what Mr. Byers called "political dogma" before the nation's economic interests.
William Hague, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said today that Mr. Blair was "trying to link the mainstream majority who want to keep the pound with the extremist minority who want to leave the European Union."
"The real debate in British politics is not about Europe -- in or out -- as Tony Blair wants us to pretend," said Mr. Hague, who recently embarked on a tour of the country in a truck emblazoned with the Union Jack, part of a campaign to keep the pound. "The real debate is about the euro -- in or out -- and Tony Blair knows he is losing the argument."
Some of Mr. Blair's ministers acknowledge that Mr. Hague may have a point. "I accept criticism, either of me personally or perhaps of other members of the government, that we haven't done enough," Mr. Byers said today. "And what we now need to do, I think, is to engage in the debate. There is a real battle here that we have to win."
That is important because the government has committed itself to seeking popular support for joining in the single currency in a referendum after the next national election -- an election that must be held by May 2002 and may be held earlier. And if Mr. Hague has his way, the election will hinge partly on the question of British adoption of the euro.
Britain has laid down five conditions for joining, one of which is that there be "sustainable convergence" between the British and Continental European economies. Those conditions do not prevail today: Britain's short-term interest rates are roughly twice the level of the 11 euro zone countries, while its unemployment rate below 5 percent is perhaps half the Continental European average.
But the single currency has never been a purely economic issue anywhere in Europe, least of all in Britain, the only major European country where the question of membership has been aired in a public, if sometimes fanciful debate. For some opponents here of the single currency, the Europeans, especially France and Germany, are often depicted as conducting a sinister plot to dictate a political and economic agenda contrary to British interests.
Mr. Blair's shift in demanding reforms on the Continent -- where some Britons see only slow attention to issues of economic change -- is intended as an antidote to that argument.
"If Blair is seen to be shaping the reform agenda," Mr. Hall at the Center for European Reform said, "the theory is that that will persuade the British people that things are moving in our direction and not just run by the French and the Germans."
But the debate, he said, "never will be rational."

HEADLINE: All Aboard for a Big Rail Deal?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
It is just steel and stone, a rough line scratched across an immense and largely empty landscape. But for much of the last century, as the whistle of Canadian National freight trains pierced the northern night, the "government railroad," as CN was known, helped define Canada.
The grand old railroad ran from east to west, and so did Canadian commerce -- even with American markets lying seductively close to the border. So long as there was a separate Canadian market, and a separate Canadian railway, generations of politicians vowed, there would be a separate Canada. 
 Now, the current president of the Canadian National Railway Company, Paul M. Tellier, has a different vision of the railroad, of Canada and of the American continent -- a vision that some people on both sides of the border reject. Though his focus remains transcontinental, he is looking south, across the United States border and beyond that into Mexico.
Mr. Tellier wants to merge the Montreal-based CN with a giant American railroad, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, and create the most titanic railroad this continent has ever seen. The behemoth would have 50,000 miles of track, combined annual revenue of $12.5 billion, freight service to 32 states and 8 Canadian provinces, and cross-border access from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Mexico City to Long Beach, Calif.
The proposed $6 billion rail pact is important for what it says about one of America's oldest industries as well as what it shows about how North America is changing. Perhaps more than any other symbol, the alliance would underscore how far the formation of a truly integrated continental economy has developed in the six years since the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect.
"There has been a change in the mind of the peoples of North America," said Halina Ostrovski, president of the Canadian Council for the Americas, an economics-oriented research organization in Toronto. "They now see the three countries as one big market."
Not everyone is willing to accept the vision of the new railroad or the changes it represents. In the United States, shippers and unions, burned by service disruptions after other big rail mergers, oppose the deal, a cashless transaction that would create a new holding company, North American Railways. Competing railroads have warned that another merger at this time would push the industry into a final round of consolidations that would end with just two enormous networks to serve the entire continent of North America.
In Canada, shippers and farmers are worried that the merger will reduce what little competition exists -- CN's only national rival is the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. And fervent nationalists see the proposed merger as the loss of a revered national symbol and the last spike in the dream of an independent, sovereign Canada.
"We would probably not have the western part of the country in Canada today if not for these railways," said David Orchard, a prairie farmer and chairman of a Canadian group called Citizens Concerned About Free Trade. "This merger would be a betrayal of everything that the founders of the country fought for."
Both freight lines are led by executives determined to drag American railroads into a new era. Robert D. Krebs of the Fort Worth-based Burlington Northern is a bred-in-the-bone railroad man, with 34 years' experience running American trains. Mr. Tellier, who joined CN eight years ago, is a former civil servant with a passion for Descartes.
The combined railroad, they say, makes perfect economic sense. North-South traffic across the borders is expanding at a rate of 10 percent to 15 percent a year, while east-west traffic is rising no more than 4 percent annually. United States trade with Canada and Mexico has continued to grow even when trade with many other countries flattened out.
"What we're seeing in North America is what you would expect from the development of a free trading zone, but in many ways it goes beyond that," said Jorge O. Mariscal, a managing director at Goldman, Sachs. "It's now engulfing banking, telecommunications and transportation in a quite remarkable way."
The railroads have taken pains to present the deal as a merger of equals. Burlington Northern and CN would keep their own offices, and their locomotives would continue to be painted with their separate corporate logos.
But the balance of power seems to tip toward the Canadians. The parent company, North American Railways, will be in Montreal, and, by Canadian law, the majority of board members must be Canadian. Mr. Krebs, 66, would become non-executive chairman and Mr. Tellier, 60, chief executive.
The $40 billion North American freight railroad industry has already slimmed down considerably in response to relentless competition from trucking, which began offering transcontinental service a decade ago.
"Truckers have been eating our lunch every day of the week," Mr. Tellier said.
Over the last two decades the number of large, independent -- so-called Class I -- freight lines has declined substantially. In 1980, 26 such freight railroads operated in the United States, according to the Association of American Railroads. Today, just seven are left. While that decline was due in part to changes in the way railroads are categorized, there is no doubt that national railroads have been forced to get bigger to survive.
The outcry over the Burlington Northern-CN alliance has reached the Surface Transportation Board, the United States regulatory agency with the power to review, and possibly block, rail mergers. The board has scheduled an unusual public hearing next month -- before the formal merger application is even filed -- to look at the rail industry's future.
If railroad consolidation "plays itself out to the endgame that some feel it will," Linda J. Morgan, chairwoman of the board, wrote in response to the merger announcement in December, "this is the final round."
The most recent consolidations -- CSX and Norfolk Southern's absorption of Conrail, and the Union Pacific's acquisition of the Southern Pacific -- have not gone smoothly. Disgruntled shippers who continue to suffer delays and interruptions caused by the last mergers are in no mood for yet more consolidation. Led by the Chemical Manufacturers Association, they have made their displeasure known to regulators and to important members of Congress.
"This just ensures that politics is going to be the operative word," said James M. Higgins, a railroad analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "It has become a political issue, and politics is more about perception than reality."
The regulatory environment in Canada is quite different. The only significant review will be undertaken by the federal Competition Bureau, which will assess the merger's impact on competition within Canada, where the two railroads' lines overlap just for short stretches in Manitoba and British Columbia.
But Canadian legislators, particularly in the grain-growing west, where farms, mines and manufacturing plants rely on efficient rail service, are concerned that the combined railroad will favor Burlington Northern's more heavily used and profitable western line in the northern United States over Canadian National's parallel route. "The big issue in western Canada is lack of competition," said Reg Alcock, a ruling-party member of Parliament from Winnipeg. "We don't have many options."
Even Mr. Tellier of Canadian National acknowledges that support is growing for Canada's House of Commons to use a coming revision of the Canadian Transportation Act to give federal officials new powers to review mergers.
"If I was back in my previous job would I argue that it makes sense for the Government of Canada to bring an amendment to Parliament?" asked Mr. Tellier, who was clerk of the Privy Council, which made him the top bureaucrat in Canada, before taking control of CN in 1992. "Sure it makes sense. Do I expect something like this to be passed overnight? The answer is no."
He accuses Canadian nationalists and the competing railroads of playing on emotions to fight the merger. "We're not going to get into any kind of emotional debate or confrontation," he told analysts at a meeting in New York. "We're going forward in a very rational, Cartesian fashion to make our case."
Still, the emotions are real. Perhaps more than any other nation, Canada used the building of the railroad to stitch disparate colonies into a nation. The fledgling federal government used the audacious promise of building a rail line across the empty western prairies to entice the faraway province of British Columbia to enter confederation in 1871.
The building of the Canadian Pacific and what later became the Canadian National were heroic undertakings, spurred more by national pride than economic sense. The cost was sizable, with billions of dollars in subsidies going toward keeping the railroads running.
By 1919, a group of money-losing lines was taken over by the government and combined to form Canadian National. In the early 1990's, CN was privatized. More than 60 percent of the shares are held by American investors.
Mr. Tellier said he had no patience for those who think the alliance represents the Americanization of Canada. Last year, he bought the Illinois Central and it was an open secret that he was shopping for another American line, the Kansas City Southern, which is part owner of the recently privatized line from Mexico City to the border that carries about 40 percent of Mexico's rail traffic.
CN already has a 15-year marketing agreement with the Kansas City Southern that gives it access to the Mexico City line.
"If you look at a map, it would be a logical extension at one point in time," Mr. Tellier said, suggesting that CN might go after the Kansas City Southern again. He also said that an alliance with a carrier in the Northeast was inevitable.
Mr. Tellier is sometimes criticized for thinking like a government official and not like the chief executive of a tradition-bound business that he has become. But Mr. Krebs of Burlington Northern who has spent his whole career in railroading, is also convinced that running the trains on a continental basis is not only logical but inevitable.
"Market forces are demanding a transcontinental system," he said. "It's just a matter of time."

HEADLINE: CHINA SAYS TAIWAN CANNOT CONTINUE DELAYING REUNION

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 21

 BODY:
Less than one month before presidential elections in Taiwan, the Chinese government released the bluntest warning yet that it will not wait indefinitely for the island to reunite with the mainland. A prolonged lack of negotiations, in itself, China warned, could provoke a military attack.
The Chinese have long made it clear that any moves by Taiwan toward formal independence would lead to war. But today's government report on Taiwan adds -- for the first time in such a definitive policy statement -- that if Taiwan refuses indefinitely to pursue "the peaceful settlement of cross-straits reunification through negotiations, then the Chinese government will only be forced to adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force, to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity." 
 The report does not provide timetable or deadline for negotiating progress. Still, "This is a signal that Beijing is getting impatient with the delays in the process of reunification," said Andrew Yang, secretary general of the China Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a private group in Taipei. "This is a warning to the people of Taiwan."
Taiwan officials said they would not comment until they had studied the document. As of tonight, the candidates in the March 18 presidential elections had not responded. The top contenders have favored talks of some sort, but not Beijing's vision of reunification.
The 11,000-word report, entitled "The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue," was released by the Taiwan affairs office and the information office of the state council, China's cabinet.
It elaborates on China's longstanding proposal for a negotiated return of Taiwan under a version of the "one country, two systems" formula, with even greater autonomy than was given to Hong Kong, which reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. "Provided that it is within the framework of one China, any question can be discussed," the report says, including "Taiwan's international space for economic, cultural and social activities compatible with its status, the political status of the Taiwan authorities and other questions."
That formula has been rejected as too confining by Taiwan's leaders and the three leading presidential candidates.
The dire warnings in the document were a reminder of what an emotional issue the reunification of Taiwan with the "motherland" is for Beijing, especially now that Hong Kong and Macao have returned to the fold. While there was no ultimatum or threat of immediate attack, they also underscore how explosive the confrontation across the Taiwan Strait is, potentially drawing the United States into war with China.
Today's report lambastes the United States for providing advanced weapons to Taiwan, which China says violates promises, and for proposals in Congress for a closer military relationship with the island, which it calls a "gross interference in China's internal affairs and a grave threat to China's security."
The United States officially supports the concept of "one China," but is also committed to providing Taiwan with the means to defend itself against attack.
In Washington, the State Department said there would be no official response until the report was studied "very carefully." But the harder line on Taiwan was likely to cause political problems for the Clinton administration as it faces a battle for Congressional approval of to get China's membership in the World Trade Organization approved in Congress. And the report's denunciation of the Congressional bill to upgrade military ties with Taiwan, which passed the House this month, could enhance support for the bill in the Senate.
The new Chinese report bitterly condemns Taiwan's president, Lee Tung-hui, accusing him of destroying previous talks with his assertion last summer that Taiwan would negotiate with China only on a "state-to-state" basis and his refusal to repeat the traditional homage to the concept of "one China."
After Mr. Lee's statement last summer, China broke off planned high-level meetings, charging that Mr. Lee was secretly scheming for independence even though he professes to support reunion at some distant point -- after the mainland, too, has become a democracy.
The report condemns Mr. Lee's suggestion of waiting for democracy as "an excuse for postponing and resisting reunification," since China has offered to allow different political systems to coexist under the banner of one China.
It is too early to tell what effect China's sharp words might have on Taiwan's election campaign. In 1996, before Taiwan's first direct elections for president, China was angered by Mr. Lee's defiant statements and fired missiles near Taiwan as a warning. The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region.
Mr. Lee won election handily and seemed to gain popular appeal though his brinkmanship, but since then many Taiwanese who had toyed with the idea of declaring independence have had second thoughts.
China lacks the military power to invade Taiwan, experts say, and is no match for American forces should they be drawn into a confrontation. But China is steadily improving its navy; it recently received the first of two Russian-built guided-missile destroyers designed to penetrate American carrier group defenses. And it is building up forces of ballistic and cruise missiles. Both could be used to cripple Taiwan's economy by disrupting sea lanes.
So far, this year's election campaign has involved fewer military tensions, and in Taiwan the candidates have gone out of their way to avoid sounding provocative. Surveys show that a large majority of the Taiwan public, after enjoying years of prosperity and democracy, does not want a military confrontation with China.
All three major candidates, -- Vice President Lien Chan of the governing Nationalist Party; James Soong, a former Nationalist leader who is running as an independent, and Chen Shui-bian, of the Democratic Progressive Party -- have made vague pledges to resume negotiations of some sort with China and to encourage more trade and business links. But none endorses China's formula for reunification, and it is unclear what the two sides might say in future to talks to give China a sense of progress toward unity.
Some political experts think that today's Chinese warning may be intended, in part, to scare voters away from Mr. Chen, whose party has long been associated with Taiwan independence. The founding charter of his party calls for a referendum on whether the island, still formally called the Republic of China, should be renamed the Republic of Taiwan.
Mr. Chen, seeking to broaden his electoral appeal, has declared that since Taiwan is already independent in practice, it does not need a formal declaration and that if elected, he would not pursue a referendum on the issue unless Taiwan came under attack. He has offered to discuss improving communications and economic ties, something the mainland badly wants.
The report released today unequivocally rejects the legitimacy of any referendum in Taiwan on independence, warning, "Any attempt to separate Taiwan from China through so-called referendum would only lead the Taiwan people to disaster."
In effect, today's warning puts the Taiwan candidates on notice that China does not intend to allow a repeat of Mr. Lee's performance, which it believes brought a halt to even the pretense of negotiations toward symbolic unification.

HEADLINE: Pardon Lets Black Exile Come Home

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
President Clinton granted a pardon today to a 63-year-old political scientist who went into self-imposed exile almost four decades ago after his draft board in Georgia, learning that he was black, refused to address him as "mister."
The pardon for the man, Preston King, a professor at the University of Lancaster in Britain, overturns Mr. King's 1961 conviction for draft evasion and allows him to return to the United States for the funeral of his oldest brother later this week. 
 Mr. King had said at the time of his conviction that he was willing to report for an Army physical and serve in the military so long as the draft board in Albany, Ga., referred to him as "Mr. King" instead of "Preston."
The board, which had used "mister" in earlier correspondence to Mr. King but stopped after its members learned of his skin color, refused. Mr. King was convicted of draft evasion by an all-white jury and sentenced to 18 months in prison. He fled the country while out on bail.
Among those who had recently called for a pardon was the trial judge in the case, William A. Bootle of Federal District Court in Macon, Ga. In a letter to President Clinton last year, Judge Bottle, who is now in his 90's, said Mr. King had "followed his conscience just as Rosa Parks had followed hers."
A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said President Clinton had "considered the facts, the law and all the circumstances involved here and decided that clemency was appropriate."
He said that the White House had a policy of not discussing the details of the president's reasoning in clemency cases but that the decision-making process was speeded up for Mr. King "because of humanitarian concern," given his brother's death.
"Preston King was one of the first people who stood up against government discrimination," said one of his lawyers, Elizabeth Holtzman, the former Democratic congresswoman and Brooklyn district attorney.
"He was denied an extension of his draft deferment because of his race," Ms. Holtzman said in an interview. "He was addressed in a demeaning fashion because of his race. He was convicted by a totally segregated jury. In a way, this case reflects not just Preston King coming home, but this country coming home."
She said Mr. King, who was traveling tonight to London from his home in Lancaster and was not available for an interview, would return to the United States on Wednesday, for the first time in 39 years.
Clennon L. King, a television journalist in Jacksonville, Fla. who is a nephew of Mr. King, said that the family was "thrilled" by news of the pardon "although these are very sober circumstances because of the death of his brother."
Mr. King's oldest brother, also named Clennon, a civil rights leader who was committed to an insane asylum for a time because he had the temerity to try to enroll at the all-white University of Mississippi in the 1950's, died last week at the age of 79. He is scheduled to be buried on Thursday.
Mr. King graduated magna cum laude from all-black Fisk University in Nashville in 1956 and received a deferment from military service that allowed him to study for a master's degree at the London School of Economics.
He has said the draft board refused additional deferments and began to refer to him simply as "Preston" in letters, dropping the "mister" that was routine for white students when he appeared in person at their offices in 1958 and the board's members realized for the first time that he was black.
In his letter to the White House, Judge Bootle said that Mr. King "has paid a big price" and that "to lock him up today would amount to overkill."
While he insisted that the trial had been "error free," the judge suggested that Mr. King was right, in fact, heroic, to stand up to the draft board and insist that he be addressed as "mister." "Mr. King was deeply sensitive to what he recognized as this long-lasting, deeply rooted method of racial discrimination," the judge said.
He noted that a new federal courthouse in Albany was being named for another of Mr. King's brothers, C. B. King, a prominent civil rights lawyer. "If Mr. King can be allowed to attend the dedication of this building," the letter said, "many of us who are familiar with the facts will be comfortable and happy that this little tragedy has ended."

HEADLINE: Safety a Worry as Companies Shop for Nuclear Reactors

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21

 BODY:
As nuclear families go, the Indian Point 2 reactor's is about as small as they get. It has suffered its teething problems, growing pains, setbacks and crises pretty much as an only child, under the tutelage of a corporate parent, Consolidated Edison, that has little experience in the care and feeding of a nuclear reactor.
The adjacent Indian Point 3, with its checkered operational history, is also pretty lonely, in the corporate sense. It is run by the New York Power Authority, which has only one other reactor, of a different design, on the shores of Lake Ontario. 
 But both may be sold soon. Would the plants operate better, or more safely, if adopted into a company with a bigger brood?
"There's benefit to aggregating expertise," said Stephen E. Quinn, a vice president of Con Edison. "There's a lot of professional things you gain there." His company once set out to have three reactors, but Indian Point 1, which resembles a modern reactor the way a Commodore 64 resembles an iMac, was shut down before Indian Point 2 opened in 1974. Con Ed built Indian Point 3 but sold it to the Power Authority before opening it.
Both Con Ed and the Power Authority run what experts sometimes refer to as mom and pop reactors. Like many other utilities, Con Ed is seeking to sell Indian Point 2 mostly because of utility deregulation, which has sent a handful of other groups shopping for reactors.
Experts, including advocates and critics of nuclear power, are ambivalent about what the effect could be. It could be management with more experience, or it could be management with a stronger drive to make money, which some people think may not be consistent with safety.
Circumstances seem likely to provide a test. Power Authority directors are scheduled to meet this month to vote on the sale of Indian Point 3 and the James A. FitzPatrick reactor, in Oswego, N.Y., to Entergy Nuclear, a company based in Jackson, Miss. The company has negotiated a deal to operate Nine Mile Point 1 and 2, in Scriba, N.Y., for Rochester Gas and Electric, although ownership of those reactors is confused. Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 could go to another entity that is trying to buy reactors: Amergen, a partnership of British Energy and the parent company of Philadelphia Electric.
Entergy officials would not say if they were negotiating for Indian Point 2, but Carl Crawford, a spokesman, said: "We are interested in any plant that's available in the U.S. We're building a new fleet of reactors in the northeast."
The Amergen partnership, which is interested in Indian Point 2, would like to buy as many as 20 reactors, a spokesman, J. William Jones, said. The group has already bought Three Mile Island 1, near Harrisburg, Pa., and Clinton, near the southern Illinois city of the same name, and has struck a deal to buy Oyster Creek, in Toms River, N.J., and Vermont Yankee, near Brattleboro, Vt.
There are factors that make it positive for safety, said David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer based here at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which is generally critical of the utilities and of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. "The new owner of a nuclear power plant clearly has a commitment to a nuclear future," said Mr. Lochbaum, who worked as a consultant for both Philadelphia Electric and Entergy before moving to the Union of Concerned Scientists. "They've made a business decision they can make money at nuclear power. They will do whatever it takes to make that investment work."
The sellers, on the other hand, "may not have made the choice to go nuclear," Mr. Lochbaum said. "It may just be the legacy they've inherited." Of course, he added, "you can also make the counterargument that the new owner is only trying to make a quick buck, to recoup their investment and make some money."
Shirley Anne Jackson, a physicist who retired last year as chairwoman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to become president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, N.Y., also expressed ambivalence.
"If you have a strong company taking over a number of plants, then you'd have the potential for quite a salutary effect in how those plants are operated, in overall safety performance as well as economic performance," she said. "It's more difficult for a single-plant utility to amass the kind of critical mass to be able to have the kind of expertise and resources to bring to bear."
But she added, "you can't argue that size in and of itself gives you good performance." Two of the biggest operators, she said, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Commonwealth Edison, also had some of the worst operating experiences.
Some people concerned about nuclear safety say that a buyer is under more pressure to keep a plant running, even if it needs maintenance, than an old-style monopoly utility with a captive customer population. But other experts say that high reliability and safety are likely to come hand in hand.
At Entergy Nuclear, Jerry W. Yelverton, the president and chief executive, said that the old theory was that plants that shut down only briefly for refueling must be skipping something important and reducing safety. But he said that capacity factor -- the amount of electricity produced, compared with what would have occurred if the plant ran at full power 365 days a year -- tended to be highest when other statistics were also favorable, like low radiation exposure to workers, low number of hours when crucial systems were not working, and small number of problems that had to be reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Entergy, he said, had changed its strategy, undertaking aggressive maintenance on various systems while the plant was running to keep them in top shape. One example is emergency diesel generators, needed in case of a blackout in the region. Entergy used to take the generators, which are trouble-prone, off-line for service while the plant was shut, which lengthened refueling shut-downs and also made them unavailable at a time when, analysis shows, they were more likely to be needed. Now it takes them off-line in rotation while the plant is running, keeping them in top shape and raising their availability at important times.
Others see a less glowing picture. The Nuclear Information and Resource Service, a nonprofit group here that favors shutting down reactors, is trying to block Amergen's purchase of Oyster Creek. The partnership is expanding into too many plants, according to Michael Mariotte, the executive director, and may be stretched too thin.
In addition, he said, operators are supposed to have enough cash on hand to weather a six-month shutdown, which can amount to $75 million or more, and to help pay for a nuclear accident anywhere in the country, which can come to $10 million a year for 7 years. It is not clear if Amergen can do that for more than one reactor, Mr. Mariotte said.
"It's a company with essentially no assets," he said. "It didn't exist two years ago."
Mr. Jones, the Amergen spokesman, said he could not say if such liabilities would rest with the partnership or the parent companies.
At the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Robert S. Wood, the senior financial policy adviser, said that Amergen was financially qualified to handle its completed purchases.
When companies make an agreement to buy a plant and apply to have the operating license transferred to them, they tend to have far more experience than the original licensee had. Between acquisitions and mergers, another trend in the utility industry, the agency foresees getting about 20 applications in the next few months, representing one-fifth of the operating reactors.
But Mr. Mariotte of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service said it was a case-by-case problem. Recalling Northeast Utilities, among others, he said, "the largest utilities have often gotten into the most trouble."

HEADLINE: Hasty Call for Amnesty

 BODY:
The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s call for the government to grant amnesty to an estimated six million illegal immigrants currently living in the United States and to eliminate most sanctions on employers who hire them in the future was a surprising turnabout. Until now, organized labor has fought hard to keep illegal workers from taking jobs from higher-paid union workers.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s proposal is attractive to many groups. Unions welcome the chance to go after a huge new pool of unorganized workers. Employers welcome the chance to hire cheap labor without fear of criminal liability. And illegal immigrants who have worked hard for years and raised families under harrowing circumstances would welcome access to medical care and other services denied to illegal aliens. 
 But the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s proposal should be rejected. Amnesty would undermine the integrity of the country's immigration laws and would depress the wages of its lowest-paid native-born workers.
Back in 1986, Congress granted amnesty to an estimated three million illegal immigrants as part of a law that also promised to crack down on further illegal immigration by imposing sanctions on employers who knowingly violated the law. At that time, this page endorsed amnesty because it was tied to measures that promised to keep further rounds of illegal immigration in check. But 14 years later there are twice as many illegal workers, and employer sanctions are widely deemed a joke. Workers pretend to show employers proof of citizenship or work visas and employers pretend they do not know the proof is fake.
The primary problem with amnesties is that they beget more illegal immigration. Demographers trace the doubling of the number of Mexican immigrants since 1990 in part to the amnesty of the 1980's. Amnesties signal foreign workers that American citizenship can be had by sneaking across the border, or staying beyond the term of one's visa, and hiding out until Congress passes the next amnesty. The 1980's amnesty also attracted a large flow of illegal relatives of those workers who became newly legal. All that is unfair to those who play by the immigration rules and wait years to gain legal admission.
It is also unfair to unskilled workers already in the United States. Between about 1980 and 1995, the gap between the wages of high school dropouts and all other workers widened substantially. Prof. George Borjas of Harvard estimates that almost half of this trend can be traced to immigration of unskilled workers. Illegal immigration of unskilled workers induced by another amnesty would make matters worse. The better course of action is to honor America's proud tradition by continuing to welcome legal immigrants and find ways to punish employers who refuse to obey the law.

Remembering a George for All Seasons

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
Happy Washington's Birthday! Today we celebrate the career of a George who became first in the hearts of his countrymen without conducting a single town meeting.
Washington, by the way, was actually born on Feb. 11, not 22. In 1752 Britain and its colonies jumped ahead 11 days in order to get their calendar in sync with the rest of Europe. After that, he was never entirely certain about his birthdate, or even birth year, since the Americans also shifted New Year's Day from March 25 to Jan. 1. 
 Q. Excuse me, but why in the world are you telling me all this?
A. I just thought it would be a nice millennial touch.
Q. Uh-huh. Actually, I was hoping you'd explain how the Bush campaign managed to spend $50 million so fast.
A. George W. Bush was asked that very question last week. He told reporters that "We have a plan in place," and also that "We're on the plan." He went on to say that his campaign had "got a plan," which was "a broad plan" and "a plan that's working."
Q. So in other words, it's a plan.
A. The official theory is that the Bush campaign cannily and deliberately threw all its resources into smashing John McCain in South Carolina, confident that it would still be able to raise heaps more money later on.
Q. What's the unofficial theory?
A. Contrarians believe that Mr. Bush, like Al Gore before him, fell victim to the Law of Financial Leakage, which dictates that a candidate's assets will quickly come into equilibrium with supporters' desire to spend them. Cynics refer to this as the District Chairmen With Unemployed Relatives Rule, and it is far more effective than the Federal Election Commission in leveling the presidential playing field.
Q. Have you tried that out on the Bush campaign people?
A. They prefer it to the Gramm-Connally Law, which states that presidential candidates who emerge from Texas bearing pots and pots of money inevitably come to disaster.
Q. Is George Bush really a completely different candidate now? How do you get a middle-aged man to change himself so fast?
A. Stylistically, Mr. Bush has simply adopted the Al Gore tactic of demonstrating his sincerity by raising his voice. But while Mr. Gore likes to yell out entire sentences, Mr. Bush simply goes for every other noun. ("The people of THIS STATE can start the end of the CLINTON ERA in Washington D.C.")
Q. Would you remind me again what compassionate conservatism is?
A. To quote Mr. Bush: "It is conservative to lower taxes. It is compassionate to give the money back to the people."
Q. If you lowered taxes, who else would you give the money back to?
A. Hey, you can't claim the low road from a high horse. We're talking about reducing the toll booth to the middle class and demolishing the tolls.
Q. How come when the other candidates are fuzzy on an issue, reporters say they're "ducking," but when John McCain does it they say he's "evolving"?
A. When reporters point out contradictions in his positions, Senator McCain often says, "That's a good point, I'll have to think about that." This is what we call evolving.
Q. How come he got whomped in South Carolina?
A. Look, it's an unusual place. Half of American history involves efforts to get South Carolina to stop acting out.
Q. I saw the Democrats had a debate last night. Whatever happened to that primary?
A. Some say John McCain sucked the air out of Bill Bradley's campaign. My own theory is that Mr. Bradley's troubles began when women realized that he sounds a lot like an extremely pompous husband pretending to be patient.
Q. Does he still have a chance?
A. Mr. Bradley is trying to re-start his campaign even as we speak. He says the state of Washington could be the firewall that stops Al Gore in his tracks.
Q. Say what?
A. That's the plan, and if it keeps the race alive until my state gets a chance to vote, let there be firewalls. The Washington primary, by the way, is on Feb. 29. Have I mentioned that, because of calendric reforms initiated by Pope Gregory XIII, this is the first '00 leap year since 1600?

Debate Over Who Must Pay For Calls to Cellular Phones
A debate is raging at the Federal Communications Commission about whether cellular telephone customers must continue to pay to receive calls as well as to make them.
Cellular companies, hoping to make wireless phones a viable alternative to the desk phone, have pressed for a rule change that would allow them to bring wireless calls under the same "calling party pays" system used with the traditional telephone network. Some traditional phone companies and consumer groups oppose such a change. Page A1.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Splits on Issue Of Cellular Charges For Incoming Calls

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
A debate is raging at the Federal Communications Commission about whether cellular telephone customers must continue to pay to receive calls as well as to make them.
Cellular companies, hoping to make wireless phones a viable, everyday alternative to the desk phone, have pressed for new rules that would allow them to bring wireless calls under the same "calling party pays" system used with the traditional telephone network. 
 But traditional local phone companies, which benefit from the current system, see far less need to change the rules. And some consumer groups argue that a change would mean higher rates for regular phone customers.
The F.C.C. had been scheduled to vote on final rules for such a system last Thursday, giving cellular companies the option of adopting caller-pays billing systems. But the vote was canceled amid continued wrangling among commissioners, staff members and lobbyists. The commission could still reach a decision over the next few weeks, but with heavy lobbying from all sides, the process could well stretch into the spring.
More than 80 million American consumers now use wireless phones. But for only very few of them has the wireless phone become a true replacement for the standard home telephone, because the current payment system gives standard, wired telephones a distinct cost advantage.
When the wired telephone rings at home, people generally answer without worrying about whether it is a local or long distance call. Unless the call is made collect, any charges will be the responsibility of the person who placed the call.
But as anyone with a cellular phone knows, wireless subscribers almost invariably pay for incoming as well as outgoing calls. People who use a traditional telephone to place a long-distance call to a wireless subscriber incur long-distance fees just as if they were calling a desk phone. Still, wireless charges can quickly mount, especially if the incoming call incurs roaming fees. That is a big reason many users do not give their numbers to others and generally leave their cell phones turned off.
Even with the rise of so-called one rate plans, pioneered by AT&T, which eliminate roaming fees and long-distance charges for wireless users, subscribers still pay for incoming calls.
The current payment system for cellular calls is a legacy of the industry's founding in the early 1980's, when cellular phones were conceived as a business-class luxury. The entrepreneurs who built many of the early networks sought to recoup their investments by charging premium rates to the people affluent enough to use the phones -- and charging them whether they were using the network to make or to receive calls.
But as competition within the cellular industry has led to more affordable rates, and more Americans have become cell phone subscribers, cellular companies are seeking an overhaul of their industry's basic economics. The cellular companies are eager to compete on a more equal footing with conventional phone companies for the nation's $100-billion-a-year local communications business.
So far, residential local phone markets have generally remained de facto monopolies, dominated by the regional Bell companies and a handful of independent operators including the GTE Corporation, which has agreed to merge with Bell Atlantic. Although many of the local telephone companies, including Bell Atlantic, are also active in the wireless business, they tend to run their cellular companies as separate units.
Many analysts and wireless executives believe that eliminating wireless fees for incoming calls -- as most other countries have done -- could go a long way toward making wireless carriers viable long-term competitors to local phone monopolies.
"We're trying to get a level playing field with the local phone companies," Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive of the Sprint Corporation's wireless unit, Sprint PCS, said in an interview last week. "If you look at almost every other country in the world, they all have calling-party- pays as a standard. In those countries where you have calling-party- pays, you have a much higher percentage of people giving out their number and using it for inbound calls. In this country there is a lot more hesitancy to give out the number."
In other parts of the world, particularly in Europe, the cellular industry developed more recently than in the United States. And rather than being conceived as a luxury item, the cell phone overseas has been seen as an extension of -- or even an improvement upon -- the wired telephone network.
Wireless carriers in the United States are not prohibited from offering calling-party-pays. But with the F.C.C. having spent the last few years studying the issue, few carriers have been willing to bring such plans broadly into the market until they know just what the commission's national rules will be. Bell Atlantic's wireless unit, for instance, began a trial program in Delaware last November called Call Me, but has not expanded the plan past a "couple of thousand" subscribers, according to a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman.
As a general proposition, many of the F.C.C. commissioners appear to agree that fostering calling-party-pays could increase overall competition among wired and wireless phone operators, according to people close to the agency.
But there are big hurdles concerning consumer protection and the internal financial structure of a caller-pays system that must be cleared before any consensus can be achieved.
Regarding consumers, the most important issue is to make sure that people who dial a wireless subscriber who uses a caller-pays plan are made aware that they will be charged, and how much.
Someone who makes a conventional telephone call from the United States to, say, Kazakhstan, is not told the charges. But the caller presumably has a reasonable expectation that the fee will be substantial, if only because they are making an international call to a place so far away.
The complication posed by a caller-pays system in the wireless sector is that a call to what appears to be a local number could in fact incur big per-minute "roaming" fees because the user is traveling on the other side of the continent. Without some sort of notification, the caller would have no way of knowing about those fees until a bill arrived.
The wireless carriers appear to be in favor of less notification rather than more. For example, Mr. Sukawaty said consumers could eventually be informed by a simple tone that the call they were placing was to a wireless number that would incur a charge.
In Europe, where the caller-pays system is generally the rule, wireless phone numbers often include one or two digits more than do traditional lines. So while European callers do not generally hear a notification message, the additional digit indicates that additional fees may apply. In the United States, many communications experts say it would not be feasible to add an additional digit to wireless numbers, if only because the cost of modifying communications switches across the nation could be prohibitive.
It is also somewhat simpler for European carriers to establish caller-pays systems because most wireless companies in Europe own nationwide licenses, reducing the prevalence of roaming fees. In the United States, few wireless carriers own licenses for the entire nation.
The F.C.C. is thought to be leaning toward a substantial notification system -- one that would require that a caller hear a message indicating what the charge will be and that would give the caller an opportunity to disconnect before incurring any fees at all.
Some of the conventional local phone companies appear to hope that extensive notification messages would discourage people from calling wireless subscribers who use a caller-pays plan.
The other major issue that stands in the way of consensus on a caller-pays system is one that would not be obvious to most consumers but which is vitally important for the carriers: billing.
Generally, local phone companies are no longer obliged to include the services of other companies on their bills. That is why some consumers now receive separate bills from their local and long-distance carriers.
Extending that logic, some local phone giants are arguing before the commission that they should not be obliged to include charges on their bills for calls their customers make to wireless phones under a caller-pays system.
If that argument succeeded, it could mean that consumers might receive separate bills from various wireless carriers. Or, alternately, they could be forced to use a credit card to call a wireless number.
All of the complications strike some consumer advocates as ridiculous. They argue that people who choose wireless phones should pay for their use.
"We think this is one of the silliest ideas to hit the policy arena," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union, an advocacy group. "The notion that people who don't use wireless phones should pay extra to reach people who are using the new technology is just absurd."

HEADLINE: How to Make Globalization Work

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Paul Krugman ("An American Pie," column, Feb. 16) delights in the irony of affluent Americans trying to hold back the economic growth of impoverished third world countries. Opponents of globalization do not, by and large, oppose modernization per se; rather, they oppose development dictated by the rich industrialized countries at the expense of the vast majority in the developing world. 
 Furthermore, the protesters in Seattle included the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Steel Workers as well as activists from around the world. Some delegates from developing countries even credited the demonstrators for giving them increased leverage with the wealthier countries in negotiating trade rules.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE BATTLEGROUND;
Evangelist Goes On the Attack To Help Bush

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Feb. 21

 BODY:
While George W. Bush tried today to rally Michigan voters for Tuesday's primary here with a sunny message of tax cutting and political reform, a second, shadow campaign by his allies sought to sow suspicions of Senator John McCain.
Supporters of Mr. McCain reported receiving automated telephone calls in which the recorded voice of the evangelist Pat Robertson urged them to "protect unborn babies and restore religious freedom" by opposing Mr. McCain. As he has on his cable television program, Mr. Robertson, a supporter of Mr. Bush, accuses Mr. McCain of having chosen as his national chairman "a vicious bigot who wrote that conservative Christians in politics are anti-abortion zealots, homophobes and would-be censors." 
 The reference is to former Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, who used those phrases in his autobiography to describe some in the Christian right, although he also said there were "some fine, sincere people in its ranks."
Mr. McCain, as he crossed the state on the final day of campaigning before the primary, continued to attack Mr. Bush as a character assassin and a pretender to the mantle of Republican reformer. And the Bush campaign accused Mr.McCain's operatives of making attack calls of their own.
A spokesman for Mr. Robertson said tonight that he had recorded his message without the knowledge of the Bush campaign. Bush aides said that they knew nothing of the calls and that the direct calls they were making to voters were all positive.
"All of our scripts are positive get-out-the-vote scripts," said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.
The parallel campaigns here against Mr. McCain, one above the fray and the other slashing, recalled the pattern in South Carolina, where third parties spread damaging and sometimes false information about Mr. McCain. The votes of conservative Christians, who were and are the focus of those messages, were crucial to Mr. Bush's victory.
In Michigan, other groups are also coming to Mr. Bush's aid with radio commercials intended to inflame doubts about Mr. McCain's commitment to ending abortion.
As the McCain campaign disclosed Mr. Robertson's calls, the Bush campaign late today released transcripts of two automated calls supporting the senator. In them, a recorded voice repeated many of the same criticisms that Mr. McCain has made publicly. One call accused Mr. Bush of increasing public spending by a greater percentage in Texas than Bill Clinton has in Washington.
"Both McCain and Bush are good men," the caller continued, "but John McCain has a much more conservative record on fighting spending."
The second call accused Mr. Bush of a "negative smear campaign" and urged a vote against "negative smear politics."
Michael Hudome, Mr. McCain's top aide in the state, said that the two calls transcribed by the Bush campaign were consistent with calls the McCain forces were making.
"We have a transcript that says they are both good men, and they call that negative," Mr. Hudome said. "What do they want us to say?"
Mr. McCain's message today was largely consistent with the two automated calls.
"I'm just like Luke Skywalker trying to get out of the Death Star," the senator declared, delighting in his new Star Wars imagery before a rowdy crowd at Heritage High School in Saginaw, north of here.
In an appeal to Michigan's independent-minded voters, he held Mr. Bush's establishment support, including that of Gov. John Engler, against him.
"I'm telling you, they're shooting at me from everywhere," Mr. McCain said. "Everybody's against me. Governor Engler, Governor Bush, all the governors, all the senators. And we're going to kill them, right?"
As some in the crowd chanted, "No more Bush!" Mr. McCain replied, "I thank you. There's our secret weapons."
Mr. Bush tried to ignore his Republican rival today, explaining to reporters that "this is the time to rally the vote." He preferred to direct his barbs at Vice President Al Gore, whom he accused of "politics that's so stale and so negative." But when pressed, Mr. Bush again questioned Mr. McCain's commitment to cleaning up the political system.
"He talks about the iron triangle in Washington, D.C.," Mr. Bush said, referring to the senator's complaints about the links between lobbyists, campaign donations and legislation. "He's been ringing that iron triangle like a dinner bell."
Told of Mr. Bush's simile, Mr. McCain responded, "He's the one taking all the money from them. Seems to me he's had a Pavlovian reaction."
With a laugh, he essayed a metaphor, accusing Mr. Bush of having "both feet in the trough."
After weeks of boutique politicking in New Hampshire and South Carolina, the candidates, short of time to impress voters and short of patience with each other, were counting on their national images and a burst of appearances to make and correct impressions in what Mr. Bush today called an abbreviated "two-day primary."
In his speeches, Mr. Bush was buoyant as he moved east to west, from the company of workers at a Detroit factory to a rally among Grand Rapids's more conservative voters this evening. Mr. McCain traveled north to south before flying home this evening to Arizona, which also votes on Tuesday.
Late into the evening, the Bush and McCain campaigns traded accusations of sinister telephone calls. Bush aides supplied the telephone numbers of women who said they had received calls accusing Mr. Bush of being anti-Catholic.
Adrienne Karns, who lives in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham, said she received a call at 5:30 this afternoon that issued a "Catholic voters alert." Then, she said, the anonymous voice told her "that George Bush had gone to Bob Jones University, and Bob Jones University was anti-Catholic, and George Bush was anti-Catholic." Then, she continued, "It said John McCain was pro-Catholic and I should vote for John McCain."
The McCain campaign denied any knowledge of the calls. And it supplied the telephone number of Sue Eaton, a homemaker in Ypsilanti who said she had received an automated telephone call today attacking Mr. McCain and "more or less insinuating to the fact of being a P.O.W. made him have a bad temper."
Ms. Eaton said the call suggested that Mr. McCain would have a hair-trigger in dealing with an obstreperous foreign power like Iraq, and urged her to make a "wise choice." She said she did not know the origin of the call, and the Bush campaign denied any knowledge of it.
Any of Michigan's 6.7 million registered voters is free to cast a ballot Tuesday, regardless of party affiliation. Pollsters have pronounced the race too close and too volatile to call.
Candice Miller, Michigan's secretary of state and state elections officer, has been predicting that 950,000 voters will turn out on Tuesday, when the weather is expected to be unseasonably mild but seasonably cloudy. Just over half a million voted in the primary of March 1996.
In addition to the bigger voice that the primary's earlier date has given them in selecting the nominee, Michigan voters are likely to be drawn to the polls by several local ballot issues, like whether to to raise $12 million to overhaul Birmingham's sewers.
As much as 20 percent of the potential vote may already have been cast by absentee ballot. Michigan automatically mails such ballots to its elderly residents.
John Schwarz, the only Republican state senator to endorse Mr. McCain, said he was hoping for 1.1 million voters to turn out, because he felt that would benefit the senator.
"Your rejoinder could be, 'Well it didn't in South Carolina,' " Mr. Schwarz said, referring to the record turnout that carried Mr. Bush to a big victory on Saturday. "My answer to that is South Carolina is not Michigan. I can't think of two states that are more different in their geography, their demography."
Higher turnout, he said, "indicates more independents are voting, and as you know, Michigan is independent heaven." In 1996, 10 percent of the voters in the Republican primary were Democrats, and 28 percent were independents.
Polls indicate that Mr. Bush has strong support among Republicans here. Given Mr. McCain's hopes of rallying independents, the senator's itinerary today seemed odd, since he did not campaign in suburban Detroit, where they are concentrated.
"Would I have gone to Oakland County?" asked Mr. Schwarz, speaking by telephone before climbing back on the candidate's bus in Saginaw. "Yeah, I would have. But I'm not making those decisions." He noted that in two days Mr. McCain had hit "probably six of the nine media markets in the state."
 Mr. McCain ended up in Arizona Mondy night, where he held one last rally at the University of Arizona in Tucson. Greeted by a crowd of more than one thousand, he said, "I can't tell you how greatful I am for the large turnout." He also took a jab at Mr. Bush saying, "Friends, we want to thank the Bush campaign -- we want to thank them for contributing about three million dollars to our economy," a reference to the campaign advertisements Mr. Bush has run in Mr. Mcain's home state.

A New High-Tech Boom

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Along the Merritt and Wilbur Cross parkways in Connecticut, business analysts say, there is a new superhighway springing up -- a technology corridor formed by scores of high-tech and Internet businesses.
Some, like Stamford's Priceline
.com and the Gartner Group, are internationally recognized. Others, like Norwalk's iBirthday.com, are just getting started. 
 But taken together, they hold the potential to achieve national prominence.
"There definitely is a boom in the Internet companies and the companies that serve them," said Victor Budnick, executive director of Connecticut Innovations Inc., which invests in technology start-ups.
Should the area gain a national reputation as a vibrant technology corridor, it could result in dozens of new businesses and their employees coming to the state.
A survey last year counted more than 600 technology-oriented businesses in communities along the parkways. In the months since then, many more have been founded. A poll of venture capital firms found investment in Connecticut companies -- many involved in high-tech and software enterprises -- doubled in 1999 to a record $521 million.

Of Oats and the Meal
Q. I have just returned from London, Paris and Milan, where I often found porridge on breakfast menus. While similar to oatmeal in texture, it had a taste of its own, and I was told it is low fat and nutritious. Is porridge available in the New York City area?
A. Although porridge, essentially boiled cereal, can be made from any type of grain, the type you were served was probably made from oats. It tasted so different from the oatmeal you're used to in the United States because of the way the grains are processed. 
 Steel-cut oats, also known as Irish or Scotch oats, are much more popular for porridge in Europe than the rolled oats preferred here. Steel-cut oats are unrefined; they have simply been dried and roughly cut. Since hardly any heat is applied during processing, they retain a good portion of their nutrients, and are an excellent source of B vitamins.
Rolled oats, on the other hand, have been sliced, steamed, rolled into little flakes and dried, losing a bit of their nutritional value along the way. Both types of oats are low in fat.
With their denser shape, steel-cut oats take much longer to cook than rolled oats (45 minutes as compared to 5). But the resulting porridge has a creamier texture and nuttier flavor.
Although most New York City area restaurants serve rolled oats, you can find some that serve steel-cut oats, especially those that serve Irish or English breakfasts. You can buy steel-cut oats in most health food stores, or in specialty shops, where they are labeled Irish oatmeal.
 
Substituting Gelatins
 
Q. I have a recipe calling for sheet gelatin. I'm used to using powdered gelatin and wonder if I can substitute that for sheet gelatin.
A. Powdered gelatin, carried in most supermarkets, can be substituted for sheet gelatin (also known as leaf gelatin), which can be hard to find in stores. Generally, one quarter-ounce package (two and a quarter teaspoons) of powdered gelatin has the equivalent gelling power of five sheets of gelatin. That means you should use a scant half-teaspoon of powdered gelatin for every sheet of gelatin called for. It's not an exact science, though, and I've found that it takes some experimenting to get the texture just right. You might want to practice the recipe once if you are making it for a special event.
Once you have figured out how much powdered gelatin you'll need, place it in a heatproof cup and dampen it with a tablespoon or so of cold water. Let the gelatin sit for five minutes, then place the cup in a pan of simmering water. Stir the gelatin mixture until it is smooth and dissolved, then add it to the liquid to be gelled and proceed with the recipe.
If you would like to try using sheet gelatin, which many chefs find easier to work with than powdered gelatin, it can be ordered from the Baker's Catalog (800-827-6836), which sells packets of six sheets for $1.95 each.
 
Homemade Baking Powder
 
Q. I recently ran out of baking powder. I read the contents of the empty can, which listed essentially cornstarch and baking soda. As these two items are always in the house, could you please tell me the proportions necessary to make my own baking powder at a fraction of the cost?
A. Baking powder contains both a mild alkali component (baking soda) and a combination of mild acids, which react when moistened and then baked. Cream of tartar is one of the acids used, but since it reacts quickly, the batter must be mixed and immediately placed in the oven before the reaction is over.
Most baking powders have a slower-acting acid in them as well, commonly sodium pyrophosphate. This will cause another reaction when the batter is in the oven. This is why baking powders are labeled "double-acting." A small amount of cornstarch is then added to help keep the mixture dry.
To make your own fast, single-acting baking powder, Shirley Corriher, in her book "Cookwise" (William Morrow, 1997), suggests mixing one tablespoon baking soda with two tablespoons cream of tartar and one and a half tablespoons cornstarch. But given the cost of cream of tartar, your homemade baking powder probably won't be any more economical than store-bought. MELISSA CLARK

HEADLINE: New Tools for Employee Maintenance

BYLINE: By JOANNA L. KROTZ 

 BODY:
Wage inflation may have all but disappeared from the economic map, but for companies looking to grow, there is anotherside to that good news. Just about any worker with a marketable skill has by now caught on to corporate America's worst-kept secret: managers are desperate to attract talent and even more desperate to hold onto it.
Mambo.com, a start-up events-planning Web service in Menlo Park, Calif., for example, hired a longtime Internet recruiter last spring before it even thought about hiring a vice president for business development, according to Madeline Schroeder, Mambo's chief executive. "It was a strategic move," Ms. Schroeder said. "Competition for good candidates is fierce in Silicon Valley." 
 And when the computer networking company Cisco Systems moves into a market and needs staff, it often hires trucks to be driven around town with billboards that flash the company's Web site and plead: "Talk to us at Cisco."
"We like people to know we're there," said Randall Birkwood, Cisco's senior employment manager.
The latest method to persuade midlevel and senior managers to turn down rival offers is one borrowed from addiction treatment: an intervention by those in the workplace who are nearest and dearest. James Boone, president of the recruiter Korn/Ferry International, says that besides "hard offers of compensation, position and title immediately, you have to hit at the heart."
"As soon as a manager announces he's leaving," Mr. Boone added, "you get his team in a room to say things like, 'We need you to succeed' or 'What can we do to make you stay?' People don't usually leave just for money. It can be just as effective to tug at the emotions to get them to stay."
That sort of pleading puts employees in a strong position. Colleen McGrath, 26, had been at Monster.com, an Internet career and recruitment site, for almost four years last September. Though she had worked her way up to the position of project manager, she said, "I felt stale; the job wasn't much of a challenge."
Ms. McGrath went job hunting, and soon got an offer from another Internet company with comparable benefits and a $5,000 raise. She accepted and gave notice.
Two days later, Jeff Taylor, Monster .com's founder and chief executive, asked why she was leaving. Then he made a counteroffer: he would promote her to manager of special projects and give her an immediate $4,000 raise, with the likelihood of more to come.
She accepted because she was shedding the old routine job and preferred Monster .com to the new company, anyway.
"I wasn't leaving because I hated the job so much," Ms. McGrath said, "but because the company had turned formal and corporate in the past three years -- titles and what size cube you have. So I wanted more money. Jeff got me to stay by making me feel like a change agent again." Two months later, she snared an additional $2,000 raise.
For Mr. Taylor, grabbing people on their way out the door has become a way of life. Monster.com began with a staff of 70 in 1997, grew to 500 by the end of 1998 and doubled again last year. Competition for skilled workers from other dot.com start-ups is fierce, so he pays close attention to his employees' needs and makes sure the workplace reflects Net speed and culture.
"My employees get shot at regularly by recruiters," Mr. Taylor said. "And money rocks people's worlds, so almost always, I'll make a counteroffer. They wouldn't be here if they weren't great at their job. But I like to counter opportunity, not offers."
Companies are becoming increasingly inventive when it comes to incentives, either by dangling special premiums over compensation or by bumping up the role and autonomy of the job. Counteroffers now often include letting managers exercise stock options at earlier dates or at lower prices than the contracts call for and guaranteeing juicy bonuses for employees who stay a specified number of years, even if their performance fizzles along the way. Recruiters and human resources professionals have even coined a term for these gun-to-the-head elevations: battlefield promotions.
Managers are also more willing than ever to cut special deals. Daphne Matalene, 26, an advertising account manager at a travel magazine in New York, turned down an unexciting offer from a rival company last June. But when she mentioned it to her boss, he immediately withdrew an earlier suggestion that he might have to reduce her commission from 10 percent of sales to a rate more in line with the industry average of about 2 percent. Then, a few months later, an attractive job offer came her way from a prestigious business publication, and she was leaning toward accepting it.
But when she informed her boss, he countered by raising her base salary by $17,000, a 75 percent increase. To do that, he said, he would have to lower her commission rate, but he awarded Ms. Matalene some plummy extra accounts and some added responsibilities to compensate for that.
"I decided to stick around," shesaid.
According to a recent survey by Development Dimensions International, a consulting firm, most companies will be enhancing stock options, benefits packages and salaries this year to attract qualified applicants.
But according to the survey, workers want more than just money. Organizations with the most effective recruiting strategies, according to the survey, were more likely to offer potential for advancement, a solid reputation, learning opportunities and a positive corporate culture as well as stock options and competitive salaries.
That means employees across the board can expect more and better job offers and increased leverage with their current employers, said Jeffrey Christian of Christian & Timbers, an executive search firm. "Today, the best talent wins," Mr. Christian said. "So if you haven't had a counteroffer, you're probably not working."

HEADLINE: NATIONAL ORIGINS: Central Florida;
Squeezing Gold From the Groves

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL 

DATELINE: AUBURNDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
"YOU want to look at oranges?" Jim Walker asked. "Well, let's go look at oranges." Mr. Walker, lean and fit at 70, jumped into his red minivan. I joined him, and minutes later we were deep into Walker Groves, a 70-acre spread of citrus trees midway between Tampa and Orlando that his family has cultivated for more than a century.
Here in central Florida, the citrus groves form a sea of dark green foliage stretching to the horizon. Unfortunately, the horizon is limited; the land is so flat that there are hardly any places high enough to see more than a mile or two. The growers and the bureaucrats who watch over them use helicopters to keep an eye on the groves and, in fact, to count the oranges. Not one by one, of course, but by using educated guesses about how much fruit a tree will produce. The crop for the growing season from fall 1997 through late spring 1998, the most recent count available, came to about 48 billion oranges, according to the Florida Citrus Department. 
 For a time, we bumped along past rows of 12-to-15-foot-high trees thick with glossy, dark green leaves but bereft of fruit. "Early varieties," Mr. Walker said, "all picked." Abruptly, we came upon row after row of trees laden with fat orange fruit. "Valencias," my host remarked, "not quite ready yet."
Actually, I had recognized them. In fact, it was their imminent arrival in my local supermarket that lured me down here last week in the first place. I am, I must confess, an orange-juice addict. Only two or three fresh-squeezed oranges a day will do it for me, and Valencias are my orange of choice. I await their annual debut the way some people yearn for the start of spring training. In fact, the ballplayers and the Valencias turn up around here every year at about this time.
"Best juice oranges in the world," Mr. Walker agreed.
You might not know it by looking at them. These happen to be pretty good looking oranges, but not all Valencias are. Valencias are thin skinned, making them susceptible to nicks and bruises. When they are ripe, they may be a brilliant orange or tinged with yellow or even green.
"Color has nothing to do with ripeness," Mr. Walker said. "A green orange can be fully ripe and an orange one far from ready to be picked. What makes an orange orange is cold weather. When it gets a little warmer around here in a few weeks, these Valencias could turn green again. But they'll be ripe."
But they are heavy with juice. They have been bred that way, although the Florida weather helps. California oranges, navels mostly, develop thick skins because they are grown in a dry climate. They are light in weight and drier in texture. Florida oranges are juicier because Florida is wetter. The water table is high, and the rainfall is one of the heaviest in the United States. In Florida, water is everywhere, even in the oranges.
Even so, it's the navel that is considered the eating orange, by growers and consumers alike, because it peels so easily and looks so much more attractive in the produce bin. It's too bad; a Valencia sliced into wedges or circles is a fine thing.
The Valencia was once known as the Rivers Late, after the Englishman who first shipped the seeds here in the 19th century. It came to be known as the Valencia when, it is said, a Spanish grower saw some Rivers Late trees in this country and claimed them to be his country's Valencias. (The navel orange has a less romantic history: it is known formally as the Washington Navel, not for the state but for Washington D.C., where it was propagated by the Agriculture Department after arriving from Brazil in the 1870's.)
Today, Valencias are the world's most popular orange, and they grow in every part of the world where oranges thrive.
Orange trees have a lot in common with grapevines. With wine grapes, the noble European vinifera vines -- cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay and others -- are grafted onto disease-resistant American roots that, left on their own, would produce relatively useless grapes. Similarly, fruit-bearing citrus branches are grafted onto rootstock derived from, among others, the Rough Lemon tree. On its own, the Rough Lemon will produce unusable fruit. Paired with good plant material, it produces high-quality fruit: oranges, lemons, grapefruit or limes.
A grafted orange tree comes into maturity in five years; a tree grown from seeds takes at least 15 years. Seedling trees are rare in Florida these days. Growing lemon tree rootstock is itself a major business. Much of Florida's citrus is grown in sand, which contributes little or nothing to the tree's well-being. Most of its nutrition, aside from what it gets from sun and water, comes from hefty doses of manufactured nutritives.
A healthy tree can be economically viable for 50 years, a Citrus Department spokesman said.
In Florida a century ago, the groves began much farther north, not all that far from the Georgia border. Frequent devastating frosts prompted the industry to move farther and farther south.
"There are fewer frost problems," the spokesman told me. "But lots of the groves are in hurricane territory now, and a hurricane can be just as deadly as a bad frost."
But even in an ideal season, there is a long period, from late summer through winter, when there are no Valencias to be found. Since oranges, including Valencias, are grown all over the world, they are always in season somewhere.
In northern European cities, it's not uncommon to find oranges from all over the world in the markets. Why don't we see oranges from Morocco or Uruguay or South Africa or Brazil in this country? Spanish clementines do show up, but other foreign oranges are scarce because they compete with the domestic product. French supermarkets may put on a dazzling display of imported oranges, but there are no domestic growers to complain.
In the United States, tariffs protect Florida Valencias; California navels, which ripen in the early fall; and other varieties that ripen between those two main seasons. The only times we are short of oranges in this country is when Florida is hit by a bad freeze, as happened in 1990, when more than a third of the crop was destroyed.
The juice business also has had a profound effect. The year-round availability of good -- and infinitely cheaper -- frozen and bottled juice has all but squeezed out the fresh-orange business. Sales of fresh citrus fruit are almost an afterthought in the orange-juice business, a $3 billion-a-year industry. Oranges are counted in 90-pound boxes, the way they are picked in the groves. In 1997-98, more than 230 million boxes of Florida oranges went into pasteurized, chilled juice, most of it from reconstituted frozen concentrate, according to the Citrus Department. Fewer than nine million boxes were sold as fresh fruit.
Fresh grapefruit fared better. From the same harvest, some 28 million 85-pound boxes went into chilled juice, and 20 million were shipped as fresh fruit, the department says.
In 1966, when John McPhee wrote a monumental two-part essay on oranges for The New Yorker magazine, he was surprised to discover how difficult it was to get fresh orange juice in Florida. State-run tourist offices offered every sun-starved visitor a cup of juice, Mr. McPhee reported, but it was all made from concentrate.
Nothing has changed. Tourists arriving at the portals of the Sunshine State are still offered free orange juice, and it still isn't fresh squeezed, even though an orange, presumably a fresh one, is featured prominently on the state license plate. Some Florida hotels offer fresh juice, at a price, but rarely does anyplace else. At both the Florida Citrus Department in Lakeland and at Tropicana Products' vast headquarters and bottling plant in Bradenton, cordial receptionists offered me orange juice, but none of it fresh squeezed.
"Unbelievable," Mr. Walker said, shaking his head.
Oranges have been grown in Florida since the 16th century. Columbus took citrus seeds on his first voyage and spread them around the Caribbean. Ponce de Leon is supposed to have taken them from Spain to Florida. "He came looking for the Fountain of Youth," the juice people like to say, "but in fact he brought it with him."
Four hundred years later, some Florida scientists invented frozen concentrate. By the time Mr. McPhee wrote his essay, the changeover from fresh fruit to frozen concentrate was almost complete. The 6- and 12-ounce cans whose contents were diluted with three equal amounts of water were in millions of home freezers. Minute Maid, a pioneer in the concentrate business, became the country's largest producer of processed orange juice.
In the early 1970's, however, consumers began to move away from frozen concentrate toward chilled juice, both pasteurized not-from-concentrate and reconstituted concentrate. Chilled-juice sales passed frozen concentrate in 1986, and the gap has continued to widen. Chilled juice now accounts for more than 60 percent of all orange-juice sales, the department says.
Tropicana, which produces only chilled juice, both from fresh fruit and from concentrate, is now first in the industry, with between 37 percent and 38 percent of the market, said Jim Dwyer, Tropicana's senior vice president for North American operations. Florida is the nation's largest producer of oranges, and each year Tropicana buys about 25 percent of the state's orange crop. In the 1998-99 season, the company produced some 320 million gallons of orange juice.
The Northeast is the United States's biggest orange-juice market, consuming some 40 percent of all the orange juice the country makes. The New York metropolitan area alone consumes about 17 percent of the national output. Just to serve the metropolitan market, Tropicana dispatches five full trainloads of orange juice each week to its bottling plant in Jersey City. Each train carries more than 5.2 million gallons of juice. Tropicana also has production plants in France, Britain and China.
The Tropicana plant in Bradenton is a technological marvel. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, millions of oranges are squeezed, turned into rivers of juice and bottled, some with no pulp, some with a bit of pulp and some with a lot of pulp. "Kids hate pulp," said Steven Lezman, a Tropicana executive, who showed me around.
Actually, he didn't just say it; he shouted it, the only way to be heard over the ceaseless, ear-splitting roar of the plant machinery. Like all dedicated Tropicana people, Mr. Lezman is immune to the lure of fresh juice, even though he has his own private orange tree in his backyard.
"We keep two kinds of Tropicana juice in the refrigerator at home," Mr. Lezman said. "No pulp for the kids and pulp for the adults."
Back in Auburndale, where the only noise is an occasional blackbird and where hawks wheel lazily in the warm, late winter air, Mr. Walker squeezes his juice in a stainless-steel machine about half the size of a player piano. It's in a back room of the little shop on Route 599, where he welcomes tourists who are loyal fans, newcomers lured by his billboards out on the Interstate and a surprising number of Floridians who refused to take the dearth of fresh juice in their state lying down.
"I've got people coming all the way up from Hollywood," he said, chuckling. "They want a few gallons of the real stuff."
Still, Mr. Walker is no stranger to the more commercial side of the business. What he doesn't sell at his shop, or ship around the country in gift packages, he sells to local processors to be turned into pasteurized juice or concentrate.
"Just so I can keep this way of life going for a while," he said, as we walked among his fruit-laden trees. "My grandfather came down here from Tennessee in 1884. He was 30 years old and suffering from what they used to call consumption. They'd told him he wasn't going to live long in any case but that he might live a little longer in Florida. Well, this life must have agreed with him; he lived to be 87."
I returned to my car and headed for Tampa, pulling on a quart bottle of Walker juice and thinking about that old man. Could it have been the orange juice? It seemed distinctly possible.

HEADLINE: Economy's Next Leader

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Paul Krugman (column, Feb. 20) finds it a "reassuring thought" that the next president need only be someone "who won't do too much damage" to our booming economy. 
 For the millions of Americans not sharing in the wealth, the next president's positions on the minimum wage, the growing gap between rich and poor, the right to join a union, and a host of other issues will matter very much.
This country's poor and working class could use a friend in the White House. Mr. Krugman seems to view the global economy, in and of itself, as more important to defend than the welfare of those who are not among its winners.

HEADLINE: Social Security Risks

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While a Feb. 17 editorial acknowledges that "piecemeal changes to the Social Security system are rarely a good idea," its praise for a $22.7 billion measure to end the earnings test in effect encourages Congress to support measures that increase Social Security benefits before enacting the more difficult comprehensive reforms. This invites elected representatives to pander to the largest voting bloc -- those over 65 -- without regard for the program's generational inequity. 
 While only 30 or so members have co-sponsored reform bills, there is a waiting list to co-sponsor bills that increase benefits for retirees (for example, prescription drug benefits and bonus benefits for "notch babies"). By failing to contain Social Security's costs, we run the risk that the national debt will rise above 125 percent of gross domestic product or that future Americans will face a 50 percent payroll tax increase or a 25 percent to 33 percent cut in Social Security benefits.

HEADLINE: Murray Bernstein, West Side Sturgeon King, Dies at 87

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Murray Bernstein, who took a narrow store on Broadway and turned it into Murray's Sturgeon Shop, a legendary Upper West Side purveyor of salmon and sable, caviar and camaraderie, died Monday at a nursing home in Lauderhill, Fla. He was 87.
Limousines would line up in front of the store, and it regularly shipped sturgeon and other delicacies overseas. But its heart and soul were in the ready smile and deft cutting stroke of Mr. Bernstein. His own life epitomized a neighborhood of immigrants, many of them Jewish, who had known and expected struggle. He remained active in the grocery workers' union even after he became a store owner, worked six days a week and never took a single vacation. 
 His ambitions were sturgeon-size (a beluga sturgeon can weigh half a ton). "He had grandiose plans for making the best smoked fish in the world," said his daughter, Cecile Rivel. "He was a perfectionist."
Jack Rudin, a member of the New York real estate family, began coming by in 1950, and remembers the sturgeon shop as a sort of lodge where the regulars would nosh on pieces of salmon and bagels between shots of ice-cold vodka. Mr. Rudin's wife Rebecca asked Mr. Bernstein to bless the couple's marriage, which lasted until her death 35 years later.
Murray's Sturgeon Shop, which looked like a jewel box with its large mirrors and stainless steel, became a place where real estate magnates and politicians would bump into policemen and shopkeepers. Show business personalities like Zero Mostel and Sammy Cahn were regulars.
"He may have been a fish slicer, but he was a very sage fellow," Mr. Rudin said of Mr. Bernstein. "He knew his product. He knew his customers. He ran a clubhouse there."
Mr. Bernstein was born on Feb. 14, 1913, in Poland, and came to New York as a teenager to escape anti-Semitic violence. In 1932, he met the woman who would become his wife, Nettie Katz, through a friend, Albert Newman. He and Mr. Newman went to Montreal, where the prospective bride was living, for the introduction. They married three days later, and returned to New York.
Mr. Bernstein worked mainly in grocery stores, but as the Depression deepened in the early 1930's, he lost job after job and was unemployed for an entire year. But in 1945, Mr. Bernstein was able to buy his first store, at Broadway and 89th Street, from the same Mr. Newman who had helped arrange his marriage.
Several years later, his brother Sam became a co-owner. Sam died in 1977. In the late 1940's the store moved to its current location, 2429 Broadway, at 90th Street.
When Mr. Bernstein took over, the store sold some fish but specialized in candy and nuts. The Bernsteins concentrated on fish, and set out to popularize smoked fish in the European tradition at a time when many Americans who lived beyond New York didn't know nova from lox. It was hard work.
Sturgeon, the specialty of the house, may produce caviar, but its pearly saline flesh is loved for itself by connoisseurs of smoked fish. Murray's had some of the finest, each customer's order immaculately sliced with surgical skill. The slicing board was hospital clean, and the store held no odor of fish. Murray's sable, the silky smoked codfish known as the poor man's sturgeon, was legendary, too.
Early each Tuesday and Thursday morning, Mr. Bernstein could be heard negotiating with his smoked-fish suppliers in a loud voice. "This is not acceptable," his daughter remembers him saying, again and again. "This has to go back."
She said he would regularly return a third of the fish, and then demand that it be replaced the same day. He believed that the customer was always right, and that included himself.
The diligence paid off. The food critic Craig Claiborne said the store was "perhaps the finest in the city." New York magazine, calling it the "Tiffany of smoked-fish stores," likened Murray and Sam Bernstein's carving skills to that of the heart surgeon Christian Barnaard.
In 1974, the Bernsteins sold the store to Artie Cutler, a restaurateur. As Mr. Cutler's empire of Manhattan restaurants like Ollie's and Carmine's expanded, he sold the sturgeon shop to Ira Goller in the early 1990's.
One day, a year after Mr. Bernstein's wife Nettie died in 1990, he was talking to Florence, the widow of his nephew. She had been a widow for 18 years, and the two, who had known each other for 43 years, were discussing how lonely they felt. He immediately proposed.
"My father doesn't take long," Ms. Rivel said.
In addition to his wife and daughter, who lives in Weston, Conn., he is survived by a sister, Ann Fortune of Clifton, N.J.; a son, William Bernstein of Westminster, Colo.; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
Mr. Bernstein remained active in the grocery store union even during his Florida retirement. He always refused to open an Upper East Side branch, though many of his customers had moved across town.
"He felt it wouldn't be the same," Ms. Rivel said. "It wouldn't have had his personal touch."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Rosenbluth, a trend spotter among travel agents, believes it has found a new one. Think Internet.

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. Joe Sharkey's e-mail is jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AMONG travel agents, Rosenbluth International gets credit, though sometimes very grudgingly, for having anticipated several of the economic trends that have shaken that industry recently. In the early 1990's -- years before the airlines enraged travel agents and even drove some out of business by slashing commissions on tickets sold -- Rosenbluth began sharply reducing its dependence on commissions and instead started charging corporate clients fees for providing travel-management services.
So it is probably worth briefly examining the latest business idea by Rosenbluth, a Philadelphia-based travel agency with 1,300 offices worldwide. Last month, its Rosenbluth Interactive subsidiary rolled out a business-to-business travel-booking service that sets up custom online travel-booking sites, with off-line travel-agent telephone assistance, "tailored specifically for small, midsized and emerging-growth companies," said Justin Shaw, the vice president and general manager of Biztravel.com, a division of Rosenbluth Interactive. 
 Anyone can book a trip online on dozens of different sites, including Biztravel.com, which Rosenbluth bought last year. What's different here is that Rosenbluth will design a site -- the company refers to it generically as biztravel@mycompany
 -- individually for a company. The site will accommodate a company's employees' travel profiles and allow travelers wide flexibility not only in making airline, hotel and other bookings, but in making last-minute changes by speaking with someone on the telephone.
"Say you're en route and something changes -- the weather, a meeting is rescheduled, the boss calls and says they want you in North Dakota tomorrow," Mr. Shaw said. "These are times when it's not easy to access the Internet and making a phone call is the way to get it done."
About 35 companies are now clients of the service. They pay nothing for the custom site, and pay fees, which Mr. Shaw says are lower than typical travel agencies charge, for having Rosenbluth's agents provide telephone assistance in changing tickets, available around the clock.
How does Rosenbluth make money at this? Well, besides the telephone-service fees, much of the revenue comes from "certain payments from the suppliers whose products we sell, such as an airline," Mr. Shaw said.
Ah, yes, that would be commissions. Oddly enough, as many struggling small travel agencies were forced to impose fees for face-to-face transactions to make up for the reduced commissions, big-brand agencies with huge volumes were negotiating bulk commissions for bookings from airlines and others.
"We found that with some of the commission cuts, a lot of local and regional agencies were getting to the point where they had no choice but to charge all of their customers a transaction fee, maybe as much as $20, for booking a ticket," Mr. Shaw said.
"Now obviously with the economics of an Internet business, we can do the booking online and not charge anything" for selling the ticket, he said.
Go figure.
Speaking of travel agents and online competition, last week the American Society of Travel Agents petitioned the Justice Department to look into possible antitrust violations by major airlines who announced last month that they would participate jointly in a new Web site that would offer low-cost tickets.
The travel agents' trade group called the site, scheduled to start this spring, an anticompetitive ploy to "lure consumers onto the Web with lower prices."
A spokesman for the Web site said there was no merit to the complaint.
The travel agent group, which has been dismissive of online booking sites until the airlines started getting into the act, says that travel agents still book 80 percent of airline tickets, 95 percent of cruises and 90 percent of package tours, and most continue to prosper as overall travel spending increases in a booming economy.
Now that oil prices are wedged in the $30 a barrel range, airlines are scrambling -- a bit frantically at times -- to keep profits up as fuel costs soar. Last Friday, Continental Airlines increased domestic fares by as much as $15. The next day, Delta Air Lines and AMR's American Airlines also raised fares, followed on Sunday by US Airways, UAL's United Air Lines and Trans World Airlines. But Northwest Airlines stubbornly refused to get on board.
"Never mind!" yelped the others, fully aware that mischievous Northwest would undoubtedly get a lot of mileage out of ads trumpeting that it alone had refused to jack up fares. One by one on Monday, the others dropped their price increases.
Let's see what happens next week.
The troubled British Airways, meanwhile, raised trans-Atlantic fares by 3 percent earlier this month, after earlier increases on those routes by American competitors. And since January, major American carriers have been adding a $20 fuel surcharge to most domestic tickets.
Because of the cost of oil, American Express says, "typical" business air fares will rise this year by 3 to 4 percent, to an average of more than $1,000 round trip -- a higher rate than it forecast last fall.
"Flying for business will get more expensive than many expected this year," said Rusty Carpenter, vice president of American Express Consulting Services. He said the predictions on air fare costs might have to be revised upward later in the year if the airlines maintained their fuel surcharges.

HEADLINE: Home Depot's Quarterly Profits Rise 38%

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Home Depot Inc., the nation's largest chain of home-improvement stores, said today that its fourth-quarter profit rose 38 percent as it sold more water heaters, appliances and other big-ticket items.
Net income rose to $578 million, or 25 cents a share, from $418 million, or 18 cents, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 26 percent, to $9.17 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 30, from $7.26 billion. 
 Home Depot has expanded its selection of higher-priced and higher-profit goods. It has also added services and products to attract plumbers and other contractors, who typically buy more expensive items than homeowners, the stores' main customers. The average purchase increased 4.8 percent, to $46.61, from a year earlier.
"They're demonstrating to the customer the benefits of products that are one step up in price," said Doug Gordon, a Banc of America Securities analyst, who rates the stock "strong buy."
Shares of Home Depot fell 12.5 cents, to $53.875, in New York Stock Exchange trading today. The stock has fallen 20 percent this year on concern that higher interest rates could curb consumer spending and hurt profit growth.
"With rates rising at least two more times this year, Home Depot is going to have a hard time moving back up into the low 60's," said Phil Larkins, a market strategist at Legacy South Inc. in Atlanta, which owns about 220,000 shares.
Even with higher rates, housing trends for the year "look strong" as more Americans buy homes and housing construction increases, said Home Depot's chief executive, Arthur Blank, in a conference call. "We're very optimistic," he said.
Sales at stores open at least a year rose 9 percent in the quarter, topping forecasts for a gain of 6 to 8 percent.
The 930-store chain expects same-store sales to rise by a high single-digit percentage rate this quarter, executives said. The figure is a principal indicator of a retailer's business because it excludes sales from new and closed stores.
Home Depot was expected to earn 24 cents, the average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. The chain, based in Atlanta, has beaten forecasts for eight consecutive quarters.

HEADLINE: Many Iranian Conservatives Lose Seats

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Many of the conservative parliamentarians who led the opposition to President Mohammad Khatami's reform program were apparently soundly defeated in their re-election bids in the election last Friday, according to independent analysts who tallied the hard-liners' losses today.
Vote counting was nearly completed in the major cities, including the capital, Tehran, although no official results will be announced until the end of the week, officials said. 
 But preliminary results in Tehran, plus decided races in provincial areas, indicate that the conservatives lost most of their senior representatives in the Parliament, analysts for several foreign embassies and Iranian political parties said.
A runoff election will be needed to decide the winner of about 60 to 65 seats in the 290-member Parliament, they added. The runoff has tentatively been set for sometime in April.
In one of the most closely watched races, the former President of Iran, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was barely holding on to 30th place in voting in Tehran for 30 seats in the Parliament. It was unclear whether he would even get the minimum number of votes -- 25 percent of those cast in the capital -- to claim a seat in the first round, or be forced into a runoff.
The first 29 biggest vote-getters in the capital appear to be from the reform camp, which supports Mr. Khatami and advocates liberating Iran's press from clerical censorship and other cultural freedoms.
Mr. Khatami's brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami, has held onto his lead as the top vote-getter in the capital since the counting started. Most analysts, including those for the reformers, give the pro-Khatami forces about 70 percent of the seats in the first round and the conservatives about 30 percent. Tallies differ because some independent candidates are claimed by both sides.
For the first time since the elections, a spokesman for the defeated conservatives admitted publicly today that they have suffered a damaging blow. The spokesman, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the most prominent conservative ideologues, suggested in an interview with a Tehran newspaper that hard-liners have some soul-searching to do.
"We will not change our principles and positions, but it is natural that we should reconsider our policies and methods," he was quoted as saying in the newspaper Iran Vig. Mr. Bahonar also lost his seat, according to unofficial Tehran results.
In a news conference today to proclaim victory in the parliamentary poll, the reformers pledged to push for legalizing satellite dishes and allowing a free public debate of religious and social issues that hard-liners had tried to suppress.
But President Khatami's younger brother warned that normalizing relations with the United States -- an issue that some of his allies have suggested should be put to a public vote -- would depend on action by Washington.
"The United States supported the totalitarian regime of the shah," he said. "And now that Iran has become one of the most free nations, it continues its policy of sanctions and continues its baseless claims against Iran."
The United States cut relations with Iran during the 1979 revolution, after students seized its embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats captive. It also has classified Iran as a state that sponsors terrorism.
In one of the paradoxes of Iran's budding reform movement, some of its most prominent advocates for opening the country to the outside world and institutionalizing democratic values were either hostage-takers or supporters of the seizure.
The poor showing by Mr. Rafsanjani, a veteran politician who has held high government positions since the Islamic revolution 21 years ago, surprised even his reformist critics.
He was described as a man who could provide balance in the Parliament between up-and-coming leftists and their foes on the right. Many analysts had assumed that most Tehran voters, who could choose 30 candidates, would include Mr. Rafsanjani as a stabilizing factor.
Outside Iran, Mr. Rafsanjani had long been considered a moderate who allowed independent newspapers and took steps to liberalize the economy. But in recent weeks, some pro-Khatami activists have accused him of steering government contracts to family members during his presidency and failing to support the cause of reformers jailed during the last two years for expressing political views.
One Tehran-based diplomat said his analysis showed that between 140 and 150 incumbent parliamentarians failed to gain the minimum number of votes on Friday to keep their seats.
Among them is a core group of senior right-wing lawmakers who formed a powerful directorate of deputies under the Parliament Speaker, Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri. Mr. Nouri did not run for re-election. He lost in the presidential race two and a half years ago to Mr. Khatami.
Veteran incumbents who lost their seats included Jabat Larijani, the brother of the head of state television, and Hassan Rohani, the first deputy speaker. A former intelligence chief, Ali Fallahian, was also not re-elected. Some reformers have called for Mr. Fallahian to be questioned by the police about what he may know about the murders of prominent liberals in Tehran that took place during his tenure. President Khatami has said the murders were carried out by "rogue" intelligence agents.
Another outspoken hard-liner, Ali Zadsar, lost his re-election bid. Mr. Zadsar was one of the parliamentarians who tried last year to impeach the liberal culture minister, Ataollah Mohajerani. Ahmed Rasouli-Nejad, another incumbent involved in the impeachment attempt, also lost.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
The Euro Rebounds Above $1 On Weakness in Yen and Stocks

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The euro rose sharply yesterday, settling above parity with the dollar for the first time in a month, as United States stock markets wobbled.
After ending Friday's trading at a rate of 98.49 cents to the dollar, the single currency sold above $1.00 overnight after steep declines Friday by United States equities. It drew additional support from speculation about a euro-zone interest rate increase and also made sizable gains against the Japanese yen. 
 Markets were closed in the United States on Monday for the observance of Washington's Birthday. Early yesterday, declines on major stock indexes accelerated waves of short-covering -- buying to repay currency borrowed in anticipation of a price drop. This helped send the euro to a one-month high of $1.0078 before it settled in New York at $1.0036, or nearly 2 percent higher, for the session.
Traders said the euro's moves had been set off in part by heavy selling of yen for euros; the euro rose 1.25 percent at one point in midsession, touching a four-month peak of 111.73 yen.
"The euro-yen cross is clearly the hot currency pair that everyone in the market is trading," said Greg Anderson, currency strategist at FleetBoston. "The flurry of activity overnight sent the whole speculative community even further long of euros relative to the yen, and the dollar as well."
Mr. Anderson said he expected the euro to maintain its gains against the yen, which has declined against major currencies in recent weeks as doubts circulated on Japan's economic outlook. But he said that fears of a correction on Wall Street were overblown and that the dollar's downside value was limited, with the euro's trading band between 96 cents and $1.01.
"In my opinion, the euro is at an attractive level to sell," Mr. Anderson said.
The dollar's declines against the euro spilled over into losses against the yen; the dollar slipped to 110.70 yen from 110.96 late Friday.
The euro's move back above parity with the dollar was seen as breaking through an important psychological level. The single currency has been under pressure from the belief the United States economy would continue to outperform that of European countries.
But many traders are looking for the tide to eventually turn, as the price action for the euro begins to reflect signs of improvement in European economies.

HEADLINE: BOXING;
Trinidad Takes Role Of Attention Grabber

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH 

 BODY:
Felix Trinidad and Oscar De La Hoya were in Manhattan yesterday, each doing his own thing. The proximity was not by accident.
Trinidad was working out at the Church Street Gym trying to drum up attention for his bout in Las Vegas on March 3 against David Reid, the World Boxing Association superwelterweight champion. Trinidad was hoping his presence would take a little attention away from De La Hoya, who fights Derrell Coley on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. 
 Trinidad's presence only begged the question of why he was fighting Reid instead of a rematch against De La Hoya, whom he defeated in a controversial decision Sept. 18 in Las Vegas to win the World Boxing Council welterweight title.
The answer was simple and readily available from the two people who should know: Trinidad's promoter, Don King, and De La Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum. King was with his man at the Church Street Gym, while Arum was holding court with reporters at The Friars Club for lunch.
King and Arum, rivals who have feuded for years, took turns trying to kill each other's coming fight.
"His fight is a nothing fight," King said of the De La Hoya-Coley match. "It doesn't segue into anything. He has nothing after this. The fight Tito is fighting is a something fight. He's fighting a world champion with a gold medal. There's no upside for De La Hoya. The guy he's fighting is a bum."
Arum threw cold water on Trinidad-Reid.
"I'm not chortling," Arum said. "It's a lot like a guy who breaks up with a woman and rushes into another affair without thinking. It generally ends up a big disaster. King's losses in this fight will be the biggest losses in the history of boxing. He's going to lose between $6 million to $7 million."
King said if he loses money, he loses money. He said he would need about 400,000 pay-per-view buys on Showtime Event Television to break even.
"I made the fight and I'm going on with it," King said. "Money is incidental to me in this. When we knock out Oscar, I'll make up for it."
King has presented a rematch deal to Arum that he thinks will work. King's proposal has De La Hoya and Trinidad each making $20 million and fighting at a catch weight, possibly 150 pounds (3 pounds over the welterweight limit). King said that under his plan, De La Hoya could keep the W.B.C. welterweight championship belt win or lose. Trinidad doesn't want to have to fight at welterweight again, because he is having trouble making the weight.
Arum said they talked about the deal two weeks ago and it seems workable. He said if they could reach an agreement, the fighters could be in the ring for a rematch on June 17. That is the date that De La Hoya had reserved for Sugar Shane Mosley, but Arum hasn't been able to reach an agreement with Jack Mosley, the fighter's father, manager and trainer.
Arum said he has not discussed King's proposal with De La Hoya, who has been concentrating on the Coley fight. He said he would talk to him about it once De La Hoya gets past Coley.
"It seems to me that the only issue is the weight and I can't speak to that," Arum said.
He added: "The economic issues have all been addressed. I said we wanted the fight at Mandalay Bay, because we're loyal to them. King wanted the fight at Caesars. Dr. Ghanem said the fight would be at Caesars and a third fight would be at Mandalay Bay."
Dr. Elias Ghanem is the chairman of the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
The one thing both King and Arum readily agreed on is that Trinidad and De La Hoya have to win their respective coming bouts to keep this shaky rematch deal from falling apart.
"After that if this guy doesn't fight Trinidad, then he is truly Chicken De La Hoya and no one should support him," King said.
 
King Clears the Air
Don King said he doesn't understand how the F.B.I. can be chasing him for making payoffs to the International Boxing Federation while other promoters and managers have admitted to federal authorities that they made bribes to advance their fighters in the rankings.
"They got about five or six confessors," King said. "How do they look past the confessors and look for the ghost?"
When asked if he had ever paid a bribe to the I.B.F. to have one of his fighters ranked, King said: "No. No. No. No. No. No."
In terms of making financial contributions to the various boxing sanctioning organizations, King said he treats them as he treats the government.
"You can't get goods and services without paying your taxes," King said. "I don't look for tax loopholes. I pay what I owe. I paid $34 million in taxes and I sent out a release to tell everyone that I had paid my taxes.
Bob Arum was one of the people who gave affidavits to the F.B.I. detailing what he knew about bribes to the I.B.F. for rankings. Arum said he has never made a payoff to any sanctioning organization for a ranking.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: Joy for Second-String M.B.A.'s;
Elites and Internet Change Face of Campus Recruiting

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
For years, America's big-name investment banks and consulting firms considered it a waste of time to send recruiters to second-tier business schools. Harvard, Stanford, the Wharton School at Penn and a handful of others supplied the talent they needed.
M.B.A. candidates at large state schools or lesser-known private schools could not expect to see many blue-chip recruiters on their campuses. They had to send in their resumes and hope for the best. 
 Now, however, that elitist approach is fading, another consequence of the Internet economy.
Even as the long economic boom has increased demand at banks and consulting firms for new hires, many of the brightest students at the top business schools are joining Internet start-ups instead. As a result, prestigious firms are descending on many schools that make the top-50 lists compiled by Business Week and U.S. News & World Report but are nowhere near the top.
Not surprisingly, students and administrators at the newly initiated members of the club are ecstatic. "The top firms are coming up empty more often at the top schools," said Stuart I. Greenbaum, dean of the Olin School at Washington University in St. Louis. "It's opened a whole new tier of opportunities for our students."
In the last year alone, 17 companies, including CIBC Oppenheimer, have started recruiting at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, increasing the number of on-campus recruiters there by about 15 percent. A. T. Kearney has gone to the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University for the first time. Chase Manhattan is recruiting at Boston University.
PricewaterhouseCoopers went to the University of Georgia. And Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette made a visit to St. Louis to talk to Professor Greenbaum's students. Andersen Consulting, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter are also among the firms expanding their pools. And recruiters say they are having little trouble finding qualified candidates, so long as they focus on the best students at the second-tier schools. "The notion that all the world's talent comes out of three business schools I find hilarious," said Lenny T. Mendonca, a director in the San Francisco office of McKinsey & Company. Three years ago, McKinsey began using the Internet to reach campuses where it does not send recruiters, he said.
The shift could not have come at a more opportune time for second-tier schools. At some of them, applications have leveled off in the last year as the booming economy has kept in the work force people who might otherwise have taken time off to give their careers an M.B.A. boost. Many deans also fret about the long-term threat of the top schools' cutting into the second-tier schools' revenue by offering programs over the Internet. The prestigious additions to their recruiting lists, the deans said, will help their marketing efforts.
Life just got easier for the recruiters, too. Accustomed to wooing freshly minted Harvard and Stanford M.B.A.'s caught up in dreams of Internet riches, they are suddenly encountering students who are generally thrilled to see them and eager to sign up at their firms.
"I'm tremendously excited," said Vivian Chen, 29, a second-year student at Washington University who recently accepted a job at Salomon Smith Barney. When recruiters for the firm came to her school in St. Louis for the first time this year, but did not interview for the kind of job Ms. Chen wanted, she used connections through an alumnus and her internship at another firm last summer to land an interview at a Salomon office. "It was a joint effort," Ms. Chen said, a combination of "a firm willing to expand its horizons" and "my tenacity."
When recruiters do find what they are looking for, a bonus often comes attached: cheaper labor. Students at lower-ranked schools -- whose average starting pay packages are about $80,000, some $30,000 less than the typical student at the top schools would draw -- are less likely to have lucrative competing offers that would force a firm to bid up their salaries.
The big uncertainty now is whether the trend will reverse when the economy slows or Internet businesses go through a retrenchment. Deans at the second-tier schools say that the students of today are the recruiters of tomorrow and that the current wave of hiring will allow the schools to establish a long-term presence at the firms.
"Once I have my people on the inside," Professor Greenbaum said, "I don't expect to get pushed out." If that is the case, middling students at the top schools could eventually lose out to star performers at lesser-ranked institutions.
Others looking at the trend are not so sure, though. "I'm hoping they'll come back to us" and try to hire as many graduates in future years as they now are, said Roxanne Hori, the director of career management at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern, a top-ranked school. "But I don't know. That's sort of the million-dollar question."
The elite firms' deployment of recruiters to second-tier schools began in earnest a couple of years ago to fill double-digit increases in their staff openings. Bain & Company, for example, says it will hire about 250 M.B.A.'s this year, up from 180 two years ago. "The top seven or eight schools," said Stan Miranda, a director in charge of the firm's recruiting, "just cannot satisfy our needs. We're growing very, very fast and cannot find enough people to support the growth."
The supply squeeze has worsened in the last year, as dot-com frenzy has gripped many business school campuses. "Historically, when you got an offer from Morgan Stanley or J. P. Morgan, you just took it. End of story," said Meyer Feldberg, dean of the Columbia Business School, another traditional recruiting ground of the top firms. But now, "in some circles, there is a panic over not being able to hire a sufficient number of talented people," Professor Feldberg added, as many of the most promising students rush to join Internet start-ups or venture capital firms.
As one stark example, the proportion of Stanford M.B.A.'s taking jobs with either consulting firms or investment banks dropped to 33 percent last year from 43 percent in 1998. For the first time in memory, people in business school placement offices say, some firms are having trouble filling out their on-campus interview schedules. "People who typically had long waiting lists now have shorter lists," Ms. Hori said. "People who had full schedules now have holes."
The response of Andersen Consulting, the world's biggest consulting firm, illustrates the urgency recruiters feel. Andersen has expanded the list of schools where its "strategy group" recruits to 15 from 12, said Bill Copacino, a managing partner. And at the original 12, it is giving more presentations to students this year, taking them out to more dinners and trying to make stronger connections with student clubs. "We had to work harder on the campuses because there are more options" for students, Mr. Copacino said.
Sensing a golden opportunity, second-tier schools and their students are becoming more aggressive about selling themselves. After attending a recruiting conference and hearing a manager from Salomon Smith Barney describe the banking industry's hiring woes, Kim Gattiker, the assistant director of the University of Georgia's M.B.A. career services office, organized a promotional campaign. She and her colleagues pitched Georgia's students and the school's highly regarded information systems to the big investment banks and consulting firms, called Georgia alumni already working at some of those companies and sought out recruiters at other conferences.
Ms. Gattiker thought that adding just one or two corporate blue-bloods to the list of Atlanta companies like Delta Air Lines and United Parcel Service that traditionally scour the University of Georgia's graduating class would give her big marketing leverage. Signing up just a few new firms allows her to mention their names to other recruiters, who then will be more likely to come to Georgia as well, she said.
For the first time this year, for example, McKinsey invited Georgia's M.B.A.'s to send in their resumes. "McKinsey, up until this year, had not had anything to do with us," Ms. Gattiker said. One student received an invitation to travel to Florida for an interview. She did not get the job, but Pricewaterhouse, which had not shown interest in her before, also decided to talk to her after she told the firm about the interview with McKinsey.
To students and administrators at places like Georgia, the new-found interest is overdue recognition for a level of excellence that they believe is a near match for Columbia or Wharton. "I have these incredible students," said Jennifer Lawrence, an assistant dean at Boston University, "who have been severely undervalued by the marketplace."
Recruiters, however, are not so easy to convince. "You can't go any deeper" than the very top students at second-tier schools, said Mr. Miranda at Bain & Company. "We're already pushing the boundaries at those schools."
Pushing the boundaries or not, they still sometimes have to do battle with the lure of technology. Students at Boston University, for example, are delighted that Boston Consulting Group, Chase Manhattan and McKinsey are all doing more to recruit them than they did in the past. "There's definitely a happiness about their coming to campus," said Moshiko Levhar, a second-year student who survived the interviews and got a job offer from McKinsey, which is, he declares, "as good as it gets."
Still, Mr. Levhar says he may not accept the offer. After all, he said, the telecommunications industry, where he worked before entering graduate school, looks very exciting right now.

Major consulting firms and investment banks once recruited almost exclusively among students at the top business schools. But as more of them are lured by Internet start-ups, the firms are turning to lesser-known M.B.A. programs like Indiana University's. Here is the share of graduates taking jobs in each field.

The Dishonest Truth

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
You don't have to be a brilliant political analyst to realize that the Republican nominee for president (whose identity is still, amazingly, in doubt) is going to have trouble making an economic case for his candidacy. As Bill Clinton put it, declaring that he had a "lot of sympathy" for the Republicans: "I mean, it's hard for them to figure out what to run on. They can't run against the longest economic expansion in history."
No, but they can try to claim credit for it. In the months ahead, there will be a deafening chorus of pundits insisting that it was Ronald Reagan who laid the foundations for our extraordinary prosperity -- indeed that today's prosperity is the ultimate vindication of Reaganomics. 
 The other day I happened to read a fairly typical example of the genre, an article titled "It's the Reagan Economy, Stupid." The piece, circulated by a neo-Reaganite pressure group called The Club for Growth, was written by Lawrence Kudlow, who was an adviser to Steve Forbes's campaign, and the club's president, Stephen Moore. (Mr. Moore is also director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute.) The title says it all: Rapid growth in the late 90's is the continuing legacy of Mr. Reagan's tax cuts, way back in 1981. And reading the piece, an idea occurred to me.
You see, the usual riposte to this sort of thing involves a weary reiteration of the basic economics involved. One tries, for the umpteenth time, to explain that nothing extraordinary happened to the U.S. economy during the Reagan years. Well before the events of the 80's, scenarios of disinflation had become standard exercises in the macroeconomics textbooks. In these scenarios, an initial period of rising unemployment and slow or negative growth would be followed by a period of rapid, non-inflationary growth and falling unemployment, with the unemployment rate ending up about where it started. And that's just what happened. But though it's the simple truth, this explanation is too complicated to be heard over the shouting.
So what do you say we focus on the character issue instead? Are the commentators who say that our current prosperity vindicates Reaganomics being honest? If they are, then if things had gone differently -- if the economy had done badly under Bill Clinton -- logic implies that they would have reached a different conclusion. If good news vindicates the Reagan legacy, bad news would have called it into question, right?
I suppose I could stop right there. You know and I know that if the economy were slumping instead of booming, the same people would triumphantly contrast the Clinton record with Mr. Reagan's and declare the contrast -- surprise! -- a vindication of Reaganomics.
But we don't have to leave this as a mere conjecture. Instead we can be scholarly, and look at the literature -- that is, earlier writings by some of the Reaganite faithful, from the years before it became clear that their problem would be how to explain away the economy's continuing success.
For example, it so happens that in October 1996, little more than three years ago, Mr. Moore and William Niskanen, Cato's chairman, put out a report titled "Supply-side tax cuts and the truth about the Reagan economic record." This report was vehement in insisting that in assessing Mr. Reagan's achievement one must not include any data after 1989, which marks the end of the Reagan era; the years from 1981 to 1989 "provide a convenient and unique laboratory-like testing ground for assessing the success or failure of Reaganomics." And the report went on to argue that the slower growth from 1989 to 1995 demonstrated the superiority of Reaganite policies.
It doesn't get much better than this. If the post-Reagan economy stumbles, the great man's responsibility ends on the day he left office. But if the good times keep rolling, so does Mr. Reagan's legacy. As they say in the scholarly journals: Gotcha!
Of course, none of this will make any difference either to the views or the behavior of the faithful. Commentators will commentate, fulminators will fulminate, and everyone will pretend to base his arguments on the evidence. But now that you know the truth, here's a suggestion: Next time you hear a talking head start to explain how Ronald Reagan deserves the credit for Bill Clinton's economy, switch to the Discovery Channel -- where you might actually learn something.

HEADLINE: Another Big Paper Company Acquisition

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
In a move that brings the fourth major paper-industry merger or acquisition in less than two weeks, the big Finnish paper company Stora Enso said yesterday that it would acquire Consolidated Papers Inc., based in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis. The deal is valued at $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $900 million in debt.
The merged company's combined sales of $13.2 billion in 1999 place it a distant second in revenue to the International Paper Company, which sells a bigger proportion of high-priced stock, and had $25 billion in sales. The new company, though, will probably be the world's largest producer in terms of paper tonnage. 
 Stora Enso is paying $44 a share for Consolidated, a rich premium over the company's preannouncement closing price of $26. Investors clearly felt that Consolidated got the better deal: its stock jumped $10.50 on Tuesday, to $36.50, while Stora Enso's shares lost 2 euros in Helsinki, closing at 11.10 euros.
Still, analysts hailed the merger as another sign that the fragmented paper industry was building a global business. "This sea change that we've been expecting is finally happening," said Kathryn F. McAuley, a Brown Brothers Harriman analyst, "and we're seeing real globalization of the industry."
In the last two weeks, UPM-Kymmene, also of Finland, bought Champion International, creating a behemoth in coated papers; Abitibi-Consolidated bought Donohue Inc., creating a leader in newsprint, and International Paper, which bought Union Camp last year, said it would acquire Shorewood Packaging, which had been embroiled in a takeover battle with the Chesapeake Corporation when International Paper made its offer.
More deals are in the works. The New Zealand conglomerate Fletcher Challenge has said it wants to sell its newsprint operations. Norske Skog is said to be looking for a North American acquisition. And on Friday, St. Laurent Paperboard of Canada said it was in merger talks. It did not specify with whom, but the name swirling around Wall Street was that of Smurfit-Stone Container, the world's biggest corrugated-box maker -- itself formed when Jefferson Smurfit gobbled up the Stone Container Corporation in 1998.
Despite all the mergers, paper remains a highly fragmented industry. "You can still find 30 or 40 publicly traded paper companies in the U.S., and probably another 15 in Canada," said Mark Wilde of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, noting that even International Paper, the industry leader, accounts for only about 5 percent of the 300 million tons of paper produced worldwide each year.
The lack of cohesion has cost the industry dearly. Most companies expanded wildly when paper prices started to soar in the mid-90's. When economic troubles overseas put the brakes on demand, the industry found itself drowning in capacity. The long lead time required to plan and build paper mills meant that construction proceeded even as prices and profit plummeted, starting in late 1995. They did not recover until last year.
Industries like publishing and manufacturing, which are prime customers for paper, have been consolidating into global powerhouses that want global suppliers.
"They want to deal with the same supplier all over the world," Ms. McAuley said, "but they don't want their paper shipped to Chicago from Finland."
In such an environment, consolidation may have been inevitable. The European paper companies began merging several years ago and the resulting big producers, like Stora Enso, are now looking to North America for merger partners. North American companies, though, are still joining mainly with each other.
"The American companies may be missing chances to expand into higher-growth markets," Mr. Wilde warned.
And the industry has returned to good times. After a dismal 1997 and 1998, most companies were profitable last year, and Ms. McAuley, for one, predicts that profits will remain robust through 2002. Consolidation can only improve the profit picture, as merged companies close older plants and eliminate administrators.
This has not yet translated into higher prices. "We may see more pricing power but we're far from being an oligopoly yet," Ms. McAuley said.
The deals may help smooth out some of the wild swings that have characterized paper pricing. And they are likely to buoy profit. "It doesn't mean anything for prices," said John V. Faraci, International Paper's chief financial officer, "but it's enabling all of us to get costs out and to put more money into product development."
Analysts say stockholders will settle for nothing less. "Shareholders have made it clear they want financial returns improved," Mr. Wilde said, "that they want C.E.O.'s to stop building plants and start rationalizing their businesses."

HEADLINE: New Tension Over Taiwan

 BODY:
A dangerous pattern is emerging in the troubled relations across the Taiwan Strait. During Taiwan's last presidential campaign, in 1996, China test-fired missiles over waters close to the island's major cities to protest what it saw as a drift toward independence. Now, with a new campaign under way, Beijing is again trying to intimidate Taiwanese voters and push the island's next leaders into early reunification talks on the mainland's terms.
China was wrong this week to threaten to use force against Taiwan if the island's leaders take too long to agree to reunite with the mainland. By coupling that threat with an attempt to deflect the blame to Washington for increasing military tensions over Taiwan, Beijing may have damaged its chances of winning Congressional backing for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. 
 Unlike some of the past crises stirred up by the provocative actions of Taiwan's departing president, Lee Teng-hui, the blame for this flare-up lies squarely with Beijing. Taiwan's three leading presidential candidates have tried to mute the independence issue, and all three favor early talks with the mainland. Most of the world, and most Taiwanese, acknowledge the principle that Taiwan and the mainland are part of a single China that should ultimately be reunited.
But there are vital differences on how and when reunification should take place. The United States, which recognizes the Communist government in Beijing as the sole government of China, rightly insists that reunification be achieved by peaceful means. Beijing, however, has consistently asserted its right to settle the question by force. When China underscored that threat with missile tests in 1996, it created an anti-mainland backlash among Taiwanese voters and damaged Beijing's relations with the United States. The mainland could again hurt its own interests if it fails to show greater restraint.
Taiwan's presidential race is a tight three-way affair between the candidate of the ruling Nationalist Party, Lien Chan; a dissident nationalist, James Soong; and the candidate of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, Chen Shui-bian. Although Mr. Chen's party has traditionally called for an independent Taiwan, he has deliberately stepped back from that position, promising that if elected, he would not seek formal independence. This caution reflects the general sense on Taiwan that President Lee needlessly provoked the mainland with his politicized 1995 visit to the United States and his 1999 declaration that Taiwan would henceforth negotiate with China only if Beijing acknowledged it as an equal state.
Over five decades, a relatively stable arrangement has evolved that allows Taiwan and the mainland to maintain separate political and economic systems as part of a larger, single China. That understanding has served both sides well and preserved peace. This is no time for Beijing to threaten to overturn it.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Police Union Seeks Inquiry

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 22

 BODY:
In an extraordinary step that reflected the plummeting public confidence in the Los Angeles Police Department over a growing corruption scandal, the union representing police officers undercut the department's chief today and demanded an independent investigation of the growing evidence of police brutality.
The union noted that since its creation in 1925 it had never advocated an outside investigation of the department. But it said such a step was needed now because the scandal had so tainted the department, as reports emerged that corrupt officers framed perhaps several hundred people and in at least two instances shot unarmed suspects and then planted guns on them. 
 The announcement was also a political shot at the chief of police, Bernard C. Parks, who has fought any outside interference but is now clearly losing the confidence of his uniformed officers, some of whom have said they fear the chief may make some of the wrongdoers scapegoats and not thoroughly investigate the department's senior officers.
The Police Department has established an internal Board of Inquiry, composed of top officers, that has been investigating the scandal for several months separately from the criminal investigation at the district attorney's office. The Board of Inquiry is expected to deliver its report to the police commission, a civilian oversight body, on March 1.
Mr. Parks did not comment on the announcement, and Cmdr. David Kalish, the department spokesman, did not return calls seeking comment.
"This represents a great leap forward for the police union and it's also the first step in reinforcing to the public that restoring the credibility of the Police Department is our single biggest priority," said Ted Hunt, the president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which represents about 9,500 officers.
In addition, the City Council considered a motion today to create an outside entity to investigate the scandal. Joel Wachs, a councilman who is running for mayor, proposed that the city consider such a body to ensure that the police brutality was being thoroughly investigated, particularly the accusations of culpability by the department's top officers.
His motion was voted down, 8 to 6, but several other members of the Council said that over the past week a more militant mood had developed as confidence in the police chief tumbled and concern grew over the extent of the brutality.
"How could this go on so long and be so bad and nobody at the top knew about it?" Mr. Wachs asked in an interview. "It just doesn't pass the smell test to do something from within."
He called the scandal "a moral and a financial crisis," and said that politicians and the public were sobered by reports that the civil suits by those unjustly imprisoned could cost the city $200 million or more.
The new mood marks a major shift, since politicians, especially the mayor, had generally watched quietly since the first reports of corruption emerged last September.
"I'm one of those whose views are evolving, particularly in the last week or so," said Councilwoman Laura Chick, who voted for Mr. Wachs's motion.
Ms. Chick said she now believed that restoring public confidence in the Police Department could not be achieved by the police commission alone.
The scandal began last September when a former officer, Rafael Perez, agreed to disclose evidence of the corruption in return for a lighter sentence in a case in which he admitted stealing about eight pounds of cocaine from the department. He told how the police had framed scores of innocent people, many of them gang members, and lied in court. In at least two instances, Mr. Perez said, officers shot unarmed gang members, one while he was handcuffed, and had then framed them on trumped-up charges.
Initially, the scandal was focused on Mr. Perez's old inner city station, the Rampart Division, but evidence is emerging that the brutality may have been more widespread.
More than 40 criminal cases have been overturned so far, with the police saying that at least 99 have been tainted.

Microsoft Presses Defense As Trial Draws to a Close
After 16 months of testimony and argument the antitrust suit against Microsoft drew to a close. A verdict is expected in the next few weeks, but even then the court is likely to hold separate hearings on remedies if, as expected, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson rules that Microsoft violated antitrust laws.
As Microsoft and the government concluded the trial, their representatives were still continuing to meet in Chicago in search of a settlement in mediation talks. Page A1. 

Sealing the Deal Over Raw Caribou
He met his wife in the Sunday school class that his parents taught, and he has never lost his deep faith. But God helps those who help themselves, as Archie Dunham, Conoco's chief executive, discovered on a business trip to the frozen wastes of northern Russia. There, he was offered an unusual appetizer by the local chieftain: raw caribou meat dipped in caribou blood. The morsel held little appeal, but Mr. Dunham gulped it down and sealed the deal. The Boss. C12.
 
Blue-Chip Stocks Recover Slightly
Blue-chip stocks finished higher as concern about the impact of rising interest rates eased and the market got a lift from news of stock buybacks by companies, including the drug producer Merck. The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 85.32 points, or 0.83 percent, at 10,304.84. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose slightly, closing up 6.08 points, to 1,352.17.

Knicks Won't Train in South Carolina

BYLINE: By STEVE POPPER 

DATELINE: PURCHASE, N.Y., Feb. 22

 BODY:
The Knicks have trained in Charleston, S.C., for the past eight years, spending a week of preseason training camp at the College of Charleston and then returning there for the period between the end of the regular season and the beginning of the playoffs. But the Knicks won't be there this spring, as they get ready for the postseason.
The Knicks announced today that they are pulling out of South Carolina because of the state's continued policy of flying the Confederate flag over the state Capitol building in Columbia, a policy that has created an intense, nationwide debate. In doing so, the Knicks apparently became the first professional sports team to take such an action. 
 "We're making a decision that we think is in the best interests of our team," said Steve Mills, the Knicks' executive vice president for franchise operations. "That's what this decision is really all about. We obviously don't want to put our players in a situation that they're uncomfortable with. We felt this was the right and best decision to make."
Last July, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called for an economic boycott of South Carolina because of the flag issue. Last week, USA Track and Field, mindful that the United States women's marathon's trials are to take place in Columbia this Saturday, issued a statement in support of removal of the flag. At the same time, some track and field athletes have contemplated a protest during Saturday's trials and some college sports teams have already begun canceling trips to South Carolina.
According to Mills, it was the USA Track and Field statement that pushed the team to consider taking action, and Coach Jeff Van Gundy broached the issue with the Knicks players in a meeting last Friday. "Based on what we saw with the USA Track and Field issue, and how the athletes were reacting to the situation, that's when we started looking at it," said Mills, the highest-ranking African-American on the Knicks. "We realized this is something we needed to address. We spoke to Jeff and through our conversations with him, decided that he was going to raise the issue with the players.
"We, as an organization, identified it as an issue and knew it was something the players were going to have a strong view on. We thought we ought to have Jeff speak to them."
While the Statehouse is nowhere near the College of Charleston or the Charleston Place hotel where the team stays, Mills said the team still felt it would be wrong to be in South Carolina. The Charleston site has been an easy fit for the team, offering a facility where the team could focus in relative anonymity, far from the masses of cameras and tape recorders that they are subjected to when they work out at home.
"We all enjoy going there," said center Chris Dudley, the lone white player on the Knicks. "But we feel this is only right. Once everything is worked out, we'd like to go back."
Mills said the decision to relocate was reached today after a number of players had voiced their objections to a Charleston trip to Van Gundy. Several had spoke publicly, too, with Larry Johnson, Charlie Ward and Chris Childs all making it clear they did not want to go. For now, the decision only affects this spring's pre-playoff camp, with Mills saying that the decision whether to return in the fall for training camp depended on whether the state could come up with a compromise that would remove the flag from the Statehouse.
But even if a compromise were reached soon, Mills indicated that the team would stay away from Charleston this spring.
"We feel that now that we've gone this far, we've made a decision as it relates to the playoffs," Mills said.
The team had contact with representatives of the College of Charleston to tell them of the team's plans, but there was no interaction with representatives of the state. Mills said the Knicks would now look at a variety of options to replace Charleston. In the abbreviated preseason of last season's lockout-shortened season, the Knicks worked out locally.

Bradley Nod To Clinton On Universal Health Care

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Feb. 22

 BODY:
In a nod to President Clinton's continuing popularity among Democratic voters, former Senator Bill Bradley asserted today that Vice President Al Gore had adopted many core Democratic principles only after becoming Mr. Clinton's "No. 2," and he suggested that the vice president could not be counted on to defend those principles on his own.
Though he has criticized Mr. Clinton's ethics in the past, the former senator from New Jersey twice wrapped himself in the president's mantle today, saying he and Mr. Clinton shared views on universal health care, and contending that Mr. Gore had forsaken that goal. 
 "When he was running for vice president in 1992, he took Bill Clinton's views on health care and said we needed health insurance for everyone," Mr. Bradley told more than 250 people here at Adelphi University. "Now that he's on his own running for president, he says health insurance for all Americans is too expensive and we can't do it, even though we have a giant budget surplus and eight million more uninsured than seven years ago."
Mr. Bradley went on to argue that in 1993 Mr. Clinton supported replacing Medicaid with a new program that was similar to what Mr. Bradley has called for in this campaign.
"When Bill Clinton wanted to reform Medicaid to end the two-tiered system in our country, Al Gore supported it," Mr. Bradley said. "Now that he's running for president, he attacks me for wanting to do the same thing that Bill Clinton wanted to do, and that he used to support."
In evoking Mr. Clinton today, Mr. Bradley -- who is trailing Mr. Gore by double digits in public opinion polls in most states -- was trying to show that Mr. Gore was a follower in the Clinton administration, not a leader, his aides said. Mr. Bradley sought to underscore that theme by calling Mr. Gore "a loyal No. 2."
But Mr. Bradley also seemed intent on trying to separate Mr. Gore somewhat from Mr. Clinton, who remains popular among voters in Democratic primaries. A CBS-New York Times poll conducted last week, for example, found that 70 percent of Democratic voters viewed Mr. Clinton favorably.
And by mentioning the president twice -- he usually does not mention Mr. Clinton at all in his speeches -- Mr. Bradley wanted to show that he strongly supported some of the president's major initiatives, Mr. Bradley's aides said.
That acknowledgment represents a subtle shift for Mr. Bradley, whose campaign was once strongly premised on the idea that Democrats would be ready to throw Mr. Gore out of office because of weariness with the Democrats' fund-raising abuses in 1996 and questions about Mr. Clinton's ethics.
"He's trying desperately to create phony distinctions, because he loses when voters focus on the real differences in this campaign," said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman.
Coming just two weeks before the Super Tuesday primaries on March 7, Mr. Bradley's 20-minute prepared speech today was one of his most forceful and clearly articulated explanations yet for why Democrats should choose him over a sitting vice president when the nation, by many measures, is in very good health.
It also picked up on a theme he began sounding during the Democrats' debate in Harlem on Monday night, when Mr. Bradley asserted that Mr. Gore was a conservative member of Congress whose views turned left when he joined the administration in 1993.
By having shifted ground on abortion, gun control, tobacco regulations and health care, Mr. Gore had showed himself to have no clear ideological core, Mr. Bradley said.
But Mr. Hattaway said, "Senator Bradley knows very well that Al Gore is pro-choice and supports gun control."
Mr. Bradley, who has been criticized by some Democrats for having a low-key stump style, also urged voters not to be taken in by Mr. Gore's more forceful manner.
"Strength is not about shouting or pounding a table, it's about knowing what you believe and acting on those beliefs no matter what those around you are doing," Mr. Bradley said.
"I'm not flashy," he added. "Never have been, either on the floor of Madison Square Garden or in the United States Senate.
"My passion for these things is deep in my heart, and it's deep in my soul," Mr. Bradley continued. "I show them not by shouting or making a fist, but by the consistency of my beliefs."
Before his speech today, the candidate stopped in Astoria, Queens, where he shook hands with voters and dropped by a Greek delicatessen where he ate feta cheese and baklava, bought a spinach-and-cheese pie and did his version of a Greek folk dance for the amused clientele.
On Wednesday, Mr. Bradley will give a speech on economics at Columbia University before flying to Washington State, where he intends to spend almost all of the week campaigning in preparation for its Feb. 29 nonbinding primary.
Mr. Bradley is staking much time and money on that state, hoping to jump-start his struggling campaign for the stretch run to March 7, when 16 states will hold primaries or caucuses that will select nearly a third of the Democratic delegates.

On a Rocky Road, the Race Tightens

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 22

 BODY:
This road is nothing but bumps.
New Hampshire knocked Gov. George W. Bush's bandwagon off the highway. Then, last Saturday, South Carolina derailed Senator John McCain's Straight Talk Express. Today, after a meager two-day campaign, Mr. Bush hit a sizable pothole in Michigan, right in the middle of his turnpike to victory. 
 Mr. McCain's electrifying andoh-so-vitalvictoryhere was reinforced by an overwhelming victory in his home state of Arizona, where Mr. Bush had once hoped to make inroads.
So Senator McCain lives to fight another day, and Governor Bush, with his cloak of inevitability further frayed, must find somewhere else to drive the Arizonan from the contest. Mr. Bush tried to look past Mr. McCain in his speeches here, concentrating his fire on President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, the most likely Democratic nominee. That proved premature.
Although it sounded at the time like wishful thinking, Mr. McCain prophesied on Sunday that Michigan would differ from South Carolina. In South Carolina, he said, "it was very clear that we were wiped out by the so-called Christian right, and that's where a lot of this hate stuff was directed" -- implying that Republican conservatives would count for less today.
Because he has more money, more prominent backers and two powerful geographic bases -- Florida, where his brother Jeb is governor, and his own state of Texas -- Mr. Bush must still be counted the man to beat. He also demonstrated again today his ability to beat Mr. McCain handily among Republicans, and in many of the primaries ahead they are the only ones who get to vote.
On the other hand, Mr. McCain can now entertain legitimate hopes of rekindling the widespread enthusiasm he generated in the campaign's early weeks.
The results in Michigan, much the most representative state to vote so far this year, also contained dire warnings for both of the candidates. This is the eighth-most-populous state, with a highly competitive two-party system, a downsizing government, prosperous farms and a growing, highly innovative economy: the kind of state all presidential candidates shoot for.
Mr. Bush was outpolled 60 to 40 by Mr. McCain among moderate voters here. Such voters usually hold the key to presidential elections. Having allied himself firmly with the far right in South Carolina, he apparently suffered for that in Michigan.
Although the poll of voters conducted by the television networks and The Associated Press contained no denominational questions, many politicians suggested that the governor's visit two weeks ago to Bob Jones University, which is often accused of anti-Catholicism, had hurt him among Roman Catholic voters in the blue-collar suburbs of Detroit and other big cities.
Mr. Bush's father, George Bush, lost centrist voters to Bill Clinton, and with them the election of 1992, and then Bob Dole did the same thing in 1996. This year, the Republican leaders who flocked to the Texas governor did so in large part because they thought he would have broader appeal.
Delighted though he was to do so well here, Mr. McCain must worry about the uncomfortable degree to which his advantage depended upon Democrats and independents. Mr. Bush took two-thirds of the Republican vote, and only the astounding fact that Democrats and independents accounted for more than 50 percent of today's electorate pulled the Arizona senator through.
It appeared that the non-Republican turnout reached record proportions for a Republican primary, partly because of local ballot issues in some places. There were hints that at least a few Democrats deliberately voted in the Republican primary to foul up the other party's process.
Michael Flashner, 31, a Democratic sales representative in the Detroit suburbs, backed Mr. McCain. Asked why, he replied: "To tell the truth, I'd like to see the process go on as long as it can, because the more they beat each other up, the better."
Gov. John M. Engler, who had put his political prestige on the line for Mr. Bush, confessed tonight that he may have miscalculated.
"I thought if we could just get the Republican vote out," he said, "we could withstand whatever Democrats and independents came out for McCain. I didn't see any need to go up on television and warn about this wave of Democratic and independent voters. Maybe that was a mistake."
The ability to attract voters across party lines augurs well for Mr. McCain's chances this fall, should he be nominated, but it will not help him in many of the primaries that take place later this month. Virginia's voting next Tuesday and Georgia's and Ohio's on March 7 are open to all registered voters, but only registered Republicans can vote in primaries in Washington State next Tuesday and in New York on March 7. In California, also on March 7, non-Republicans can cast ballots, but their votes will not count in awarding delegates.
In Michigan, the electorate was much more balanced than in South Carolina, from a number of points of view. Half the voters here described themselves as conservatives; 60 percent did so in South Carolina.
In South Carolina, 34 percent called themselves Christian conservatives. Fewer than 3 voters in 10 here said they identified with the religious right, a decline from 1988, when Pat Robertson ran strongly here, and 1996, when Patrick J. Buchanan took 34 percent of the total in giving Mr. Dole a tough fight.
Mr. Robertson recorded telephone messages to Michigan voters this year urging them to turn out in support of Mr. Bush, accusing Mr. McCain of having chosen, in former Senator Warren E. Rudman of New Hampshire, a "vicious bigot" as national chairman.
Because the voting here followed almost immediately on the heels of that in South Carolina, the results there may not have had time to sink in and generate a surge for Mr. Bush. Not until election day itself, the exit poll indicated, did a small swing to the Texas governor get under way.
Michiganders, subjected for a much shorter period to bombardment by the artillery of radio and television advertisements, took a different view of the candidates on important points. There, Mr. McCain was seen as the less fair of the two contenders; here, Mr. Bush was, although Mr. McCain took a more caustic tone in his personal appearances. There, Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain were seen as equally likely to say what they believed rather than what people wanted to hear; here, Mr. McCain had an advantage on that score.
Todd Breadon, a United Auto Workers member who works on a Chrysler production line, said in explaining his vote for Mr. McCain: "I really don't care for George Bush. He seems like a daddy's boy. He seems like a weasel." An independent, Mr. Breadon voted in Royal Oak, north of Detroit.
A third of the voters said they belonged to a union, and Mr. McCain took 6 of every 10 votes in that group. But that margin lent little credibility to the argument, voiced by some Bush backers, that the state's big trade unions had set out to disrupt Mr. Engler's pro-Bush efforts.
In addition, Mr. McCain seemed to have gone some way towards reclaiming his identity as a reformer, for which Governor Bush successfully challenged by proclaiming himself a "reformer with results."
Once again, Mr. McCain did less well than he had hoped among two groups he has targeted. A Vietnam veteran who spent years as a prisoner of war, he got the votes of only slightly more veterans than Mr. Bush. And he did less well than his rival among young voters, especially under 30.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE SENATOR;
McCain Makes Appeal to G.O.P. Loyalists

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Feb. 22

 BODY:
With his insurgent campaign brought back to life tonight by victories in the Michigan and Arizona primaries, Senator John McCain reached out to loyalists in his party, imploring, "Don't fear this campaign, my fellow Republicans -- join it."
Just three days after a drubbing in South Carolina looked like it could be the death knell for his campaign, Mr. McCain was exuberant, grinning and saying, "What a difference a couple of days make." 
 Recognizing that his victory in Michigan relied on his crossover appeal to Democrats and independents, he immediately began trying to shore up support from Republicans in preparation for the round of primaries ahead.
"I want to make a special plea tonight to my fellow Republicans," he said in a hotel ballroom here. "There are those who rule the establishment who want more than anything to defend Washington's big money, big spending status quo. They want to fool you about me. Well here is some more straight talk: I am a proud Reagan conservative. I love the Republican Party. It is my home."
The night's victories, particularly in Michigan, made Mr. McCain viable again and propelled him and Gov. George W. Bush into a fierce cross-country struggle for the Republican presidential nomination.
The schedule ahead still presents a formidable challenge to Mr. McCain's underdog campaign, which largely lacks institutional support while Mr. Bush has piled up the endorsements of governors and has a national apparatus in place.
Showdowns loom next week in Washington, Virginia and North Dakota. And on March 7 comes the first super Tuesday when the delegate-rich powerhouses of California and New York, a host of New England states and Ohio and Georgia vote. Asked as he voted this morning whether the Michigan primary was "do or die" for him, Mr. McCain said: "Every day is do or die. We're a high-wire act and an insurgency campaign."
In Michigan today, Mr. Bush once again won handily among Republicans while Mr. McCain drew independents and Democrats into voting in the Republican primary. While that shows Mr. McCain's potential general election appeal, it also represents a challenge for him. (In his home state, the results were somewhat different, with Mr. Bush winning his support only from the most conservative Republicans.)
While some of the states ahead have open primaries, like Michigan's, others allow only party members to vote. And while California has an open primary, its 162 delegates are allotted based only on how Republicans vote.
In order to shore up his support among Republicans, Mr. McCain began trying to hammer home the themes that he is the one who can best propel his party to victory in November. "We are creating a new majority, my friends, a McCain majority," he said, "and we are Al Gore's worst nightmare."
Mr. McCain was also preparing to begin airing a new commercial in California, Washington and Virginia perhaps as early as Thursday to try to make up ground with Republicans, his aides said. Striking similar tones to his victory speech, the advertisement will likely feature Mr. McCain looking into the camera and saying that the establishment is running ads to fool voters about him.
The advertisement will then stress his economic message of fighting against pork-barrel spending, and his plan for tax cuts for the middle class while devoting much of the surplus to Social Security.
"I want to end Washington's outrageous pork barrel spending," Mr. McCain said tonight, striking some of the same themes. "I want to rebuild our military, strengthen our families, protect the unborn, and cut your taxes. I want to use the surplus the right way, by keeping our obligation to shore up Social Security, fix Medicare and pay down our debt."
Mr. McCain's aides argue that Washington, California, New York and New England now represent fertile ground for Mr. McCain's message of reform Republicanism and that Mr. Bush will be haunted by the tenor of his South Carolina campaign and his close alliance with the Christian right. "South Carolina did not define this campaign," said Rick Davis, the McCain campaign manager. "Unfortunately for Bush he got defined in South Carolina."
Dan Evans, the former governor of Washington, recently switched from Mr. Bush to endorse Mr. McCain. In New York, Representative Peter T. King also switched to the McCain camp, criticizing Mr. Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University.
And though the pace now becomes punishing and the campaign has to be waged coast to coast, Mr. McCain's aides said that Mr. Bush's vast spending in South Carolina, Michigan and Arizona has virtually eliminated his fund-raising advantage and that they could now come closer to matching his television advertising.
To ensure that, Carla Eudy, Mr. McCain's finance chairwoman, said the campaign was sending out new mail, telephone and Internet appeals for cash and that fund-raisers were planned for Thursday in San Francisco and Friday in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: MICROSOFT CHIDED AS ANTITRUST TRIAL DRAWS TO A CLOSE

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22

 BODY:
Microsoft had its last chance in federal court today to persuade the trial judge not to issue a stinging antitrust verdict against the company.
But the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, gave Microsoft little comfort. At one point in today's final arguments, he dismissed a crucial Microsoft defense by comparing the company to John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly, the subject of the first major antitrust case, in 1906. That case resulted in a breakup of the company. 
 "I don't really see a distinction," Judge Jackson said.
The government, in its final argument, said it was "simply impossible to imagine" that the company would not be found to have violated the nation's antitrust laws.
The Microsoft Corporation, for its part, argued that it was impossible to see how the company could be found guilty. "A lot of nothing doesn't add up to something," said John Warden, the company's lead lawyer.
And so the trial drew to a close on exactly the same notes that carried it through 16 months of testimony and argument. The government pressed hard on its broad points, while Microsoft refused to concede even a nit. Today's arguments on the relevant points of law bearing on the case were the last act before a verdict, which will probably be issued in the next few weeks.
The court is likely to hold separate hearings on remedies if, as expected, Judge Jackson rules that Microsoft violated antitrust laws.
A strong verdict against Microsoft could well lead to harsh sanctions against the company, including breaking it up. If, however, Judge Jackson agrees with some of the government's legal contentions but rejects others, the sanctions against Microsoft could be less severe, prohibiting it from some practices but leaving the company intact.
Still, the Justice Department and state attorneys general pressing the case insist that they will not settle for mild sanctions.
"The remedies have to be drastic and far reaching," Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut and one of the plaintiffs, said this evening.
But even as Microsoft and the government concluded this phase of the trial, their representatives were continuing to meet in Chicago in search of a settlement in mediation talks overseen by Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The sides reportedly remained far apart, but government officials noted that the fact they were still meeting at this late date suggested willingness on both sides to reach a settlement.
"We're continuing to work hard with Judge Posner," said William H. Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel.
The debate in court today was over how legal precedents from industries ranging from ski slopes in Colorado to newspapers in Ohio apply to the facts in the Microsoft case. The government said Microsoft was an old-fashioned monopolist in high-technology clothes. Microsoft responded that computer software -- a fast-changing, dynamic, fiercely competitive industry -- did indeed have distinctive characteristics, and the courts should tread carefully.
The Standard Oil analogy was just one of several skeptical questions and remarks Judge Jackson aimed at Microsoft's lawyer in court today. Mr. Warden was making the argument that the Windows operating system was protected by a copyright and, therefore, was protected against some of the government's accusations, when Judge Jackson spoke up to say he had a problem with that defense.
"What exactly is covered by copyright?" the judge asked. He then asked whether it was "fee simple" -- or absolute -- control over code.
"Mr. Rockefeller," the judge said, "had fee-simple control over his oil. I don't really see a distinction."
 Mr. Warden responded that the laws were different then, adding that he did not think copyright law was more powerful than antitrust law.
Today's presentations were the final attempts by both sides to try to influence Judge Jackson's thinking. At one point, David Boies, the Justice Department's lead trial lawyer, said Microsoft's business strategy was based on trying to "bribe and coerce" other companies in the computer industry. Mr. Warden dismissed one of Mr. Boies's arguments as "entirely wrong."
The government, according to most antitrust experts, is sitting on a big lead, while Microsoft is trying to limit its losses in Judge Jackson's court while hoping to fare better on appeal. But at one point, Mr. Boies appeared to be trying to embolden Judge Jackson not to worry about appeals by saying: "Try to imagine the Supreme Court ruling that these acts do not violate the antitrust laws. It is simply impossible to imagine that."
Microsoft, on the other hand, seemed to be employing elements of a loss-limitation strategy. Mr. Warden began by saying that Microsoft "respectfully disagreed" with much of Judge Jackson's findings of fact last November, which strongly favored the government's case.
Mr. Warden then went on to tell the judge that his ruling might well shape the ground rules for competition in the entire high-technology economy. And he lambasted the government for its "assault on Windows, which promotes and creates commerce."
The Microsoft case, Mr. Warden noted, focuses on the company's "fights with competitors in a highly competitive, fast-moving industry." And antitrust law, he observed, encourages competition even when that rough-and-tumble competition hurts a company's rivals.
"The law should not be rewritten to prevent Microsoft, or any other company, from competing aggressively," Mr. Warden said.
In the government's view, Microsoft is trying to change the subject with arguments like these. "We don't say competition is a violation of the antitrust laws," Mr. Boies said. "Our allegations here deal with the means by which they compete. They are seriously anticompetitive."
He added that the voluminous court record, including thousands of e-mails, internal Microsoft documents and months of witness testimony, had shown that Microsoft was an arm-twisting monopolist, whose corporate behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers. Judge Jackson's factual findings agreed.
Mr. Boies opened his remarks by emphasizing that the Supreme Court had long recognized that antitrust cases were "especially fact-based cases." And throughout his presentation, he repeatedly made reference to the judge's findings of fact.
But at one point, Judge Jackson asked hard questions of Mr. Boies, too. Antitrust experts say that the government accusation that is most vulnerable is the contention that Microsoft illegally tied its Internet browser to a separate product, its industry-standard Windows operating system.
Judge Jackson questioned Mr. Boies closely on the tying issue. Mr. Boies argued that Microsoft's decision was not really a product design decision but more a mere "bolting" together of the browser and Windows.
In short, Mr. Boies was trying to recast the tying charge as a contract restriction -- that is, PC makers who wanted Windows had to take its Internet Explorer browsing software whether they wanted it or not.
Judge Jackson appeared to be skeptical. What about the benefit, he asked Mr. Boies, of the increased distribution of browser technology resulting from Microsoft's decision to fold its browser into Windows? "I can't offset that -- one plausible benefit," Judge Jackson said.
Still, Kevin O'Conner, an assistant attorney general for Wisconsin, who represented the states, declared that "Microsoft has used virtually every tool of the monopolist's trade -- attempted collusion, exclusionary contracts, tying, predation -- in a coordinated scheme to eliminate threats to its monopoly."

HEADLINE: As Workers Go Off Duty, So Do Cabbies. How Odd.

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
It is as inexorable as the tides, as reliable as the setting sun. And it happens every weekday afternoon around 5, just as office buildings are beginning to empty out, just as hundreds of hands are being raised into the air on hundreds of crowded Manhattan street corners: the Great Taxi Drought begins.
"Hey, guy!" yelled Don Ciliotta, waving, leaning into traffic, trying to catch the eyes of a cabbie tearing down Ninth Avenue. "Guy! Hey, guy!" 
 The driver waved back, which was nice of him, considering that more than a dozen taxis had simply roared past Mr. Ciliotta, a tile importer from Long Island, suffering for more than 20 minutes in a subfreezing wind with his brother and their wives.
Atop each passing cab glared the familiar amber off-duty light, as forlorn as a no-vacancy sign buzzing in the dead of night.
The Ciliottas, far from alone, were caught in the gears of the dreaded taxi shift change. It happens when daytime drivers end their 12-hour work day and hit their off-duty lights to give themselves time to gas up and return to their garages to hand the cab to the night drivers, who are eager to start their own 12-hour shifts to catch as much of the evening rush as possible.
As New York phenomena go, the changeover approaches a kind of natural law, and one that seems to have been handed down from God, like alternate-side-of-the street parking rules and 20 percent tips.
In fact, it has been around so long and has become so ingrained in most taxi drivers' lives that explaining it seems, to them, as unnecessary as explaining why their cars have tires. "It's been around, like, forever, for eons," said Mike Higgins, a longtime cabbie who publishes the trade newspaper Taxi Talk. "It's just a traditional thing."
But to the cab-hailing public, it is a natural law that makes about as much sense as the one that compels salmon to swim upstream.
"It doesn't follow any kind of supply and demand laws," said Nathana Josephs, a public relations consultant who practically lives in taxis and has, in desperation, talked police officers and once even firefighters into giving her rides when she could not find a cab during a shift change.
"From 53rd and Fifth Avenue to 57th and Fifth, you could die before you get a cab at 5 o'clock," Ms. Josephs said. "Or you could get killed because of the competition to get the ones out there that are on duty."
Taxi industry historians say that the weekday late-afternoon shift change -- or at least the version that has become so noticeable and roundly reviled -- started happening in the early 1980's, when the large taxi fleets began leasing cabs to drivers instead of hiring the drivers as employees and paying them on commission.
The change, the result of a taxi industry policy adopted in 1979, made drivers into independent contractors who generally worked longer hours -- 12-hour shifts instead of 9-hour shifts, to make more money -- but who had more control over when they worked.
To keep the cabs occupied with drivers, fleets and other companies that leased taxis needed to divide the two 12-hour shifts so that there would always be a roughly equal number of drivers wanting to fill day and night shifts.
The problem was that if the day drivers started their shifts when they really wanted to -- at around 7 a.m. or even 8, when the streets begin to fill with people -- they would hand off to the night drivers too late for those drivers to reap the busiest time of their shift, when people left work. This would mean fewer drivers willing to take on night shifts.
So widespread shift changing around 4:30 or 5 o'clock began to evolve, giving both groups of drivers the benefit of a rush hour. And to make sure that the system was fair to night drivers, fleets also began to assess late fees from day drivers who stayed out too long and cut into night drivers' business.
But, in truth, night drivers are always complaining that day drivers should start earlier and hand off earlier because so many of their precious evening fares are simply evaporating, into the subways or into private car services, while the hand off takes place.
Day drivers, who hate starting as early as they do, are not budging.
Ron Sherman, president of the Midtown Operating Corporation, one of the city's largest fleets, with about 200 cars, recalled a heroic effort a few years back to move the shifts so that more of his drivers would change over earlier in the day.
"I thought it made sense and we'd give it a try," he said. The result? "We completely lost our whole day line." He said that about 70 percent of his drivers now change at 4:30 p.m. and others work out changes among themselves that are earlier or later.
There is not much he can do, he added, because the healthy economy has prompted many taxi drivers to leave for more lucrative work at private livery companies and has increased competition among taxi fleets for drivers. So the drivers who lease his cabs, Mr. Sherman said, pretty much "do what they want to do."
"We're really no different from Hertz or Avis," he said. "I can't tell you when to come in and rent a car from me."
Mr. Sherman's drivers insist that, sure, they feel for the stranded pedestrian with a late afternoon meeting or a plane to catch or a child waiting at day care. But there is really not much they can do.
"Of course it's rough out there, and of course everybody wants to go home, but I want to go home, too," said Anthony Tilelli, 58, who stood in Mr. Sherman's Long Island City garage last week after his day shift, while restless night drivers played "Ms. Pac-Man" in the waiting room behind him.
Mr. Tilelli, a 20-year taxi veteran, says that when he is off duty and angry pedestrians begin knocking on his window at a stop light, threatening to report him to the Taxi and Limousine Commission for refusing service, he generally rolls down his window and spells his name.
"I tell them to make sure and get it right," he said. "I don't care."
While the commission has no exact figures to show how many cabs are changing shifts around 5 P.M., the indications are that more are doing so than several years ago.
This is because the number of taxis being driven by individual owner-drivers -- those who work for themselves and tend to drive from the morning rush through the evening rush, filling in the gap -- is dropping, said Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant who studies the taxi industry. From 1994 to 1998, the proportion of all taxis driven by owner-drivers fell from about 28 percent to 18 percent, and the percentage is believed to be lower now.
That, combined with the fact that more discretionary income means more people competing for the fraction of the 12,187 cabs remaining on duty, means one thing: some very mean streets.
"There isn't really a lot we can do about it," said Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the chairwoman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission. "Except make it very hurtful for the drivers, and we're not going to do that."
Perhaps the ugliest manifestation of the increase, said Mr. Higgins, the Taxi Talk publisher, is the rising occurrence of what he calls "the big double cross," when an off-duty driver, motivated by both commercial and humanitarian impulses, decides to pick up a passenger who swears his destination is in the direction of the driver's garage.
"They say, 'Yeah, I'm going to 49th Street. This works out great!' And then they get in and say, 'O.K. buddy, take me to Brooklyn Heights,' and what are you going to do because they're already in the cab?"
More often than not, Mr. Higgins says, he does not take the risk anymore. He does exactly what all those cab drivers who whooshed past the poor Ciliottas on Ninth Avenue did.
"I don't care if it's Jesus Christ or a little old lady," Mr. Higgins said. "I've got to get to the garage on time."
And what about the Ciliottas, who had a dinner reservation in the West Village? When a reporter left them, they were still waiting, and beginning to shiver.
"What are we going to do?" Mr. Ciliotta said. "We're not going to walk 40 blocks."

HEADLINE: Pain Relief Underused For Poor, Study Says

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 22

 BODY:
An international narcotics control agency that is better known for raising alarms about the narcotics trade and drug abuse has turned its attention this year to a severe shortage of morphine and other painkillers in poor countries, where many are left to die in agony from cancer and other diseases.
The International Narcotics Control Board, a United Nations agency based in Vienna, says in a report to be published on Wednesday that it has been tracking the rising but uneven use of morphine and other natural or synthetic drugs with similar structures and effects for several years. 
 The board and the World Health Organization encourage the use of morphine, which is derived from opium, or similar drugs to relieve cancer-related pain. The board says that there is no evidence that those drugs are widely diverted for illicit use, and therefore no reason to caution against increased production.
In its report, the 26-member board made up of experts and diplomats found great disparities in access to strong painkillers among countries and also within them -- usually for economic reasons, but not always. Cultural or social attitudes and medical philosophies also play a part. Treating pain has gained more attention in the United States and Europe in recent years, but for other countries morphine may still be an unaffordable luxury, experts say.
"The ten largest consumer countries accounted for as much as 80 percent of analgesic morphine consumption," the report found. In those countries, all richer nations, the annual average consumption of such drugs was 31 grams for each 1,000 people. At the other end of the scale, in 120 mostly poor countries, there was little or no consumption of those painkillers, called opiods. Eighty other countries fell somewhere between those extremes.
"In a large proportion of the countries and territories of the world," the report says, "insignificant amounts of these medicines are available for medical purposes and it is generally agreed that the treatment of chronic or acute pain caused by cancer is still inadequate. Only about 10 to 30 percent of patients suffering from severe cancer-related pain may be receiving adequate treatment, even in many technologically advanced countries."
But the situation is often starkest in the poorest countries, the report found. "In developing countries, the relief of pain and suffering is given much lower priority than other, more urgent, health and social problems," it says.
The World Health Organization, which is represented on the narcotics board, predicts that by 2015, two-thirds of an estimated 15 million new cancer cases each year will be in developing countries.
Like calls made by others for cheaper and more readily available drugs for H.I.V.-AIDS in the third world, the narcotics board report recommends making more painkillers accessible.
The use of morphine for medical purposes was relatively low and stable until 1984, the report says. In the last 15 years it has risen tenfold.
The country with the highest consumption of morphine for medical use in 1998 was Denmark.
In its report, the narcotics control board also surveyed the use of legal mind-altering drugs and found that Europe far outstripped America and all other regions in the medical use of hypnotics and sedatives. Americans, on the other hand, continued to lead the world in the use of amphetamines, which act as stimulants, and, in fact, increased their intake.
"Over the last few decades, accepted therapeutic uses of amphetamines have become rare and as a result almost all countries in the world report declining medical use of such substances," the report found. "Not so the United States." American consumption of amphetamines for medical use is 10 times higher than in any European country, the narcotics board said.
The board said the issue of possible oversupply and overmedication with those drugs will be the focus of next year's annual report.

HEADLINE: Tickets: In Line or Online?

BYLINE: By CAROL FLAKE CHAPMAN 

 BODY:
LAST year, if you had set out to buy tickets to a hot event like a World Series game, a Backstreet Boys concert or the local premiere of "Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace," chances are you would have joined in the traditional rituals of ticket buying: the around-the-block line, the stampede or the keypad race to get through on the telephone.
Even though the lottery system now commonly used for selling tickets has helped reduce the number of all-night camp-outs at ticket windows, getting tickets to the most popular concerts, shows and sporting events remains a test of the will or the wallet. 
 Thanks to the Internet, however, any pain associated with buying entertainment tickets can be mostly a matter of the wallet. There are ticket vendors, auction markets and scalpers galore on the Web. And you can purchase tickets online for an amazing range of events and venues, from World Wrestling Federation matches and Nascar races to the Louvre, "The Lion King" and the San Diego Zoo.
Bypassing the box office to buy entertainment tickets online makes a lot of sense. It's not like buying books or clothing -- you don't need to glance at a book's cover and a few pages or finger the goods for texture, peruse them for style and find a certain color. You just need to know where you will be sitting and how much you will pay for the privilege. (If you're buying from an unlicensed broker, you also need to know that the tickets are legitimate. One way is to see if the seller is listed on the www.natb.org site of the National Association of Ticket Brokers.) Many sites now offer not only seating charts but also photos that show your actual vantage point. And of course, there's the convenience factor, which is particularly important when the event you will be attending is out of town.
Not surprisingly, the sale of entertainment tickets has become one of the fastest-growing segments of electronic commerce. In 1999, online brokers sold some $300 million worth of tickets. According to Forrester Research, the market is expected to grow to nearly $4 billion by 2004.
The Internet has been a boon to traditional vendors like Ticketmaster, the giant of the ticketing business, which sells online through a separate company called Ticketmaster Online-City Search. The percentage of the company's total sales attributed to online transactions has been growing steadily, from 12 percent in the second quarter of 1999 to 18 percent in the last quarter.
Some places and artists sell tickets through their own Web sites, allowing fans to avoid extra fees. Last year, for example, the Cranberries sold tickets to some of their shows exclusively on their Web site. A growing number of classical music and dance companies, like the New York City Ballet, the Houston Opera and the San Francisco Symphony, are also selling tickets through their own sites.
For smaller performing groups, though, the high cost of software or technical support can be prohibitive. (Selling tickets online usually requires an electronic sales-tracking system.) Nor can smaller groups afford the kinds of links and advertising they need on the Web to reach a wide audience. As a result, most entertainment tickets are sold online through sites operated by large vendors like Ticketmaster Online. The brokers connect the organizations or venues selling the tickets to the brokers' systems through either equipment established on site at each vendor's place of business or through Web-based systems that allow access by vendors using Web browsers.
Although the Web would seem to offer opportunities for cutting costs, online brokers' fees are seldom cheaper than those than tacked on at regular outlets.
Ticketmaster Online has said that ticket buyers will soon be able to print their tickets at home after buying them online. These tickets, which will be letter-size sheets of paper imprinted with bar codes, will be accepted in place of traditional tickets.
Just about any printer will be adequate, said Tom Stockham, a spokesman for Ticketmaster.com, and if the paper jams, the ticket can be printed out again. You won't be able to use the same ticket more than once, however, because the system allows only the first person who shows up with the encoded ticket to get in.
The system may deter scalpers from using it to buy tickets, Mr. Stockham said, because it will be harder to convince buyers that a sheet of paper with a few lines on it is a real ticket.
While Ticketmaster Online continues to dominate the Web-ticketing business for live events, a number of competitors have cropped up, including fast-growing Tickets.com, which recently announced that it would be the online broker for tickets to the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Tickets.com offers tickets from some 4,000 venues worldwide. It also offers links to events and venues for which it does not act as broker.
"We'll connect any consumer to any event," said Tim Kelly, the company's president.
The company, which came under fire from competitors for offering tickets to some high-demand events at high resale prices , is phasing out its site's links to so-called secondary-market sellers, Mr. Kelly said.
The online movie-ticket business is also about to experience some competitive jostling. A new company called MovieTickets.com is set to challenge Moviefone, which has been the dominant online seller for film tickets. MovieTickets, a joint venture between AMC Entertainment and Hollywood.com, has announced that it will begin selling tickets online during the Memorial Day weekend.
There is also room in the Web ticket market, it seems, for the niche seller -- the gatherer of "low-hanging fruit," as Andrew Dreskin, president of TicketWeb, put it. TicketWeb, which began in 1995, established itself as an alternative broker with tickets to trendy nightclubs, festivals and such oddball events as the Burning Man Festival, which centers on a wooden statue of a man that is set on fire on the last day. Its fees are considerably lower than Ticketmaster's, partly because its ticket-selling clients tap into the system online and do not need any special software to use TicketWeb's servers and database. The company has been growing at a rate of 400 percent a year, Mr. Dreskin said, and it has gathered a number of prestigious clients, like the Louvre.
Another company called CultureFinder, which went online mainly as a search engine for cultural events, has grown into a major source for buying tickets to museums, concerts and shows. CultureFinder.com is particularly useful for travelers. The site offers comprehensive listings of events, including free events, as well as nutshell descriptions of the offerings. Users of CultureFinder purchase tickets online and pick them up at the box office.
Anyone searching for tickets to a hot attraction will probably be out of luck using a regular online broker. "One of the things that doesn't work well online is selling tickets for big events," like Super Bowl games or Backstreet Boys concerts, said Seema Williams of Forrester Research. "They sell out in minutes, and the volume is so high their systems can't handle it." And that is where the resale, or secondary, online market comes in. Such sites have proliferated, although some states, including New York, have strict regulations regarding scalping.
While the authorities in New York and elsewhere have recently cracked down on ticket brokers who skim tickets to sell on the secondary market, Web scalping has remained something of a gray area. The eBay auction site recently incorporated state laws into its requirements for selling entertainment tickets. For example, eBay forbids resales of tickets at prices more than $2 above their face value for any entertainment event held in New York. For events held in Louisiana, in case you are looking for something to do at Mardi Gras, the allowed markup above face value is zero.
Such restrictions do not seem to faze online resellers like Frontrow.com, Tixx.com or Ticket Dog. For them, the sky seems to be the limit on prices (for sky box tickets, you might as well be buying tickets to the moon). People who wanted tickets to this year's Kentucky Derby could have joined Millionaire's Row, courtesy of the online scalpers, for a minimum of $4,000 -- or waited until the day of the Derby, when they could buy tickets to the infield at the gate for $35 apiece.
 
Strategies
Looking for Deals While Looking Out
 Here are tips for online tickets.
Try searching for tickets on your favorite search engine by typing in "tickets" and adding the name of the show, artist or sports team you're looking for. (Example: "tickets Spurs" or "tickets Springsteen.") You'll get a range of sellers, some legitimate and some scalpers.
Check out the Web sites devoted to your team, musician or group. A number of sites devoted to rock groups have areas for ticket trading, and you might get lucky. But be aware that those sites are often invaded by scalpers.
To save money on shipping and extra fees, buy from a broker working directly with the venue, so you can pick up your tickets there. You'll usually need to present the credit card you used to purchase the tickets.
If you're not sure about a broker's reliability, check with the National Association of Ticket Brokers (www.natb.org) to see if the broker is listed and if the broker is bonded. If you're buying tickets on eBay, you can check the seller's customer feedback rating. Check eBay's rules on selling tickets; scalping may be regulated in your area.
Check the location of the tickets offered for sale against a seating chart (usually available on the venue's or broker's site).
If you're buying high-demand tickets online, find out when the tickets go on sale (often it's Saturday morning). Go to the broker's Web site ahead of time and fill out the order form. Be ready to hit the button again and again until you get through. Be prepared to be disappointed.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Kuwait Is Said to Be Opposed To U.S. Effort to Cut Oil Prices

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Feb. 23

 BODY:
A consensus on the need for lower or stable oil prices is slowly building among some leading producers, but resistance to the Clinton administration's campaign for increased oil supplies and lower prices is coming not only from Algeria and Iran, but from a traditional Middle East ally, Kuwait.
According to American and Arab oil officials, Kuwait, which controls 9 percent of the world's reserves and has considerable ability to produce more oil, apparently remains opposed to the administration's view that the recent run-up in prices to the highest in nearly a decade will cause inflationary pressures that threaten global economic growth. 
 The Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, in the sixth day of his 10-day tour of some of the largest oil producers, picked up strong support here from Egypt. After Mr. Richardson met today in the Egyptian capital with President Hosni Mubarak and Sameh Fahmy, Egypt's minister of petroleum, Mr. Fahmy said current prices were too high and had to come down.
"If we don't take the price down, everything will go up," said Mr. Fahmy, speaking in English to Egyptian and American businessmen. An inflationary spiral now, Mr. Fahmy said, would jeopardize Egypt's development plans as well as its economic overhaul and privatization. What the United States is promoting, Mr. Fahmy said, would result in "a balanced situation for everybody."
In Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, oil ministers from the four-member Gulf Cooperation Council pledged today to work with other producers to create a predictable oil market to avoid "harming the world economy."
But the ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, which together produce about half the daily output of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, did not say they would do this by releasing more oil.
The absence of such a statement, coupled with the refusal of the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, to answer reporters' questions about whether production would be raised, led to speculation on the oil markets that the group could not reach a consensus on strategy.
This in turn, helped pushed up oil prices today. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, prices rose 47 cents, to $29.39 a barrel. Prices reached a nine-year high of $30.45 last week.
Kuwait's reported resistance to what is said to be an emerging majority view among its fellow OPEC members also annoyed Clinton administration officials in Washington, as well as Mr. Richardson's energy team, which is expected to arrive in Kuwait on Thursday.
In an interview today, Mr. Richardson said he was extremely pleased with Egypt's support. Asked about the the Gulf Cooperation Council's ambiguous statement, he called it "responsible," adding that it was "heading in the right direction." He declined to elaborate.
Other administration officials who had hoped that the cooperation council would be more decisive about increasing production to lower prices were clearly irritated by what they described as Kuwait's continuing hard-line stance, particularly in view of the American-led military effort nine years ago to liberate Kuwait from Iraq's occupation.
"That's gratitude for you," said one American oil expert, who insisted on not being identified.
A hard-line stance on prices by Kuwait is also likely to infuriate Capitol Hill. At a hearing last week, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, the Republican chairman of the House International Relations Committee, urged the Clinton administration to cut off military assistance to OPEC nations that refused to help reduce oil prices. "The people in the Northeast are facing a major crisis in the cost of home heating oil," Mr. Gilman said.
Pressed today to say what oil price he was seeking from the countries he called "good friends of the United States" -- Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- Mr. Richardson demurred. "Thirty dollars a barrel is too high," he said. "And $10 is too low."
"We're not trying to be greedy," he added, saying that it should be market forces that determine price. "We're trying to do what is in everyone's best interest," he said.

HEADLINE: Threat Seen To Trade Deal To Let China Join W.T.O.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Two supporters of China's entry into the World Trade Organization warned the White House today that the administration is in imminent danger of seeing its huge trade initiative die, partly because of Beijing's threats to Taiwan and because Vice President Al Gore appears to have cold feet about the deal.
In a heated exchange before the Senate Finance Committee, the chairman of the panel, Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, said today that recent comments by Mr. Gore "raise serious questions about the administration's commitment to getting this deal done and the legislation passed." Speaking at a meeting of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last week, Mr. Gore promised to negotiate stronger protections for workers' rights and the environment if elected president. 
 The ranking minority member of the committee, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, was even harsher in his assessment of how the administration has handled an agreement on which much of the United States-China relationship now hinges.
The administration, he said, has not yet sent a bill to Congress to grant China permanent "normal" trade status -- the one American concession in an accord that opens China's markets.
"The administration has to know that they have to get this thing done in two to four weeks," Senator Moynihan said in an interview this afternoon, describing a timetable for a vote far speedier than what the White House is considering. "After that this whole thing is in jeopardy."
White House officials say they disagree and want a vote before the summer. But the timetable is partly up to the Republicans, and administration officials met today with Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader.
President Clinton has begun a lobbying campaign on the China deal, meeting members of Congress in small groups in the yellow Oval Room in the White House residence, and will speak on the issue on Thursday morning in front of the Business Council, a group of 75 business leaders.
The White House insists that it can win passage of the deal by relying on the support of Republicans, and by winning over 70 to 90 Democrats. But it is far from clear they will get that support.
Democrats, pressured by labor's opposition to the trade deal, are far more leery. Mr. Gore promised last week to get labor and environmental protections into a subsequent agreement with China, but Senator Moynihan said today "the Chinese won't sign that deal, so we won't have any future trade agreements."
Mr. Gore's comments put the White House in what one administration official said this week was "an intellectually indefensible position." By suggesting that he would press for a better deal later, Mr. Gore gave political cover to those Democrats who want to skip the vote this year. And plenty want to do exactly that, after the unions have made clear that they will work to defeat, district by district, members of Congress who vote for the China agreement.
This week China also made passage more complex. Its 11,000 word report on Taiwan, released on Monday, suggested that Beijing would feel free to use military force to reunify the mainland with the Republic of China if negotiations with Taiwan drag on for too long. That drew a sharp response from the Pentagon and from conservative Republicans who see China as an emerging security threat to the United States.
The result is a bizarre political alliance between conservatives in Congress and labor and environmental groups opposed to the China deal.
In testimony before the Finance Committee today, Charlene Barshefsky, the American trade representative, made no direct references to either Mr. Gore or the threats against Taiwan. She told Mr. Roth and Mr. Moynihan that she was testifying "with the full support of the administration."
But she also argued that while Congress could debate the issue endlessly, it really had no choice other than to sign on to the deal -- or risk putting American firms at a huge competitive disadvantage in the world's largest and fastest-growing market.
Clearly, though, the administration is going to have to give ground to its critics. Some supporters of the trade organization deal say that may mean approving more arms for Taiwan -- which enrages Beijing -- or may mean finding a way to enforce Chinese compliance with the deal that would appease the critics.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Warns of Big Shortfalls and Cutbacks in Mayor's 4-Year Budget

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's four-year spending plan leaves New York City with dangerously large budget gaps that could force layoffs and cuts in city services after the mayor leaves office, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said yesterday.
The comptroller's sharply worded warning and the mayor's quick dismissal of it yesterday afternoon as groundless and politically motivated represent the latest in a series of skirmishes between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Hevesi, who is considering running for mayor. 
 The problem with the mayoral spending plan, the comptroller said, is that it relies far too heavily on one-time revenue sources that will disappear if the economy falters. The mayor, for example, wants to use Wall Street-fueled surpluses accumulated over the last four years in the city's pension funds to help balance budgets in the next two years.
"It is a mistake," Mr. Hevesi said. "This boom isn't going to last."
The comptroller, a Democrat, did offer the Republican mayor some good news. With the city's economy still charging ahead, at least for now, the surplus will probably be even larger than the mayor expects by the time the current fiscal year ends on June 30: it will total $2.46 billion, or nearly 7 percent of the $37.4 billion budget, the comptroller predicted.
But by the 2002 fiscal year, the city may face a $2.5 billion deficit, Mr. Hevesi said, in large part because of tax cuts the mayor has proposed. The comptroller said the cuts were more generous than the city could afford.
That shortfall could reach as much as $4.1 billion by 2004, a total that is 63 percent higher than the amount Mr. Giuliani has predicted, Mr. Hevesi said. Even when using the mayor's projection, the deficit would exceed deficit predictions issued at comparable times during the Dinkins and Koch administrations, the comptroller said. These budget gaps are so large, Mr. Hevesi said, that the next mayor may be forced to lay off teachers or cut city services to balance the budget.
"What is lacking here is long-term planning," Mr. Hevesi said. "It is a very, very serious problem."
Mr. Giuliani ridiculed the comptroller's remarks, suggesting at his own afternoon news conference that Mr. Hevesi had proved over the last six years that he was incapable of issuing an accurate budget analysis. Prudent fiscal management, the mayor said, has allowed his administration to cut taxes while still generating record surpluses. "We've accomplished a turnaround in the economy of the city, and I would suspect that the comptroller, not having been part of that, is probably a little jealous of that," Mr. Giuliani said.
As the comptroller and the mayor disagreed over New York's finances, the city's Independent Budget Office issued a report yesterday showing that New York City's tax burden, as of 1997, was 79 percent higher than the average burden of the nine next largest cities in the nation. The study found that $7.99 worth of every $100 in household income or business profits in New York City goes to the local government as taxes, compared with an average of $4.47 for the nine other cities.
Part of the reason for the higher New York City tax burden is that New York pays a much larger share of Medicaid and welfare costs than the other cities. City tax cuts adopted in the last two years also are not reflected in the study. Even when these factors are taken into account, New York City's tax burden remains higher than the tax burden for the other nine cities, said Andrew S. Rein, associate director of the Independent Budget Office.
Mr. Hevesi said that he had supported tax cuts adopted by the mayor and the City Council over the last several years and that he supports a number of the new tax-cut measures the mayor is advocating. The question, Mr. Hevesi said, is whether the city can afford them all at once.
"You have got to be judicious," Mr. Hevesi said.

Nasdaq in Record Gain to New High, but Blue Chips Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The technology-laden Nasdaq stock index soared 168.21 points yesterday -- its biggest point gain ever -- more than offsetting the losses it incurred in the two preceding sessions and surpassing the high it had set just last week.
But in another sharp divergence between the performance of the high-technology sector and most other stocks, 20 of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average fell -- 10 of them by more than a dollar -- to push the blue-chip gauge down 79.11 points, to 10,225.73, its fourth loss in five sessions. 
 The bullish technology tone was set early, analysts said, when Merrill Lynch strongly recommended eBay, the Internet auction house, and America Online, whose deal to acquire Time Warner has met skepticism in various quarters.
Then, in an appearance before Congress, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, seemed to dispel some fears he aroused last week that he was focusing on stock prices in an effort to cool an overheated economy that might cause inflation to pick up.
"I think it was a big relief rally" for buyers of growth stocks, said Matthew W. Johnson, head of Nasdaq trading at Lehman Brothers. "He didn't drop another shoe."
Mr. Johnson also pointed to heavy buying of Cisco Systems and Qualcomm stocks by index funds needing to add shares to conform with rebalanced index weightings.
Ebay surged 20 7/16 a share, to 154 15/16; America Online 7 7/16, to 57 3/16; Cisco 14 11/16, to 138 5/8; and Qualcomm 16 5/16, to 146 7/8.
"There's only one game for the portfolio manager" these days, said Richard E. Cripps, chief equity strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore. "He can't afford to be in anything that's not showing great relative strength."
And when technology stocks took off, many traders who had bet that the declines of Friday and Tuesday would continue were driven to cover their short positions, buying back shares they had borrowed and sold.
The Nasdaq composite index finished at 4,550.33, up 3.84 percent, with the 168.21-point gain slightly greater than the previous one-day record of 167.05 points on Jan. 10.
Technology also lifted the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which climbed 8.52 points, to 1,360.69, even though 350 of its component issues fell while only 140 rose.
As for the Dow, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, I.B.M., Merck and Honeywell all lost more than 2 points a share to lead its retreat. The only issues to gain more than a point were Intel, up 2 5/16 a share, to 109 1/16; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up 2 3/16, to 92 5/16; and Hewlett-Packard, up 2 1/4, to 130 3/4.
Henry Blodget, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, initiated coverage of eBay with a buy rating, saying that the stock could reach 175 a share within 12 to 18 months; it wound up moving about halfway there yesterday. Mr. Blodget and another Merrill analyst said America Online "seems undervalued by almost any measure."
Concerning Mr. Greenspan's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee the Fed chief said that among other things, he agreed with those analysts who see no evidence of revived inflation. "I cannot find it, no matter where I look," he declared.
He also said, "the basic purpose of what we are trying to do is to sustain this extraordinary recovery, this extraordinary acceleration in growth and a vibrant labor market."
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones 1,764 to 1,258, with 219 stocks setting new 52-week lows and only 47 reaching new highs. Volume remained heavy, with 994 million shares traded.

Treasury Prices Drop
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday, as investors took profits to make room for new supply and technology shares surged after several jittery sessions in the stock market.
Dealers said Treasuries were taking their cue from equity markets, which were recovering after last week's declines on rate worries.
"It's a little bit of an unwind" from earlier run-ups in bond prices, said Richard Gilhooly, fixed-income strategist at the Paribas Corporation. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 18/32, to 101 24/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.12 percent from 6.08 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: It Blocks Cat Odors, And Maybe Radiation;
Material Used in Litter Is Tested In Sopping Up Nuclear Contaminants

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: WEST VALLEY, N.Y.

 BODY:
Here at the opposite end of New York State from the site of the Indian Point nuclear accident on Feb. 15 lies one of the country's biggest radioactive stains, left behind at a long-mothballed recycling plant for spent nuclear fuel rods.
An army of nearly 1,000 scientists and engineers has spent 18 years and $1.5 billion so far on a cleanup involving custom-designed robots and remote-controlled ovens that bake liquid wastes into solid glass cylinders. 
 Now they are testing the ultimate in low technology: a mineral better known as a prime ingredient in cat litter.
Federal and state energy experts and a task force of residents are closely watching the project, which involves digging a deep trench and burying a wall of zeolite -- the same stuff found in millions of cat boxes -- to sop up radioactive material tainting the ground water. The contaminant is seeping toward a stream that feeds Lake Erie.
"There are an awful lot of things that are simple that turn out better," said Joe Patti, the owner of a West Valley hardware store and a member of the task force. "It's too early to say whether it's going to work, but if they don't try to do something, we're going to have a problem."
Zeolite is actually a family of 48 minerals that absorb odors and moisture. They are commonly found in many varieties of animal litter, and it turns out that the most abundant one, clinoptilolite, has a strong affinity for strontium 90, the radioactive isotope that tainted ground water beneath the plant when acid ate through a concrete and steel foundation several decades ago.
Some scientists and officials involved in the test are eager to play down the latest strategy's quirky pedigree.
"Zeolites are used for all kinds of things, and one of those markets happens to be cat litter," said Alan J. Rabideau, an associate professor of engineering at the State University at Buffalo who ran the laboratory studies and is monitoring the pilot project.
At the university and the West Valley plant site, the cat litter connection has often dominated discussions, he said, adding, "That has sort of trivialized the science."
After Dr. Rabideau's lab tests in the spring of 1999 were successful, cleanup managers began a field test of the buried zeolite wall in December. The 3,300-acre West Valley site sits on a rural, windswept slope 30 miles south of Buffalo.
If the test goes as planned, for at least the next 25 years the porous mineral wall, 30 feet across and 26 feet deep, will act like a giant molecular sieve, letting water flow downhill but capturing any strontium 90 molecules.
The method could not only be expanded at the West Valley site, but could also help restore water quality at many other nuclear waste sites, federal energy officials said. The approach could sharply reduce the need for costly pumping systems for treating ground water.
Results should be evident by the spring, said Beth A. Fallon, the project manager for West Valley Nuclear Services, a subsidiary of Westinghouse that is handling the cleanup for the Department of Energy and the state, which owns the land.
The state built the fuel-processing plant in the early 1960's in hopes that the emergent atomic power industry would revive the economy of western New York. But the plant ran for only six years, from 1966 to 1972, chopping up spent fuel rods and extracting uranium and plutonium in acid baths. The process left all manner of radioactive residue above and in the ground.
Over all, the underground strontium leak, totaling about 200 curies of radiation, represents a minuscule fraction of the contamination at the West Valley site, which harbors 30 million curies.
(A curie is the amount of radiation given off by one gram of radium. The 12 radium dots on the dials of the radium watches popular in the 1920's emitted about three one-thousandths of a curie of radiation. By comparison, the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant released about 50 curies into the air; Chernobyl released tens of millions of curies. And if any radiation escaped in the brief puff of steam and gas that was released from the Indian Point 2 reactor in Westchester County on Feb. 15, engineers say it would have been measurable only in millionths of a curie, if that.)
About two-thirds of the radioactive waste at the West Valley site has been contained in the solid glass blocks, but the remaining waste includes radioactive sludge in rusting underground tanks and the contents of two nuclear waste dumps, which hold a melange of chopped-up casings for fuel rods, old gloves and other debris.
The underground plume of strontium was detected about seven years ago, Ms. Fallon said. The leak was stopped years ago, plant officials said, but the strontium has been slowly spreading ever since.
The leading edge of the 700-foot-long amoeba-shaped plume -- which is spreading downhill from the old factory -- has approached the surface of the gravelly soil in some places and, if nothing is done, could eventually make its way into several creeks and possibly Lake Erie, the officials said.
Private environmental groups, the nearby Seneca Indian Nation and neighboring towns have long been concerned about that possibility.
Several years ago, West Valley Nuclear Services began drilling wells and pumping the contaminated water through filters to capture the strontium 90, but the method costs nearly $400,000 a year and creates its own new batch of radioactive waste each time the filter material has to be replaced, Ms. Fallon said.
"In some ways," she said, "you're creating more of a problem than you're solving."
Two years ago, engineers began searching for an alternative and quickly focused on an emerging toxic cleanup method: allowing ground water to pass through underground berms of materials that can catch or break down hazardous chemicals. One variation of this technique, using buried walls of iron filings, is increasingly being used to remove harmful chlorinated solvents, like dry-cleaning fluid, from ground water.
Small tests of zeolite as a strontium snare at the nuclear site in Hanford, Wash., were successful, and the material has been used for decontamination at Chalk River, a nuclear site in Ontario. But Dr. Rabideau said the West Valley test was the first large-scale effort to use the mineral in a completely passive way.
Engineers hope that the zeolite will not have to be replaced for a relatively long time, eliminating the need for frequent pumping and treating of ground water, and for the disposal of newly created radioactive waste. And over time, the strontium will decay and lose much of its radioactivity.
The project is still in its early stages. Water samples are taken every other week, Ms. Fallon said, and by March the team should have enough preliminary data to see if the project is working. The goal is to see a rise in concentrations of strontium in the wall, and a drop in the ground water downstream.
Not everyone is enthusiastic about the mineral wall. Ray Vaughan, who lives halfway between the plant and Buffalo and has been tracking the cleanup for 22 years as a member of several community groups and the citizens' task force, said the test "appears to be a useful idea."
But he added that he and other residents wanted the cleanup to proceed as rapidly as possible. They think that it has to include pumping and treating of the most heavily contaminated water from the center of the plume.
A formal report on the test is to be issued in late spring, Ms. Fallon said, adding that if it works, the wall will be extended for about 100 feet to intercept the leading edge of the entire plume. The total cost is expected to be less than $1.5 million, she said, far less than it would cost to continue pumping and treating the water year after year.
If the technique catches on, it will mean a new line of business for Glen and Marie Teague, who own the mine in eastern Oregon that supplied the mineral being used for the test -- at $180 a ton.
Mrs. Teague said she and her husband sold their zeolite mainly as an additive for poultry and livestock feed -- it improves the health of the animals by absorbing some toxins -- and as a deodorizer for horse stalls.
And, of course, as cat litter. The Teagues sell it in 40-pound sacks.

At a defunct nuclear fuel recycling plant near Buffalo, a pilot project to clean up contaminated ground water is in progress. Zeolite, the same material used in many cat litters, will be used to form a permeable wall that engineers expect will decontaminate the ground water as it passes through.
 
The depth of the contaminated ground water ranges from the ground surface to about 26 feet below the surface.

HEADLINE: Feud Over How Port Authority Spends Money Creates an Impasse

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
When the 12-member board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey holds its monthly meeting today, the agenda will be limited to routine capital expenditures instead of the grand bridges, tunnels, airports and development projects the agency has pursued in its 79 years.
Such initiatives exist in abundance, but a long-simmering civil war between New York and New Jersey members has made agreement on them impossible. As a result, the agency has all but halted for the last year actions that could generate billions of dollars from such things as the privatization of the World Trade Center, the leasing of air rights over the Port Authority Bus Terminal and the approval of a long-term lease meant to keep the container terminal at Port Elizabeth competitive with other East Coast ports. 
 Historians, former agency officials and some board members call the stalemate the worst in the history of the agency, which is the nation's oldest congressionally approved compact between two states.
The current impasse grows out of a squabble between New York and New Jersey about the allocation of Port Authority expenditures, which have amounted to $14 billion over the years. As a complicating sidelight, the agency has become the target of New York City's mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. While other mayors have silently suffered the Port Authority's presence in their midst, Mr. Giuliani has publicly lacerated it as an unaccountable and unnecessary anachronism that ought to be dismantled.
Contributing to the situation is the makeup of the board, which is top- heavy with members politically tied to the two governors.
The result has crippled the authority and significantly dimmed its reputation as a businesslike body able to rise above politics and bureaucratic red tape to get things done.
The port agency's board has met only five times in the last 10 months, with New York members actually boycotting the December meeting. A repeat of such acrimonious tactics is not likely today, said Charles A. Gargano, the vice chairman and a New York representative. But he added: "There are minor things on the agenda, and none of our major resolutions. So the impasse continues."
Already, internal efforts to sort out differences have slowed to a crawl, said the chairman, Lewis M. Eisenberg, a New Jersey appointee, and some other top officials have openly talked of the need for an outside study to see if major changes must be made in the compact or whether alternatives to the agency are needed.
The agency was created in 1921 to coordinate the two states' transportation and port projects and enhance commerce in the metropolitan region. The authority built and operates all of the tunnel and bridge crossings between New Jersey and New York City, manages airports and seaports in both states, operates the PATH rapid transit system and owns the World Trade Center.
The argument about the share of expenditures in each state is a complicated one, depending largely on how benefit is defined and how the spending is categorized.
One such accounting by staff members at the agency was based on each project's location and whether it was a transportation link between the two states. The study found that between 1928 and 1998, 43 percent of the capital spending had been in New York, 27 percent in New Jersey and 29 percent on interstate linkages.
New York disputes this accounting while New Jersey generally agrees with it. And Mr. Gargano notes that it fails to take into account the agency's continued subsidizing of such money-losing interstate operations as the PATH trains and the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, which together lost $234 million last year alone -- expenditures that New York representatives insist disproportionately benefit New Jersey.
The focus of the impasse is a dispute over a 30-year lease between the port agency and Sealand Maersk to operate a major containerized cargo terminal at Port Elizabeth. New York commissioners charge that it amounts to yet another deeply subsidized project benefiting an operation based in New Jersey.
New Jersey and authority staff disagree and say that the lease arrangement and its attendant dredging and channel-widening is crucial to maintaining the region's competitiveness and thousands of jobs in New Jersey and New York.
Mr. Eisenberg, at the direction of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, has, in drafting the agenda for recent meetings, insisted that the port lease be approved as part of a package that includes items such as the World Trade Center privatization effort and the bus terminal air rights that are important to New York commissioners. Mr. Gargano and his other New York members, acting at the direction of Gov. George E. Pataki, have refused to approve the package.
In a letter sent yesterday to Governor Pataki, Governor Whitman noted the long-pending Sealand Maersk lease as well as her support of projects in the agency's pending budget that are in New York and "will benefit the Port Authority and the region." She called on Governor Pataki to "respect the need to proceed with all of these projects."
Behind the conciliatory tones, said one New Jersey official, was actually a threat by Governor Whitman to add the agency's entire capital budget to the current bargaining over the Port Elizabeth lease.
In the past, when parochialism or politics reared its head within the agency, the independent business people on the board or its professional staff, which was insulated from patronage and political pressures, could be counted on to resolve things, said Robert Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group specializing in transportation and planning issues.
In extreme cases, he said, public bickering was short-circuited: the governors of the two states could be counted on to sit down behind closed doors to compromise.
But today, the 12-member board is largely dominated by cabinet members or top aides of the two governors. And the voice of Robert E. Boyle, the current executive director and an appointee of Governor Pataki, is often not as loud and authoritative as those of other important New York appointees, like Mr. Gargano, head of the Empire State Development Corporation, and Brad Race, Mr. Pataki's chief of staff.
Mr. Yaro said distrust between the governors had grown so intense that they had not met to discuss port issues since 1997, and more recent meetings between their respective chiefs of staff had proven futile. In short, he said, there is "no shared strategic vision" for the agency.
Stanley Brezenoff, who served as executive director of the port agency from 1990 to 1995, had a similar assessment. "You go through the Sturm und Drang but you get to a point where people can sit down and reason together," he said. "But now these disputes seem to go on and on."
Not since the early 1970's, when New Jersey Gov. William T. Cahill refused to approve the agency's minutes and effectively stopped all its activity, have things been so paralyzed, said Jameson W. Doig, a Princeton University historian whose book on the agency is due out this year. But even then, Mr. Cahill was acting as the consummate cosmopolite, trying to pressure New York and the board into paying more attention to regional mass transit issues. He and Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a fellow Republican, eventually met secretly and negotiated a compromise.
"But everything is emerging in the public eye now and governors are digging in their heels," Professor Doig said. "In the last seven years or so I see Governor Pataki as the one who seems to care much less about regional growth issues. Whitman's problem is less a lack of understanding of those issues but a failing to take a strong position for the integrity of the Port Authority."
Professor Doig also took note of the silence from business and corporate interests on the stalemate and termed it "puzzling."
It is on this point that many cite the "Mayor Giuliani effect."
One official of a civic group who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that business leaders in the city who would have spoken up for the port agency in the past have been afraid to now for fear of antagonizing the mayor. "Any support of ending the impasse at the agency might be seen by the mayor as giving aid and comfort to an entity that he would just as soon see disappear from the face of the earth," the official said.
The dispute at the Port Authority comes at a time when the agency is more flush with cash than at any time in its history. Spurred by operating efficiencies and a racing economy, revenues from everything from tolls to airport activity have ballooned cash to $2.6 billion in 1998 from $1.5 billion in 1996, according to agency financial statements.
Mr. Yaro and others suggested that this factor might explain some current maneuvering and tactics. Both Republican governors have cut taxes, limiting the money available for new capital projects. Consequently, he said, the port agency's resources, are "very attractive" to both governors.
The situation sets up a competition for money that would seem to be the antithesis of real regionalism. But the agency is not new to open horse trading. Over the years, it has created "development banks," or pools of money derived from excess revenues and divided it between the states. The two governors saw it as a way to get a direct benefit from Port Authority projects.
Some see that idea -- quietly providing extra funds to both states -- as a way to defuse the current situation. But others say the hard feelings run so deep that no easy resolution is in sight.
New York commissioners, said Mr. Eisenberg, seem to be nursing an unfounded grievance that they lost out in agency spending. And New Jersey commissioners, said Mr. Gargano, cannot seem to move on any project without "orders from Trenton."

HEADLINE: Will Inquiry's Shadow Chill Art Auctions?

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
As the world's two dominant auction houses find themselves embroiled in a widening federal antitrust investigation, experts at both are racing to get major property for their important spring auctions.
Time is running out. With the deadlines less than a month away for printing catalogs for sales that could exceed $500 million, collectors must decided whether to sell a $5 million Picasso now or wait for the potentially market-weakening commotion to die down. 
 While officials at Christie's and Sotheby's say they will have plenty of interesting and expensive art to offer in New York and London in May and June, dealers and others in the art world say there is bound to be an effect on the auctions. These people say that some pieces could be withheld by nervous sellers and that there is likely to be more haggling than usual over commissions.
"I don't think it's good for anybody," said Alex Apsis, a partner in the gallery C & M Arts in Manhattan and a former head of the Impressionist and modern art department at Sotheby's in New York.
He said that while he did not think the investigation would affect art prices, it might make it harder for both houses to get property to sell.
Still, in one way the houses are oddly blessed. Debt, death and divorce have traditionally kept them in business, but this spring with a robust economy and few estates available, there is a dearth of powerhouse collections whose withdrawal could severely damage the season. Certainly, there are no estates with sales potential that can match the collection of Victor and Sally Ganz, which was auctioned by Christie's three years ago for $206.5 million.
This makes Sotheby's and Christie's more reliant on so-called discretionary sellers, who may choose to sell only a piece or two. Still, given the investigations, shake-ups in the leaderships of both houses and a change in the commission structure at Christie's, some such sellers appear to be having second thoughts.
"I got a call from a collector in California who was planning to sell several million dollars worth of pictures who said to me, 'I'm scared -- what should I do,' " said a prominent Manhattan dealer who insisted on anonymity because of his relationships with both houses. "I do think this is going to hurt the spring sales."
Not everyone agrees. James Goodman, another Manhattan dealer, said he had not heard from any concerned collectors, nor did he think the recent problems would hamper sales. But, he added, the scandal is likely to affect commissions.
"There will be all kinds of negotiations," Mr. Goodman said.
Commissions are at the core of the inquiry. It is suspected that the two houses colluded to fix commissions, leaving all but a select few buyers and sellers with no room to negotiate rates. Neither house has admitted or denied the accusations in public statements, and both say they are cooperating with prosecutors.
Because the two houses sell more than $4 billion of merchandise a year globally, the amount in extra commissions they could have amassed the last several years could easily be tens of millions of dollars.
After Christie's announced that it was cooperating with the inquiry, it changed its commission structure to favor sellers more than do the rates Sotheby's still posts.
Both houses are trying to put a good face on the situation. "Nothing has been put off track by these events," said David Norman, who runs Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department in New York.
He said sellers were eager to take advantage of the recent high prices. So far, he said, the company had concluded deals to sell works like a $6 million Modigliani, and an equally valued Cezanne landscape. He said Sotheby's would also compete aggressively with Christie's new commission structure by negotiating rates with valued clients.
Franck Giraud, head of Christie's 19th-century and 20th-century art department worldwide, said he had already put together strong sales for the spring."Certainly people are being more cautious," Mr. Giraud said.
But, he added: "At the end of the day the collectors are there, and the money is there. There's big money to be spent."

HEADLINE: BOXING;
Coley, Angry at Slights, Ready for De La Hoya

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH 

 BODY:
In case anybody was wondering, Derrell Coley is the man Oscar De La Hoya is fighting on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. From the billboards advertising the fight to the news conference announcing it, it has been all Oscar all the time.
"I've had it," said Coley as he stood off to the side while a mob of reporters three rows deep formed a semicircle in front of De La Hoya's table at a news conference at Madison Square Garden yesterday. "I'm sick of Oscar. I'm sick of Oscar being the man. I could go over there and choke him right now. 
 "I don't want anybody else to get rid of him. I want to get rid of him. I want to beat him up right now. I've been signed to destroy Oscar De La Hoya."
They will square off in the main event of a card that features a junior welterweight bout between Arturo Gatti (30-4) and Joey Gamache (55-3). The bouts, will be on HBO beginning at 9 p.m.
Coley's anger has been simmering since Dec. 1, when he set up training camp in Vero Beach, Fla. He missed the holidays with his family in Maryland. He trained three times a day, sometimes running as much as eight and a half miles a day. In between, he had plenty of time to nurse his dislike for De La Hoya.
It is genuine anger and frustration on the part of Coley, who has waited over a year as the No. 1 contender for his shot at a welterweight title. His opportunity arose because he was a convenient pawn in a chess match that has been going on since De La Hoya lost his World Boxing Council title to Felix Trinidad on Sept. 18. The rematch could not be made, so both sides went out and secured matches hoping the other side would get back to the bargaining table.
Neither side did, so now both the rebound matches -- De La Hoya versus Coley and Trinidad against David Reid -- are on in successive weeks, with Trinidad-Reid set for March 3 in Las Vegas. If not for that fact, Coley might have been waiting even longer. "It's nothing new," he said. "I've been at the bottom for a while. I've been frustrated and miserable. I've had bad fights. But I perform the way I feel, and I feel great for this fight."
Coley, 29, has felt betrayed at almost every turn of his career. He has been with some of the top promoters -- Main Events, Don King and now America Presents -- and yet his frustration has only mounted. He believes that De La Hoya and Trinidad have been ducking him, although it is doubtful that Trinidad, who isolates himself in Puerto Rico when he is not fighting, even knows who Coley is. De La Hoya said he did not know who Coley was until his promoter, Bob Arum, told him that Coley was the W.B.C.'s No. 1 contender and that they were trying to make the match.
Fred Sternberg, a publicist with America Presents, said he sent tapes of Coley to Arum's office a few years ago, so he is certain that Arum and De La Hoya are familiar with Coley.
Coley was reminded about the slight with the posters around town that bear only De La Hoya's likeness, and Sternberg said: "You've seen HBO's posters for the 'Titanic.' It's just the ship. But you know it ends in a disaster. Same here."
Coley's problem is simple. He is a good fighter without a big name, so the risk of fighting him far outweighed the paltry economic rewards for a fighter at the highest level of the game like De La Hoya. If De La Hoya did not need a splashy fight to get himself back into the welterweight championship picture, then Coley would not be on the menu for Saturday night.
Consider the list of fighters whom De La Hoya chose once he won the welterweight title from Pernell Whitaker: David Kamau, Hector Camacho, Wilfredo Rivera, an aging Julio Cesar Chavez and Patrick Charpentier, who astonishingly was a W.B.C. No. 1 contender. Looking at that list, it is easy to understand Coley's frustration.
Coley, and his manager, Barrett Linde, also feel betrayed by their promoter, Dan Goossen of America Presents. Linde laced into Goossen at the news conference yesterday, because he believes that Goossen tried to sandbag Coley in an effort to make a fight with Trinidad for David Reid, another of Goossen's clients. When it looked as though the W.B.C. would mandate that Trinidad defend the welterweight title against Coley, Goossen offered Coley $250,000 to step aside so that Trinidad could fight Reid. Coley and Linde then went into an alliance with Arum for a match with De La Hoya and Goossen relented to Coley's wishes to make the fight.
"Barry was outsmarted by Bob Arum," Goossen said, referring to Linde. "I was trying to maximize every possibility. I knew from the beginning that he would either fight Trinidad or De La Hoya. Trinidad was going up in weight and I knew that Oscar needed the fight because of the positioning in the W.B.C. I knew Arum didn't want to go to the W.B.O. But when Barry made a deal with Arum, he cut off the economic stream. Derrell could have made $2 million for this fight. Instead, he's getting $1 million."
Coley does not seem to mind that he is leaving money on the table and that he is not guaranteed the W.B.C. title even if he wins. He just wants to punish De La Hoya for all the waiting and all the slights, real and perceived.
Coley (34-1-2), a hard puncher with a good chin, is an accomplished boxer. His lone loss is to Oba Carr, a tough welterweight contender at the time that he defeated Coley. He will have to take his game to a higher level to bring De La Hoya down. Coley said he is up to the task.
"The last day of training, I cried like a baby," Coley said, "because I've never trained like that before to be in the best possible shape for the best fight of my career."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ISSUES;
2 Democrats Present Plans About Drugs And Workers

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Former Senator Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore paused in their attacks today to announce proposals for social programs.
Mr. Bradley proposed federally financed earnings insurance to compensate workers who take salary cuts as a result of global trade. 
 "We will not have true prosperity until all of our citizens share in the benefits of our growth," he said in an address at Columbia University.
In a speech that offered many economic policy positions but few details, Mr. Bradley also accused Mr. Gore, his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, of advocating the kinds of policies "that got us into the Great Depression."
Mr. Gore, with an eye on the growing budget surplus and the important elderly vote in Florida, today offered a proposal, based on an administration plan, to help people on Medicare pay for prescription drugs.
Mr. Bradley's address highlighted a political problem facing the two Democrats: both are strong advocates of free trade, and both are trying to win votes from union members and environmentalists who support sharp restrictions on trade.
Today, Mr. Bradley did not back away from his support for expanding global trade. But he argued that the best way to protect gains from free trade would be to buffer American workers from the worst side affects of global competition, including layoffs and declining wages.
"Our economic prosperity has been spectacular," Mr. Bradley said to more than 400 students, faculty members and supporters, a huge American flag draped behind him. "But despite all our success, far too many Americans are still on the outside looking in."
Mr. Bradley made his remarks as he was preparing to open a week-long stand in Washington, which holds a nonbinding primary on Feb. 29. Seattle was the site of fierce protests against the World Trade Organization when it met there last year, and opposition to expanding global trade seems to run strong among many Democrats in that state.
Mr. Bradley's proposal for earnings insurance would partly reimburse workers who lose employment because of trade agreements and then are hired into lower paying jobs. The program would compensate such workers for half their lost wages, up to a maximum of $10,000 a year, for up to three years. The intention would be to sustain them while they learned new skills.
For instance, a worker who lost a $45,000-a-year job and was rehired by another company for $25,000 would get $10,000 a year for three years. The program, which would not replace unemployment insurance, would cover only workers affected by new trade agreements, not existing ones. Mr. Bradley's aides said the program would cost $200 million a year and could be paid for out of the federal surplus.
The Gore campaign immediately distributed a news release saying Mr. Bradley had already spent all of the surplus on other proposed social programs, particularly his plan for near-universal health insurance. Mr. Bradley's aides contend the total price tag for his proposals is less than the non-Social Security surplus, projected to be nearly $2 trillion over the next decade.
But the Gore campaign said the surplus would pay the $35 billion, 10-year costs of its drug plan. For a $44 monthly premium, the plan would have Medicare pay half of an individual's drug costs of up to a $5,000 a year. After $4,000 in out-of-pocket costs, the government would pay for any additional prescription drugs, no matter how high the bill. Poorer Medicare recipients would pay no premium.
Mr. Bradley has proposed an optional prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients that would have a $500 deductible, $25 monthly premium and 25 percent co-payment fee.
In New York today, Mr. Bradley said of the Gore proposal: "It sounds vaguely familiar. It's my proposal."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: WASHINGTON STATE;
Confidence Restored, McCain Trumpets His Conservatism and Reaches Out

BYLINE: By DAVID BARSTOW 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 23

 BODY:
With two more primary victories under his belt, Senator John McCain campaigned across the Northwest today with restored confidence, proclaiming himself a "proud, pro-life conservative Republican" yet continuing his appeals to Democrats, independents, young people and minorities.
"The party of Abraham Lincoln," he told a group of college students today, "is a party of addition, and not division." 
 Mr. McCain repeatedly aimed his appeals at two fronts in a series of events across Washington State, one of three states with Republican primaries next Tuesday.
Concerned about his weak support among conservatives, he underscored his commitment to cherished Republican positions like reducing government spending, opposing abortion and strengthening the military. But, delighted with his backing from Democrats and independents, Mr. McCain reminded large, enthusiastic audiences of his terrifying experiences as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and of his "crusade" to show young people that public service is an honorable undertaking.
"The great thing about this victory yesterday," he said at Gonzaga University in Spokane, "was we have proved -- I hope to my Republican friends, and I believe to most Americans -- that we can reassemble a coalition, a coalition that reaches out across party lines, preserving our core with conservative Republican principles and yet attracting to our banner people who are independents, people who are Democrats, libertarians, vegetarians."
For his part, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas reached out to a wider audience than he normally does, visiting a privately financed social service center that helps provide food, clothing and educational assistance to people in inner-city Los Angeles. The Dream Center, as it is called, is a model for the governor's efforts to encourage private, faith-based involvement in social services.
Mr. Bush later held a news conference in which he belittled Mr. McCain's appeal during his victory speech for Republicans to support his campaign. "I was amazed last night to hear my opponent is reaching out to Republicans," he said. 'It's an amazing admission to make."
Mr. Bush also blamed the "liberal Democratic vote" for his eight-point loss in Michigan, and suggested that the Democrats who voted for Mr. McCain had tried to "hijack the primary to help Al Gore."
The governor added: "I didn't anticipate that nearly 20 percent of the Republican primary would be made up of, in many cases, liberal Democrats. I don't think anybody did. The only thing we need to do is rally our base and rally our support."
In his speeches today, Mr. McCain largely avoided mentioning Mr. Bush, instead aiming his fire at President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, just as Mr. Bush did after winning the South Carolina primary on Saturday.
But in interviews with reporters, Mr. McCain and his aides tried to pin Mr. Bush to the far right. Rarely did they utter Mr. Bush's name without mentioning his support from social conservatives like Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, or Mr. Bush's campaign appearance earlier this month at Bob Jones University in South Carolina.
Mr. McCain left open the possibility that his campaign would continue to place phone calls telling Roman Catholic voters that Bob Jones has made a series of anti-Catholic remarks. On Tuesday, as voters cast ballots in Michigan, Mr. Bush complained bitterly that people were receiving such calls, but the McCain campaign denied any involvement.
Only late Tuesday night did the campaign acknowledge making such calls, a point that Mr. Bush made today. "They admitted they were making those calls," he said. "I don't accept that kind of campaign. And I don't appreciate it one bit."
Although Mr. McCain has repeatedly promised not to run negative advertisements, he defended the phone calls today when he spoke to reporters on his campaign plane. "That was an accurate phone call," he said, jabbing the air for emphasis. "I didn't call anybody a bigot."
He was alluding to phone calls that Mr. Robertson, a Bush supporter, made to voters in Michigan in which he characterized former Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, a McCain supporter, as a "vicious bigot."
Yet just below the swagger, there was a palpable sense of relief in the McCain campaign. The magnitude of the loss in South Carolina last week had been stomach-churning, aides said, and Michigan had been viewed as a must-win state, which perhaps explains Mr. McCain's first reaction upon hearing himself declared the victor of Michigan on television.
"Phew," he said.
Mr. McCain flew first to Spokane today and then to Seattle, riding a crest of new enthusiasm and campaign contributions over the Internet. In Spokane, several hundred people stood outside the Gonzaga student union building because it was packed to capacity. When Mr. McCain waded though the crowd, people surged toward him, seeking his handshake or his autograph on campaign signs, books, newspapers, T-shirts and, inexplicably, a volume of Washington State statutes.
In Bremerton, a working-class town built around a naval shipyard on the edge of Puget Sound, more than 5,000 people showed up tonight for a McCain rally, one of the largest turnouts of any McCain campaign event. Hundreds of people waited as long as four hours, and when he departed after a brief speech in freezing rain several dozen people surrounded his bus and pounded on the windows to get his attention.
"You know what this is like?" asked Cindy McCain, the candidate's wife, "it's like traveling with Mick Jagger."
McCain strategists said today that one key to shoring up support from Republicans would be forceful reminders of Mr. McCain's conservative voting record on a wide range of economic and social issues.
"We have to do a better job of connecting the dots, and we will," said a senior strategist, John Weaver. "We have to remind Republicans of John McCain's life history, his record, his ties to Reagan."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: NEW YORK;
McCain Is Facing Labyrinth (a k a New York's Primary)

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain's victories in Michigan and Arizona have set the stage for the first contested statewide Republican primary in New York in 20 years. But Mr. McCain faces two problems as he turns his attention east: a contest closed to non-Republican voters and, yet again, an electoral system designed to assist the candidate favored by the Republican establishment, in this case, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
As a matter of his standing among rank-and-file Republican voters, Mr. McCain appeared to be in an unexpectedly strong position two weeks before the March 7 vote. A New York Times/CBS News poll of likely Republican primary voters in New York state, completed on Tuesday, before Mr. McCain's victories in Michigan and Arizona, found Mr. Bush with 43 percent and Mr. McCain with 36 percent. 
 The finding was particularly notable given that Mr. McCain succeeded in fighting his way onto the ballot, over the resistance of the state's Republican leadership, less than three weeks ago.
"I think we need some fresh blood in there," Connie Perez, 80, of Saratoga County, one of a number of Republican voters interviewed yesterday who said they were enchanted by the prospect of both a genuine Republican primary and Mr. McCain. "He's young, and he was in the war, which counts, and he's going to try new ideas, hopefully."
"He reminds me of Truman," said Angela DiMarino, a New Rochelle homemaker waiting to get her hair styled at an Eastchester salon. "He just brings something to the race."
But things are never that simple when it comes to elections in New York. Mr. McCain's supporters acknowledged that the labyrinthine, indirect primary system in New York threatened his hopes of a strong showing in a state which, ideologically, would seem somewhat partial to Mr. McCain's moderate and maverick appeal.
Primary voters on March 7 will not be voting directly for the candidates, but for six delegates and alternates whose names are emblazoned on the ballot. Names of the candidates and alternates whose names are emblazoned on the ballot. Names of the candidates are reduced to a small squibble below their delegates.
More significant, in terms of the emerging shape of this contest, Mr. Bush, with the support of Gov. George E. Pataki and almost the entire state Republican organization, has assembled delegate slates of state legislators, county executives and other well-known Republicans. Mr. McCain's volunteer organization in the state had to scramble to even find delegates in most districts, and most are largely unknown.
"The six Bush delegates are all friends of mine," said Richard N. Bond, the former Republican national chairman and veteran of New York politics. "The six McCain people are people I have never heard of. They are perfect strangers."
And it is not just a matter of being better known than the delegates supporting either Mr. McCain or a third candidate, Alan Keyes. As elected officials, the Bush delegates have an established network of supporters who will turn out the vote for them on March 7. And those delegates, no matter what they think of Mr. Bush, have a powerful incentive to win, to make sure there are seats for them at the Republican convention.
And as Mr. Bush's senior New York advisers nervously surveyed the upended landscape yesterday, that network stood out as perhaps Mr. Bush's single greatest defense.
"The most important factor is every single one of these people have got it on the line," William D. Powers, the state Republican chairman, said of the delegates vying to go to the convention. "And you know something? When you've got it on the line, you're going to work harder. They don't want to lose."
The other force working against Mr. McCain, Mr. Bush's supporters said yesterday, was that Republican primaries in New York are open only to Republican voters; Mr. McCain's victory in Michigan came with the help of independents and Democrats.
"If you look at Michigan, almost 70 percent of the Republicans voted for Bush," Mr. Pataki, who is serving as Mr. Bush's state chairman, said in an interview. "Here you're going to have Republicans voting in the Republican primary, which is the way it should be."
The Times/CBS News telephone poll, of 1,440 registered voters, was conducted from Feb. 16 to Tuesday. While Mr. Bush was slightly ahead of Mr. McCain, 16 percent of the respondents said they were undecided. Mr. Keyes had 4 percent. The poll has a margin of sampling error of five percentage points for the 374 Republican primary voters.
For Mr. Pataki and Mr. Powers, the primary emerged as a test of the strength of a political organization that Republicans have come to view as one of the strongest in the nation, and that took the lead in an effort to keep Mr. McCain off the ballot. Mr. Pataki finds himself in a particularly high-pressure situation given Mr. Bush's experience in Michigan, where he relied on another Republican governor, John Engler, to run his campaign.
Mr. Bush is expected to begin running television advertisements in New York later this week.
For Republican voters, the prospect of the first genuine primary since Alfonse M. D'Amato defeated Senator Jacob K. Javits for the nomination for United States Senate in 1980 was a welcome if somewhat alien development. In interviews, they said Mr. McCain's performance had prompted them to take a look at the race, though their responses suggested they had a fuzzy perception of the candidates and the issues.
"I prefer McCain, but I am not sure why," said Francois Capronmanieux, a wine importer from Manhattan. "There is a sense he is more experienced and serious."
The Republican electorate -- 3.1 million voters, of which 2.5 million are outside New York City -- is different from any Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush have faced to date.
"It is far more moderate than the typical Republican primary electorate," said Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster who is advising Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in his race for the Senate. "It is not as harshly ideological, and it is certainly not religious right."
Mr. Luntz described Mr. McCain as "perfect for those kind of voters: economically conservative, perceived to be socially tolerant, and less tolerant." But he said Mr. Bush benefited from the support of the nation's "most powerful and well-organized" Republican organization.
Given that organizational advantage, Mr. McCain's advisers are trying to move the race to what they see as their strongest ground: the make-up of the electorate. They are hoping to turn what Mr. Bush did to win in South Carolina -- in particular a visit to Bob Jones University -- to undercut him in New York.
If religious Christians were a huge force in South Carolina politics, Roman Catholic voters are major players in New York, and Mr. McCain's advisers said last night that they would make sure those voters knew that Mr. Bush had visited the very conservative Christian university, whose leaders have made anti-Catholic statements.
Representative Peter T. King, the Long Island Republican who is the co-chairman of Mr. McCain's New York effort, predicted that the intrigue that had lifted Mr. McCain to unexpected victories so far would upend the Republican organization in New York.
"I would make the analogy to the Shah of Iran," Mr. King said. "He had the largest air force in the world, largest military in the world, but was absolutely powerless when the revolution started."

HEADLINE: Is U.S. a Global Snoop? No, Europe Is Told

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Fears that the United States, Britain and other English-speaking countries are using a cold-war eavesdropping network to gain a commercial edge roused passions across Europe today, even after Washington and London roundly denied the notion.
The subject kept the European Parliament in Brussels entranced for hours and drew banner headlines across the continent. One political cartoon showed Britain in bed with the United States, despite Britain's membership in the European Union. 
 The hubbub grew from a report prepared for the European Parliament that found that communications intercepted by a network called Echelon twice helped American companies gain an advantage over Europeans.
Whatever the merits of the latest allegations, suggestions of commercial spying have surfaced regularly in recent years. They have infuriated many Europeans who seem to have little trouble believing that military espionage systems developed in the cold war would now be used to help businesses in English-speaking nations.
Echelon is a network of surveillance stations stitched together in the 1970's by the United States National Security Agency with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand to intercept select satellite communications, according to recently declassified information in Washington.
But Washington and Downing Street quickly rejected the idea that they might be using any secret information to bolster their own economies.
"No is the short answer," Prime Minister Tony Blair of England said in London. "These things are governed by extremely strict rules, and those rules will always be applied."
In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department, James P. Rubin, said, "U.S. intelligence agencies are not tasked to engage in industrial espionage or obtain trade secrets for the benefit of any U.S. company or companies. Although we cannot comment on the substance of the report, we can say that the N.S.A. is not authorized to provide intelligence information to private firms."
The denials did little to quell European fury, especially in France, where Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said French companies were being encouraged to encrypt sensitive information to avoid detection by American espionage operations.
She said that Echelon had been set up as a military system, dating originally from 1948, to eavesdrop on the Soviet Union and its allies in the cold war, but that it had been converted to "economic espionage."
"Today," Ms. Guigou said, "it appears that the network has been diverted to the purposes of economic espionage and for keeping a watch on competitors."
The flare-up was prompted by the publication today of a report commissioned by the European Parliament 18 months ago, after initial allegations of commercial espionage.
The 18-page report, which was written by a freelance journalist, Duncan Campbell, and based in large part on other newspaper accounts, said Echelon had been used by the United States to gain the advantage in at least two deals that involved major European companies.
Mr. Campbell described Echelon as a vast coordinated system that includes a system of satellites and at least 10 listening posts worldwide that can intercept telephone calls, e-mails and faxes.
The report drew skepticism from conservative parliamentarians, some of whom said it had failed to provide sufficient proof.
Citing "well informed" press reports from 1995, Mr. Duncan said information learned through Echelon had been given to Boeing and the old McDonnell Douglas when they were trying to win a $6 billion contract from Saudi Arabia. His report said the spy network had intercepted calls between Airbus, the European consortium, and the Saudi airline and government officials.
Mr. Campbell also said spy information had helped an American company, Raytheon, win a bid for a $1.3 billion surveillance system for the Amazon forest away from Thomson-CSF, a French company.
But few details were offered about how the information was of any use to the American corporations. Each example was described in just a short paragraph.
In recent years, Echelon has been criticized in the United States as an excessive intrusion into the private communications of Americans and their allies. Some critics said the system emerged from the cold war as a Big Brother without a cause.
R. James Woolsey Jr., who headed the C.I.A. from 1993 to 1995, said in Washington that "basically the United States does not conduct industrial espionage." But he said the government might look into some economic areas, like questions of bribery.
"You collect intelligence on bribery by some of our friends abroad . . . and then you tell the U.S. government so they can try to get the other government not to award the contract," Mr. Woolsey said today at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 "But you don't go to the American corporation and say 'Hey, you're about to lose,' " he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. LOSES DISPUTE ON EXPORT SALES

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
The United States has suffered its largest defeat ever in a trade battle, losing a dispute with Europe about tax policies in a ruling that deals a blow to trans-Atlantic relations and could force American companies to pay billions of dollars more in taxes each year.
An appeals panel of the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based body that regulates trade, has ruled that the United States must scrap a law that allowed companies to avoid paying taxes on some overseas sales by channeling them through offshore subsidiaries. 
 The decision, which Clinton administration officials expect the trade group to announce on Thursday, orders the United States to rewrite its tax code by Oct. 1 to eliminate what the decision calls an illegal export subsidy or face sanctions.
The United States has lost trade cases before, but no loss comes close in dollar terms. Last year alone, hundreds of United States companies including Boeing, Microsoft and General Motors avoided paying about $4 billion in federal taxes under the provision. Boeing alone used the tax law to save $130 million in 1998, a crucial edge in its competition with the European consortium Airbus Industrie for global aircraft sales.
Clinton administration officials said the unfavorable ruling would set off a scramble to find ways to preserve the tax breaks. One option is to alter the tax code to comply with W.T.O. rules, though it is not clear how that would be done. The United States will also seek to reach a political settlement with the European Union, which brought the case in 1998.
If settlement talks fail, Washington has also contemplated filing a countersuit against what it argues are equivalent European export subsidies. Retaliation of that kind would further strain economic ties at a time when the United States and Europe are already fighting skirmishes over genetically modified products and aircraft noise. Sharp disagreement between the United States and Europe was one factor that led to the collapse of global trade talks in Seattle late last year.
"The rules are widely viewed as creating a level playing field with the European tax system and are important to the business community," Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said in a statement tonight. "We will work closely with our European counterparts, Congress and the business community to achieve a solution."
Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said she would work to ensure that the dispute did not derail cooperation with the European Union on other fronts. "It's in neither of our interests to allow this case to damage bilateral relations," she said.
The defeat comes as United States trade policies are being challenged on several fronts.
The Clinton administration is lobbying Congress to approve trade agreements with China, Africa and Caribbean nations. Congress will also vote this spring on whether to renew United States membership in the World Trade Organization.; some critics of the trade group have accused it of extending its reach into areas where it does not belong, threatening the sovereignty of member nations.
"This could not have come at a worse time for the U.S.," said Peter S. Watson, a trade lawyer and former head of the International Trade Commission. "It makes the U.S. a loser in a major case involving significant financial exposure."
How much financial exposure is still an open question. The administration estimates that the tax breaks could save United States companies as much as $5 billion annually, but a W.T.O. panel has yet to rule on what the total damages might be. In one recent case involving Australia, damages were applied retroactively. If that position was adopted in this case, the European Union could claim billions of dollars for past damages inflicted by the tax breaks.
At issue is a little-publicized tax provision that allows exporters to channel overseas sales through subsidiaries, called foreign sales corporations, set up in places like the Virgin Islands, Barbados and Guam. The United States does not tax sales made by those subsidiaries, nor does it impose duties when they transfer profits to their parent companies.
Analysts say the offshore tax havens clearly violate W.T.O. rules that prohibit nations from subsidizing exports to make them more competitive. But the United States has argued that the tax breaks mirror subsidies the European Union provides to companies there. Europe forgives value-added taxes on exported goods, for example.
The two sides have a pact dating from the early 1980's in which they agreed not to challenge each other's tax policies, Clinton administration officials said. The administration contended during the case that the W.T.O. should not intrude into tax matters covered by such agreements between nations, but the trade body rejected that argument.
Exactly why the European Union chose to bring the case remains unclear. European officials have said they believe that the long-standing United States tax breaks give American companies an unfair advantage.
But administration officials accuse Europe of exploiting American vulnerability on the tax issue out of spite. Europe was bitter when Washington used the W.T.O. to pry open European markets for imported bananas and hormone-treated beef -- decisions Europe is still fighting.
Members of Congress and industry executives are urging the administration to find a way to resolve the matter quickly. Business lobbyists said that if the corporations lost the tax breaks entirely, they would find themselves at a serious disadvantage against European competitors.
"One thing we absolutely must not do is to unilaterally disarm," said Homer E. Moyer Jr., a Washington lawyer who represents some companies that employ the tax breaks. "This cries out for some kind of political solution."
Some analysts suggested that one answer would be for the United States and Europe to swap victories -- European beef and banana restrictions for United States tax breaks. But the money involved is of uneven magnitude.
The W.T.O. has ruled that the beef and banana restrictions cost United States companies several hundred million dollars in lost exports each year, while the tax ruling involves billions of dollars of export earnings for United States companies.
Administration officials are worried that the dispute might undermine the already tepid support for the W.T.O. in Congress. Lawmakers will vote whether to renew the nation's membership this year. Though the measure has been expected to pass -- the United States was a founding member of the W.T.O. in 1995 -- opponents now have fresh ammunition to argue that the organization does more harm than good.
Some critics have argued that W.T.O. judges often overreach in their rulings, sometimes encroaching on the sovereignty of member nations. Environmentalists are among the fiercest critics, citing cases in which the organization has struck down some environmental protections. Other opponents have attacked the W.T.O. as the captive of anti-American groups abroad.
"Those who are predisposed against the W.T.O. will use this as a poster child" for their claim that it interferes in domestic politics, Mr. Watson said, adding that he disagreed with that sentiment.

HEADLINE: Amnesty for Illegal Immigrants?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Contrary to your Feb. 22 editorial "Hasty Call for Amnesty," the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is correct to call for a general amnesty for illegal immigrants. United States immigration laws are far too strict, and thousands of good people are prevented from contributing to American economic growth. 
 With the increasing isolationism displayed by the protesters at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and by anti-immigration groups, it is refreshing to see that organized labor has finally come to understand that globalization is good for this country.
Even the least skilled immigrants contribute to our economy. They do the jobs that many Americans are unwilling to do. The United States should open its doors to all immigrants.

HEADLINE: Tracking the Wealth Effect;
Imbalance of Supply To Demand Causes Greenspan to Fret

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan defended the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate increases today as necessary to keep the current prosperity on track, and denied that he was putting the entire economy at risk just to rein in the bull market.
In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan, the central bank chairman, parried questions from members of both parties about whether he was putting too much emphasis on the strains that rising stock prices might be creating in the economy, and too little on the benefits of low unemployment, steady growth and low interest rates. 
 Elaborating on comments he made last week, Mr. Greenspan said that while he was not aiming at stock prices, he had to be concerned about how the run-up on Wall Street translated into increased consumer spending and a broader increase in demand for goods and services. That "wealth effect," he said, was contributing to an imbalance between demand and the economy's ability to produce the supply needed to meet it, the classic precondition for an outbreak of inflation.
Mr. Greenspan said he saw no evidence of inflation outside of rising oil and commodity prices. But as he did during an appearance before the House Banking Committee last week, he suggested that the Fed would continue raising rates in small steps until the economy slowed from the blistering pace it set late last year.
"What I've tried to argue today is not that we are on the edge of instability, but that we have an extraordinary economy which is growing at a pace which is somewhat above the level which is sustainable over a longer term," Mr. Greenspan said.
The Fed has raised rates four times in eight months, in quarter-point increments. Analysts are all but certain that the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will push its benchmark federal funds rate -- the target rate for overnight loans among banks -- up another quarter point, to 6 percent, at its next meeting on March 21.
With inflation quiescent, the interplay between the stock market and the economy has emerged as one of the trickiest and most critical issues facing the Fed, and Mr. Greenspan spent much of today's session trying to explain his thinking.
By the Fed's estimate, "2 to 4 cents out of every additional dollar of stock market wealth eventually is reflected in increased consumer purchases," Mr. Greenspan said.
Multiplied by the trillions of dollars of wealth created by the long bull market, that is one powerful engine of consumer demand. (Much the same phenomenon causes corporations to invest freely in new technology and equipment.) By the Fed's estimates, the booming market has, on average, added about a percentage point a year to gross domestic purchases for five years.
To some degree, Mr. Greenspan said, rising stock prices are an expected and entirely justified response by investors to the most fundamental change in the economy in decades, the surge in productivity, or a worker's output each hour.
The point, he said, is not whether stocks are overvalued. Mr. Greenspan said his views were no more or less valid than anyone else's. But that does not mean rising stock prices -- more specifically, the huge and growing pool of new wealth created by the market -- are not a factor in the economic outlook.
The problem is that the additional oomph that market-generated wealth gives to demand is not replicated on the other side of the economy's balance sheet -- supply, or the economy's ability to meet that demand. "It is firmly documented that when people have significant capital gains, a small part of them do induce an increase in consumption," Mr. Greenspan said. "It is the nature of a capital gain not to increase supply accordingly."
Mr. Greenspan tracks the scale of the wealth effect by watching a ratio of household net worth to income. Since income growth is a rough proxy for growth in the nation's productive capacity, a rise in wealth relative to income implies an expansion of the gap between demand and supply, the very imbalance of most concern to Mr. Greenspan.
Mr. Greenspan said that the Fed has tracked the ratio back to 1922, and that it did not change in a way that had a big effect on the economy until the mid-1990's. According to the Fed's statistics, household wealth remained between 4.8 and 5.1 times income from 1988 until 1996, when it began surging. By 1997, wealth was 5.7 times income; last year it was nearly 6.3.
In prepared testimony delivered to both the House and Senate committees, Mr. Greenspan said that squeezing inflationary pressures out of the economy would have to involve bringing the growth in asset values into line with the growth in income.
After Mr. Greenspan set out that equation for the House committee last week, some economists took it to mean that slowing the growth in stock prices until they came in line with income growth had become a goal of monetary policy. Responding to a question today, Mr. Greenspan said that was not the case.
"It is merely a diagnostic tool to make a judgment as to whether a wealth effect is indeed functioning in the economy," Mr. Greenspan said.
Members of the committee pressed Mr. Greenspan today to explain the distinction between using monetary policy to slow the whole economy, with all that could mean for jobs and incomes, and using it to curb the wealth effect by taking some air out of the stock market.
"There's a whole new theory being laid out here," said Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, the panel's ranking Democrat, "that's going to justify raising rates, curtailing the economy, when there is no inflation. And it's all being done on the basis of this wealth effect."
Mr. Greenspan never completely explained the distinction, if there is one. Rather, he emphasized that what he was dealing with was "not a theory, it's merely an analysis of what in fact is happening."
Curiously for a Fed chairman who is often viewed as omnipotent, Mr. Greenspan said the central bank was playing only a supporting role in addressing the problem.
"Market forces, not the Federal Reserve, are driving up interest rates to close the gap between supply and demand for funds, which is a counterpart to goods and services," he said.
But there is no question that Mr. Greenspan views the situation with a growing sense of urgency. By his account, the economy has absorbed the growth in demand relative to supply over the last few years through two "safety valves." They are an increase in imports and a decline in unemployment.
But with the unemployment rate at 4 percent, a 30-year low, the economy is fast running out of workers, as the Fed sees things. And with the nation's trade deficit at a record high, the United States cannot afford to continue importing goods with abandon for much longer.
The bottom line, Mr. Greenspan said, is that there is no longer much of a buffer between increased demand and an inflationary spiral in wages and prices -- especially as long as the stock market continues to stoke demand.
"The wealth effect cannot persist indefinitely because it relies on two safety valves, both of which are limited," Mr. Greenspan said.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about Alan Greenspan's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee misstated his estimate of the portion of gains from the stock market that are translated into higher consumer spending. Mr. Greenspan said it was "perhaps 3 to 4 cents out of every additional dollar," not 2 to 4 cents.

HEADLINE: Directing Traffic in the Radio Spectrum's Crowded Neighborhood

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB MCCLAIN 

 BODY:
IT is a growing, although invisible problem.
 In the past decade, an explosion in the number of wireless devices -- cellular telephones, satellite television dishes and pagers, to name just a few -- has led to crowded airwaves. 
 So far, the range of radio frequencies, which lie between audible sound and infrared radiation on the electromagnetic spectrum, has been able to accommodate all the increased uses.
 More and more, though, ensuring that different devices can be used without interference from others is a high-wire act achieved only through technological advances and the careful management of the radio spectrum.
 Different uses are allotted different portions of the usable spectrum, from relatively low frequencies (measured in thousands of hertz, or kilohertz) to high-frequency microwaves (measured in billions of hertz, or gigahertz). The result is a crazy quilt of frequency bands reserved for a variety of civilian and military applications, like conventional AM and FM radio, television, ham radio, mobile phones, aircraft and ship communications, and navigation systems. Some frequency bands are left unused to avoid interfering with radio astronomy and other scientific efforts.
 The International Telecommunication Union, a United Nations organization that is the intergovernmental rule-making body for the radio spectrum, used to review how radio frequencies were used every 20 years. Since 1992, though, it has stepped up its reviews to every two years to keep up with the demand.
 In the United States, the agencies responsible for managing the spectrum have never been busier. They are the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, which handles the parts of the spectrum reserved for the government's use, and the Federal Communications Commission, which keeps watch over private use. Both agencies are in the Commerce Department.
 As you make more of the spectrum available, more people want to use it, said Norbert Schroeder, a program manager in the office of spectrum management at the national telecommunications agency. Decisions about how to use the spectrum hinge on practical questions -- what it is possible to do -- as well as on public policy, international regulations and economics, Mr. Schroeder said.
 Technology has come to play a crucial role. It is only because of the developing technologies that the spectrum has become available at the higher frequencies, Mr. Schroeder explained.
 But tapping into ever-higher frequencies has its own problems. The signals at higher frequencies are more easily obstructed by buildings and other structures. To use these frequencies, which start around three gigahertz and are mostly in the microwave part of the spectrum, it is necessary to use relays to strengthen and retransmit the signals or to build very big antennas. Both solutions are expensive, Mr. Schroeder said.
 Dale Hatfield, director of the Federal Communications Commission's office of engineering and technology, said an alternative approach was to use the lower frequencies more efficiently.
 Here, too, technology can help. Digital systems are making it possible to compress signals, reducing the width of the frequency bands needed for some transmissions. For example, the frequency bands allocated for two-way radios for taxis and the police used to be 50 kilohertz wide. Now they are 12 kilohertz, and technology is becoming available that could reduce them further, to 6 kilohertz.
 Still, there are trade-offs. With the smaller bands, you lose transmission power, Mr. Schroeder said. But system design can overcome these problems by using relays or repeaters that rebroadcast the signals.
 Sharing frequencies is another way to manage the demand. The radio broadcasts of the Voice of America, for example, share frequency bands that are used by the military for training.
 Reallocating what is already in use is a possibility. The part of the spectrum used for U.H.F. (ultrahigh frequency) television channels 60 to 69 ranges from 746 to 806 megahertz. That band is not in use in some parts of the country, so part of that chunk of the spectrum in those areas is being sold at auction to companies that want to provide wireless Internet communications for personal digital assistants, cell phones and personal computers. Other parts are being reassigned by the Federal Communications Commission for use by the police and other public safety agencies.
 Even with changes and technological developments, spectrum management remains difficult. One strain on the system is unlicensed use. The spectrum from 902 to 928 megahertz, for example, is occupied by signals that do not need to be licensed, like those coming from cordless phones and keyless security systems for doors.
 People a lot of times are using radio spectrum without realizing it, Mr. Hatfield said.
 And equipment that makes no use of radio frequencies can also cause interference. "The spectrum is a natural resource that can be polluted," Mr. Hatfield said. A person turning on a hair dryer can cause snow on the TV next door.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 26, 2000, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Circuits on Thursday about the management of the radio spectrum referred incorrectly to the Federal Communications Commission. It is an independent agency, not part of the Commerce Department. The article also classified sound incorrectly. It is produced by the vibration of molecules; it is not part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "A Place for Everything, and Everything in Its Place"
Radio waves used for communications and research lie in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum between sound waves and infrared light. They are electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging from 9 kilohertz, or 9,000 cycles a second, to about 400 gigahertz, or 400 billion cycles a second.
 The radio spectrum has been divided into frequency bands by the Commerce Department, and each band has been allocated to one or more of 30 uses. The chart below shows how the spectrum is divided, with each frequency band color-coded to indicate what use it is reserved for (many have several colors because they have several uses). Horizontal bars along the bottom indicate whether the use is reserved for the Federal government (brown), for the public (gray), or for either government or public use (black).
 
OLDER TECHNOLOGY
The frequencies on the lower end of the spectrum have been in use the longest. Among the frequencies shown here are the ones used for communication between airplanes and air traffic controllers (aeronautical mobile); for satellite communications and space research; for two-way radios (mobile and fixed); for amateur, or ham, radio; for ship-to-shore communications (maritime mobile); and for broadcast television Channels 7 through 13.
 
NEWER USES
Technological advances have opened up the higher end of the radio spectrum for new uses. Among them are: transmitting images and data from weather satellites (shown here as met sat, short for meteorological satellite), transmitting signals from PCS (personal communications services) devices (the widest fixed band below), broadcasting digital radio signals (broadcasting satellite), and transmitting signals from Global Positioning System satellites (radiolocation).
 
NOTE: The spacing alloted the services in the spectrum segments shown is not proportional to the actual amount of spectrum occupied.

HEADLINE: Web Access, Minus the Monthly Bill

BYLINE: By PETER DIZIKES 

 BODY:
INFORMATION, as the saying goes, wants to be free. In this spirit, a growing number of Internet service providers have begun offering completely free Internet access: no monthly charges and no start-up fees.
Companies like NetZero, World Spy, Freei.net, and even Kmart (yes, Kmart) now let anyone with a computer and a modem browse the Web at no cost, and, through aggressive advertising campaigns, aim to lure Web users away from fee-based services like America Online and Earthlink. And the trend is accelerating: in January alone, established Web names like Alta Vista and Juno joined their ranks. 
 Free access has been slower to catch on in the United States than in countries like Britain, where the debut last year of Dixon's Freeserve, run by an electronics retailing chain, was so successful that many competitors, including AOL, now offer free services of their own. In Britain, though, telephone customers pay by the minute for local calls, which means a so-called free Internet connection can still be costly.
Few Internet experts expect such dramatic changes on this side of the Atlantic. Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a New York-based company that provides research on Internet commerce, predicts that 13 percent of Net users will gain access via free providers by 2003 -- a healthy amount, but probably not enough to scare AOL.
"The free services are catching on," Ms. Wigder said, "but they are competing against each other, not just AOL."
Why has free Internet access been a greater hit in Britain than the United States? For one thing, industry analysts say, the British tend to spend less on entertainment. Also, established I.S.P.'s command greater customer loyalty in the United States.
"AOL offers a very good service that people are addicted to," said Bruce Kasrel, an analyst at Forrester Research, a research company in Cambridge, Mass., that analyzes how changes in technology affect businesses and society. "Free I.S.P.'s will not be the primary way people access the Internet in the future."
Nonetheless, free I.S.P.'s are a burgeoning presence in the United States, with a dozen companies offering national services and many regional I.S.P.'s offering something like free connections (many charge one-time set-up fees). I recently signed up for a number of the largest providers and tested them over several weeks.
The ground rules: I ignored providers who promised free monthly service but charged a hefty set-up fee, avoided services that could not provide a local phone number (in my case, area code 718) and tried to rely only on free technical support, which was sometimes available only by e-mail. In short, my goal was to evaluate the quality of Internet access I could get without paying a cent.
To begin, I downloaded the software from the free I.S.P. Web sites using my existing provider, a regular phone line, a 56K modem and Windows 98. Anyone who doesn't already have an Internet provider can order the software by phone, usually for less than $10.
Among the following free I.S.P.'s, only Freei is compatible with Macintoshes.
 
NetZero
NetZero (www.netzero.net) the biggest of the free I.S.P.'s, reports having three million subscribers, all with PC's (it does not work with Macs). NetZero subscribers mustuse Windows 95, 98, NT or 2000.
Downloading the software and answering a marketing questionnaire, a necessary part of the sign-up process, took an hour. After I had used NetZero a few times, an ambiguous error message began cropping up on my computer: "691: member ID/ password invalid OR we may have temporary system difficulties."
Since I had been using NetZero successfully, I figured that it was the latter. But I could not be sure because NetZero does not have toll-free technical support by phone; you must either pay for a call to Southern California or use the service's "platinum" phone support, which is $14.95 per call. If the service is down, you obviously cannot use e-mail or consult a Web site for help unless you have another Internet provider. I decided to use another I.S.P. to send e-mail to NetZero's technical support service. All I got was a standardized response urging me to upgrade to the latest version of NetZero.
It was faster to register again under another name, with a new ID and password. The error message disappeared, but I would not want to re-register every time I encountered a problem.
NetZero provides free e-mail, and it comes with a window for advertisements,called the ZeroPort, that can be moved around but not removed from the screen. The ZeroPort was only a moderate distraction; I found it least obtrusive at the bottom of the screen.
 
WorldSpy
"Free Internet access,"the WorldSpy advertisements say (www.worldspy.com). "Our accountant isn't happy." Neither was I, after realizing that WorldSpy's memory-gulping software would occupy 8 megabytes on my hard drive.
And there were glitches: a dialogue box kept reappearing on the screen, the service intermittently disconnected and occasionally when I dialed in, the WorldSpy application would start, then enigmatically disappear from the screen.
On the positive side, WorldSpy's technical support includes a toll-free phone number, and the people there were prompt and helpful -- although the first time I tried it, I was cut off in midcall. A representative solved the dialogue box problem without too much difficulty and assured me that the mysterious disappearing application was caused by a software bug that WorldSpy was attempting to fix.
WorldSpy does not include an advertising window like ZeroPort. WorldSpy is an online retailer, and its Internet service is intended to draw traffic to the site. Its service is compatible with Windows 95, 98 and NT, but not yet with Windows 2000. Over all, I had enough connection problems to give me pause about using WorldSpy as a long-term I.S.P.
 
Freei
Setting up Freei's software is quick, provided you have Version 5 of Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Anyone using an earlier version of Explorer will first have to download Version 5, which can itself be a lengthy process, to install Freei. In fact, almost all free I.S.P.'s use Explorer as the default browser, perhaps because Netscape is now part of AOL. Freei (www.freei.net), based in Seattle, does not have a toll-free number for phone support, but the service itself presented a minimum of connection problems. Since Freei provides access for Macintosh users with OS 8.0 or higher, Apple partisans may choose to go here first and consult friends if technical issues arise. Freei is also compatible with Windows 95, 98, NT and 2000.
 
Alta Vista
One of the best-known portals on the Web, Alta Vista (www.altavista.com), recently started offering free Internet access. The software downloads rapidly, and Alta Vista allows users to list several local phone numbers in the setup program. If the modem encounters a busy signal when dialing in, it will try the next number on the list. Alta Vista provided a reliable connection and has a highly detailed trouble-shooting guide, parts of which pertain to basic networking and protocol issues and could be useful no matter which I.S.P. you use. The service works with Windows 95, 98, NT and 2000. Alta Vista also provides free technical support by phone, which in my case included about a 10-minute wait on hold.
 
Juno
An established I.S.P., Juno (www.juno .com) offers a choice between its premium service for $9.95 a month and completely free access. Among other differences, the premium service includes free technical phone support, which costs $1.95 per minute if you choose the free service. Premium users also have more local phone numbers to choose from. But like Alta Vista, Juno's free service also allows users to list several local numbers in case of a busy signal, and it offers a dependable, consistent connection. It does not take long to download Juno's software, either. In fact, the most time-consuming part of the set-up process is answering a tedious personal questionnaire, which is by far the longest of any free I.S.P. reviewed here. Juno's free service also requires Windows 95 or any later version, including Windows 2000.
 
BlueLight (Kmart)
When I learned that Kmart was in the free I.S.P. business, I pictured a cheesy service with pop-up advertisements distracting me while I perused the Web: "Attention, Kmart surfers. We now have a blue-light special on garden hoses." As its name indicates, though, Kmart has a sense of humor about its cyberventure (www.bluelight.com). BlueLight does show a video advertisement while your modem is dialing, and it includes the usual on-screen advertising window.
These distractions aside, BlueLight emerged as a dark-horse winner. It took just a few minutes to download the software and to register. The service is run in collaboration with Yahoo -- the default home page -- and users are given a yahoo.com e-mail address. BlueLight runs with Windows 95, 98, NT and 2000. I have yet to experience a single software glitch, connection problem or curious error message with BlueLight. When I tested its technical support by phone, I reached a representative within a minute. Granted, that required a call to the 409 area code (Texas), but that seems like a reasonable trade-off.
Indeed, using free I.S.P.'s generally means accepting trade-offs like connection difficulties and limited technical support, but that can also be true of services you pay for. You may have to endure an advertising window, and many free I.S.P.'s monitor the online activities of their users. Almost all free service providers require Windows as a platform. And if you are using the Internet for professional reasons, it is a good idea to try a free I.S.P. for a while before relying upon it too heavily. But if all that seems reasonable to you, there is one undeniable benefit: a very nice price.
 
Places to Look
 
A number of Internet service providers provide free Web access, in addition to those mentioned in the article. Here are some of them. Unless otherwise noted, these services are compatible with only Windows 95, 98, and NT.
 
THE SIMPSONS: www.thesimpsons.comFree Internet access and e-mail brought to you by the site of the long-running hit series, but only for Windows users. D'oh! It runs with Windows 2000.
 
EXCITE@HOME: www.excite.com Where would a major portal be these days without offering free Net access? Excite's FreeWorld works with Windows 2000.
 
FREEWWWEB: www.freewwweb.com This site says it was the first national provider of free access. It covers nearly every area code in the country.
 
IFREEDOM: www.ifreedom.com Local access numbers are limited in some states, especially in rural areas, but iFreedom is promising compatibility for Mac users by the middle of 2000. A Windows 2000 version is also on the way.
 
DOTNOW: www.dotnow.com National coverage for dotNow is extensive. Before downloading, use its search form to see if your local access number is available.
 
TRITIUM NETWORK: www.tritium.net Currently, Tritium Network covers only major cities and requires at least Windows 95. In return for free access, users must fill out an online survey once a month.
 
Free Advice
 
Here are a few hints on how to make sure that you get more than you pay for from free Internet service.
 
AVOID HIDDEN COSTS Some free I.S.P.'s, especially local and regional providers, advertise "free service" or "no monthly fees" but actually charge a hefty set-up fee or make users purchase their software.
 
CHECK SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS Before downloading a free I.S.P.'s software, make sure that your system is compatible with it. Most I.S.P.'s list system requirements, sometimes on a Frequently Asked Questions page.
 
READ THE FINE PRINT Some free I.S.P.'s terminate sessions if users do not click on a banner advertisement within a certain number of minutes; others monitor use or require users to fill out surveys on a regular basis. Look at the user agreement and any disclaimers on the site.

A WEB site, Old-houses.com, recently featured this announcement: "The Schoharie County Planning and Development Agency is offering free, to a qualified individual who can relocate it, a 2,948-square-foot historic home/inn in Fulton, N.Y." At the Web site Buildingmovers.com is another enticing offer: "Small Hotel $1 Must Be Moved." And this message: "Free House, You move it, you own it."
Then there are logistical queries like "How do you transport a 39-foot geodesic dome?" or "Can a log cabin be airlifted?" 
 Once an oddity, house moving is gaining appeal, partly as a result of advertising and publicity on the Internet and partly as a result of some highly visible moves. Last year, for example, the 208-foot-tall lighthouse at Cape Hatteras, on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, was moved half a mile on rails, back from the water's edge.
"It used to be kind of a creative thing people did," said R. J. Soens, a broker at the Avalon (N.J.) Real Estate Agency. "Now, it has become an alternative for people that want a home but don't have the economic means to buy one."
Or to buy the kind of home they want. Last October, Peter and Sheila Hughes of Stone Harbor, N.J., were able to get a home way out of their price range by moving it. The house cost only $1, and in total, including a one-mile move and reconstruction costs, the couple spent $100,000 for a five-bedroom house worth twice that.
Susan Anderson, 37, a court reporter in Minco, Okla., "didn't want to go the mobile-home route," she said, so she bought 30 acres "out in the boonies" and acquired a house 14 miles away, which she then moved.
Even the house made famous by "The Blair Witch Project" can be bought and moved: in the spring, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources is expected to post an announcement asking for salvage or relocation bids on the house, known locally as the Griggs house, near Burkittsville, Md.
The decrepit "Blair Witch" house, made famous in the low-budget movie last year, is no one's idea of a dream house. Nonetheless, a filmmaker might want to snatch it up for a scarefest sequel, and fans have been trying to remove the house piece by piece since the film opened.
Many houses are up for grabs because of the current building boom. Mr. Hughes, the general manager of Atlantic Capes Fisheries Inc., got his home from a local businessman who wanted to build another on the property.
"I'm happy that a house with a lot of character, rather than being torn down, is being put to use by someone who can appreciate it," said the former owner, who refused to give his name and passed his comments along through Mr. Hughes.
While demolition is still the norm, having a house moved off the property can actually save a homeowner money, around $13,000 in demolition costs for a large house.
Often called "house recycling," house moving can be an environmentally helpful option for developers: two years ago, for example, when the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission built an expressway that cut right through a residential area it owned in Finleyville, it gave its renters the option of buying their homes and moving them down the road and out of the expressway's path.
Despite the apparent interest, it is hard to know just how many people follow through with moving a house. For one thing, a house move is a major undertaking.
"The worst thing that can happen is you buy a house because it looks great -- you say, 'This is a terrific deal' -- and then realize it is too wide to go down the street, you have to take down 600 power lines, and you can't get it under the bridges," said Robert L. Williams, the author of "Houses to Go: How to Buy a Good Home Cheap" (Breakout Productions, 1997).
The most affordable moves involve short houses (i.e., ranch or colonial-style matchboxes) or short distances. Regulations, including permit requirements for highways and railroad crossings, vary by state, making interstate travel a challenge. Among house movers, Massachusetts is known for being the only state where there is no charge for moving overhead wires.
So many houses are on the move on Nantucket, where there are few trees to get in the way, that a local paper warns drivers of the routes they will take.
A cross-country move is nearly impossible these days, unless disassembly of the house is involved. David R. Dow, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center, liked his house in Texas so much he hoped to relocate it to Colorado.
But, he said, "I can't make the move make economic sense."
Nontheless, improved hydraulics has made it much easier to handle short-haul moves. (Not that the business is anything but macho: the International Association of Structural Movers gives out awards annually for tallest, longest and heaviest moves.)
Members of the association spend much of their time lifting houses or moving them back onto their foundations (after the basements are pumped out), skills that were in demand last year in regions that suffered hurricane and flood damage.
A routine house move involves digging around the foundation, cutting openings in the foundation walls, inserting steel beams and jacking up the building. Dollies are shoved beneath the house, and then a truck yanks it off its foundation and the house is on its way. Once at its destination, the house is lowered onto a new foundation.
Depending on the width of a planned route, the house is either transported in sections or left whole.
"The biggest thing about building movers is that they take great pride in being able to move entire structures -- we really enjoy tight moves," said Kenneth D. Jordan of Ellsworth, Me., who once moved a Victorian house for 90 miles on a barge.
The best part of getting a whole house moved in one piece is not having to pack any boxes. "We tied the cabinets and fridge closed with a string, took a couple pictures off the wall, and left the cat sleeping in the computer chair," said Shelley Wain of Finleyville, Pa.
The cat was still sleeping when the house arrived at its new location 500 yards away. Ms. Wain, 34, the owner of a crafts store, was one of the renters who took the option offered by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission to buy and move her home out of the new expressway's path. She documented the move with a camera, then posted the pictures on her Web site, along with a detailed text.
Ms. Wain is such a fan of house moving that she has made a video showing two houses, including her own, being successfully moved. She also shows what can go tragically wrong.
A third house from the Turnpike Commission's site collapsed into rubble, killing one of the house movers. Still pictures of the moves and of the accident are posted incongruously on Ms. Wain's Web site dedicated to handicrafts (www.patternpage .com/house.htm).
Movers themselves usually have three kinds of insurance: general/ public liability, auto liability and a cargo policy. If a house does not survive the trip, the home owner does not have to pay the movers but will probably still have to pay for any permits or wire moving.
Mr. Hughes said his move, which involved slicing the house into a top half and a bottom half, like a layer cake, was hard on his nerves. (Even while the house was in pieces, he had to continue paying the mortgage.) Then, after the house was dissected and before it was moved to his property, it sat exposed to the wrath of Hurricane Floyd.
Miraculously, it was unharmed, he said, and the pieces fit together perfectly when the two halves were reattached on the new site.
Diane Elliott of Monroe, Wash., was less fortunate. Her deconstructed house was "cut up so badly that it couldn't be put back together again," she said. Eventually, half of it had to be torn down. Two years later, Ms. Elliott, a systems manager at Boeing, and her husband are still working with contractors to rebuild the house.
YET, sometimes, disassembling a building is the only answer. Peter Bickford, a banker who lives in East Harlem, had an 1860 Canadian barn reassembled on his property in East Hampton, N.Y., by Steve Mack of Steven P. Mack Associates in Ashaway, R.I.
Whether a bargain home is delivered in parts or whole, once on site, it's essentially a shell. "Basically, it's like building a house," said Mary Jane Copeland, a graphic designer in her 30's. All kinds of expenses she had never considered arose.
Ms. Copeland bought a house in Bennett, N.C., in the central part of the state, and moved it to Moncure, N.C., 40 miles away. The mover offered her the house and the move in a package deal at a cost of $15,000. But building a new foundation cost $5,000, putting in a well cost another $5,000, clearing land was $2,000, putting in a septic system $5,000, attic insulation $1,000, wiring another $3,000 and so on.
She secured a construction loan in advance, but that took some shopping around. When she presented her proposal at one bank, the loan officer "started stuttering when I told him about it," she said.
But there is one fringe benefit to house moving: the surreal spectacle of seeing an entire building cruising down the road. As Mr. Hughes, the New Jersey man who moved the five-bedroom house, said, "It's just awesome."

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
A City in Full: Venerable, Impatient Atlanta

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
This is a city without a historic core, a city in constant evolution -- a Deep South version, you might say, of Los Angeles.
It has a past, of course, a real one as well as the one that Margaret Mitchell so vividly imagined in "Gone With the Wind." A decisive Civil War battle was fought over this ground, and the momentous civil rights movement of the 1960's had its principal headquarters here. That most American of products, Coca-Cola, was invented here. 
 But Atlanta, a city in a hurry, keeps putting its past behind it. If not for the Cyclorama depicting the fighting of 1864 and the superlative Atlanta History Center, with its evocations of Henry W. Grady, the great newspaper editor, and Bobby Jones, the golfer, and, yes, William Tecumseh Sherman, who burned the city down, a visitor might easily come here and miss Atlanta's past altogether.
This, after all, is the vibrant, business-minded capital of the New South, proud to have played host to the 1996 Olympic Games, pleased to promote itself as "The World's Next Great City" and not another tradition-bound vestige of the Old South.
"Atlanta had never been a true Old Southern city like Savannah or Charleston or Richmond, where wealth had originated with the land," Tom Wolfe wrote in his novel "A Man in Full" in 1998. "Atlanta was an offspring of the railroad business. It had been created from scratch barely 150 years ago, and people had been making money there on the hustle ever since."
Quite so. Atlanta, or rather the Atlanta region, is one of the global capitals of New Money, much of it made in real estate. It goes to build the trophy houses in the ritzy residential area along West Pace's Ferry Road in Buckhead, near the History Center, and to buy the BMW's and Land Rovers that clog the parking lots around Buckhead's many shopping centers and to pay for the fine food and drink in the neighborhood's glossy restaurants.
That is one face of Atlanta, but there are many more. Start with Downtown, bustling by day, much less so at night; people work there but don't play there, and Centennial Olympic Park, created for the 1996 games, has not quite pulled the area together the way the city fathers had hoped. Then there is Midtown, staging a comeback as a pleasant place to live, as well as the poorer and shabbier and mostly African-American south side of town.
It is in Virginia-Highland, a walk able neighborhood of bars, boutiques and bookshops, and close-in Inman Park that the city shows its charm, especially in spring, when dogwood blossoms brighten the streets.
Put all that and more together, and you have a compact, relatively small city of 400,000.
 
A Truer Picture
But that defines Atlanta only in a governmental sense. To get a truer picture, you must focus on an unruly 17-county sprawl spreading ever outward, with no mountains or seacoast in the way, across Cobb and DeKalb, Gwinnett and Forsyth and Cherokee and a dozen other counties, home to some 3.5 million people.
Four of the nation's 10 fastest-growing counties lie within commuting range of Atlanta, and their exploding populations have helped make Georgia the 10th largest state. But with growth, with prosperity, with the shady trees and tidy yards of the suburbs, have come problems: higher taxes to pay for infrastructure, air and water pollution, and nerve-shattering drives to and from work. Drivers here endure the longest average commute in the country -- a 34-mile round trip every working day, often snarled by gridlock.
The Sierra Club calls Atlanta the most sprawl-threatened large city in the United States; an official of the American Farmland Trust termed it "the poster child for sprawl." Stung by those descriptions, the state government is working on tactics to bring greater order to the region.
How much such things bother you depends on where you sit. My friend Colin Campbell, a newspaper columnist, lives in Midtown and wishes more suburbanites would move there. It still has a slightly hollowed-out feeling, he said. But our host at lunch, former Mayor Sam Massell, now known as the unofficial mayor of Buckhead, which houses 15 percent of Atlanta's population and pays 45 percent of its taxes, said the only real option to more sprawl was greater density in town, with more smog and bigger traffic jams.
 
Transportation Hub
Originally, Atlanta was called Terminus, but that was a misnomer. It has always been about linkage. It came into being as the place where the railroads from the bustling port cities of Mobile and Charleston and Savannah met the line running south from Chattanooga, which is what made it such a strategic objective in the Civil War. Later, Atlanta became the southeastern hub of the highway system, where Interstates 20, 75 and 85 meet.
The civil aviation network, too. Even on your way to heaven, Southerners used to say, you have to change planes in Atlanta. Atlanta's airport pioneered instrument approaches and air traffic control, and today it vies with Chicago's O'Hare for the title of the nation's busiest.
Several generations of visionaries have made possible the city's rise from the ashes of defeat. They thoroughly disproved the prophecy of a Union soldier, Pfc. Theodore Upson, who wrote in his diary after the Battle of Atlanta in September 1864: "We have wholly destroyed Atlanta. I don't think that any people will want to live there now."
Henry Grady was the first. As the editor of The Atlanta Constitution, he argued after the Civil War that the salvation of his ruined city, state and region lay in attracting Northern investment to a "New South," a phrase he coined. In a famous speech in New York in 1886, he assured the New England Society that Southerners had accepted the outcome of the war and bore the North no ill will.
His vision of good race relations -- "sunshine everywhere and all the time," as he put it -- was never realized in his lifetime. The South remained the nation's economic stepchild, and Atlanta's history was marred by several spasms of intolerance, including the 1906 race riots, in which whites attacked blacks, and the 1913 lynching of Leo Frank, a Jew from Brooklyn. Anti-semitism reared its head more recently in the 1958 bombing of a synagogue.
When the Federal government ceased enforcing black rights, Jim Crow laws brought on segregation in restaurants, hotels and other public places. Blacks were denied the vote. But they built successful parallel institutions, including churches, newspapers, radio stations, banks, insurance companies and two of the nation's best predominantly African-American colleges, Morehouse for men and Spelman for women. Between the world wars, Auburn Avenue ("Sweet Auburn") became a regional mecca for blacks.
Coca-Cola, Atlanta's first great international business, was built by Robert W. Woodruff, who took a tonic developed in 1886 by Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a local chemist, and peddled it around the globe.
Woodruff philanthropies, large and small, are inescapable in Atlanta. The World of Coca-Cola, a self-aggrandizing corporate museum where the Coke is free but the admission isn't, has a blinking electronic sign informing wide-eyed visitors that more than 6 trillion, 39 billion bottles have been sold. So the recent news that the company was changing C.E.O.'s and eliminating 6,000 jobs worldwide, including 2,500 in Atlanta, hit the city like a tornado.
 
Land of Where Dr. King Started
The great visionary of the civil rights movement, of course, was the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., born in a clapboard and shingle house that still stands on Auburn Avenue, not far from Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. King and his father preached. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, at the age of 35, the youngest person ever to do so. He is buried in a marble tomb in a reflecting pool at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, also on Auburn.
Across the street at a National Park Visitors Center the still photographs of Birmingham and Selma by Charles Moore and James Karales evoke that era of strife and accomplishment. But the genius of the place lies in the films of Dr. King delivering his unforgettably eloquent speeches, in that prophetic voice mingling calm, cultivation and steely determination.
I heard many of them in person as a young reporter, and like many of my generation I can recite bits of several from memory -- "Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, I'm free at last" -- but neither my wife, Betsey, nor I was prepared for the powerful waves of emotion that washed over us as we listened. Atlanta offers no experience to match it, and not many other cities do either.
Dr. King had important co-workers, including Jesse Jackson and Andrew Young, later a member of Congress, ambassador to the United Nations and mayor of Atlanta. A large black middle class helped lend stability to the city when others, potential rivals for Southern leadership, fell apart. Mayors William B. Hartsfield and Ivan Allen pronounced their city "Too Busy to Hate," and Ralph McGill preached moderation in his column in The Constitution.
 
Carter and Turner
Today, the city's leading citizen is former President Jimmy Carter, much more admired out of office than in, who builds houses for Habitat for Humanity, lectures, writes books and travels the world with his wife, Rosalynn, promoting peace and working to eradicate disease and ease hunger. When not on the road, they divide their time between the little farm town of Plains and an apartment at the Carter Presidential Library here.
But he has a rival in Ted Turner, the voluble entrepreneur who turned an underpowered UHF television station into the Superstation viewed across the country. He invented CNN, based in downtown Atlanta, which has become the world's channel of choice when big news is breaking.
He built the Atlanta Braves, winner of eight division titles under the imperturbable Bobby Cox, into one of the nation's most successful sports franchises. He married (and split from) Jane Fonda. He gave $1 billion to the United Nations. And he owns 1.6 million acres of ranch land, more than any other American.
Atlanta is full of success stories, from Delta Airlines to Home Depot and UPS. Over the years, it has built important institutions like Georgia Tech and Emory University, a superb liberal-arts school less well-known than Tech because it lacks the Ramblin' Wrecks' sports legends, and the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Emory's well-regarded Michael C. Carlos Art Museum was renovated and expanded by the post-modernist Michael Graves in 1993.)
Atlanta boasts tourist attractions like the zoo, with a winsome pair of pandas, Lun Lun and Yang Yang, two of only five in the country, and the Stone Mountain Monument, a kind of Confederate version of Mount Rushmore, out to the east of the city.
I must not forget the Art Deco-style Varsity, the nation's largest drive-in, where they move the customers through at double-time, all day every day. And I must mention a curiosity of Atlanta nomenclature: there are 32 streets, lanes, drives, circles and roads named Peachtree in the metropolitan area.
Culturally speaking, Atlanta remains a stripling, and it has suffered two important losses this year. Ned Rifkin, the director of the High Museum of Art, left to run the Menil Collection in Houston, complaining of a chronic dearth of arts financing, both public and private. And Harriet Sanford, the director of the Fulton County Arts Council, announced she would leave in April to take a similar position in Charlotte, N.C. -- "a place," she said, "that just has a different level of appreciation for the arts."
 
Better Days Anticipated
Atlanta likes to think of itself as a much more important city than Charlotte and as a legitimate rival to Houston. So it was not surprising that The Journal-Constitution ran an editorial chastising both business and local governments for failing to commit the big bucks needed to move the city into the artistic big leagues.
But better days seem to lie ahead for the 56-year-old Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the largest performing arts organization in the Southeast, with a budget of $21 million and an endowment nearing $70 million. It was built, to a considerable degree, by Robert Shaw, the noted choral conductor, who died last year; but it has not flourished under Yoel Levi, the Romanian-born conductor who leaves in May after 12 years as music director.
As the orchestra struggled with a deficit, it endured a 10-week strike at the beginning of the 1996-97 season, as well as a protracted conflict between the orchestra's board and management, on the one hand, and a vocal band of Levi supporters who charged that he was being forced out.
This month, however, the Symphony named Robert Spano, the 38-year-old leader of the Brooklyn Philharmonic, to succeed Mr. Levi. One of the most highly regarded young American conductors, he had been mentioned as a possibility for a half-dozen other orchestras, some of them bigger. Mr. Spano made his name in Brooklyn with an emphasis on the modern, but this, he said, is "a very different city" that might require a different approach.
Atlanta will be getting not one but two marquee names; Donald Runnicles, the Scottish-born, German-trained music director of the San Francisco Opera, was named the orchestra's principal guest conductor.
For many years until 1987, the Metropolitan Opera came to Atlanta every year on tour. When the touring ended, the Atlanta Opera, which had begun as an amateur outfit, transformed itself to fill the void. Starting, in the words of William Fred Scott, its artistic director, with "somebody who answered the phone and a sextet of well-meaning ladies in station wagons," it has grown into a company with an annual budget of almost $5 million. More than 50,000 people attended its productions last season.
This "meteoric growth," the British magazine Opera Now said last year, is "creating noises everywhere." In 2000 Atlantans will see three performances each of four operas -- "Rigoletto," "Cosi Fan Tutte," "Lucia di Lammermoor" and "Turandot" -- in the glorious, 4,518-seat Fox Theater, an Art Deco movie palace that retains its "Thousand and One Nights" decor. For the first time, all four presentations will be Atlanta Opera productions.
 
A Theater Company
If any Atlanta arts organization embraces the whole city, black and white, urban and suburban, it is the Alliance Theater Company, a repertory group based at the Woodruff Arts Center. Its guiding spirit is Kenny Leon, who must be one of the few artistic directors around who stands outside after some performances, greeting the audience members like a parish priest.
Mr. Leon, who is black, has cast African-American actors and actresses in traditionally white roles in "A Christmas Carol" and "Medea," which featured the "Cosby" star Phylicia Rashad. Shortly after his appointment in 1990, ticket sales dropped to 13,000 from 20,000, but then rebounded.
"I think controversy is probably my middle name," Mr. Leon said on the CBS News program "Sunday Morning" a year ago, "not because I want to be controversial but because I want to ask questions that will make us better human beings. I think the theater can be a place where we can come and realize that we all bleed the same blood, we all walk the same way, and we all want the same things."
Among the company's offerings this year are Shaw's "Heartbreak House"; August Wilson's "Jitney"; "Shadowlands," a love story drawn from the life of C. S. Lewis, the Oxford theologian; and "Wit," the 1999 Pulitzer Prize winner written by Margaret Edson, an Atlanta kindergarten teacher.
 
Of ArchitectureBuilders and Buildings
As befits a city whose main business for the last century has been building itself, most of Atlanta's architecture is developer architecture. The city's most important home-grown architect in the postwar period was John Portman, himself a developer, who built many of the postmodern towers that define downtown Atlanta, including the vast Peachtree Center, the Atlanta Merchandise Mart and the 70-story Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel.
But he will be best remembered for the Hyatt Regency Hotel, in which he adapted and expanded the atrium lobby that had been used in 19th-century hotels like the Brown Palace in Denver.
The Hyatt's 22-story skylit courtyard, with bedrooms opening onto cantilevered balconies hung with vines and transparent "bubble" elevators whisking awed guests to their floors, was copied all across the United States soon after it opened in 1967.
Philip Johnson and John Burgee contributed a pair of skyscrapers in the late 1980's, the more successful of the two forming an anchor for the Midtown neighborhood. Called the I.B.M. Tower, it is a neo-Gothic campanile, refined in its ornament and satisfying in its proportions.
There are a few other notable buildings scattered here and there, including a series of elegant mansions designed in the 1920's and 30's by Philip T. Shutze, a gifted classicist who took his stylistic cue from the best Regency and Federal models.
Sadly, the clumsy McMansions that have joined them along the wealthy, wooded byways of Buckhead in the last two decades have none of Mr. Schutze's finesse. Meant to resemble Venetian palazzos, Georgian country seats, Tuscan villas or French chateaus, they succeed only in looking hugely expensive. A scroll pediment here and a Palladian window there don't cut it.
 
The High Museum
Only one of the country's leading modernists can be seen at the peak of his game in Atlanta, and that is Richard Meier, whose High Museum (1983), clad in dazzlingly white porcelain-enameled steel panels, resembles a space station that has settled gently onto the greensward along Peachtree Street. A big, colorful Calder mobile (a lunar explorer?) sits alongside it, and a series of curving ramps lead into and through the exhibition spaces.
The High's collection is skimpy in spots, but it has significant strengths, including the spectacular Virginia Carroll Crawford collection of 19th- and early 20th-century American furniture and decorative arts (several Herter Brothers pieces are of special note) and an idiosyncratic group of objects made by Howard Finster of Summerville, Ga., one of the nation's best-known outsider artists.
I especially like the way in which unlikely juxtapositions of pictures or the like have been created: a Rothko next to a Martin Johnson Heade, one abstract, one not, but both divided into three horizontal bands; an old Yoruba door from West Africa next to a door painted in New Orleans by a black artist named Herbert Singleton, born in 1945; children as seen by three portraitists, Mary Cassatt, Samuel F. B. Morse and George Bellows. The pedagogy is not heavy-handed, but the lessons are there for those who seek them.
 
What to do
 
Atlanta is about 870 miles southeast of New York City. Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:
 
Where to Stay
 
RITZ-CARLTON BUCKHEAD, 3434 Peachtree Road, (404) 237-2700. Set in a sterile suburban sea of shopping malls, office towers and parking lots, the Ritz nonetheless conveys a feeling of graceful luxury. The public rooms are lush; the bedrooms benefit from thick carpets and thicker towels, but you may wonder why faxes take so long to reach you. Renovations are under way. The dining room (see below) has been a superstar since it opened in 1984. Double room: From $195 on weekends; $235 on weeknights.
 
FOUR SEASONS, 75 14th Street, (404) 881-9898. Strategically positioned between Buckhead and downtown, only a few steps fom the High Museum of Art and the Woodruff Arts Center, this opulent property occupies the bottom 20 floors of a postmodern high rise. Offices and condominiums take up the top floors. Corridors and bedrooms are bright and amply proportioned, and room-service breakfasts are delectable. Easy, modern computer linkups. Double room: $165 to $325.
 
RITZ-CARLTON DOWNTOWN, 181 Peachtree Street N.E., (404) 659-0400. The Buckhead property is the chain's flagship, but this "other" Ritz clearly ranks as the best hotel in downtown Atlanta. Acres of marble, fine Oriental rugs, a 17th-century Flemish tapestry and an 18th-century chandelier lend the lobby all the luxury anyone could ask for, although the overall feeling is just a little bit institutional. Some of the rooms have fourposter beds. Double room: $139 to $295.
 
SWISSOTEL, 3391 Peachtree Road, (404) 365-0065. Adjacent to Lenox Square, Atlanta's grandest shopping mall, this streamlined, sparklingly white building bears a certain resemblance to the High Museum. Inside, Biedermeier furniture and modern paintings soften the geometry and lend a human scale; the 365 rooms are up to date and carefully kept, if not particularly distinctive. A branch of New York's Palm steakhouse is in the hotel. Double room: $150 to $390.
 
Where to Eat
 
BACCHINALIA, 1198 Howell Mill Road, (404) 365-0410. Newly installed in a former slaughterhouse west of downtown, Bacchinalia expends vast effort in tracking down prime raw materials: Niman ranch pork, lamb and beef; cherry-red Ahi tuna from Hawaii; cheeses from not only Italy, France and Britain, but also North Carolina, California, Arkansas and New York. Amazing Meyer lemon souffle for dessert and great California cabernets.
 
BLUEPOINTE, 3455 Peachtree Road, (404) 237-9070. At the moment, this is gastronomic ground zero for Hotlanta, a bold blend of primary colors, hard edges and wait staff in black Mandarin tunics. The fusion food is terrifyingly good-looking on the plate and packed with flavor. Try the Thai chicken and coconut soup, or the peanut-crusted grouper atop bitter choy sum greens. The atmosphere at lunch is less frenzied than at dinner.
 
BRASSERIE LE COZE, 3393 Peachtree Road, (404) 266-1440. A cousin of Le Bernardin in New York, this is a genuine brasserie, with white tile floors and Lipp-like mosaics between tall pier mirrors. Parisian dishes (onion tart, roast skate) as well as Franco-American specials (soups, salads, a roast lamb sandwich on olive bread with garlic mayonnaise) -- almost all good. Perfect for a lunch break during a shop-till-you-drop day at Lenox Square.
 
FUSEBOX, 3085 Piedmont Road, (404) 233-3383. No short-circuits here, in one of Atlanta's current hot spots. Tiny sheets of silver leaf cover the ceiling, and a boat-shaped, marble-topped common table makes lone diners welcome. The chef, Troy Thompson, has mastered a broad range of dishes, from delicate Shanghai dumplings to lobster with pasta and Thai basil to a stunning terrine of duck confit, suckling pig and foie gras. Shad roe wrapped in a filament of bacon and slowly sauteed takes on an exquisite texture.
 
DINING ROOM AT RITZ-CARLTON BUCKHEAD, 3434 Peachtree Road, (404) 237-2700. The United States is full of synthetically sophisticated Continental restaurants. This, on the other hand, is the real thing: immaculate service, directed by Peter Krehan; counter-snob wine advice from Yves Sauboua; and lean, mean, flavor-packed cuisine fashioned by the brilliant Joel Antunes, whose London restaurant, Les Saveurs, earned two Michelin stars. Try his lamb loin in puff pastry, potently flavored with coriander, curry and basil. Divine.
 
SEEGER'S, 111 West Pace's Ferry Road, (404) 846-9779. Gunther Seeger introduced world-class cooking to Atlanta, and he continues to push out its margins at his small, understated restaurant in Buckhead. His kitchen is bigger than his dining room; his style is intellectual and abstract. One example: a filet of sea bass, marinated in sake, covered with a Japanese cherry leaf. You will wonder whether you deserve such refinement.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
An Eye for the Details of His Era And a Wink at Timeless Foibles

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HONORE DAUMIER aided, abetted and recorded the emergence of so many aspects of modern art and life as we know it that you may have trouble keeping track. Look in any direction in the sprawling, illuminating retrospective of his work at the Phillips Collection here -- the largest Daumier show ever held in this country -- and you'll see the start of something big: the modern newspaper, the modern city and public transportation, working-class consciousness, agitprop and political caricature, popular art and entertainment.
One gallery is dominated by his drawings and paintings of exhausted workers in the third-class section of one of Paris's new omnibuses. Front and center is the 1831 satiric lithograph depicting the pear-headed Emperor Louis-Philippe as a gargantuan gorging on his nation's wealth, a work that earned the 23-year-old artist instant celebrity and, after a few more similarly seething images, a six-month prison term. 
 Elsewhere there are lithographs of complacent bourgeois tucked in bed, their nightcaps in place, or the allegorical figure of the French Republic chasing off Louis-Philippe's corrupt cabinet ministers at the onset of the Revolution of 1848. Understandable without consulting the labels are scathing portrayals of lawyers and doctors. And throughout there are the beautiful little paintings of actors illuminated by the footlights, theatergoers in their box seats, men playing chess or reading, painters and sculptors in their studios or, in one instance, an homage to Fragonard, talking with a beautiful model, whose yellow skirt is a shower of undulating brush work.
Daumier's art, dominated by the lithographs that appeared in French newspapers for 40 years, covers a socially and tumultuous period of his nation's history in remarkable detail. His career reached from Louis-Philippe's July Monarchy to the beginning of the Third Republic in 1870, which made democracy a reliable fact of French life nearly 100 years after the storming of the Bastille. In between were the events of 1848 and the short-lived Second Republic; the Third Empire of Louis-Napoleon, who entrusted Baron Haussmann with the creation of modern Paris; the tragedies of the Franco-Prussian War; and the chaos of the Commune.
Daumier attended to nearly all of it in the pages of La Caricature and Le Charivari, two daily newspapers overseen by the visionary Charles Philipon. One of Daumier's final political images, not in this show, appeared in Le Charivari in 1872, seven years before his death, when he was poor, losing his sight and all but forgotten. It depicted the French monarchy as finally dead, a skeletal corpse in a plain wood coffin.
Throughout, Daumier risked as much as each regime permitted, producing scathing political satire in times of relative freedom and turning to more subtle but equally penetrating social satire when censorship tightened up. His understanding of politics was astute and brutal. In 1834, in the final issue of La Caricature, which shut down when Louis-Philippe instituted harsher press laws, he depicts three heroes of the French Revolution rising from their grave while mounted soldiers suppress a protest. The caption reads, "So this is what we got ourselves killed for!"
When he turned from the political to the social, concentrating on the city's streets and courtrooms, he still managed to illuminate the winners and losers in the workings of power and to record the foibles of the growing Parisian bourgeoisie for its own amusement. In an 1858 lithograph a wealthy Parisian woman walks along a sidewalk while a gentle snow falls, its flakes accumulating on the immense architecture of her crinolines. In her wake a worn and ragged concierge holding her broom, a bent woman whose ragged skirt hangs straight, offers to remove the snow.
When it comes to his artistic development, Daumier is inextricably linked to the earliest roots of modernism: romanticism and realism. He admired the work of Gericault and Delacroix, and some of Daumier's work, especially his poignant depictions of the dreamer Don Quixote, which fill an entire gallery here, qualify him as a first rank Romantic. Still, he was a member of the generation of Millet and Courbet and the Barbizon, he shared with them an interest in the observable world, albeit a staunchly urban one. In this regard a wall label claims his 1834 lithograph "Rue Transnonain," which shows the bodies of a Parisian family murdered in the night by French troops in the days after the Revolution of 1830, as one of the first works of realist art.
But often the romantic and the real join forces. Among the exhibition's most affecting images are several ethereal drawings and watercolors of forlorn street performers and their families. These can be seen as romantic metaphors for the isolated artist, but they were partly inspired by the news of the day: the performances by which they lived were largely outlawed under the Third Empire. Either way, and although he received two or three government commissions during his life, Daumier also helped bring forth the notion of the avant-garde, of art as an oppositional activity, functioning without official sanction from government or academy.
The Phillips show, organized with the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and the Grand Palais in Paris, includes 250 works, among them hefty chunks of drawings, paintings, sculptures and the lithographs. The obligatory text panel at the beginning concludes by short-listing the artists influenced by Daumier: Degas (who amassed 4,000 Daumier lithographs), van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec and Picasso. It's impossible to see the show without adding to the list names both numerous and bewilderingly incompatible.
In front of one Daumier artwork or another, Manet, Rodin, Renoir, Seurat, Vuillard and Gauguin all spring easily to mind. Squint one eye, especially at the nervous almost shimmering lines and ambiguous expressions of Daumier's ink drawings, and from him descends both the ribaldry and torment of German Expressionism and Francis Bacon, and the delicate tangles of Giacometti and Pollock. Squint the other eye, and you've got Thomas Nast, Kathe Kollwitz, Ben Shahn and Pat Oliphant, as well as the emotional legibility of Norman Rockwell and the fluid abbreviations of Disney animation.
And since Daumier, with his photographic memory, often depicted life on the streets of Paris, he might be called a photojournalist before the fact, a predecessor of Robert Frank and Weegee. If nothing else "Rue Transnonain" is a strong candidate for the first urban tabloid crime-scene image.
In a sense Daumier was to lithography, which was in its infancy when he first took it up at age 14, what Chaplin or Keaton was to the movies: a natural genius whose artistic and emotional instincts predisposed him to a medium that was relatively unexplored, technically dazzling and implicitly populist, capable of vividly communicating the human comedy, and tragedy, to a broad swath of humans.
Everything evolved from his genius for drawing. At Philipon's suggestion, he transposed his gift for caricature into sculpture, with a series of small clay busts of Assembly members and other prominent citizens. And he familiarized himself with the contents of the Louvre, with particular attention to the monumental figures of Rubens. Sometime in the late 1830's or early 1840's he took up oil painting and began to lead the double artistic life. By 1839 he was living on the Ile de la Cite, drawing on his stones in a studio stacked with canvases turned to the wall and occasionally submitting his work to the official Salon.
His neighbors included Charles Baudelaire, who would later write that Delacroix, Ingres and Daumier were France's greatest living artists. But over the years, and especially during a three-year hiatus from Charivari in the early 1860's, Daumier managed to flesh out the basics of his drawing style -- the restless agitated line and the dramatic silhouette -- into a full-fledged painting style. He was a lifelong procrastinator: a number of the paintings in this exhibition are clearly unfinished, although that may make them of particular interest today, both for the way they expose Daumier's painting process and for their striking physiological accuracy, as demonstrated by the large canvases titled "Man on a Rope."
His primary subject from beginning to end was the human form, which he almost never failed to imbue with a convincing sense of motion and emotion, while also freeing it to function as a kind of pure, animated shape.
This is especially clear in his well-known paintings of a laundress struggling up the stairs of a quay with heavy bundle and young child in tow. One senses the different strengths and mind sets of the two figures, down to a tension in the child's head and shoulders that seems to communicate a dawning awareness of the drudgery of the mother's life. Yet their silhouettes, curving in and out, are both monumental and back-lighted, which gives them a heroic and visionary isolation, like Ryder's sailboats against the moon.
Sometimes the gestures and feelings can be broadly dramatic, as in the raised fist of the pale young man leading the crowd in "Uprising," sometimes comically melodramatic, as with his wild-eyed, flailing lawyers with their pointing fingers and fluttering robes. They could also be infinitesimally nuanced, like the bowed, quietly attentive posture of a man leafing through a folio at a print seller's outdoor stand, visible and ever so slightly different in two paintings that are both titled "The Print Collector."
If it is the job of the full-scale museum retrospective to establish its subject as a mythic Ur-artist, who relentlessly blazed trails and opened doors, this show succeeds, but only halfway. It awards Daumier his Ur-ness, but he resists mythification. His art is too modest in its form and too selfless in its ambition to succumb to myth. There is about it a sense of realness that communicates both the time and the man in a way that keeps artistic ego to a minimum.
There is also a sense of integrity that is at times hard to believe and occasionally a little boring. And finally there are comforting signs of neurosis, most notably his procrastination, which may have kept him from completely living up to his potential as a painter, while conveniently thwarting the inflationary tendencies of art history.
But there is still an unusual completeness to Daumier's art, one that may be out of step with any time, but especially our own, when the formal and the political are so widely divided. Very few artists have balanced engaging form and urgent meaning so perfectly and done so while taking such evident pleasure in the art's physical materials and processes. Even from this distance Daumier speaks to us, a whole man wholly in his art. And we can still understand much of what he says.

HEADLINE: U.S. Drug Czar Reassures Colombia on Aid

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The White House's top official on drug policy capped a three-day visit here today by touring a jungle base from which a new Colombian Armed Forces unit hopes to attack Marxist guerrillas involved in the cocaine trade. Aside from that excursion, however, most of his time here was devoted to maneuvering through the thickets of Colombian and American politics.
The trip was the second in little more than six months that Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, has made to Colombia, the source of 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States. It came as the Clinton administration is seeking Congressional approval of a $1.6 billion aid package for which General McCaffrey has strongly lobbied, warning that there is "clearly a huge drug emergency" here because of an explosion in cocaine production. 
 The proposed aid includes 63 helicopters -- 33 Blackhawks and 30 Hueys -- intended to give government units the ability to operate in coca-growing areas that the main guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, now dominates. But the distribution of aircraft between the Colombian Armed Forces and the National Police, traditional rivals, has not been determined, and both have been jockeying for advantage.
Until recently, American officials held the armed forces in low regard, preferring to work with the police, who were seen as more aggressive and less corrupt. As currently structured, the aid package calls for the armed forces to get most of the aircraft, but the police commander, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, has a warm personal relationship with conservative Republicans on Capitol Hill, whose support is essential if the aid package is to be approved.
What progress, if any, has been made in resolving the issue was unclear today. Colombian military officials would not comment. An American official traveling with General McCaffrey said there was "still a little bit of give" on the matter, which is expected to be raised at Congressional hearings in the next few weeks.
Some leaders in Colombia have expressed concern that the aid package does not do enough to address the social and economic problems that underlie the conflict with the guerrillas. There is also growing anxiety that increased American involvement here, which includes the presence of 80 to 200 American military trainers at any given time, will eventually result in direct military intervention by the United States.
So in nearly all of his appearances General McCaffrey emphasized that $270 million was scheduled to go to alternative economic development programs. He also dismissed the prospect of American intervention at every opportunity, telling one audience, "I do not anticipate an enhanced U.S. footprint in this country."
"The execution of this program is in the hand of Colombian leadership," he said of the aid package at a news conference here on Wednesday. "It is Colombian sovereignty at stake, and it must be Colombian ideas that guide this strategy."
The general's visit coincided with the release in the United States of a Human Rights Watch report charging that Colombian Army units continue to maintain links with right-wing paramilitary groups that are killing civilians and human rights advocates. Legislation passed in 1997 prohibits American military aid to units with a record of such abuses.
Questioned about the report, General McCaffrey said Colombia had a human rights problem "of gigantic proportions." But he added, "I believe the leadership of this country is committed to respecting the rule of law," citing the armed forces' commander, Gen. Fernando Tapias, by name and saying that "complaints against the armed forces have dwindled to almost nothing."
He acknowledged, however, that "when you get down to brigade level" the picture became fuzzier. So after viewing a training exercise this morning at the Tres Esquinas base, the home of the first of three new antinarcotics battalions being trained and financed by the United States, he reminded soldiers that their responsibility included "your respect for human rights."

HEADLINE: China and Europeans Break Off Talks on W.T.O. Membership

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Chinese and European Union negotiators broke off talks today on China's entry to the World Trade Organization, further complicating the country's troubled bid to join the body. No date was set to resume the talks.
"The gap has narrowed, but we are not there yet," said Hans-Friedrich Beseler, head of the European team. 
 A spokeswoman for the European Union described the end of the talks in Beijing more graphically, saying they had "broken down" in their fourth day.
China's chief negotiator, Long Yongtu, said the two sides had "come very close," the official New China News Agency reported tonight.
The halt in negotiations is the latest check in China's marathon application process, which has been dragging on for 14 years. Last year, the United States and China finally agreed to China's membership terms. But China has to reach similar agreements with all members of the organization before it can join. The European Union represents the most important bloc of countries still seeking an accord. India signed a pact with China on Tuesday.
China still has a good chance of entering this year, despite the slow progress.
A more imposing threat to its membership is growing opposition in the United States. Congress would have to lift its annual review of China's trading status and grant it permanent normal trade relations to benefit from the terms of China's eventual membership. But Congressional support has eroded because of resistance from organized labor and rising tensions over Taiwan.
China can technically enter regardless of the vote in Congress. Both the United States and Cuba are members, despite trade restrictions between the two. But officials of the trade group say China has so far indicated that it will not join unless the United States ends the annual reviews, a vestige of sanctions imposed on China after its crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in 1989.
An agreement with the Europeans is still within reach. European diplomats say unresolved issues include how extensively foreign telecommunications companies can provide services in China, constraints on business licenses and areas for foreign insurers and how open China will be to European agricultural and food products.
"The issues are the 20 percent that haven't been covered in the U.S. agreement," said a European diplomat here who is familiar with the negotiations.
In some cases, the Europeans are trying to clarify areas left vague by the talks with the United States, particularly on foreign investment in Chinese telecommunications networks. Companies as diverse as Sprint Communications and France Telecom made such investments through a complex holding structure referred to as China-China-foreign joint ventures. But China later declared those investments illegal and demanded that they be unwound, basically nationalizing millions of dollars in foreign investment.
The United States-China trade accord allowed foreign companies to eventually own up to 49 percent of fixed-line and mobile telecommunications networks, and many industry executives hoped that would resolve the dispute. But China has since offered a different interpretation, insisting that the existing investments are still illegal.
"This is an issue that is very important for the union, because there are some European companies involved, and they want a better resolution," the European diplomat said.
In other cases, the European Union is pushing for concessions that the United States was unable or unwilling to obtain. The Europeans want China to let foreigners have controlling stakes in telecommunications networks, for example.
And they want additional business licenses for European insurers. China has granted licenses to just 14 foreign insurers, including 5 American and 5 European companies. But some American companies hold more than one license.
The Europeans also want foreign insurers to be allowed to sell group insurance beyond the two cities where such sales are allowed. Group insurance, covering employees at labor-bloated state enterprises, for example, is the most promising segment of the Chinese insurance market.
Despite the breakdown today, European diplomats and business executives noted that China's negotiations with the European Union resumed just last month, after having been suspended last year pending an agreement with the United States.
"There have only been two rounds," the diplomat said. "It's not a tragedy."

Short-Term Treasury Prices Rise Amid Optimism on Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Most Treasury securities rose in price yesterday on increasing optimism that the Federal Reserve will be successful in slowing growth enough to keep inflation from accelerating in the months ahead.
The specter of rising interest rates caused stock prices to slump, as some investors sold and beat a path to bonds, which also got added support from data showing that factory orders for durable goods fell 1.3 percent in January after posting a big gain in December. 
 Initial jobless claims, however, fell by 7,000 last week, to 278,000, more than expected. It was the second weekly drop, and suggests that the supply of labor is still shrinking.
The benchmark 30-year bond slipped 4/32 to a price of 10120/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.13 percent, up one-hundredth of a percentage point from Wednesday.
But notes with shorter maturities showed strong gains. A 10-year note was up almost a half-point in price, to yield 6.36 percent, down from 6.41 percent on Wednesday.
Analysts noted that the report yesterday of the 1.3 percent decline in durable goods orders in January had been expected, but it did help to get the bond market off on a good note early in the session.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said durable goods orders remained very strong; the January decline was almost offset by the upward revision to the December number.
Moreover, the orders are still a very good indicator that production in the coming months will continue to show its recent momentum. "But the real story of the day in terms of the bond market's improvement was the flight to quality out of the stock market," Mr. Fine said.
"Market expectations for another round of Fed tightening at the March 21 Federal Open Market Committee meeting are becoming ubiquitous," Mr. Fine said, referring to the Federal Reserve panel that sets interest rate policy, "in light of the booming economy and extremely low unemployment rate. The key issues now are timing and extent."
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed income department at J. W. Genesis Financial in Boca Raton, Fla., said that he thought the financial markets were captives of the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, the equity markets and the big hedge funds.
"While Mr. Greenspan may be the gatekeeper, the equity markets and the big hedge funds are dictating the prices and direction," Mr. Pugliese said. "We are not value trading at this point. But if we're not at the low point in prices in the 5- to 10-year sectors, we're very close to it."
In fact, in the municipal market, he said, long-term, tax-free AAA bonds can be bought that yield the same as government bonds. "People are so mesmerized by the equity market and double-digit returns that it's going to take a while for investors to see the value in fixed-income products, because that's where some tremendous values are," Mr. Pugliese said.
Elsewhere, Honeywell International plans to sell $1 billion of 10-year global bonds through J. P. Morgan Securities and Salomon Smith Barney. The deal is expected to be priced at about 120 basis points more than Treasuries with a similar maturity.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
A Rogue Worth Knowing

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
As the song says: You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind's blowing. All you need, actually, is to look at the recent Iranian elections, where the Great Satan had a Great Week.
The Iranian parliamentary election, in which a disparate group of moderate reformers chopped, diced and sliced the conservatives, was a political earthquake -- rich with lessons and opportunities. We must take advantage of this, because nothing would change the geopolitics of the Mideast more than sustained moderation of Iran's external behavior. 
 Let's start with the lessons. Iran's elections are a reminder that despite its shameful track record in supporting terrorism, Iran has democratic politics. This is not Iraq or Saudi Arabia. Iran also teaches us that in a world where, thanks to globalization, we all increasingly know how each other lives, people increasingly demand the same things, no matter how isolated they seem -- and these things are the broad freedom to choose one's own life style, to lift one's own living standards and to be part of the global conversation.
The other lesson of Iran is that in a world defined by the economic, cultural and military centrality of the United States, even ostensible rogue states -- such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Syria -- are now, for reasons of self-preservation, groping for ties to the Great Satan.
This is going to become a central U.S. foreign-policy issue. For now, all the presidential candidates are too busy misrepresenting themselves and their opponents to debate it. That's actually a good thing. In fact, I'm in favor of a ban on foreign-policy debates in this election, because it will reduce by 50 percent the number of promises the winner will have to break. And, be honest, do you really want to know what George W. Bush thinks of the Grecians? Nah. Let's stick to Bob Jones University.
Because to deal with Iran, Cuba, North Korea and Syria the next president will have to demonstrate exactly what candidates cannot: courage, patience, subtlety -- what the Wilson Center's Robert Litwak in his important new book, "Rogue States and U.S. Foreign Policy," calls "differentiated strategies that address the particular conditions of each country."
During the cold war, U.S. policy was basically an undifferentiated competition between Republicans and Democrats over who could be most against North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Syria. Today U.S. policy needs to focus on how to bring these countries down from the rogue tree into a U.S.-dominated international system, without their falling -- splat -- on the ground. Because Cuba and North Korea threaten us most today by their weakness -- by the fact that Cuba could collapse and spew out refugees all over South Florida, and North Korea could collapse and spew out missiles on the Korean Peninsula, where 37,000 U.S. troops are based.
Our policy toward both should be conditional engagement. We should offer normalized trade and investment with Cuba on the condition that U.S. companies there can pay workers directly, and not through the Cuban state. And with North Korea we should offer increasing investment and diplomatic relations on the condition that North Korea not only keep its own nuclear program halted, but desist in missile sales to others.
The chest-beaters will call this appeasement. I call it assisted suicide. John McCain's policy of "rogue rollback," which involves supporting insurgency movements against rogue regimes, plays great on the campaign trail, but it would create an awful mess on the 38th parallel. I'm for classic deterrence and poison carrots, not Bay of Pigs II.
With Iran, the pro-Western reformers say they need a gesture, like loosening U.S. economic sanctions, to give them political cover for detente with the U.S. I say give it to them, while holding the ban on sales of any military technology. We're the superpower. We can afford to be forthcoming, because the stakes here are huge. Iran is still a long way from requalifying for a Boy Scout troop, but any sustained moderation in its behavior would ease the pressure on America's Arab friends and Israel, increase the isolation of Saddam Hussein and open up all sorts of policy options in Central Asia.
Syria is yet another case. Washington needs to keep building a bridge to Israeli-Syrian peace, but the Syrian regime may be too paralyzed to cross it. Never mind. Syria's collapse is the least threatening to anyone. Cuba, North Korea, Iran -- they explode. Syria implodes.

HEADLINE: Monuments to the Thai Debt;
Real Estate Fiascoes Rear Their Heads On Bangkok Skyline

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: BANGKOK

 BODY:
At night, the beer garden outside the World Trade Center shopping center here fills with some of the thousands of customers who have recently begun returning to the mall, its movie theater, its ice-skating ring and its Pizza Hut -- as sure a sign as any that this Southeast Asian economy has turned the corner.
Right next door, however, is quite a different sign. There stands what by mid-1997 was supposed to have been the 63-story World Trade Tower office building. Papaya trees grow around the gaping hole where the underground parking lot was to have been. Floor numbers that workers painted on the windowless stories tally their abortive progress: they got to 39 and stopped. 
 "There's no money to finish," said Sujin Yookongdee, the World Trade Center's deputy director of building administration, standing outside briefing a clutch of security guards. "It's a big problem in Thailand."
Anusaowaree, or monuments, is what many of Bangkok's residents have jokingly come to call the dozens of unfinished high-rises that dot the city's hazy skyline, grim reminders of the problems that still loom over the economy.
All told, there are roughly 300 such buildings in Bangkok, from skyscrapers to single-family dwellings. Like the skeletons left behind in Houston and Dallas in the 1980's when the land boom in Texas went bust as oil prices crashed, the unfinished buildings here are vestiges of Bangkok's recent property calamity. America's real estate collapse gave way to the savings and loan crisis; when Thailand's bubble burst, it set the stage in mid-1997 for the avalanche in asset values that swallowed Asia and seemed to menace the global financial system.
This month, the International Monetary Fund declared the financial crisis in Thailand over.
Over, perhaps, but not entirely solved. Most of the unfinished buildings represent the collateral behind nearly 2 trillion baht (around $53 billion) in nonperforming loans still encumbering Thailand's financial system. Strengthened bankruptcy laws are giving bankers leverage against politically powerful debtors loathe to part with assets. But the laws are far from flawless and the real estate market remains so depressed that banks are in no hurry to grab their collateral anyway. With nearly 40 percent of Bangkok's completed office space empty, few are eager to spend money to finish the buildings.
"What we don't need is another office building in Bangkok," said Paworamon Suvarnatemee, an analyst at ING Baring in Bangkok.
So the buildings sit, their lightless, empty spaces worrying passers-by and frustrating city planners, legacies of the often questionable ways some of Bangkok's wealthiest families built and borrowed.
Five years ago, Bangkok was a frenetic boomtown. Adding to the fumes of four million cars cramming the streets was the acrid dust billowing out from a construction boom gone haywire. More than 100,000 licenses to build were handed out in Bangkok in 1995, according to the central bank.
From 1990 to 1995, banks tripled their loans for property development. And they usually based the loans on little more than the market value of the property. As prices collapsed, so did the value of the collateral. Loan payments dried up; construction cranes froze on the skyline.
The 10 billion baht World Trade Tower was supposed to open in mid-1997, the crown jewel in the real estate empire of the powerful Tejapaibul family.
From a string of pawn shops, the patriarch, Udane Tejapaibul, had expanded into whiskey production and helped found the Bangkok Metropolitan Bank in 1950. In 1987, Mr. Udane's son Vichien Tejapaibul became president of the bank and used loans from it to finance the family's property investments. These included a contract from the Crown Property Bureau, the business arm of Thailand's royal family, to build the World Trade Center on the site of an old palace.
By the end of the 90's, the flagging real estate market and fierce competition in the whiskey business brought the Tejapaibul's bank to its knees. Construction of the World Trade Tower stopped. The central bank, which had warned Bangkok Metropolitan about its incestuous lending policies, forced Mr. Vichien off the board and took over the bank.
The Tejapaibuls are close to restructuring the 2.6 billion baht the bank owed for the World Trade Center's construction, part of roughly five billion baht the family's companies still owe the bank they once owned.
Thailand's real estate problems and its attempts to resolve the subsequent crisis resemble what happened in the United States when the Resolution Trust Corporation tried to solve the resulting savings-and-loan mess.
In late 1997, Thailand shut down 56 insolvent finance companies. A year later, the government began auctioning off their roughly $22 billion in bad loans and collateral. The unfinished office buildings on average fetched just half their book value, part of a liquidation that earned plaudits from abroad but generated widespread criticism at home as a fire sale for foreign bargain hunters.
The biggest banks, with their even larger pile of nonperforming loans, were left largely to deal with the problems themselves. "Therein lies the giant difference between Thailand and the U.S.," said Jack R. Rodman, managing director of Asian real estate services at E & Y Kenneth Leventhal.
They have been making steady, if slow, progress. A year ago, more than half their loans were at least three months past due. Write-offs and restructuring agreements have brought that portion down to 40 percent. And a new, more transparent lending culture appears to be taking hold. Still, many property owners have been able to fend off the banks and so avoid selling cherished property at a discount.
One such property is the unfinished Hotel Sofitel Riverside, a 550-room luxury hotel that is the stillborn offspring of a venture involving the French hotel company Accor and Thatree Boondicharoen, a Thai real estate developer. Mr. Thatree's company, Univest Land, borrowed heavily to help finance an expanding portfolio of development projects, including the hotel.
By 1997, rising interest rates and falling property prices were taking their toll. The company's stock was delisted after it failed to file financial statements; the last annual report, in 1997, recorded a loss of 5.5 billion baht. As the company hemorrhaged, many of its projects went into limbo, including the Sofitel, which Univest controlled with a 45 percent stake. (Accor has a 20 percent interest.)
"It's just sitting there," said Accor's regional vice president, Reggie Shiu, of the hotel he estimates has so far cost 1.6 billion baht.
Mr. Shiu said that it would take one billion baht to finish the Sofitel. Univest Land, he said, has turned away potential buyers offering to buy the hotel at a discount. "We can't control our destiny, and the money's down the drain," Mr. Shiu said.
Mr. Thatree did not respond to numerous requests for an interview.
A tougher bankruptcy law, enacted last year, is scaring some debtors back to the negotiating table, analysts say. But concerns that the law still lacks teeth, leaving a two-year deadlock between Thailand's largest corporate debtor, Thai Petrochemical Industry, and its creditors unresolved, have sent stock prices in Bangkok plunging this month.
Complicating the situation even more is the fact that the biggest debts are often owed by the most influential people.
For example, Mr. Vichien, the former president of Bangkok Metropolitan Bank, was charged with violating a four-year-old central bank order against lending to his bank's subsidiaries. But the statute of limitations ran out on that case because prosecutors could not pursue it against Mr. Vichien, who as a sitting senator is immune from prosecution as long as he remains in office. The Thai Senate last month blocked a request by the police to question Mr. Vichien. The police have also, according to a local newspaper report, charged Mr. Vichien with "dishonestly performing his duty and causing damage to Bangkok Metropolitan Bank," a charge that has a 15-year statute of limitations, allowing them to bring the case if he loses office.
Mr. Vichien, who has denied any wrongdoing, declined to be interviewed for this article.
Connections like these account in part for a lack of resolve at the banks to tackle powerful debtors. "They don't want to mess around with these kings," Mr. Rodman said. While an American bank might foreclose and finish the building, Thai banks are reluctant to jeopardize talks involving much larger debts. "Foreclosure is not what you do to a guy who owes you billions in other businesses," Mr. Rodman said.
Indeed, analysts say, some banks grant favored debtors generous grace periods or other accommodations and call it a resolution to a bad debt. "Some of that is real, some of that we think is dubious," said Deborah Schuler, senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service in Hong Kong. Moody's still considers Thailand's banking system technically insolvent.
Thailand's economy appears to be moving along nevertheless. It grew last year, and economists predict that Thailand's gross domestic product will expand by roughly 4 percent this year, making life a little easier for both bankers and borrowers.
As the economy recovers, said David G. Fernandez, an economist with J. P. Morgan in Singapore, "it will lift most boats."
Some construction projects are already afloat, but that does not necessarily mean they are problem free.
Workers are, for example, putting the finishing touches on the 63-story Royal Charoen Krung Tower. Promoted as Southeast Asia's largest building, the tower, a 3.6-million- square-foot monolith with residential time-share and commercial space, looms over the pharmacies and jewelry shops around it.
First scheduled to open in 1996, the Royal Charoen Krung fell behind schedule in part because Rangsan Torsuwan, the flamboyant architect who designed and owned it, was forced to sell it.
The buyer was Rasri Bualert, a real estate tycoon and Thailand's only female arms dealer. Ms. Rasri helped pay for the project with a loan from the government-run Krung Thai Bank, a loan that is now among the nonperforming loans that account for at least 60 percent of the bank's overall portfolio. Last year, auditors from PricewaterhouseCoopers, reporting that the bank had weak lending standards, singled out the loan as a glaring example.
Ms. Rasri declined to be interviewed for this article. Krung Thai officials did not return phone calls.
Brightening economic prospects have prompted developers to dust off roughly a quarter of the anusaowaree, Bangkok officials say. The fate of the rest seems to lie to some extent in the city's hands.
Though the market is still depressed, the city wants to hasten their completion and remove the unsightly reminders. According to Bangkok's deputy governor, Banasopit Mekvichay, the city is planning to help developers devise alternatives for the buildings -- even offering them easier licensing terms for converting, say, an office building into apartments. Bangkok is also studying the possibility of arranging some form of low-cost financing to entice owners into completing their projects, she said.
"When they finish the project, they can return the money," Ms. Banasopit said.

Umpires Get New Union as Phillips Is Out

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 24

 BODY:
The controversial, often raucous 22-year reign of Richie Phillips as the major league umpires' labor leader came to a quiet end today with a three-paragraph pronouncement from the National Labor Relations Board.
A three-member panel of the five-member board certified the insurgent umpires group headed by John Hirschbeck and Joe Brinkman of the American League after rejecting objections filed by the Major League Umpires Association to an election last Nov. 30 that the new group won handily. 
 Now that it has been anointed as the umpires' collective bargaining representative, the group, which has taken the name World Umpires Association, can begin negotiations with Major League Baseball for a labor agreement to replace the one that expired Dec. 31. Representatives of both sides said they thought talks could begin as early as next week.
The timing of the board's decision was tinged with some irony, coming at the same time an arbitrator resumed a hearing into the defeated union's effort to salvage the jobs of 22 umpires who were the victims of Phillips's failed mass resignation strategy last July. Phillips attended the hearing in Philadelphia and did not return a telephone call to his office seeking comment.
Hirschbeck, who has been nominated to be president of the new union, was elated at the board's announcement. It came just ahead of a meeting that had previously been scheduled for Sunday in Phoenix at which the umpires will vote on the bylaws and elect officers of the new union.
"The meeting was going to be another step in formalizing the whole process," Hirschbeck said in nearby Phoenix. "This changes things a little bit. It changes the atmosphere. Now we can announce we're certified and we are the legal bargaining agent for major league umpires."
Negotiations for a new agreement will include baseball's plan to place all umpires under the auspices of the commissioner's office. The two leagues have always had separate umpiring staffs. Until a new agreement is in place, the umpires will continue to operate within their leagues.
"We've already made spring training assignments that contemplated separate leagues and separate umpiring staffs consistent with the old agreement," Sandy Alderson, head of baseball operations, said by telephone from New York. "I expect none of that would be changed through spring training."
The first item of business the two sides will have to address is the old agreement. Under labor law, the expired contract disappears with the decertified union.
"The expired agreement is something we'll be discussing immediately with baseball," said Joel Smith, a Baltimore labor lawyer, who will represent the new union. "What I'd like to do is bridge the last existing agreement for the interim."
Phillips, a Philadelphia lawyer, has negotiated every labor agreement the umpires have had, gaining significant economic improvements in salaries, bonuses for special events and termination pay. He also won significant in-season vacations for the umpires. Sometimes the gains were made accompanied by strikes and lockouts and always with boisterous proclamations and threats by Phillips.
But Phillips blundered last July when he proposed that all umpires sign letters of resignations effective Sept. 2 as a way of forcing baseball officials to the bargaining table sooner rather than later. More than 50 of the 68 umpires signed letters, but many, most of them in the American League, quickly rescinded them. League presidents ultimately hired 25 new umpires and accepted the resignations of 22 of those who had stuck to the Phillips strategy.
Most of the opposition to the tactic was in the American League; most of the support for it was in the National League. An insurgent group made up mostly of A.L. umpires petitioned the N.L.R.B. to hold a certification election and won by 57-35.
The Phillips faction filed a challenge to the election, alleging improprieties by the insurgents and by Major League Baseball. After hearing testimony, an N.L.R.B. hearing officer, David E. Leach III, upheld the election results.
The old union appealed Leach's ruling to the five-member labor board in Washington Feb. 4, and three of the members, the chairman John C. Truesdale, Sarah M. Fox and Peter J. Hurtgen, issued their ruling today upholding Leach's decision.

HEADLINE: American Relations With Iran

 BODY:
The victory won by reformers in Iran's parliamentary elections should encourage the Clinton administration to try again to defrost relations between Washington and Tehran. Earlier efforts were rebuffed, in part because Iran's harshly anti-American clerical leaders limited President Mohammad Khatami's options. Those leaders, who outrank both Mr. Khatami and the Parliament, may still prove a formidable obstacle. But their position has been weakened by the parliamentary vote. They cannot ignore the electorate's clear desire to end Iran's international isolation.
Until the power struggle between reformers and conservative clerics is fully resolved, only limited reconciliation may be possible. But Washington should use this period to ease some economic sanctions and demonstrate its support for the reform agenda the voters endorsed, including increased trade with the West. The White House could begin by offering to open discussions about paying off some of Iran's longstanding financial claims against the United States, and selectively easing sanctions on Iranian consumer exports like caviar and pistachio nuts. 
 Iran's ruling clerics are out of touch with their people's attitude toward the United States. America's rigid support of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi's repressive dictatorship has not been forgotten. But just over 50 percent of Iranians today are under 25. What matters most for them is a chance to share in the economic opportunities of the 21st century.
It is in America's interest as well to reach out to Iran -- a regional power with some 70 million people, large oil reserves and a long tradition of friendship with the United States. Repairing ties with Tehran would also make it easier for Washington to contain Iraq, whose biological and chemical weapons programs make it a greater threat.
Three main issues must be resolved before fully normal relations can resume. Iran has to end support for international terrorism, reconcile itself to peacemaking between Israel and the Arabs and halt efforts to develop nuclear weapons. In each of these areas, resistance comes primarily from the conservative clerics. Washington is increasingly satisfied that Mr. Khatami and his reform allies have no connection with terrorist activity. An American gesture on financial claims or exports could help Iran's reformers begin to reshape their country's self-defeating foreign policies.

Kuwait, in a Switch, Agrees to Consider Increasing Output of Oil

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: KUWAIT, Feb. 24

 BODY:
In a shift that could set the stage for lower oil prices, Kuwait agreed today to at least consider raising output levels, joining other major petroleum exporters that appear to be leaning toward more production.
The change of position by Kuwait, one of the most important producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, came during a visit by the United States Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson, who has been touring OPEC and non-OPEC member nations as part of a campaign by the Clinton administration to seek higher production. The administration is under intense political pressure to lower soaring prices for heating oil and fuel. 
 Mr. Richardson, who has called supplies perilously low in the United States, is to visit Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter and the dominant OPEC member, on Friday.
Oil prices have more than doubled in the last year, to $30 a barrel, the highest in nine years, partly because of an agreement by the big producers a year ago to cut production significantly.
Several producers, including Saudi Arabia, have hinted that they now want to increase production to help push the price per barrel back to the low $20's, though an agreement on how much they would raise production has not been reached. Kuwait's change of position increases the possibility that they will come to such an agreement.
At a news conference today, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, said Kuwait would not oppose considering higher production levels when the current quotas set by OPEC expire in March.
The Kuwaiti shift was by no means inevitable, administration officials said today. Mr. Richardson has worked hard before and during this 10-day tour to persuade Kuwait to abandon its advocacy of high prices.
Officials said the Kuwaiti agreement to review production levels was partly a result of at least four telephone calls in the last three days between Mr. Richardson and Sheik Saud discussing the importance Washington places on lowering and stabilizing oil prices. In addition, Kuwait has been pressed by other leading oil producers and Arab states alarmed about the economic effect of petroleum inflation.
The Kuwaitis were also persuaded by a technical briefing in which United States energy officials produced new data on plummeting United States fuel stockpiles -- data that helped drive oil prices higher today.
Several officials said Sheik Saud and his oil experts were impressed by the presentation from Jay E. Hakes, administrator of the Energy Information Administration, an Energy Department agency.
According to several accounts of the meeting, Mr. Hakes warned that new data collected weekly by his agency showed that United States fuel reserves in the Northeast were "dangerously low" -- in fact, the lowest in 20 years -- and that Americans were "skating on thin ice" in meeting energy requirements.
Several officials said, however, that the decisive factor in Kuwait's reversal was the importance the ruling family places on preserving the sheikdom's close relations with the United States, which liberated Kuwait from occupation by Iraq nine years ago and remains its principal security guarantor.
Mr. Richardson, who is making his first visit here, called Kuwait "an extremely strong ally." Eight thousand American soldiers are based here, and Washington sent in reinforcements when Iraq threatened the sheikdom again in 1998.
In a joint communique and respective comments, Mr. Richardson and Sheik Saud said they had agreed on three basic points: price volatility was harmful; market stability was their common goal, and "adequate oil supplies at reasonable prices is of crucial importance for sustaining world economic growth, prosperity and investment in the energy sector."
Mr. Richardson declined to say what the United States considered a "reasonable" price. "I'm not here to negotiate the price of oil," he told reporters after the meeting.
Nor had he come to Kuwait to press it to conform to an emerging consensus that oil prices are excessive.
"I don't threaten," Mr. Richardson said. "I don't pressure. I don't suggest. I explain."
But there was clearly some resentment among Kuwaiti oil officials about what they described as United States indifference to the relative economic hardship Kuwait endured when oil prices stood at $10 a barrel less than two years ago. Kuwait, Sheik Saud reminded the Americans, derives 98 percent of its budget from oil sales. High prices have enabled the country to rebound from a severe recession in 1998.
For these reasons, Kuwait had been among the most ardent proponents of higher prices. But Kuwait's shift of position today also reflected recognition that high prices jeopardize the global economic growth upon which future oil sales depend.
Moreover, Sheik Saud told Mr. Richardson, two thirds of Kuwait's foreign investments are in the United States.
The current crisis over oil prices began in March 1999 when OPEC producers, prodded by the price hawks -- Iran, Algeria and Kuwait -- cut production by 4.3 million barrels a day.
Several officials and oil experts said that support was now building among the largest OPEC and non-OPEC producers for an approach that would increase production in the next economic quarter, and then perhaps again the following quarter.
Mr. Richardson called Kuwait's endorsement of the need to review production levels "real progress." But he said important meetings lay ahead, including one in London this weekend among ministers from Mexico, which is not an OPEC member, and Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. All three countries are said to endorse the concept of higher production.

CNN Anchor Goes Coast to Coast
CNN is accommodating its half of a two-network couple. WILLOW BAY, who became a co-anchor of "Moneyline" after LOU DOBBS quit last year, will move from Manhattan to Los Angeles and do the program from there. 
 CNN says this change will make "Moneyline" "the first bicoastal evening news program of its kind." That is the kind of accomplishment networks like to brag about. But the move will also let Ms. Bay live in the same city as her husband, ROBERT A. IGER, who was promoted to president of the Walt Disney Company last month.
Mr. Iger, who was chairman of the ABC Group, has been traveling between coasts. "He's pretty much kept his commuting to Monday through Wednesday or Monday through Thursday," an ABC executive in New York said, "and they spend every weekend together here."
A CNN spokeswoman, CHRISTA ROBINSON, said, "We are accommodating Willow's relocation, but this dovetails nicely with Shelby Coffey's plans to expand our West Coast presence, and the new economy." She added, "If it makes us more family friendly, so be it." (SHELBY COFFEY III is the president of CNN Business News and CNNfn.)
 
Mercy Mission
When they learned their 2-year-old daughter had a rare liver disease that could be treated only in New York, JOYBELLE and DEORTIME JAMANDRE of the Philippines sold their house, their clothes, even their kitchen utensils.
But when their daughter, NICOLE, undergoes surgery at New York Presbyterian Hospital next week, she will have a police escort, and her hospital bills will be fully paid, thanks in part to POLICE COMMISSIONER HOWARD SAFIR, who has taken an interest in her case.
Mr. Safir is on the board of the Forum Club's Children of the World Foundation, an organization based in New York that arranges for sick children from around the world to see world-class medical specialists. Nicole's case is the most difficult the foundation has dealt with; she will receive a piece of one parent's liver.
"With the other cases, it is simply a question of getting a doctor and getting a hospital," Mr. Safir said. "In this case, we have a child who needs significant resources and medications." The drugs she needs cost about $70,000.
"The thing that appeals to me about this little girl is the same thing that appeals to me with all these kids," Mr. Safir said. "They are going to die without help, and being able to help them is as good a thing as anyone could do in this world."
 
Living Proof
ROBERT CLAYTON has been quoting Mark Twain ("the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated"), but in Mr. Clayton's case, there was only one report. It appeared in his college alumni magazine, Columbia College Today.
How did an obituary on Mr. Clayton, who is 74 and who graduated in 1948 with a degree in political science, make it into the magazine? "I would rather not go into it," said ALEX SACHARE, the magazine's editor. "An error was made."
Mr. Clayton said the magazine had apologized, sending letters saying it had erred to his classmates. The magazine apparently sent similar letters to members of a secret society known as the Nacoms, which is pronounced like "knock 'em dead," except that Mr. Clayton isn't.
"It gives me the rare opportunity to nitpick my own obituary and get things straight up there," said Mr. Clayton, who, as the article noted, was a real estate executive and held class office as a loyal alumnus. "My God, I was president of my class. They say I was first vice president. This was in the 60's, maybe even the early 70's." For a while, as the obituary said, he was also his class of 1948's correspondent for the very magazine that reported his death, a mistake that he said would not have happened on his watch. "Heavens, no," he said. "I am a religious reader of The New Yorker. They have one of the best checking departments in the world. Checking is, in my opinion, very important."

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Were Lower Last Month

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
Orders to the nation's factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell in January, led by the steepest decline in orders for electronic and other electrical equipment in two and a half years.
The Commerce Department reported today that orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- dropped 1.3 percent last month, the first decline since October, to a seasonally adjusted $214.8 billion. 
 That followed a sizzling 6.3 percent advance in December -- the biggest gain in seven years. The December increase had been reported earlier at 5.5 percent.
Even with the drop, January's performance was stronger than the 2 percent decline many analysts were forecasting.
Still, economists, who were predicting a decrease, have cautioned that a drop in durable-goods orders should not be viewed as weakness in the industrial sector. Economists said the underlying trend in orders remained firm, and they expect manufacturers to perform well this year.
Over all, orders in January were 6.5 percent higher than in January of last year.
Strong business and consumer spending is fueling the red-hot economy. On Friday, the government will release a revised estimate for the economy's growth in the last three months of 1999 and some economists believe it will be much stronger than the 5.8 percent rate the government initially estimated.
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week fell by 7,000, to 278,000, suggesting that employers continue to have trouble finding workers to fill openings.
The Federal Reserve has bumped up interest rates four times since June, totaling a full percentage point. Even though those actions made borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, the higher rates still have not had much impact in terms of significantly slowing the economy. Given that, many economists widely expect the central bank to raise rates again on March 21.

In Making I.M.F. Choice, U.S. Must Decide Whom to Offend

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24

 BODY:
The Clinton administration found itself at the center of a clash today that will force it to choose between angering close European allies or the world's developing nations in appointing the chief of one of the world's important financial institutions -- the International Monetary Fund.
The battle has echoes of the administration's move in 1996 to oust the head of the United Nations and replace him with Kofi Annan. This job, too, is sensitive and complex: chief trauma manager for the world's economic crises. 
 The White House must now decide whether to vote for a German candidate it regards as unsuited for the job, or for Stanley Fischer, the highly regarded deputy director of the I.M.F. Mr. Fischer, an American Jew who was born in Africa, has emerged as the choice of developing nations. These include much of Africa and most Arab nations -- including Iraq, Syria and Libya, not exactly friends of United States policy. The Arab countries have never before supported a Jewish nominee for such a high international post.
American officials say they have nothing but the highest regard for Mr. Fischer, who was backed for the No. 2 post at the I.M.F. by Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers, a former student of Mr. Fischer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But Mr. Summers seems unlikely to be able to cast America's decisive vote -- it has 19 percent of the voting shares of the I.M.F., more than any other country -- for his old friend and economic colleague.
The top I.M.F. post has customarily been Europe's to fill, and the White House fears angering Europe, and particularly Germany, by taking the choice out of its hands. Germany's candidate is Caio Koch-Weser, its deputy finance minister and a former World Bank official.
The White House argument goes like this: Washington traditionally chooses the head of the World Bank -- it just succeeded in gaining reappointment of James D. Wolfensohn -- and it is already accused of dominating major international institutions.
Yet many inside and outside the government fear that backing Europe's choice, and rejecting that of developing nations, would be a great mistake.
"Here, the U.S. has this incredible chance to do what it said it wants to do -- make a new partnership with the developing world -- and vote for the man who is obviously most qualified for the job," said Robert O. Boorstin, who left the Treasury last year after acting as an international policy adviser to former Secretary Robert E. Rubin. "It says volumes that the developing world," which has often been at odds with the economic strictures of the I.M.F., "has found itself able to back someone like Stan," Mr. Boorstin said.
As the No. 2 official of the fund, Mr. Fischer runs its day-to-day operations. He was the field commander from the early stages of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, and he was criticized for imposing too much austerity in Thailand, Indonesia and other nations. But he changed gears and the formula he put together for economic recovery, while still controversial, has brought about results. Thailand, even with some overcapacity, is back in business; South Korea has largely recovered, and Indonesia's pain is chiefly a result of continuing political ferment.
Never before, however, has the top job at the I.M.F. been filled from its lower ranks. And if Mr. Fischer loses in his surprise bid for the top job, it raises questions about whether he could continue as the deputy.
In an interview today, though, he said: "If the members choose to appoint me, I will be honored to fill the job. I have every intention of continuing in this job if I am not elected."
The movement to nominate Mr. Fischer appears to have originated with South Africa and other African countries. He was formally nominated by Angola, which represents 20 African nations on the I.M.F. board.
Support quickly grew, and now includes India, Mexico and other major developing nations.
The American strategy now appears to be to persuade the Europeans to drop Mr. Koch-Weser and come up with another candidate from a list that includes Gordon Brown, the British chancellor of the exchequer, and a small group of other European finance officials. France is unhappy with the choice of Mr. Koch-Weser and has been trying to come up with an alternative -- though it appears unlikely to support Mr. Fischer.
"We have not supported or encouraged any of the nominations to date," said Michelle Smith, spokeswoman for Mr. Summers. "Our position has been, and continues to be to work toward a strong European candidate who can command widespread respect and support, including from the emerging markets. We want to work with Europe toward that objective."
But one of Mr. Fischer's main backers, Shakour Shaalan, an Egyptian member of the I.M.F. board who represents 12 other countries as well, said his group was trying to do more than block the European candidate. "Stan has gained the respect of the developing nations and has been sensitive to its concerns," he said. And he noted the oddity of the Arab countries' nominating a Jew, but said: "Members of my constituency are not looking at him as Jewish or non-Jewish. That's not the issue."
There is a third candidate, as well: Eisuke Sakakibara, the outspoken, sometimes nationalistic former vice minister of finance for international affairs in Japan. He has Tokyo's support, and support in some other Asian capitals, but is not considered a viable candidate for the job. After an initial, secret vote in a straw poll, probably next week, he may drop out. In that case, Japan and some of the other Asians would presumably choose between the European candidate and Mr. Fischer.

HEADLINE: After a Pardon and 39 Years, a Black Exile Comes Home

BYLINE: By EMILY YELLIN 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Ga., Feb. 24

 BODY:
After 39 years of exile in Britain, Australia and Africa, Preston King finally woke up at home today in America.
And while the day was marked by the solemn tasks of visiting his parents' graves for the first time and attending his oldest brother's funeral, Mr. King also found himself experiencing feelings of wonder at the sea changes in the social order of his southern Georgia hometown, where he had not set foot since 1961. 
 "It really is like being Rip Van Winkle," said Mr. King, 63, a professor of politics at the University of Lancaster in Britain.
Mr. King was a 24-year-old graduate student in the early 1960's when the draft board here, after learning that he was black, stopped referring to him as Mr. King and began addressing him as Preston. Mr. King said at the time that he was willing to serve in the military as long as the board called him by the same respectful title it had used in correspondence when it assumed he was white.
The board refused, and Mr. King was convicted of draft evasion by an all-white jury and sentenced to 18 months in prison. While on bail, he fled to Britain, where he enrolled at the London School of Economics.
"I took that action against the segregationist backdrop of the time," Mr. King said today. "Sometimes you have to take a stand and say no to guys who are not even prepared to make the most minimal concessions of respect to you."
As a consequence, Mr. King could not return to the United States until President Clinton issued a pardon on Monday. Even though President Jimmy Carter, a fellow Georgian and political ally of Mr. King's family, issued a blanket pardon in 1977 for all draft evaders during the Vietnam war, it extended back only to 1964 and so did not cover Mr. King's 1961 conviction.
Family members said they had tried to gain a pardon from previous administrations, but it was not until the current effort, spearheaded in part by Mr. King's daughter, Oona King, a member of the British Parliament, that they felt hopeful. In addition, the judge in the case, William A. Bootle, now 97, wrote a letter in December asking President Clinton to grant Mr. King a pardon.
One of Mr. King's lawyers, Elizabeth Holtzman, a former Democratic congresswoman and Brooklyn district attorney who had worked for a brother of Mr. King while she was a law student, said, "When we began this, I was hearing, 'This has been looked at before and it doesn't fit into the paradigm for a pardon.' "
"It seemed crazy to me that he was still paying the price for standing up to racism," said Ms. Holtzman, who was in Georgia for Mr. King's homecoming.
But that kind of action was a family tradition for Mr. King. The brother whose funeral he attended today, Clennon W. King Jr., was briefly committed to an insane asylum because he had tried to enroll in the all-white University of Mississippi in the 1950's. Other brothers and sisters, as well as his father, were leaders in the civil rights movement, working with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who was not related, to organize voter drives and desegregate public accommodations.
Mr. King got a chance today to marvel at some of the fruits of that labor. When he walked into a McDonald's restaurant this morning, he said he was pleased to see the integrated staff and customers.
"One of the images I have of my last time here," he said, "is going to that part of town and seeing black men, who were very poor, waiting in the early dawn to be picked up for work in the fields. They were looking very crumpled.
"And I go to that same area today, to McDonald's, and it's brightly lit and the people there, they are black and white and they are all mixed up together and a little bit more buoyed up, and I think, yeah, that's better, much better."
The Albany that Mr. King left behind with its separate drinking fountains for blacks and whites is indeed gone. The town, which was then run by whites, now has a black police chief, a black city manager and black members of the City Council. Mr. King said today, "I am dying to talk to the town officials and see, how do these guys think."
Mr. King said that he had monitored changes in the United States from abroad, but he said: "There's something kind of bloodless about it. You can see the statistics. There are more black mayors, black representatives, the external indications that segregation is gone, but you can't get a feel for things from a distance. There is no substitute for seeing with your own vision, smelling, hearing, feeling things, talking to people."
And while many in this city of 78,000 people are pleased by Mr. King's return, not everyone thinks he should have been pardoned. At Pearly's Famous Country Cooking on North Slappey Boulevard, some patrons were discussing his return over breakfast today.
Ted Cahill, 62, who is white and served in the Navy, said: "There's something that just isn't quite right about this. I can't remember whether anyone called me 'mister' at the time, but I went and he didn't. I just don't like the idea of a pardon. I resent it for the guys who are still over there dead in Vietnam, that they went and he didn't."
But to supporters, Mr. King's civil disobedience was not about the draft, because his family has a tradition of military service. His father was a World War I veteran. Two brothers served in World War II, and one served in Korea. To them, Mr. King was acting on his conscience.
Richard P. Thornell, a professor of law at Howard University who was Mr. King's roommate at Fisk University in the 1950's, helped with the battle to win the pardon. And Professor Thornell traveled from Washington to Georgia for Mr. King's homecoming, which will last until Saturday, when he returns to England.
"Preston is my hero," Professor Thornell said. "What moves me so much is the simple greatness of this family. In all of these towns across the South there are these kinds of families with a great commitment to social justice who have given so much to move their communities forward."
At the funeral today of Mr. King's brother, who had a successful career as a history professor, the Rev. Daniel Simmons spoke of an "inward cry" that he said must have been embedded in the King family, one that said, "You can't sit still being marginalized."
Evoking images from the civil rights movement, Mr. Simmons suggested that the same spirit that moved Mr. King in 1961 continued to spur change today.
"It's a desire," he said, "to be treated the same. It says, I can't be satisfied to just sit at the lunch counter. I want to own the lunch counter. I can't be content only to argue cases in court. I want to be a judge in court. I want it all.
"So we will keep on demanding our rights, until every valley and mountain and hill of discrimination is made low."

HEADLINE: Lautenberg Backs Corzine As His Successor in Senate

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Feb. 24

 BODY:
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who won election 18 years ago as a millionaire businessman who had never held elective office, tonight endorsed Jon S. Corzine, another wealthy newcomer to politics, as his successor, over former Gov. Jim Florio.
Mr. Lautenberg, who is retiring, said at the convention of Bergen County Democrats here that Mr. Corzine, the former cochairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, was best prepared to confront national economic issues and should be the party's nominee for the United States Senate. 
 "We have an economy that looks like there's no top to it," Mr. Lautenberg said, adding that with the stock market jitters the last few days, "I know I'm going to feel very good with Jon Corzine on the budget committee, on the finance committee and on the banking committee."
Mr. Corzine's aides said Senator Lautenberg's support would help immunize Mr. Corzine from two of Mr. Florio's most frequent lines of attack -- particularly that Mr. Corzine is making or steering campaign contributions to powerful Democrats to win their endorsements.
"Every day, Jim Florio claims that Jon Corzine's buying support," said Mr. Corzine's spokesman, Steven Goldstein. "He can't possibly claim that about Frank Lautenberg."
In addition, Mr. Florio has said Mr. Corzine's views -- he opposes the death penalty and welfare reform, and he supports an increase in the minimum wage to $8 an hour -- make him too liberal to win election.
Tonight, Mr. Florio appealed to Democrats at the Bergen County convention to support him because of his experience in the State Legislature, in Congress and as governor. "That's experience that money can't buy," he said.
But Mr. Lautenberg said he planned to work with Mr. Corzine to make him a better candidate in a general election. Acknowledging that Mr. Corzine's position on the minimum wage might not be workable, the senator said, "he's a quick study. I am going to try to help him refine his positions in a way that gains support."
Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Florio have never been close, aides to both men said, but the senator's decision to back Mr. Corzine shocked Mr. Florio's campaign staff. W. Michael Murphy Jr., a Florio spokesman, said he had expected Mr. Lautenberg to remain neutral in the race.
Advisers to Mr. Corzine said Mr. Lautenberg's endorsement would mark a new phase in the campaign, from locking up the endorsements of Democratic officials and the support of county organizations to beginning to mobilize the party's electorate. In secret balloting tonight, the Bergen County delegates voted 578 for Mr. Corzine, to 335 for Mr. Florio -- 63 percent to 37 percent. Bergen County, considered a swing county in the general election, is New Jersey's most populous, with one-tenth of its voters and one-tenth of its Democrats.
Mr. Corzine's advisers have also said that he is likely to begin running TV advertisements soon after the March presidential primaries. Aides to Mr. Florio, who trails well behind Mr. Corzine in the race to raise money, say he expects to be able to afford only about two weeks of TV commercials before the June 6 primary.

HEADLINE: Owner Is Killed at His East Side Restaurant

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS 

 BODY:
One of the owners of an Upper East Side trattoria was found dead in the restaurant's kitchen yesterday, the victim of an apparent slashing attack, the police said.
Nicolo Orobello, 62, was discovered on the kitchen floor of Erminia Ristorante Italiano at 250 East 83rd Street about 11:30 a.m. by a linen deliveryman who noticed the door to the restaurant was ajar, the police said. A meat cleaver was found resting on Mr. Orobello's chest. A long kitchen knife was at his side. 
 The police said Mr. Orobello, of Queens, had died in a desperate struggle. His throat had been slashed, and his arms and hands were covered with scrapes, bruises and cuts.
The police said they were not sure when the attack had occurred, and did not know if the knife and cleaver found with Mr. Orobello had been used against him or if he had used them to defend himself.
"Nothing has been identified as the murder weapon at this time," said Capt. Robert Iovino of the Manhattan detective bureau.
Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said the initial investigation turned up no motive for the attack or evidence of a robbery. "At this point there doesn't seem to be anything missing from the restaurant," he said.
However, a police official said last night that detectives were interviewing the restaurant's former employees, and that the investigation was making progress.
Erminia, on the south side of 83rd Street between Second and Third Avenues, has been a cozy neighborhood standby for much of two decades, and is one establishment in a wide-ranging family restaurant empire.
Relatives of Mr. Orobello's wife, immigrants from Italy, have also owned and operated restaurants in San Diego and Miami, and such popular restaurants as Baci on the Upper West Side and Lattanzi in Midtown.
Over the years, observers and critics marveled at the family's ability to endure the vagaries of the restaurant industry and downturns in the economy, all the while maintaining loyal client bases.
Erminia opened in 1983. It received favorable reviews as a romantic cafe that specialized in wood-grilled entrees. Mr. Orobello was remembered by patrons yesterday as a gracious restaurateur.
"It's a tragic loss for the neighborhood," said Stanley Poll, who lives on the East Side. "This is a great restaurant, very cordial, intimate. It was a romantic hideaway. He was a wonderful host."
Mr. Orobello's relatives clustered at the restaurant yesterday, but declined to comment on the case.

HEADLINE: In Return to University, Clinton Focuses on China and Economy

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 24

 BODY:
In 1992, the last time Bill Clinton talked economics at the University of Pennsylvania, he was a governor, times were tough, and his campaign manager kept saying, "It's the economy, stupid."
President Clinton returned to the same campus today, with just 11 months to go in his second term, to gloat a bit about his economic stewardship and suggest, without naming names, that Gov. George W. Bush's approach to economics might not be any more successful than that of his father. 
 Mr. Clinton's 1992 economics speech laid out his strategy of emphasizing education, investment tax credits and an overhaul of the nation's infrastructure. At the time, he was down in the polls, his throat was raspy and he pulled no punches in condemning his opponent, President George Bush.
When he talked of the state of the economy, Mr. Clinton derisively labeled it the "Bush recession."
Today, Mr. Clinton took no similar shots at the younger Mr. Bush, who is engaged in a fierce battle for the Republican presidential nomination. But Mr. Clinton suggested that Vice President Al Gore best understood how to keep the current prosperity going and he made clear his preference for paying down the debt rather than making large cuts in taxes.
"We have to maintain our fiscal discipline," Mr. Clinton said. Back in his campaign speech, which presidential aides distributed to reporters today, Mr. Clinton spoke of a battle to stay competitive in a world where Japan and Germany were "beating our brains in" with smarter investment and growth decisions.
Today, however, Mr. Clinton ignored those nations and focused on the need to admit China into the World Trade Organization. Addressing critics, he said differences between the United States and China should not prevent a deal.
"If we do this, 20 years from now we'll look back and wonder why we ever even debated it," he said. "And if we don't, 20 years from now we'll still be kicking ourselves in the seat of the pants."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton made a vigorous pitch to the Business Council, a coalition of corporations that is pushing for congressional passage of China's admission to the World Trade Organization. Vowing "a full-court press from our administration," the president again took on the detractors.
"Most members of Congress don't question the economic benefits," he said. "Critics are more likely to say things like this: China is a growing threat to Taiwan and other neighbors. We shouldn't strengthen it. China is a drag on labor and environmental market rights and, if you put them in the W.T.O., they will block further progress on those issues. Or, China is an offender of human rights and we shouldn't reward it. Or China is a dangerous proliferator. We shouldn't empower it."
Mr. Clinton called the concerns legitimate but said "the problems will be worse if we do not bring China into the W.T.O."
Mr. Clinton's powers of prediction in his 1992 speech proved a mixed bag. He said, for instance, that bullet trains would be shuttling 500,000 passengers a day at speeds of up to 300 miles an hour. That did not happen.
But Mr. Clinton pointed out today that he had emphasized back in 1992, when the Web was in its infancy, the importance of a national informational network. "Just as the interstate highway system in the 1950's spurred two decades of economic growth," Governor Clinton had said, "we need a door-to-door fiber optics system by the year 2015 to link every home, every lab, every classroom and every business in America."

A Cat Now and for 17 Years (Nearly Forever)

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER 

 BODY:
HERE we have a woman who has been in the cast of "Cats" the length of its lengthy run: 17 years, 9 months of putting on the yak hair wig and the tail, painting on the whiskers, crawling around the stage on all fours and being flung thither and yon in a junkyard set.
One would think the title of her autobiography would be "I Wake Up Howling," and with the show scheduled to close in June she would feel free to admit it, but this is not the case. How has Marlene Danielle -- who would like you to pronounce her name Mar-LAY-nuh and who portrays, on stage, the glamour puss Bombalurina -- managed to keep doing the same role over and over? 
 "I'm an alien," says Ms. Danielle, big grin, punching it, who does an interview like a performance and would never, ever, phone anything in, and who looks, whatever her mysterious age, as good as the 20-year-old dancers. "I have an excessive amount of energy and stamina and determination."
And if people think, "That poor dancer"?
"Poor would not be the right word," says Ms. Danielle dryly. "Challenged, maybe, but certainly not poor."
You know what the nice thing is about the dressing room of a Broadway baby? It's one of the few things in New York that looks as it did in a 1930's movie, unless you get finicky and consider the Polaroid snaps. The one where Ms. Danielle is chatting is Room 16 in the Winter Garden. The names of the 12 women who share the room are on detachable nameplates on the door. Leotards hang from a rack. Ms. Danielle's space, after her 17 years, is a section of the dressing table about two feet wide.
The best stuff, of course, is stuff you can't see, the stories of all the women who shared that room. Ms. Danielle, who has seen a marriage come apart and a son grow to adulthood since joining the show, thinks they would make a great television series, which she has been writing.
Some of the things she remembers from the room: the understudy who dealt real estate and was always on the phone and would stomp off in a rage if she was called to go on; the time the girls looked out the window and saw a man "butt naked" on Broadway; the dancer who married a man against her mother's wishes and found, sadly, that her mother had been right. Eventually, everyone moved on. The woman Ms. Danielle dances with now is 20, five years younger than Ms. Danielle's son. Ms. Danielle is the cat who stayed.
The mom cat in this story -- Ms. Danielle's mother, not Ms. Danielle or any of the seven felines she has at home -- had wanted to be an opera singer, but roles for black women, she feared, would be scant. So she married a waiter, settled in a nice house in St. Albans, Queens, and had two daughters. Ms. Danielle was named for Dietrich, for her mother foresaw -- and maternal foresight may often be destiny -- careers in the arts for her girls.
WHEN Ms. Danielle was 7, her parents divorced and Ms. Danielle's mother went to work for the Bulova watch company. "She would come home with all these metal shavings in her hair," Ms. Danielle says.
Factory work? "Yeah," Ms. Danielle says. "There were definitely times it was hard to pay the bills, a few times we had to burn pieces of furniture to keep warm. Once there was a water main burst, and the plumber told my mother we could save money if we dug a new ditch ourselves. A friend of my mother's came by when she was digging and she said, 'You need to get up off your knees, dust that dirt off, paint your nails, and find yourself a life.' "
Ms. Danielle's mother moved the family to a railroad flat in the Village. The rent was $35 and Ms. Danielle and her mother and sister slept in triple bunk beds, but there were artists and there was music, which made everything all right.
Ms. Danielle studied dance, married a French painter after graduating from high school and lived for two years in France, where her son was born. She returned to New York, worked in a few shows, and had cashed her last unemployment check when she landed "Cats."
Some opportunities have come up since then, but nothing has been quite right. How could a glamour puss take that role as a hyena in "The Lion King"? And of course, there are the brownstone in Jersey City and the property in Pennsylvania, which a regular gig has enabled her to have.
"Home is really important to me," Ms. Danielle says often. Security seems to be very important to her, Ms. Danielle is told. "If you want to get down to it, I've seen twice in my life homes that were very precious to me and my family stolen from us. I decided I would never again let that happen to our family."
There is also something else.
"I've seen so many people who have stellar careers go through such highs and lows. The star does fade, and ultimately it's about how happy you are as a human being."
This said, it is not surprising to hear that Ms. Danielle has been with a fellow for 15 years.
What does he look like?
There is a photo in the dressing room, where the younger dancers have come and gone, come and gone. Ms. Danielle laughs when she shows it, for all you can see of her boyfriend is his back. The picture was taken one Columbus Day, after she had performed in the parade. It shows a big man, in a leather jacket, walking down a street in Manhattan, holding hands with a tall, glamorous cat.

Re "The Dishonest Truth" (column, Feb. 23), by Paul Krugman: This is not Bill Clinton's economy. This economy is the one produced by the American people. No American president can claim credit for the increased productivity of American workers, the explosion in electronic commerce, the power of our technological revolution, and -- despite Al Gore's assertion -- the birth of the Internet. Government might help, but more often than not Ronald Reagan was right: government should get out of the way to let this country's creative talent make us all proud.

Tenant-Leaning City Council Prepares to Continue Rent Rules

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
With little echo of the protracted, headline-stirring bombast of the 1997 rent-regulation struggle in Albany, the New York City Council is to hold its first public hearing this morning on legislation required to extend rent control and rent stabilization for 1.1 million city apartments for three more years.
Given the powerful voting bloc represented by that measure of housing stock, all groups concerned, including the city's leading landlord group, have predicted that the Council will pass the extension by its March 31 deadline, along with one change that would protect the rights of tenants moving into deregulated apartments. 
 Placed on the back burner, however, were several proposals to strengthen rent protections. Those proposals came as a new housing survey indicated that the city's vacancy rate dropped to 3.19 percent from 4.01 percent over the last three years -- with 5 percent the statutory level required for declaring a housing emergency and extending rent regulation.
Calling the legislation time-sensitive, Councilman Steven DiBrienza, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said, "You extend the baseline system with the protections as they are and then, in the long range, you fight for the other improvements."
In 1969, the City Council created rent stabilization, intended as a less restrictive system than rent control, which now applies to buildings of three or more units built before Feb. 1, 1947, and occupied by the same tenant since July 1, 1971. Rent stabilization applies to buildings of six or more units built before Jan. 1, 1974.
Under rent control, rents are set through a complex formula administered by the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. For years, increases have consistently been 7.5 percent a year, with a $15 a month surcharge for those apartments with rents under $500. Under stabilization, rent increases for one- and two-year leases are set by the Rent Guidelines Board, appointed by the mayor. In recent years, the increases have been roughly 2 to 3 percent.
Today's hearing at City Hall, and another scheduled for March 6, will be held amid lingering bitterness over past Council votes that tenant advocates have argued severely weakened the system.
"Oh, yes! Oh, yes!" said Michael McKee, associate director of one tenant organization, New York State Tenants and Neighbors, when asked whether his members would be turning out in force for today's hearing. "We've been phone-banking just to get people there."
In 1994, the Council passed a law that allows apartments to be decontrolled when the rent reaches $2,000 a month. Laws that allow a landlord to renovate a vacant apartment and then add one-fortieth of the renovation cost to the apartment's monthly rent, when combined with a statutory vacancy increase of at least 18 percent enacted by the Legislature in 1997, are now readily pushing rents beyond that $2,000 level.
"What we're seeing now," Mr. McKee said, "is that for apartments that were renting for $800 before a vacancy, it's very easy for a landlord to get over $2,000 a month" -- and see it decontrolled.
Jack Freund, executive vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the city's largest landlord group, protested the direction the Council appeared to be taking.
"There's no question that the City Council will extend the rent laws because of a housing shortage," he said. "But it would be irrational for them to do so without also taking steps to create additional housing. The R.S.A. is proposing that the Council focus instead on a broad new middle-income housing initiative, primarily for the boroughs outside Manhattan, that will create sorely needed housing and eventually end the housing shortage. We are a little sorrowful that the City Council can only muster a knee-jerk reaction."
No statistics were available on how many apartments had been deregulated specifically because of the vacancy decontrol law. But the 1999 Housing and Vacancy Survey, compiled by the federal Census Bureau for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, showed that there were 1,122,872 rent-regulated apartments in the city in 1996, and by last year that figure had dropped to 1,098,939, a 2.1 percent decrease. Breaking out rent-controlled apartments from those overall totals, the survey showed that there were 70,572 rent-controlled apartments in the city in 1996 and 52,562 in 1999, a 25.5 percent drop.
As part of his proposed extension package, the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, has included a measure that would require landlords to give a detailed explanation of how they achieved the $2,000 rent level required to decontrol an apartment.
Of Mr. McKee's concerns, Mr. Vallone said: "Mike McKee needs an issue, so he'll find one if there's not one there. Suffice it to say we sharply disagree."
Mr. DiBrienza, conceding that his legislation would not come up for consideration by the March 31 extension deadline, said he was proposing that rent-controlled apartments no longer be administered by the state, but by the Rent Guidelines Board, which sets stabilized rents.

State Pension Money To Leave the Market

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
New York's comptroller, H. Carl McCall, said yesterday he planned to shift almost $5 billion of the state's $120 billion pension fund out of the stock market and invest it overseas or in real estate.
Mr. McCall, who is in the midst of his first asset allocation study in five years, said he wanted to reduce New York's "exposure to domestic equity markets" in reaction to the Federal Reserve Board's efforts to slow the nation's economic growth. 
 The move, to be undertaken this spring, will reduce the pension fund allocation in domestic equities to 45 percent from 50 percent. New York has the second-biggest United States government pension fund, behind California's.
While noting that $5 billion is not a substantial amount of the pension fund, John McCann, an economist at Pace University in New York, said Mr. McCall's move was a prudent reaction to resurgent foreign economies.
Last month, Mr. McCall announced he had committed $250 million of the fund to venture capital investments, specifically "new media and high technology."

Donning the Reagan Mantle

BYLINE: By JOHN BRODER

 BODY:

Gov. George W. Bush and Senator John McCain both tried to wrap themselves in the mantle of Ronald Reagan in television commercials that began running today in the primary states of California, New York, Virginia and Washington. Mr. McCain calls himself a "proud Reagan Republican," while Mr. Bush promotes his $1.3 trillion tax cut plan as "Reaganesque."
 
THE BUSH COMMERCIAL
 
PRODUCER -- Maverick Media
 
ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial uses now-familiar soft-focus pictures of Governor Bush with schoolchildren, veterans, the elderly and his wife, Laura. Snatches of the commercial's text appear in bright type near the bottom of the screen.
 
VOICE-OVER -- The commercial begins with an announcer saying: "Gov. George W. Bush. He's a once-in-a-generation leader with a bold agenda, a successful governor with a fresh leadership style.
 
"So every child reads, he'll fight for education reforms hailed as the most sweeping in a decade.
 
"While Washington deadlocked, he delivered a patients' bill of rights that's a model for America.
 
"He's the candidate with a tax cut called 'Reaganesque' and 'worthy of a new president.' "
 
The advertisement closes with Mr. Bush saying, "I fight for what I believe in, and I get results."
 
THE McCAIN COMMERCIAL
 
PRODUCER -- Stevens Reed Curcio & Company
 
ON THE SCREEN -- A smiling Mr. McCain is standing in a living room as the camera slowly zooms in on his face. Excerpts of the narration flash on the bottom of the screen.
 
VOICE-OVER -- Mr. McCain: "You can't turn on your TV without seeing an ad from the establishment trying to fool you about me. Here's some straight talk. I'm a proud Reagan Republican. I'll tear up the 44,000-page tax code that benefits special interests.
 
"Stop the outrageous waste and pork barrel spending that steals your money. Use the surplus to secure Social Security, cut middle class taxes and pay down the debt.
 
"Give me your vote, and we'll give you back your government."
 
SCORECARD -- Mr. McCain's commercial seems intended to reassure mainstream Republican voters that he resides squarely in the conservative, Reagan wing of the party, even though Republican voters have overwhelmingly preferred Mr. Bush in the primaries held so far. At the same time, Mr. McCain continues his appeal to independent and Democratic voters by emphasizing his opposition to wasteful government spending and his dedication to securing Social Security.
 
Mr. Bush also makes a play for moderate voters, highlighting his record on education and health care reform and emphasizing his "fresh" leadership style. But he caters to core Republican voters with a reference to his tax proposal that The Washington Post called "Reaganesque" in a headline. The Post did not intend the term to be complimentary; its article described the tax cut as so large that it would choke off money for most government programs. The reference was to Mr. Reagan's supply-side approach of using large income tax cuts to stimulate economic activity and limit the growth of government.
 
The Wall Street Journal, in an editorial last December, called Mr. Bush's economic agenda "worthy of a new president." The paper's editorial page has long been an advocate of tax cuts and supply-side economics.

HEADLINE: As Putin Campaigns, Tape Raises Issues on War

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 26

 BODY:
As Russia's acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, opened his election campaign today pledging a new Russia based on the rule of law, new furors erupted over the conduct of the Chechnya war that is the signature of Mr. Putin's Kremlin rule.
In Moscow, Russian officials bitterly attacked a German television station, N24, which released a videotape showing Russian troops conducting a mass burial of Chechen soldiers, some of them mutilated and others bound by the limbs. There was footage of a dead Chechen being dragged by a truck. 
 The Kremlin spokesman on Chechnya issues, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, called the film "the falsification of the year," and the daily Izvestia maintained that its contents had been distorted. The station stood by its depiction of the burial, saying it could not say whether the events shown constituted an atrocity.
Late today in Dagestan, a Russian province neighboring Chechnya, Russian officials said they had found and arrested Andrei Babitsky, a Russian correspondent for the American network Radio Liberty whose treatment at the hands of the Russian military had become an international issue.
Last month Russian officials seized Mr. Babitsky, whose reports on the Chechen war were frequently skeptical of Moscow's positions, on the ground that he lacked proper accreditation. They later suggested that he was working in league with Islamic rebels in Chechnya, and said they had traded him to Chechen guerrillas, with his consent, for Russian prisoners of war.
Mr. Babitsky's disappearance prompted sharp protests by human rights groups and journalists' organizations, and eventually by American diplomats. Radio Liberty officials speculated that he had been murdered or tortured. But until tonight, there was no real evidence of his whereabouts.
Mr. Babitsky spoke by telephone tonight with his wife, Lyudmila, who is in Prague. He apparently offered no hint of what had happened during his captivity, except that he had been held in Chechnya, and was safe and in good condition.
The volatile videotape of a mass burial of Chechen rebels was broadcast on the nongovernmental television network NTV, a frequent critic of the Kremlin. The network said the film had been shot outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny, on Feb. 22, and quoted a German correspondent, Frank Hoefling, as saying that Russian soldiers had allowed the filming because they were unhappy with their burial duty.
The graphic film, shown on Russian and European television, showed the bound bodies of men in military uniforms being dumped into pits and covered with earth. The bindings suggest that the men had been held captive, rather than being shot in battle.
But Izvestia claimed today that one of its reporters, Oleg Blotsky, had shot the film on Feb. 14 as Russian soldiers conducted a supposedly temporary burial of Chechen guerrillas in the Grozny suburbs of Roshni-Chu and Goiti. The newspaper said the soldiers' bodies were bound to ease their transport, and said the bodies were to be exhumed later for identification.
Russian officials said they would conduct an independent inquiry into the videotape and would prosecute anyone found to have violated the law. At the same time, they expressed doubt that the tape was authentic, and said they had no intention of allowing any outside oversight of their inquiry.
The issue overshadowed the unofficial kickoff of Mr. Putin's election campaign, a full-page advertisement in Izvestia in which he repeated many of his earlier promises to bring a market economy and the rule of law to Russia.
Mr. Putin said, as he has before, that no one need fear that his call for a "strong" presidency is a harbinger of a new dictatorship in Russia. "It is the task of a leader to tune people into common goals; to put everyone into their proper place and to help them acquire confidence in their own strength," he stated.
"A great country cherishes its own freedom and respects that of others," he wrote. "The stronger the state, the stronger the individual."
Mr. Putin's campaign manifesto offered few specifics. His previous writings have suggested that he favors a strong state and a western-style economic system governed by a strict set of laws.

HEADLINE: U.S. Surprise: 6.9% Growth In 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The economy barreled ahead at a breathtaking 6.9 percent annual rate in the last three months of 1999, the most rapid rate of quarterly expansion in more than three years, the Government reported yesterday.
The figures released by the Commerce Department are revised estimates from a month ago, when gross domestic product was estimated at a 5.8 percent rate. 
 The 6.9 percent rate matches a similar growth spurt recorded in the second quarter of 1996. It is the fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 1987, when the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.2 percent.
Private economists had expected the figures to show that growth was stronger than forecast, because over the last month figures from important parts of the economy -- particularly retail sales -- have been revised upward. But the size of the increase came as a surprise.
"The economy is screaming ahead," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "No one has come close to forecasting this kind of growth coupled with this kind of low inflation."
Notably, the faster rate of growth was not accompanied by an upward revision in key price measures.
An inflation gauge tied to the gross domestic product, the so-called personal consumption expenditure price index, rose at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, unchanged from the previous estimate and only slightly above the 1.8 percent rate recorded in the third quarter.
Despite tame inflation, Mr. Fine and other analysts said the report only served to reinforce the expectation that the Federal Reserve Board would raise short-term interest rates on March 21, when its Open Market Committee next meets to consider changes in monetary policy.
That increase would be the fifth since last June. In order to rein in growth to a more acceptable level, the Fed may have to do even more, analysts said.
"The economy has an awful lot of momentum and the Fed will have to tighten policy by a substantial amount," said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs.
The bond market, which normally reacts badly to news of rapid economic growth, took the report in stride. Indeed, market interest rates on most Treasury securities fell a bit yesterday.
But the stock market, which has spent the last two weeks listening to warnings from the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, that it is responsible for much of the excess growth in spending and therefore in the economy, swooned again yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 230.51 points and closed below 10,000 for the first time since April 6.
Should the stock market retreat further -- the Dow is now off more than 14 percent this year, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down more than 9 percent -- the Fed might not have to be as aggressive in trying to cool the economy, analysts said.
"It is clear that the Fed is in a tightening mode," Mr. Fine said. "But if the stock market declines enough, they might put off any further tightening, just to see how that affects the economy."
A number of factors contributed to the fourth-quarter performance, including robust consumer and government spending and a strong buildup in inventories at businesses. Several analysts say that much of this spending was higher than it otherwise might have been because of concerns about the Year 2000 date change. With that event now over, the pace of growth is probably at least a bit slower in the current quarter, they said.
"A reversal of these increases all point to substantially slower growth in the first quarter," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "But even if the growth rate slows a good bit, when averaged with the fourth quarter the number is still going to be very strong."
The upward revisions in gross domestic product virtually ensure that workers were even more productive than previous data suggested.
"These numbers will cause the productivity numbers to go up even further," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
"It is ironic to get this kind of number when Mr. Greenspan is raising questions about whether productivity gains we have seen are sustainable. Rather than aberrations, we may be on the verge of a productivity revolution."
Instead of tightening monetary policy to shut off rapid growth in the economy, Mr. Yardeni argued that the Fed should allow what he called "this new-economy experiment" to continue until it becomes clear that inflation has picked up.
"We don't have an inflation problem right now," he said. "If we get more compelling evidence, then they could act quickly and squelch it pretty rapidly."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATS;
Jerry Brown Backs Gore; Rivals Attack G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR with JAMES DAO

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore, the buttoned-up moderate who has tried to loosen up, today picked up the endorsement of Jerry Brown, the quirky liberal who is sounding more conservative lately.
Mr. Brown, a former Democratic presidential candidate, is now an independent and mayor of this city. 
 He endorsed Mr. Gore tonight at a rally of more than 150 people at a union hall here. "Al Gore cares about poverty and the environment," Mr. Brown said. "He cares about those who are falling between the cracks. He has a philosophy of equality, a philosophy of economic justice. He knows something about technology and the environment."
Called Governor Moonbeam when he was California's chief executive 20 years ago, Mr. Brown has lately been promoting a public military academy for young people and talking tough on crime.
Mr. Gore, appearing in Cleveland earlier today, and his Democratic opponent, former Senator Bill Bradley, who was in Washington State, were as tough on their potential Republican opponents as they were on each other.
"Both of the Republican candidates are courting the extreme right wing," Mr. Gore said at a senior citizens center. "Both of them have been opposed to the patients' bill of rights. Both of them have been opposed to an increase in the minimum wage. Both of them supported the Newt Gingrich 'Contract With America,' which was so harmful. So there is not a choice on the Republican side. They just echo one another."
Mr. Gore expounded on his vision of health policy and described the Clinton administration's proposals to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs. Many people in the audience said they went without drugs prescribed by their doctors because they could not afford them.
Picking up on a theme sounded by House Democrats in recent weeks, Mr. Gore said that elderly people and animals often used the same drugs, but that veterinarians paid lower prices.
"Why should the dog and the cat get cheaper medicines?" he asked. "Large pharmaceutical companies have a great deal of power in the marketplace and precious little competition. They use some of their wealth to block or delay the approval of generic versions of the medicines that could come in and compete with them."
In the second day of a five-day tour of Washington, Mr. Bradley appeared this morning with environmentalists near Seattle.
At a state park overlooking Puget Sound and the snow-capped Olympic Mountains, Mr. Bradley -- who was introduced by a woman whose 18-year-old son died in an oil pipeline accident last year -- vowed to increase pipeline safety and to require that oil tankers entering Puget Sound be guided by tugboats.
He said Mr. Gore "has never seen a dam he didn't like." (Many environmental groups in the Pacific Northwest want to tear down dams to make it easier for salmon to spawn.)
Mr. Bradley also accused Senator John McCain of being no friend to environmentalists.
"John McCain's a reformer, I'm a reformer," Mr. Bradley said. "But when it comes to the environment, there is a vast difference between John McCain and me."
In particular, Mr. Bradley criticized Mr. McCain as deriding federal spending to protect salmon.
Mr. Bradley, who views Washington as his last best chance to build momentum for his campaign before the Super Tuesday primaries on March 7, plans to campaign there exclusively through Monday and has brought dozens of aides from around the country to work in the state.
Mr. Gore plans to campaign in Washington State on Saturday.

HEADLINE: RELIGION JOURNAL;
The Clergy and the Confederate Flag Unfurled

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR

 BODY:
When Bishop Dorsey F. Henderson Jr., the Episcopal bishop in Columbia, S.C., steps out the door of Trinity Cathedral there, he need only lift his gaze a bit to see the object of a bitter controversy that has spilled over into national politics.
Across the street from the attractive, 19th-century cathedral stands the South Carolina Statehouse, atop which flies the Confederate battle flag. 
 Bishop Henderson thinks state officials should remove the flag from the dome because, he said in an interview, the flag as a symbol has been "kidnapped by racists" like the Ku Klux Klan.
"I'm a Southerner, I grew up in small towns in Florida," said the bishop, the spiritual head of the Diocese of Upper South Carolina, which incorporates the state's mid- and northern sections.
Bishop Henderson said he understood that some South Carolinians regarded the flag fondly, as a symbol of their heritage and of military bravery in the Civil War.
But, he added, given that the flag "is such a symbol of racism in today's culture, I think we can find better ways of honoring heritage than flying this banner."
The bishop's remarks underline an important element in the flag controversy -- the involvement of religious leaders in seeking its removal to help the cause of racial reconciliation between whites and blacks, for whom the flag symbolizes a grim past of bondage and servitude.
State officials put up the battle flag, beneath the national and state flags on the Statehouse dome, in 1962 as the civil rights movement was gaining steam. Lately the flag has become the focus of intensifying controversy.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has called for an economic and tourism boycott of South Carolina until the Legislature removes it.
Earlier this month, as national attention focused on South Carolina and its Republican primary, the major presidential candidates -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona -- were asked what the state should do.
Mr. Bush said it was up to South Carolinians. Mr. McCain seemed to waver, at first calling it a symbol of racism, then saying it was a "symbol of heritage."
Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, suggested a compromise in which the flag would be moved to another place on the Capitol's grounds, near an equestrian statue of Wade Hampton, the Civil War general who was the state's first governor after Reconstruction and was then a United States senator. (Hampton is buried on Trinity Cathedral's grounds.)
Meanwhile, some religious groups have decided to honor the N.A.A.C.P.'s call for a boycott.
Last year the bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, acting at the recommendation of Bishop David A. Donges of the church's South Carolina Synod, canceled plans to meet in Charleston, S.C., and rescheduled their gathering for Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
And in January, Bishop Henderson announced the Episcopal diocese would honor the boycott, too, by shortening its annual convention in February from two days to one, so that delegates would not have to stay overnight in hotels.
The convention was already on record, through votes in 1994 and 1997, calling for the flag to be moved from the Statehouse to "a more appropriate location."
Bishop Henderson reflected on that in a letter to parishioners last September. "Not everyone who is interested in the history of the Old South, including its banners, is a racist," he wrote. "But whatever else the flag may mean to us, it cannot be separated entirely from the shameful sin of slavery."
He asked Episcopalians to view the controversy within a biblical framework, keeping in mind that Jesus followed "a ministry of reconciliation" and that the apostle Paul warned Christians "not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way."
In January, Bishop Henderson joined a march held on the holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that ended in a rally near the Statehouse, where participants called for the flag's removal.
The bishop said he looked down his row of marchers and saw the state's Lutheran and Methodist bishops and representatives from the Roman Catholic diocese, the local jurisdiction of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina, which has its headquarters in Charleston.
But Bishop Henderson said he did not think that moving the Confederate flag from the Statehouse would ultimately be enough because eliminating racism demanded dedicated effort. "You'd like to think the flag goes down and it's over," he said. "It's not."
"Reconciliation is not just the absence of conflict about this," the bishop continued. "We've got to recognize the problems and deal with them in a significant way, or that dreadful sin will plague us forever."

Dow Jones Falls 230 Points, To End the Week at 9,862
The Dow Jones industrial average, which last month reached a peak of 11,723, closed below the 10,000 mark for the first time in 10 months and is down 14.22 percent for the year. The Nasdaq composite index fell 27.15 points, to 4,590.50, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 20.07 points, to 1,333.36.
Previously the Nasdaq has been impervious to the selling pressures seen in the Dow. But now investors believe Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is serious about raising interest rates until he has curbed the economy's growth, and that these rate increases will hurt some industry groups far more than others.

Automakers Form Online Venture
General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler said they would set up the world's biggest online marketplace, a giant auction site like eBay that they plan to use for buying the nearly $250 billion worth of auto parts and other goods that they need each year. The automakers hope that the move will save time and money and make it easier to build cars to order. A1. 

Priceline Set to Offer Cheaper Gas
Priceline.com said it will extend its discount price system to gasoline. Using essentially the same business model it already relies on to sell airline tickets and hotel rooms, Priceline said that it would begin offering people a way to shop around, via the Internet, for the lowest gasoline prices in their neighborhoods. Priceline promised savings of 10 cents to 20 cents a gallon if consumers are flexible about the brand. C2.
 
Canadian Television Company Bid
The owner of Canada's largest phone system, BCE, made a $1.6 billion cash bid for the country's No. 2 television network, CTV, in an attempt to acquire more programming to compete with cable television and other providers of communications and media services. Some analysts were calling the BCE bid for CTV a Canadian version of America Online's $165 billion deal to buy Time Warner. C2.
 
Carnival Withdraws Bid for Fairfield
Carnival, the cruise ship operator, withdrew a bid of $775 million to acquire Fairfield Communities, which managed vacation time-share properties. C3.
 
Little Hope Seen for Mexican Airline
Doubts have grown that Taesa, the Mexican airline, will recover from the financial collapse that grounded it three months ago. This week Taesa was ordered into bankruptcy protection, and banking officials said at least a third of its $380 million in debt would never be repaid. Taesa amassed the debt as part of an effort to offer cut-rate fares. C2.
 
Japan Replaces a Bank Reformer
The chairman of the government agency responsible for resurrecting Japan's troubled banking system was dismissed after telling a group of local bankers that he would protect them from inspections their managers considered too harsh. He was replaced by Sadakazu Tanigaki, a member of Parliament, who is likely to favor more vigorous reform. C2.
 
Slow Progress for Women in Japan
Women have been joining the professional career ranks in Japan recently, but their numbers are small, and many women complain that everything from social mores to the tax code conspire to keep things that way. A3.
 
F.B.I.'s Web Site Was Attacked
The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that electronic vandals shut down its Internet site for hours last week in the same type of attack that disrupted some of the Web's major commercial sites. The bureau's Web site remained inaccessible for more than three hours on Feb. 18 because vandals overwhelmed it by transmitting spurious signals. C4.

HEADLINE: CARMAKERS TO BUY PARTS ON INTERNET

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich., Feb. 25

 BODY:
General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler announced today that they would set up the world's biggest online marketplace for the auto industry's private use, a giant auction site like eBay through which they plan to buy the nearly $250 billion worth of parts and other goods they need each year. The site would dwarf all previous commercial activity on the Web.
The automakers said they hoped to cut costs and save time by streamlining their purchasing operations and putting them online. The new system would also help them build more cars to customer specifications by allowing them to order parts for assembly plants far more quickly. 
 Auto executives predicted that they could cut purchasing costs up to 10 percent over several years with the new system by making it easier for more companies to bid on each contract and by eliminating the need for many of the meetings now required before a parts order is placed.
Since half the cost of a $20,000 car lies in purchased parts, the new system could reduce the cost of producing a typical automobile by $1,000. This could slow inflation in car prices by offsetting part of the cost of new features like compact disc changers.
G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler said they had begun talking to other automakers, notably Toyota, about joining the new business, and would strongly encourage their suppliers and dealers to channel purchases through the online marketplace as well. As a result, the new marketplace's business volume could become several times as large as the automakers' own purchasing budgets.
Retail sales over the Internet, including everything from Amazon.com to eBay, are estimated to have been $10 billion to $15 billion last year.
The automakers said that while they would use the new Internet system for soliciting bids and awarding contracts, they would not actually combine their purchasing budgets, a step that might raise antitrust concerns. Instead, each automaker will use separate areas of the Internet marketplace to post requests for bids on everything from tires to steering wheels. Security software will be designed to prevent access by anyone except automakers and authorized suppliers, and to prevent automakers from viewing one another's contracts and suppliers from viewing one another's bids.
The automakers have worked together before on shared computer standards for purchasing and for the design of common auto parts, without objections from antitrust regulators. Justice Department officials declined to comment on today's deal.
While automakers have begun using e-mail for some purchases, much of the industry's procurement is still done in ways that have changed little in a century. An automaker's purchasing representatives call suppliers that have bid on similar contracts in the past, telling them to send sales representatives to a meeting in the Detroit area to discuss the contract. Preliminary engineering specifications are exchanged, and suppliers are given a deadline for sending in bids and detailed blueprints. Further meetings are then held to work out the details and award the contract.
The automakers hope the new system will reduce costs and save time. Engineering data will be exchanged electronically, and suppliers from all over the world will be able to bid on any contract, possibly increasing competition.
"It will drive a lot of the inefficiencies out of the system," said Harold R. Kutner, G.M.'s group vice president for worldwide purchasing.
The new marketplace, which the automakers plan to spend about $200 million to set up, will also automatically convert currencies, keep track of export regulations around the world and even perform some language translation of bids. Suppliers and dealers will be able to use the marketplace to pool orders for products like photocopiers, so as to reap some of the same economies of scale the automakers already have.
G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler were the world's three largest companies in 1998 in terms of sales and share of global economic output. G.M. alone employs 3,000 purchasing representatives around the world. Mr. Kutner said the new system would allow automakers to shrink their purchasing staffs, but declined to speculate on when or how this might occur.
G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler have done fairly little hiring in the last two decades, except for engineers, so they usually resort to early-retirement programs, rather than layoffs, to reduce white-collar employment, and are sometimes able to retrain employees to work in other divisions.
Internet businesses have enjoyed an advantage in retail sales because they are exempt from sales taxes. But most corporate purchases are not covered by sales taxes, so the electronic marketplace will mean few losses in tax revenue.
G.M. and Ford had already announced plans three months ago to set up their own separate online marketplaces. But when DaimlerChrysler began talking about creating yet another Internet system for its purchasing, suppliers began complaining vehemently and demanded that the automakers agree on a common standard.
"They said, 'What the heck are you doing here, why are you going to create a third standard, and that encouraged us to think about it," said Peter Weiss, DaimlerChrysler's project manager for electronic purchasing, at today's news conference in G.M.'s car engineering center in this Detroit suburb.
G.M. and Ford agreed to combine their systems and give DaimlerChyrsler a stake in the combined company, which has not yet been named. G.M.'s system has been designed by Commerce One and Ford's by Oracle. The two technology companies will also have stakes in the new company, which the automakers said they planned to spin off as an independent business once it had "significant" revenues from administering services like language translation and bid processing.
Automakers plan to use the new system over the next several years to help them undertake a radical change in the way they build and distribute cars. The manufacturers now assemble and paint most cars based on guesses of what combinations of options and colors will interest consumers, then ship them to dealers, which keep huge numbers of cars available, an expensive undertaking. A few cars are assembled and equipped to customers' orders, but because of the logistical difficulties in ordering the correct combinations of parts from thousands of suppliers, these take a month or two to deliver, a lag that discourages most buyers.
The new purchasing system will make it much easier to take customers' orders for specific models with specific options and colors, allowing the completed automobile to be shipped within 10 to 20 days.
Now, for example, if an automaker receives an order for 100 extra cars with leather seats, it forwards the order to a seat maker, which in turn sends an order to a leather supplier. In the new system, auto makers will relay sales data and orders from dealers to the new marketplace almost instantly, so that even second-tier suppliers, like a leather vendor, can receive this information immediately.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
STOCKS IN TURMOIL AS WORRIES GROW ON HIGHER RATES

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average, which reached a peak of 11,723 last month, closed below the 10,000 mark yesterday for the first time in 10 months as investors dumped shares of companies most vulnerable to higher interest rates. The other popular stock indexes followed suit.
The Dow finished the week down 3.5 percent. It is off 14.22 percent for the year, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has lost 9.25 percent of its value. The Nasdaq composite index, which has been impervious to the selling pressures seen in the Dow and is dominated by shares of technology and other so-called new-economy companies, fell yesterday but is up 12.81 percent this year. 
 This extraordinary divergence in the market reflects two views held by investors: that Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, continues to be deadly serious about raising interest rates to curb the economy's growth and that these rate increases will hurt some industry groups far more than others.
The older, more established companies that make up the broader market indexes will be hurt by rising interest rates, investors believe, because these companies' borrowing costs may rise substantially. But because the fledgling technology companies found in the Nasdaq composite do not rely as heavily on banks for capital, these concerns will not face rising costs as a result of a few interest rate increases.
The bifurcated market indexes pose something of a quandary for Mr. Greenspan, stock strategists say. He has made it clear that rising stock prices have fueled an already rocketing economy as investors increased their spending to reflect higher net worths. Thus, if the Nasdaq continues to generate significant wealth for investors, Mr. Greenspan could feel compelled to raise rates even as the Dow and the S.& P. are falling.
"The Fed wants a slower economy, and the stock market is interfering with this policy goal," said Christine A. Callies, chief United States stock strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Since no one has made any real money in any sectors except tech, when he talks about wealth effect he's talking about the tech sector."
Investors are clearly realizing that Mr. Greenspan appears committed to raising interest rates as high as he must to curb economic growth. The government's report yesterday of a 6.9 percent increase in gross domestic product in the final quarter of 1999 only bolstered this belief.
The Dow declined 230.51 points, or 2.28 percent, to 9,862.12, yesterday; the Nasdaq fell 27.15 points, to 4,590.50, and the S.& P. 500 dropped 20.07 points, to 1,333.36.
Investors expect Mr. Greenspan to act soon on rates. The Fed's Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet on March 21; investors expect short-term rates to be raised by one-quarter of a point at that meeting.
Though Mr. Greenspan has said that he is not trying to make the stock market a target of monetary policy, strategists agree that if stock prices fall over all, he will feel more comfortable that the effect of new wealth on the economy will then be muted. Accordingly, a less aggressive stance on interest rates might be enough to dampen the economy.
"If he sticks to his guns, he not only has to continue to raise rates until he's confident that economic figures are coming down but also that he's confident he's affected the stock market," said Alan W. Kral, vice president at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen, a money management firm in New York. "The only thing I am confident of is the Fed can raise rates high enough to affect all stocks. Hopefully it can get the economic response it wants without having to go that far."
The effect of rising rates on some stocks, particularly financial services, has already been brutal. American Express fell 4 percent yesterday, bringing its loss for the year to 25 percent. Citigroup, which lost 2.5 percent, is down almost 14 percent this year. Consumer goods stocks continued their declines, as did retailers, shares in basic materials concerns and oils.
"Some of the companies that represented the strong part of the old world -- G.E., Home Depot, Wal-Mart -- have had significant corrections this year," said James E. Moltz, vice chairman at International Strategy and Investment, an investment research firm. "Something's happened. The growth is narrower; the island of insulation seems to be shrinking some."
Even among favored technology stocks, investors are becoming choosier. One aspect of yesterday's trading action that rattled some investors was that the selling extended to former technology darlings like I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Cisco Systems. Investors seem worried that earnings at these large companies are no longer growing fast enough to guarantee future gains in their stock prices. They are selling these shares and going into much smaller, untested companies in biotechnology and health care, for example, that are thought to be in the early stages of growth.
Investment managers said their customers were not panicked by the Dow's fall. Instead, they were dispirited by continued declines in established, profitable companies. "People that have held off as long as they can are finally selling out of some of their nontechnology stocks," said David Eidelman, a money manager at Eidelman, Finger & Harris in St. Louis. "They are so frustrated they are throwing in the towel and buying technology stocks."
Money flowing into mutual funds confirms the all-technology all-the-time mood of investors. In the week ended Wednesday, $1.6 billion went into technology stock funds, $1.2 billion flew into biotechnology and $1 billion was earmarked for aggressive growth stock funds, according to AMG Data Services. Meanwhile, investors took more money out of funds that mirror the performance of the S.& P. 500 index -- a previous favorite -- than they put in.
With investor interest in technology riding high, the Nasdaq is likely to stay on a roll. "It is very hard to make a case that higher interest rates will bring Nasdaq down," said Douglas Cliggott, chief United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities. "The catalyst for that is a combination of two things, a slower rate of inflows into mutual funds, which might start happening in a few weeks, and if we start to see some negative earnings surprises. My guess is you'll see more cracks in the earnings picture."
As big-name stocks fell, investors sought safety in short-term Treasury securities. Yields on the two-year Treasury note fell to 6.40 percent from 6.50 percent Thursday as investors exited stocks.

HEADLINE: Big Gap in Screening U.S. Infants for Hereditary Ills

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 25

 BODY:
Two babies: Mubashir Younis and Bryce Burke. Both were born with rare metabolic diseases. But one was lucky in the time and place of his birth, and one was not.
Mubashir was born last April in Massachusetts, just two months after the state expanded the screening for hereditary diseases that it does on newborns. The test picked up his propionic acidemia, which can cause coma, brain damage and even death. Treated and watched carefully, he is growing normally, his "unbelievably lucky" father, Waheed Younis, said. 
 Bryce, who has a metabolic disorder called MCAD, was not tested for it when he was born in Fort Worth in 1996, and Texas still does not routinely screen newborns for it. When he was 19 months old, Bryce's blood sugar levels suddenly plunged, he had massive seizures and fell into a coma. Brain damage left him unable to walk or talk.
"He'll never be a normal child or person again," said his father, Robert Burke. "It's just so frustrating in this day and time to have a test that's available and people not know about it." And states do not mandate it, he added.
Massachusetts, using complex new technology called tandem mass spectrometry, now subjects the drops of blood drawn from the heels of almost every newborn to tests for MCAD and nearly 30 other inherited diseases. A handful of other states are starting similar programs. But in some states, like Texas, babies are tested for fewer than a half-dozen such hereditary diseases. In some cases, a lack of diagnosis can lead to health disasters and death.
State-to-state disparities exist in many areas of health care. But the gap in newborn screening is so great that federal health officials, parents' groups, some doctors, a private laboratory and some state legislators are trying to step in.
"We think infants, regardless of where they're born, should have equal access to screening and services," said Dr. Claude Earl Fox, the administrator of the federal government's Health Resources and Services Administration.
His agency and the American Academy of Pediatrics are sponsoring a task force on newborn screening, and the group is expected to issue a report in the next few weeks that advocates reducing the screening gap between states.
Newborn screening, experts say, varies so much from state to state because it presents a classic, politically charged public health dilemma: whether money directed to fight rare or incurable diseases might be better spent on other programs.
They see the current grappling with that dilemma as an excellent rehearsal for an even bigger one in years to come: what to test for when DNA-based technology makes it possible to screen newborns for thousands of genetic diseases.
"Public health departments have to be very careful how they spend their dollars so they get the biggest bang for the buck," said Dr. Brad Therrell, director of the National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center.
Public health is a states' rights issue, said Dr. Edward McCabe, who is chairman of the task force, but national decisions should be made on a "core of disorders" to be screened for. "It's a very difficult situation to have a child who may be born across the street from another child and yet have a very different screening experience," Dr. McCabe said.
Dr. Fox noted that "there are states that screen for galactosemia, and that incidence is 1 in 60,000, and states that don't screen for sickle cell anemia, and that incidence is 1 in 600."
"That's a reason to have this task force," Dr. Fox added.
Another reason is the march of technology. Tandem mass spectrometry, which can precisely and efficiently count blood components that become elevated with certain disorders, is catching on. And as some states start using it, the gap between them and states that do not may become a chasm. New parents can ask their hospitals to order the testing, but most do not even know to ask, and most hospitals do not offer it routinely.
Dr. Edwin W. Naylor, president of Neo Gen Screening Inc. of Pittsburgh, the leading private laboratory specializing in spectrometry testing, estimates that, based on data he has collected, of the four million babies born in the United States every year, about 1,000 suffer from conditions, mainly metabolic disorders, that can only be screened for by using tandem mass spectrometry.
"That's 800 to 1,000 babies a year that are not being diagnosed, and I'd say probably a quarter of those are dying," Dr. Naylor said. Although some people question those numbers, they are not out of line with what Massachusetts has found in its first year of expanded screening.
"You have a baby every day or two that's dying of it," Dr. Naylor added. "But the education process, the overcoming the politics of it," come slowly.
The politics varies from state to state.
In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki is seeking $5 million to expand the state's newborn screening program. New Jersey screens infants for just four disorders, the most common among states: phenylketonuria, which can cause retardation if not detected; hypothyroidism, which can stunt growth and brain development, sickle cell anemia and galactosemia, a defect in the breakdown of a sugar in milk. Connecticut screens for seven, a middling number among states.
Dr. Therrell said, "In any particular state, the disorders screened for are directly proportional to the number of proponents for that particular disorder in that particular state, and also to the public health dollars available."
Dr. Naylor said he and his colleagues have successfully used tandem mass spectrometry to detect rare hereditary diseases in newborns since 1992, and Neo Gen has screened nearly one million babies. But it takes time for the technology to gain credibility and for states to decide whether detecting such rare diseases is worth the money.
It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars for state laboratories that choose to do the testing themselves rather than join with a private laboratory like Neo Gen to buy tandem mass spectrometry equipment. Some states deem newborn screening such a basic public health service that they pay for it themselves; others, like Massachusetts, charge for it.
To the families and doctors of children with sometimes fatal disorders that can be screened for but are not, this process is heartbreakingly slow.
"Ten years ago, I could say to such families that there was no way we or anyone could have prevented these deaths or injuries," Dr. Richard I. Kelley, an expert on metabolic disease and an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, wrote to the Newborn Screening Advisory Committee of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. "Today I am faced with the same tragedies, but I can no longer say that the death or injury was unavoidable, only that bureaucracies and the resistance to change have prevented the adoption in this country of proven screening techniques for treatable metabolic disease."
Advocates of expanded testing contend that it is also cost-effective: testing may cost from $20 to $50 per newborn, they say, but babies left undiagnosed could require hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical care over a lifetime.
But some remain unconvinced, wanting to wait for more data.
Tandem mass spectrometry "is promising, it's intriguing, but we need to know whether going in this direction, and going to this expensive technology, in the long run will pay off," said Dr. George Cunningham, chief of the genetic disease branch of the California Department of Health Services. His department has bought a tandem mass spectrometry machine but still needs more financing to start a pilot program.
Also, he said, public health officials must decide whether, for example, it is better to expand the newborn screening program to pick up a rare disorder or to provide expanded prenatal care or provide folic acid to all pregnancies.
Massachusetts is already seeing the first-year results of its expanded screening. Out of the first 75,000 babies screened, it has turned up 10 with metabolic disorders that would have gone undetected without tandem mass spectrometry. The state also began screening for cystic fibrosis, and detected an additional 21 babies.
State health officials deem this first year a technical success, but that does not solve the economic question. It cost Massachusetts about $800,000 to start up the expanded screening, said Dr. Roger Eaton, director of the New England Newborn Screening Program, and though subsequent years will cost much less, "it is expensive for 10 people."
"If you're the family of one of those 10, then it's worth it," Dr. Eaton said. "But there are a lot of needs competing for the same dollar."
Despite the price, the new technology seems to be gaining acceptance. Some laboratory directors predict that regional labs will be set up for states that cannot afford the new technology.
Colorado's newborn screening managers want to expand screening, but first they need approval to raise their fees to $50 from about $33, they say.
In Alabama, which tests newborns for just four disorders, the state laboratory director sounded less enthusiastic, though he predicted that the state would eventually move to tandem mass spectrometry. "The equipment is very expensive," the director, William J. Callan, said, and newborn screening also requires extensive ancillary services, including follow-up tests and counseling.
One of the nation's leading parent-run Web sites on newborn screening, www.tylerforlife.com, describes the consequences of imperfect screening programs. It was founded last year by a couple in Georgia whose son, Tyler, died of galactosemia when he was 10 days old. They did not receive the results of his screening test until three days after his death.
"We had never heard of galactosemia and have since found out that a lot of other people, including health care professionals, have not, either," the couple, Tera and Brendan Mize, wrote on the Web site.
Theirs is a common refrain from parents and doctors of children with rare metabolic disorders. They say the rarity of the diseases often leads to misdiagnoses of cerebral palsy or "birth trauma." There are also indications that some cases of sudden infant death syndrome may be caused by undiagnosed metabolic diseases, experts say.
MCAD, or Medium Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase deficiency, the disorder Bryce has, is one of the more common "inborn errors of metabolism." An associate professor of genetics at Yale University, Piero Rinaldo, testified to the Massachusetts panel on newborn screening that it affected about one baby in 10,000 and led to death 30 percent to 50 percent of the time when a baby had its first crisis, "fatalities which would be prevented with almost no exceptions by simple dietary treatment and basic preventive measures."
The question of just how treatable these disorders are is one of many that states must wrestle with as they consider expanding testing. Their rule of thumb tends to be that a disorder must be prevalent and treatable to be worth screening for, but those lines can blur and move.
Dealing with such issues now is good practice, many say, for the great debates to come as it becomes possible to decipher a newborn's genes and determine tendencies toward all kinds of diseases.
"I see us as moving and now gathering speed toward a whole new world of newborn screening," said Dr. Philip Reilly, a clinical geneticist and lawyer on the Massachusetts panel. "Mass spectrometry will take the world by storm in the next couple of years, and we'll begin to go down the road toward DNA-based screening," raising new issues like privacy and use of the samples in research.
"I would say Massachusetts and a few places are setting a new standard of care," Dr. Reilly said. "And yes, babies unlucky enough to be born in states five years late may suffer."

HEADLINE: States Confronting Challenge of How to Respond to the New World of the Internet

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The Internet, an unruly technology that respects no boundaries, is making life increasingly uncomfortable in state capitols. The biggest source of the unease has been the threat of a punishing loss of state sales-tax revenues as more goods are sold over the Internet, often by faraway companies beyond the reach of state tax collectors.
Yet Internet taxation, the nation's governors say, is merely the first of a wave of challenges that states must deal with as the advance of digital technology creates a new economy. 
 From regulatory regimes to grant programs, they say, the states and the federal government must rethink their respective jurisdictions, responsibilities and methods of supplying services to citizens.
The nation's governors plan to urge Washington to focus on the issue next week when they meet with President Clinton on Monday and with senators on Tuesday. The National Governors' Association plans to call on the Senate to hold hearings on a report the group has prepared, "Governance in the New Economy," and then make recommendations to the president and Congress.
"We're living in a new frontier of federalism because of the rapid pace of technological and organizational change in the new economy," said Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah, a Republican who is chairman of the association. "We have to redefine how we share power and responsibility, and create checks and balances in the federal system in this country."
The report will be presented at the national governors' conference in Washington, which begins today. Governor Leavitt said the report's main purpose was to broaden the debate about how state and federal governments must adapt to the Internet era
The states hope the easy flow of information over the Internet will enable the federal government to monitor state and local job-training programs, for example, more quickly and efficiently. That would allow more flexibility, they say, in designing federally supported programs to address specific local needs while still ensuring accountability.
But political analysts say that the Internet will inevitably lead to a loss of control by the states in certain areas, including privacy protection, Internet-access regulations and tax policy.
"The national government has to step in and set rules to make this cross-border medium of the Internet work," said Rob Atkinson of the Progressive Policy Institute.
The states understand that they are going to have to accept more national standards in the new economy. Last fall, for example, they agreed to support proposed national legislation to simplify tax policy for one of the most popular new technologies, cellular telephones. The states agreed that wireless calls would be treated as if they were made from a person's home regardless of where the calls were actually made.
The taxation issues, however, are far more difficult when the new technology holds the potential to deplete states' coffers. State sales taxes, for example, represent more than 25 percent of total state tax revenues across the country.
The rise of electronic commerce puts a share of those revenues at risk. Online sales, by some estimates, may rise to as much as 20 percent of retail sales over the next decade from less than 2 percent today.
The states do not agree on how to handle the Internet sales tax issue. Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia, a Republican who is chairman of the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce, created by Congress to study Internet taxation, favors a tax-free Internet to foster development of e-commerce. He says federal grants to the states could make up for the lost revenues
But analysts say the tax-free approach fails a basic fairness test by discriminating in favor of Internet companies.
