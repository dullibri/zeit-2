HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
Publisher Will Pay Clinton Over $10 Million for Book

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
Former President Bill Clinton agreed yesterday to sell the worldwide rights to publish his memoirs to Alfred A. Knopf Inc. for an advance of more than $10 million, an amount believed to be the largest ever for a nonfiction book.
 The advance exceeds both the $8.5 million paid for a book by Pope John Paul II in 1994 and the $8 million recently paid to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for her memoirs, scheduled for publication in 2003. 
 Adjusted for inflation, the Pope's advance would be $10.1 million, but people involved in Mr. Clinton's deal say his is substantially higher. Knopf executives would not disclose the figure. 
In agreeing to pay the extraordinary advance, Knopf is betting that Mr. Clinton will continue to be regarded as one of the fascinating personalities of the second half of the 20th century, captivating readers both in the United States and abroad.
"I think he is up there, one of a handful," said Sonny Mehta, president and editor in chief of Alfred A. Knopf, part of the Random House division of Bertelsmann.
Mr. Mehta and Robert Barnett, Mr. Clinton's lawyer handling the sale, declined to disclose much about the planned contents of the memoir. Asked whether the book would deal with sensitive subjects like Monica S. Lewinsky or the Whitewater investigation, Mr. Barnett said only that Mr. Clinton's memoir would be "a comprehensive and candid book about his life, with particular emphasis on the White House years."
And Mr. Mehta said that this was what he expected. "I am as curious to read it as you are," he said. 
The former president plans to write the book himself, with help from researchers and hands-on guidance from Robert Gottlieb, a highly regarded editor who was previously editor in chief of Knopf and later editor of The New Yorker.
Mr. Gottlieb edited Katharine Graham's best-selling and Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, "Personal History," which Mr. Clinton told Knopf's editors he particularly admired. He has also edited other critically acclaimed books, including work by Toni Morrison, Joseph Heller and the historian Robert Caro.
Mr. Clinton's advance, combined with his wife's $8 million payment, will go a long way toward putting the Clintons on firm financial footing. They accumulated $11.3 million in legal expenses during Mr. Clinton's presidency; by March, a legal defense fund had paid off all but $3.9 million.
Knopf has scheduled Mr. Clinton's book for publication in the same year as his wife's book, setting up the possibility of a sort of competition with Senator Clinton's publisher, the Simon & Schuster division of Viacom. "It is going to be a matter of how the president gets on with his, and how Hillary gets on with hers," Mr. Mehta said. "It doesn't make sense for both books to come out at the same time, but stranger things have happened. Both publishers will probably come together to talk about it."
David Rosenthal, publisher of Simon & Schuster, said he did not expect timing to be a problem, especially since his house planned to bring out Mrs. Clinton's book first, early in 2003. "I am sure that there will be adequate spacing between the books," he said. "The Clintons, I am sure, want nothing but the best for each other." Mr. Barnett, of the law firm Williams & Connolly, who represents both of them, said that he also expected publication to be coordinated.
Mr. Mehta has effectively performed an end run around other publishing houses competing for the book by negotiating the deal without an auction.
As news of an imminent deal for Mr. Clinton's book appeared yesterday, publishers scrambled to guess who was acquiring the rights. Several were unaware of Mr. Clinton's talks with Knopf, and some expressed frustration that they had missed the chance to bid for the book.
Mr. Clinton's decision to publish with Knopf is a setback to Simon & Schuster, which has long cultivated its relationship with the Clintons.
"We are disappointed," Mr. Rosenthal said, "but we are satisfied with the book that we do own." 
The groundwork for the sale of the rights to Mr. Clinton's book was laid last winter, when Senator Clinton tested the market with an auction for her memoir. She met privately at the White House with top executives from almost every major publisher to discuss her plans for the book, and Mr. Barnett, her lawyer, invited competitive bids. 
Simon & Schuster, which published her three previous books as well as a book by Mr. Clinton's mother, won the bidding war.
Publishers expected Mr. Clinton to sell the rights to his memoirs soon after he left office. But around that time, he traveled outside the country as controversies about presidential pardons made headlines at home. 
Mr. Mehta first approached Mr. Barnett about Mr. Clinton's memoir sometime this spring. He and Mr. Gottlieb soon met with the former president in Miami, where Mr. Clinton was traveling. Mr. Mehta said yesterday that he was impressed that Mr. Clinton seemed to have studied previous presidential memoirs and spoke analytically of the problems of writing them. 
Mr. Clinton was interested from the start in writing his own book, rather than hiring a ghost writer. Mr. Mehta said he was quickly convinced that the former president could deliver a compelling book.
"Have you listened to him talk?" Mr. Mehta said. "That is one of the things that convinces you."
People who have worked with Mr. Clinton have said that he is sometimes disorganized and undisciplined in his work habits, but Mr. Gottlieb's supervision can be expected to help keep the project on track. 
Peter Osnos, the publisher of PublicAffairs books and a former editor at Random House, who worked with Mr. Clinton on campaign books, said that Mr. Clinton took an active role even when professional writers were involved. "The fact that he says he is writing it himself makes sense because anybody else who tried to would end up being rewritten by him," Mr. Osnos said.
For Mr. Clinton, the decision to negotiate his book deal privately with Knopf avoids the publicity and rigamarole of a formal auction. Yet it may have cost him some money. Publishers said that in an open bidding process, the former president might have secured an even larger amount. 
While some competitors questioned the prudence of such a large advance, it is impossible to estimate how many copies of the book Knopf needs to sell to make a profit, in part because the sale of publication rights abroad is expected to add millions of dollars in revenue.
As president, Mr. Clinton traveled widely, and he remains very popular overseas. Executives at Simon & Schuster say they have sold foreign rights to Senator Clinton's forthcoming book, for example, for about $3 million so far. But even under the most optimistic calculations, making a profit on the sale of the book will require that well over a million copies be sold in the United States, a level only a few books attain each year. 
Publishing executives say that presidential memoirs, acquired in part for prestige, seldom earn enough in royalties to cover their advances, though publishers can still eke out a profit even after writing off some of the advance. Former President Ronald Reagan received $8.5 million from Simon & Schuster for his memoirs, along with a book of his speeches. Mr. Reagan's two books did not generate enough royalties to cover his advance, according to people close to the deal.

HEADLINE: An Expatriate Who Can't Resist Telling His Mount Fuji Story Again; 
Donald Richie Offers a Collection of His Writings on Japan

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
He may have written as long and as famously on Japan as any other living writer, but Donald Richie returns over and over again to a few favorite stories whenever he meets someone curious about his life in this country.
 One of the most frequently revisited yarns concerns his walk through the Ginza, the shopping district in the heart of Tokyo, shortly after he arrived in Japan. He was greeted by the sight of Mount Fuji, 67 miles away, "growing purple and then indigo in the fading light." 
 The visibility of Mount Fuji, a quintessential Japanese symbol, on that winter day in 1947 was a testament to the leveling Tokyo suffered from the American firebombing late in the war.
"Between me and Fuji was a burned wasteland, a vast and blackened plain where a city had once stood," Mr. Richie wrote in a journal about the experience, an entry included in a recently published collection of 50 years of his writing on Japan titled simply "The Donald Richie Reader" (Stone Bridge Press). 
Anyone standing on a Ginza street corner today would see some of the world's most chic and expensive shops and a nonstop parade of stylishly dressed and well-heeled customers, despite 10 years of recession. The scene reflects the postwar affluence of Japan, as does the industrial smog that would keep Mount Fuji from view even if all the area's sleek skyscrapers weren't in the way.
Mr. Richie's career has undergone a transformation not unlike that of Japan, the land he instantly fell in love with upon his arrivalon the last day of 1946 as an ensign with the United States Maritime Service. 
Since Japan was opened to the West by the American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853, each age has a writer sought out by those struggling to understand this country. A century ago it was Lafcadio Hearn; later it was Ruth Benedict, an anthropologist who was commissioned by the United States Army to write about Japan during the war, even though she never set foot here. 
Mr. Richie knew almost nothing about Japan, but quickly resolved to learn everything he could. And although the trajectory would be long and complicated, including a stint as a film critic for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes and a brief job as a contract writer for Reader's Digest, Mr. Richie would go from lowly typist to one of his era's most influential and ubiquitous writers on Japan.
"My only qualification was great typing champion of Allen County," in Ohio, where he was born, Mr. Richie said in an interview, explaining that his first job in Japan after his discharge was as a typist for American Occupation forces. 
By 1962 Mr. Richie, no longer the newcomer without a clue, had this to say about the country's stiff social conventions: "The profile is visible -- to think of Japan is to think of form. But beneath this, a social pattern also exists. There is a way to pay calls, a way to go shopping, a way to drink tea, a way to arrange flowers, a way to owe money. A formal absolute exists and is aspired to: social form must be satisfied if social chaos is to be avoided. Though other countries also have certain rituals that give the disordered flux of life a kind of order, here these become an art of behavior." 
The range of Japanese subjects that Mr. Richie has written about, always perceptively and often authoritatively, seems astounding, from the intricacies of the cuisine to the architecture of the Japanese home, from traditional gardens and Buddhist temples to Japanese gods, Godzilla and tattoos.
In 1993 he wrote about being a foreigner in Japan: "The foreigner has been stared at for well over 100 years. The earlier accounts all mention it and, until the massive foreigner influx of the 1980's, he still was. He became used to it and initial irritation turned to pleasure and then to need. No matter what the Japanese truly thought, he was treated in a special manner. Shortly, however, the visitor discovered that Japan insisted that he keep his distance. It was being suggested he live with his own kind; he was being edged toward ghettofication. The exceptions being made for the foreigner then began to be perceived as limitations. Though he desired intimacy, Japan was gently teaching him to keep his distance." 
Some of his most penetrating commentary has been on Tokyo, a place with no true downtown or any other obvious plan, whose organizing themes he manages to make sense of as few others have.
Mr. Richie, who is 77, has a book-lined apartment overlooking the vast lotus-filled pond of Ueno Park in Tokyo. The neighborhood is coursing with energy, if a bit seedy around the edges, and feels like a cross between Central Park West and precleanup Times Square. When asked why he lives there, he offers a disquisition on sprawl: "Ueno has remained a bit like old Tokyo, which means it hasn't turned into Tokyoland yet. Tokyoland, like Disneyland, is a series of simulacrums, worlds that are miniaturized so they can be grasped. Most of Tokyo's neighborhoods have become self-enclosed, highly planned areas that are man-made, not grown."
His first love in Japanese culture, and the subject for which he has achieved the most renown, is its cinema. His film books are among his most popular works to be translated into Japanese.
When Mr. Richie arrived here, fraternization between occupier and the occupied was strictly controlled, and M.P.'s patrolled Tokyo to try to make sure that Americans did not enter Japanese bars, nightclubs, Kabuki playhouses and movie theaters.
"I could do without the bars, the brothels and the Kabuki," Mr. Richie said. "But I had been in love with the movies since childhood. Back then they put children in the movie theater to pacify them, but it enchanted me."
"For me," he added, "movies became the preferred way of life, and when I wanted to get to know Japan I had to know its movies. That's where the secrets are."
In his books and countless essays, Mr. Richie has limned memorable portraits of the greatest names in Japanese cinema, Akira Kurosawa, for example, the director of "Seven Samurai" and many other celebrated films, and Kurosawa's most famous actor and collaborator, Toshiro Mifune. About the latter, Mr. Richie wrote that he always wore "the look of a person who is doing his best to be good in a world that is not."
While figures like these came to be appreciated in the West, some of Mr. Richie's best writing has been about giants of Japanese film who were not recognized overseas.
A 1975 essay on the director Yasujiro Ozu, for example, which is included in Mr. Richie's reader, is a labor of love and a masterpiece of the kind of criticism that tries to make the difficult or obscure accessible.
Ozu's films are famously slow-paced, and use only the simplest-seeming camera techniques -- typically static shots taken from the level of a person seated on the ground, in a traditional Japanese style.
"It is the same as the position from which one watches the Noh or the rising moon, from which one partakes of the tea ceremony or a cup of hot sake," Mr. Richie wrote. "It is the aesthetic attitude; it is the passive attitude. Less poetically, it also represents the viewpoint of a then-majority of Japanese. They spent their life on the floor and any attempt to view such a life through a camera high up on a tripod was nonsense."
True to what he said about using film to "learn" Japan, the cinema essay, for Mr. Richie, is usually a chance to digress on the wider society, and for all of his accumulated experience, his eye retains the freshness of the dilettante.
Watching Ozu's films, for example, gave Mr. Richie insight into the workings of daily life. "Most of Ozu's characters are noticeably content with their lives, but there are always indications that the family will shortly cease to be what it has been," he writes. "The dissolution of the family is a catastrophe because in Japan -- as contrasted with the United States, where leaving the family is considered proof of maturity -- one's sense of self depends to an important extent upon those with whom one lives, studies or works."
Still, many of his themes recur: the proliferation and use of symbols in daily life; the intensity of feeling of Japaneseness, and the special role of the outsider (and the impossibility of assimilation) in helping affirm it; the fondness for adaptation of ideas and things imported; and the uses of kitsch.
Entire industries here revolve around continually celebrating the notion of Japanese uniqueness, often relying on dubious history and contrived science to make the point. But after a life of observing the quirky features that make Japan Japanese, Mr. Richie offers a deflating thought for those desperate to believe in their uniqueness, and characteristically pulls it off without subtracting one iota from his love for his subject.
"People who want to find national differences because they have some kind of need," he said. "You might say that Japan is a religious country, and the religion is Japaneseness, and we, the foreigners, or gaijin, are talked about in a certain way because without us they cannot define themselves. I'm afraid, though, that in the end, our differences are truly minuscule."

From Film to Kitsch

These are excerpts from "The Donald Richie Reader: 50 Years of Writing on Japan" (Stone Bridge Press), compiled and edited by Arturo Silva.

FROM "OZU," 1975 -- The Japanese continue, 10 years after his death, to think of Yasujiro Ozu as the most Japanese of all their directors. This does not mean he is their favorite, though he has been given more official honor than any other. It means that he is regarded as a kind of spokesman: Ozu, one is told, "Had the real Japanese flavor." This "Japanese flavor" has a more definite meaning than, say, "the American way," or "the French touch," if only because Japan remains so intensely conscious of its Japaneseness.
FROM "FUJI FROM GINZA," 1947 -- Tokyo back then was poor. Poverty gave it the Asian look, an appearance that prewar Japan had been at some pains to avoid. But then Asia had moved closer. And with it a kind of natural nudity once the weather got warm enough. By summer, many were unclothed. There were no more laws against going naked and so people naturally did -- in hot weather being naked is more comfortable than being clothed. Bare breasts in the suburbs were not uncommon and in Asakusa I once saw a man returning from his bath wearing his towel on his head, and nothing else. Children were often naked in midsummer and the fisherfolk of the further coasts of Chiba traditionally worked nude with only a small red ribbon tied around the member lest the goddess Benten, deity of the sea, be offended. I used to stand on street corners -- not perhaps those of Ginza, but certainly those of Ueno and Asakusa -- and gaze at the shapely limbs, the curves and angles of all this beautiful bare skin. And some not so beautiful. Malnutrition is no beauty aid. When you look at naked people one of two things can occur. You get excited, feel sexy, view the nude as desirable. Or, you see the human race, finally, as it is: innocent, vulnerable, unknowing and beautiful in that general way which discourages possessiveness.

FROM "THE 'REAL' DISNEYLAND," 1985 -- It is evident that the Japanese claim to prior Disneyfication is a very strong one. No other country has brought the principle of the microcosm -- ikebana, bonsai, chanoyu, gardens -- to such profuse perfection. No other has managed to turn so much into something else. So when one wonders why Japan, such a Disneyland itself, needed a real Disneyland, one must conclude that it found here something in which a true fellow-feeling was discovered. And also, perhaps, because in Disneyland it recognized as well one of its own enduring qualities. This is a passion amounting to near genius for kitsch.

HEADLINE: Young Job Seekers Need New Clues 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
The interview was over five minutes after it began.
 Ron Donoho, executive editor of San Diego Magazine, had barely ushered a job prospect into his office this spring to discuss an internship when he stumped her with what he thought was an easy question. 
 "All I did was ask her what she could offer the magazine," Mr. Donoho recalled last week. But the woman, a recent college graduate, froze. "All she could say was, 'Hmmmmm, that's a toughie,' " he said. "Then she added, 'I was more wanting to hear what you could do for me.' " 
A few hours later, in an apparent attempt to redeem herself, Mr. Donoho said, the candidate e-mailed him a note elaborating on her qualifications for the news reporting post. The note began: "Besides the occasional hangover, here's what else I could bring into the office," and proceeded to list a number of attributes that she seemed to feel would make her more desirable, including her sense of fashion.
Needless to say, she did not get the job.
Experts say that such candidates are becoming increasingly common. Many young workers who entered the marketplace in the recent boom years never had to learn the traditional rules of job hunting, from showing up for an interview in a suit to following up with a thank-you note. Now that the job market has tightened, though, more and more -- including those with a job or two already under their belt -- are scrambling to master these basic skills, with varying degrees of shock and dismay.
For the most part, "20-somethings have never had to compete for jobs" in such a climate, said Allison Hemming, president of the Hired Guns, a temporary-staffing agency based in New York. She founded the Pink Slip Party, a Manhattan club for people who have been laid off from dot-com jobs. "They're used to being pursued, not being the pursuer."
Certainly, the job market was much different for those who entered the employment world in the mid-1990's. For instance, the Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising, which measures demand for workers, fell from 82 in July 1995 to 58 last month.
Young job candidates who find they have to sell themselves, Ms. Hemming said, often do not even know where to look for their next job.
"These guys have relied strictly on the Internet and headhunters in the past," she said. "Now, headhunters aren't as interested in this age group, and so a lot of these people have no clue how to go at it on their own."
Meg DeKeukelaere, a branch manager for the Manhattan office of Spherion, an administrative-staffing concern, said she had received "an unusually high number of phone calls from mothers, asking how they can get interviews for their 20-something kids."
Ms. DeKeukelaere added, "We've never had that before."
Employers say that candidates who manage to land interviews are increasingly unprepared -- sometimes woefully so -- for the interviewing process. "Many can't provide details to probing questions," said Paige Soltano, a senior partner and hiring director for Bozell New York, an advertising agency. "If they tell you they completed a successful project at their old job, and you ask them why it was successful, they aren't able to give any details."
But the biggest difference Ms. Soltano has noted recently is the attire. Although she is used to interviewing candidates in their 20's -- most of the agency's employees are under 35 -- Ms. Soltano says recent applicants have "reached a new low" in dressing for interviews. "I see young women all the time who wear little sun dresses with bra straps showing, along with fancy flip-flops," she said. "This winter, I had guys coming in T-shirts and Army boots. It's as if no one ever taught them how to look for a job."
Ms Hemming says she has even had to counsel members of her Pink Slip club on their hair for interviews, recently urging one young Web designer to dye his orange hair back to brown. "When the economy was hot, job interviews were sort of 'come as you are' events," she said. "Now, they've gotten formal again, and some people are resisting that."
Augusto Matias, a systems administrator in New York who has been job hunting for several months, acknowledges that he was clueless at first about how to cope in the new job marketplace.
Mr. Matias, 25, worked for an Internet service provider for about two years, but quit in May 2000 to travel to Asia and Europe. When he returned in January he decided to spend a few more months relaxing before looking for work.
The few interviews he has had thus far have gone nowhere, lamented Mr. Matias, who, with no college degree, earned more than $55,000 at the Internet company. "The way I've heard about jobs in the past is by headhunters calling me and offering me $10,000 more than I was earning at my current job -- I never even had to go through interviews," he said.
He once arrived in khakis and a long-sleeved shirt for an interview, he said, and later fretted that he was overlooked because he did not wear a suit. "I'm sort of learning this stuff as I go along."
Some of the young job seekers behave as well as dress too informally during the interview process, Ms. Soltano said.
One recent candidate stood up to thank her for her time, she said, and then proceeded to pull her newspaper out of her office wastebasket. "He said, 'Oh you're done with this?' and then pulled it out -- along with my coffee and breakfast, which spilled out all over the floor," Ms. Soltano said.
Larry Engelgau, president of Management Recruiters of Portland in Oregon, a unit of the Cleveland-based Management Recruiters International, says that while most of the young people he sees are relatively polished, many are less than enthusiastic or even realistic. "Folks in their 20's are still coming in expecting to get six-figure jobs right off the bat, and they seem put off when you tell them they might have to work their way up to that figure," he said. "These young people have some pretty big misconceptions, and that shows up during the interviewing process."
But as is especially true with any tightening job market, even candidates who seem better prepared and more realistic are not necessarily finding success. Scott Berwitz, 24, has been the victim of layoffs by two public relations firms in two years, most recently in June. Although he says he follows basic interviewing protocol and dresses "by the book," he has received little interest this summer from employers.
"I graduated with honors right in the middle of the career boom," in 1999, Mr. Berwitz said. "This is certainly not a situation I would ever have expected to find myself in."

HEADLINE: BP Predicts It Will Meet Output Target For the Year 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
Easing concerns that a global economic slump would crimp demand for its oil and gas, BP said today that it planned to meet production targets set earlier this year.
 The reassuring announcement came along with a 5.2 percent reported rise in the company's second-quarter earnings and stood in sharp contrast to recent warnings from rivals like Royal Dutch/Shell that their production could fall short of previous forecasts. 
 BP had set a more aggressive production target to begin with -- an increase of 5 to 7 percent. Exxon Mobil projected only 3 percent growth this year, and Royal Dutch/ Shell, 5 percent. BP's optimistic outlook also runs counter to a forecast of falling demand for oil by the International Energy Agency. 
"BP has made it clear that the current production targets are based on existing projects that have already been sanctioned," said Doug Leggate, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities. Mr. Leggate said he rated BP's stock a hold, though comments today by Lord Browne, the company's chief executive, had made his outlook more positive.
Lord Browne told analysts he was "especially delighted with the growth in oil and gas production" and that the company had improved efficiency in its fields.
Net income rose to $3.8 billion, or 16.92 cents a share, in the first six months of 2001, compared with $3.6 billion, or 16.54 cents a share, in the first half of 2000. The results were slightly better than analysts had forecast, and BP's share price rose $1.33, or 2.7 percent, to $50.15.
Like some rivals, BP benefited from higher natural gas prices in the United States and strong profit margins at its refineries. It is also reaping gains from integrating acquisitions and improved efficiency; for all of 2001, it expects those gains to reach $2 billion.
Under Lord Browne, BP spent some $100 billion on takeovers in three years, including Amoco, ARCO, Burmah Castrol and others.
BP's future earnings growth, like that of rivals, depends largely on a factor beyond its control, crude oil prices. Last month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its production quotas by a million barrels a day in an effort to keep prices at $22 to $28 a barrel as the global economy cools.
Profit from finding and pumping oil and gas rose 8 percent, to $3.9 billion, and those from fuel refining and marketing rose 27 percent, to $1.76 billion. But earnings from chemicals all but vanished because of rising costs and slow demand.

HEADLINE: Sluggish Germany Begins to Drag Down Rest of Europe 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
Germany, Europe's biggest economy, provided more evidence today that its growth has come to a stop and that it is dragging down the rest of the Continent.
 The government reported today that industrial production declined slightly in June, adding up to a decline of about 2.3 percent in the second quarter. The unemployment rate climbed in July for the seventh consecutive month, to 9.2 percent from 8.9 percent in June. 
 The new data, though not as bad as many economists had expected, nevertheless provoked new unease across Europe. The euro, which had been gaining value against the dollar in recent weeks, dropped sharply, though it regained some ground later in the day. 
Most economists now predict that Germany's economy will grow only about 1 percent this year, probably the weakest performance of any country in the European Union. Many also think the economy may already have contracted in the second quarter, and say it will be lucky to expand at all in the third. Because Germany accounts for one-third of total output in the 12 nations adopting the euro currency, its problems mean trouble for its neighbors. They also mean that Europe is in no position to replace the United States as a locomotive for world growth.
German political leaders and many economists have blamed the slowdown emanating from the United States for most of Germany's problems. Germany depends more on exports than most countries, particularly sales of the kinds of heavy equipment that companies stop buying in slowdowns.
But a growing body of evidence suggests that many of Germany's problems begin right at home. Notably the country's exports are still growing, in part because of a cost advantage derived from the euro's weakness.
Indeed, German exports are in many ways the brightest part of the economy right now.
BMW, the maker of luxury sedans and sports cars, said today that its profit doubled in the first half of 2001, as sales in the United States surged 21 percent. The Mercedes unit of DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen have also enjoyed rising sales in the United States, while total American car sales fell by about 5 percent.
Yet here in the home market, car sales have declined sharply the last year, especially for midpriced cars, in part because of higher fuel prices and fuel taxes. Luxury models eked out only modest gains. 
The chemical conglomerate, BASF, reported today that its operating profit shrank 15 percent in the second quarter, and that it would eliminate another 1,200 jobs around the world on top of the 3,000 jobs it had already planned to cut. BASF's biggest decline in sales was in Europe, and Germany in particular; North American sales fell 5.2 percent and in Asia and Latin America, sales rose.
"Currently, we have only one advantage, which is the weak euro," said Stefan Bielmeyer, an economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. "You can see the result in exports, which are very healthy. It is not exports that are hurting G.D.P."
So what is really ailing Germany's biggest economy?
Part of the problem is that exports are not providing as much growth as people had been expecting a year ago. But perhaps more important, the domestic economy never really achieved much dynamism when times were relatively good last year. Germany's growth reached 3 percent last year, slightly below the European average of 3.4 percent but much higher than in any other year since the euphoria after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
But even in a good year, consumers remained cautious. Though the government passed important tax cuts that took effect in January, they were soon offset by rising energy prices. The falling euro made imported goods -- including oil -- more expensive. And gasoline taxes were raised. All in all, consumers wound up with little if any extra money to spend, and new reasons to worry about their financial security.
"I am not surprised that Germany has been hit harder than other countries," said Gustav Horn, head of macroeconomic research at the Deutsche Institut fur Wirtschaft in Berlin. "But I was surprised by the slack this year. What we underestimated was the effect of the oil price shock and the price increases in food. This resulted in an accelation in inflation, which had effects on personal consumption."
Many economists still think that German consumers will perk up later this year, now that inflation seems to be subsiding. But German industry is pulling back sharply. On Monday, the German government reported a steep decline in orders for manufactured goods in June, especially for machinery, equipment and other capital goods.
But the big surprise was that foreign orders declined slightly, by 0.4 percent, while domestic orders plunged 4.5 percent. In capital goods, the contrast was even starker: foreign orders were up 1.9 percent, domestic orders were down 8.5 percent.
Separating the American slowdown from the problems in Germany's backyard is not easy because a big part of German manufacturers' retrenchment reflects fears about events overseas.
"Both influences are important," said Willi Leibfritz, chief forecaster at the IFO economic research institute in Munich. "We have seen in the first half of this year a slowdown in foreign demand, but domestic demand has also been weak."
But Jean-Marie Mercier, an economist at Schroeder Salomon Smith Barney in London, said Germany might have already slipped into a recession. "The impact from the global demand slowdown has fed through very quickly to domestic confidence and domestic demand, and that is where you had the German surprises," he said.

To the Editor:
 "Rural Towns Turn to Prisons to Reignite Their Economies" (front page, Aug. 1), describing how a 1,440-bed prison sparked an economic revival in Sayre, Okla., could not have been richer with irony. Here we have one town buoying its economy on the human fallout from another's economic decline and a city official gleefully predicting that nothing will stop crime as crime rates fall for the eighth year in a row. 
 Housing humans who labor for nothing and serve as "cogs" for an "economic engine" was reportedly done away with in Lincoln's day.

HEADLINE: Investing for College, Before Taxes 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Recently enacted federal tax legislation brought some good news to the more than 150,000 investors in New York State's College Savings Program, but the stock market has been less kind.
 Under the new tax law, earnings on investments in the program, which were already free from New York State taxes, will no longer be subject to federal income taxes when the money is withdrawn to pay for college. 
 The bad news is that the program's stock market investments -- like many others -- have not shown much in the way of earnings lately, although their investments in bonds and money market instruments have helped somewhat.
Until this year, virtually all of the stock market investments in the College Savings Program had been placed in growth stocks, which rose handsomely in 1999 but dropped sharply in late 2000 and early this year. In the March-to-June quarter, growth stocks again outperformed the broader stock market. 
Officials associated with the plan say that investors should not focus too much on those returns, but on the long-term outlook, since markets are volatile.
"If you take into account the long-term horizon, the tax benefits, and the low fees, this has been a very good investment," said Theresa Bourgeois, a spokeswoman for the New York State comptroller's office, which helped initiate the program and now runs it.
She said that the overall goal of the program was to try to match or exceed the rate of inflation in college tuition and that officials believed they would be able to do that over the long term.
As of June 30, accounts for students within a couple of years of entering college have shown an annual average return of about 4 percent since the program's inception. Accounts for younger students, which were more heavily invested in the stock market, have risen by less. And the average annual return for children born last year is actually down.
The pain of the declining stock investments has been offset, in part, by the fact that New York residents may put up to $5,000 into the plan before taxes. In most other states, deposits to college savings plans are made with after-tax money.
"The tax deduction is a real tangible economic benefit regardless of vagaries of the stock market," said Timothy Lane, a vice president at TIAA-CREF, the large pension fund management company that is investing the New York College Savings Program money. He said that for New York City residents who can also deduct their investments from their New York City taxable income, "It is like starting out with a 10 percent return."
The program now manages $722 million in assets, up from about $565 million at the end of last year. Investors can enroll through the Web site, www.nysaves.org, or by telephone at 1-877-NYSAVES. 
When the program opened in late September 1998, investments were divided among stocks, bonds and money market instruments based on the age of the intended beneficiary of each account. 
Under the plan's structure, if an account was for a very young child, 75 percent of the money was automatically put into stocks. For a student entering college in a couple of years, only 20 percent of the money was invested in stocks because the student was considered more vulnerable if the stock market turned down. 
Investors were given no say in how the money was allocated; under federal tax rules, they would lose their tax benefits if they did.
But since January, with changes and clarifications of the federal tax code, New York has given investors more choice since January. They now have four options that they can mix and match when they send in new money, but they cannot move the money around after that.
One new option -- high equity -- is 100 percent invested in a broad stock market index: the Russell 3000. About $27 million, or 7 percent of the program's assets, are invested in this option.
Another new option will guarantee investors a specific return -- say 3 or 4 percent -- on their investments. That plan is still waiting for regulatory approval, so no rate has been set yet and the money is temporarily being held in money market instruments. About $6.5 million is committed to this approach.
A third option is the managed allocation approach, the only approach available before January. Under this option, an investor's money is divided up depending on the age of the beneficiary, and shifted as the beneficiary moves closer to college. More than three-quarters of the funds in the program are in this category. 
The last option -- the aggressive managed allocation option -- follows a similar approach, but with a heavier emphasis on stocks. An account for a new baby, for example, is 100 percent in stocks rather than 75 percent. And when the baby turns 15, the account will still be half stocks, rather than only 30 percent. About $43 million is in this category.
Both of the managed allocation accounts are invested in growth stocks. Because these companies are seen as having better prospects for growth, investors typically pay a higher price for their earnings. Among the largest stocks in the Russell 3000 Growth Index are General Electric, Microsoft, Pfizer, Intel and AOL.
Some investment managers, like Theodore R. Aronson in Philadelphia, say that is an unusual approach, because as a group, growth stocks will be more volatile than a broader mix of stocks. In good markets they may rise more, but in bad markets, they are likely to decline more.
"It surprises me that an investment pool like this would lean on growth," he said. "You might find a tilt in a fund toward growth or value stocks, but you would seldom find an exclusive focus."
But researchers at TIAA-CREF concluded that growth stocks were the investment likely to provide the highest return at the least risk, given the length of time the college accounts would be invested and the fact that the accounts would gain balance from their sizable holdings in bonds and money market instruments.
"What we were doing was looking for the best growth with the least risk, knowing that there would be some counterweight," said Mr. Lane of TIAA-CREF.
He said that investors should not be put off by the declines in their portfolios when they occur, even if they appear to be bigger than for other stock portfolios.
"It's a dangerous game to look at the results quarter by quarter," he said. "The reality is that individuals do get financial statements. But what is really important is continuing to invest."

HEADLINE: Arafat and the Power of Persuasion 

BYLINE:  By Martin Indyk; Martin Indyk was American ambassador to Israel from 1995 to 1997 and again from January 2000 to July 2001. He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
As one who has just returned from the front lines of the intifada, I find the current argument about what happened at Camp David to be surreal. Violence is worsening, Hamas's strength is growing and the Palestinian Authority's institutions are beginning to crumble. Unless we quickly intervene to reverse the rapid deterioration, the next terrorist attack could push both sides toward open warfare and threaten American interests in regional stability as well.
 Our focus should be on persuading Yasir Arafat to take the initiative to stop the violence. If he does that, my own experience suggests, it will not be difficult to get Mr. Sharon to respond. The only way to stop the escalating cycle of violence is to replace it with more vigorous Palestinian efforts to arrest terrorists, reciprocated by Israeli actions to stop targeted assassinations, ease closures of the West Bank and Gaza, and redeploy Israel's military forces. 
 Can Mr. Arafat stop the violence? Back in June we glimpsed his capabilities. At that time, he declared a unilateral cease-fire and then committed himself to a work plan hammered out by George Tenet, director of the American Central Intelligence Agency, which included arresting terrorists. Even before this, Mr. Arafat had stopped the shooting from the Bethlehem area onto the Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo. After Mr. Arafat's efforts, violent activities declined throughout most of the West Bank and Gaza. Until last week, his security forces had also begun to stop the mortar firing in Gaza and had taken steps to control violence connected to arms smuggling across the Egyptian border at Rafah.
However, Mr. Arafat still had not stopped drive-by shootings in the northern West Bank. And, most important of all, he had avoided a serious effort to arrest those members of Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad who were involved in terrorist activities. Instead, he had jawboned Hamas into a temporary suspension of bombings, but Islamic Jihad operatives and others were thumbing their noses at him. 
This is typical of Mr. Arafat. Confronting Hamas and Islamic Jihad is no easy wave of the hand for him, especially since he has allowed them free rein and let elements of his own security forces collaborate with them. He has always preferred consensus building to confrontation with these opposition elements, and this is even more so today because of their popularity with Palestinians angered by Israel's attacks.
But Mr. Arafat has acted effectively against the terrorists in the past, and he remains capable of doing so today. He is very much in control of the nine security organizations he established to maintain order in the West Bank and Gaza. Mr. Arafat may just be desperate enough now to issue orders to them to put terrorist organizers in "protective custody." But he will be able to sustain those orders only if he gets help from Israel and the United States.
Mr. Sharon will need to stay his army's hand and ease the economic pressure on the Palestinian people. He began to do this back in June. After his own cease-fire declaration, he tolerated a degree of violent activity while Mr. Arafat made an effort to bring it under control. He stopped launching raids into areas under Mr. Arafat's authority. He loosened the closure in areas where there was quiet and indicated through his security chiefs to Mr. Arafat that he was prepared to go much further.
But as the weeks wore on, with Palestinian violence continuing, Mr. Sharon's tolerance evaporated. Under pressure from his own right wing to end restraint and facing intelligence assessments that Mr. Arafat was doing nothing about terrorists who were planning more bombings, Mr. Sharon resumed targeted assassinations of people believed to be involved in terror activities.
This is where the United States should have come in. Instead, the Bush administration watched the deterioration from the sidelines, substituting daily denunciations from the State Department for high-level engagement with the parties. That approach didn't work this time, any more than it worked when the Clinton administration brokered the Sharm el Sheik understanding and then watched from the sidelines as the violence continued.
Left to their own devices, Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to end the cycle of violence. Effective American intervention is necessary and does not require us to reinvent the wheel. The blueprint for ending the violence already exists in the Tenet work plan, and the road map for rebuilding confidence and resuming negotiations has already been outlined in the Mitchell Report. Mr. Arafat has already committed to arresting terrorists, and Mr. Sharon has already agreed to putting a freeze on settlements, including "natural growth," when the confidence-building period begins.
Now the first step is for the United States, backed by the international community, to insist that both sides renew their commitments to a mutual cease-fire, with a specific date for putting it into effect. We need to establish a "monitoring group" much like the American-led team that helped maintain a degree of stability in southern Lebanon from 1996 until the Israeli withdrawal from there last year. Its central element would be a small team of American, Israeli and Palestinian officials capable of around-the-clock monitoring of the cease-fire. The team would investigate violations by either side and provide accounts of the incidents to the two leaders for prompt and appropriate action.
I believe this type of arrangement would be acceptable to the Israeli government. Although it is not the international observer force Mr. Arafat would prefer, it would give him the assurance of third-party involvement and the ability to say that he was not following Israel commands. 
Finally, the parties should move directly from the cease-fire declaration into the "cooling-off" period recommended by the Mitchell Commission. We should not wait for the seven days of quiet that Mr. Sharon is now insisting on before beginning this period. This would give the Palestinians the sense that the process is moving toward the confidence-building measures and the resumption of negotiations, both of which are important to them. And Mr. Sharon can be reassured that the cooling-off period would stop if there was significant violence and would resume only when quiet was restored. 
Of course, none of this can work absent Mr. Arafat's decision to confront the terrorists, Mr. Sharon's willingness to reciprocate with substantial restraint and a commitment from President Bush to more intensive and sustained engagement by his administration. In the process, Mr. Arafat will have the opportunity to show himself capable of being a partner to Israel and the United States in peace negotiations. And if he doesn't, there won't be a peace process to argue about.

Nothing For Something

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Recently I gave the "bipartisan" commission on Social Security reform -- many of its members and staff are actually associated with the ultra-conservative Cato Institute -- a very hard time over its interim report. Was I unfair? No. It's even worse than I thought. 
 I had been trying to come up with a reductio ad absurdum, something that would demonstrate how nonsensical the commission's analysis is. But I needn't have bothered; a commission member, Thomas Saving, did the job for me, in a presentation he gave at Cato. He repeated the report's claim that the trust fund accumulated through decades of Social Security surpluses is no help when it comes to paying future benefits. But he was more specific: The trust fund is worthless, he said, because it is invested in U.S. government bonds. If it were invested in German bonds the trust fund could indeed be used to pay benefits. 
 Let's see: Last year the Social Security system collected about $90 billion more in payroll taxes than it paid in benefits. Mr. Saving says that if that money had been invested in German bonds it would have made a real contribution to the system's future; but because it was used to buy U.S. bonds it somehow disappeared into a black hole. 
Is he saying that last year's Social Security surplus did not enhance the government's future ability to pay benefits? If so, he's just plain wrong. Last year the government paid off more than $200 billion in debt to the public, largely because of the Social Security surplus. And lower debt implies lower future interest payments, which means that the government can pay more in benefits without raising taxes or cutting other spending.
Or is he saying that future administrations will not allow the Social Security administration to apply the interest on its U.S. bonds to benefit payments? That's possible; but future administrations could also, with equal ease, snatch the interest on German bonds and use it for something else. Neither prospect seems likely. 
Mr. Saving is a competent economist -- he's a professor at Texas A&M -- but I can't see any way to make economic sense of his argument. It makes sense only as part of a political strategy.
The rest of the political strategy became apparent when Representatives Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, and Charles Stenholm, a Texas Democrat, introduced a bill to create private investment accounts within Social Security. It wasn't a good bill, but at least the sponsors admitted that such accounts could not be created without tax increases and benefit cuts. "Anyone that tells you there is a painless way to fix Social Security simply isn't telling the whole truth," declared Mr. Kolbe. 
That's an interesting remark. Wasn't there a presidential candidate who promised gain without pain from the creation of private accounts? As I remember, his slogan was "It's your money!"
Sure enough, the Bush administration wasted no time denouncing the Kolbe-Stenholm bill for suggesting that there might be any downside to Social Security privatization. The bill's sponsors had described themselves as "canaries in a mine," testing the atmosphere. After the administration's rejection -- one might say betrayal -- Mr. Stenholm was bitter: "We were hoping to be the mine canaries, but we weren't expecting to be shot by the owners of the mine on the way down the shaft."
But now the administration's political strategy is clear. It is not interested in a realistic proposal for privatizing Social Security; it intends to sell private accounts with false advertising, with the promise of something for nothing. And the administration is equally uninterested in a realistic assessment of the current Social Security system. Instead it will attempt to scare people with the threat of pain without gain, of nothing for something -- that is, with the help of the commission the administration will try to convince people that the huge surpluses of today's Social Security system somehow make no contribution to the system's future solvency. 
One might ask why it has to be this way. Is the actual case for privatization so weak that its advocates dare not tell the truth? Or has the administration concluded, after its successful mendacity on the tax cut, that dishonesty is always the best policy?
In any case, let's not pretend that we are having a real, honest discussion. The privatizers know what they want, and they will say anything -- no matter how untrue -- in order to get it.

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
Delta's chief says the solution to air-traffic woes is more runways.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column apears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytime.s.com

 BODY:
YOU think the air-transport system is crowded now? Just wait, says Leo F. Mullin, the chairman and chief executive of Delta Air Lines. 
 "Last year we had about 680 million people who traveled by air" in the United States, Mr. Mullin said in a recent interview in Atlanta, where Delta is based. 
 "The F.A.A. has projected that number will be one billion people in the year 2010," he said. "And that one billion can be forecast with a great deal of accuracy because these people exist. They may be 15 years old now, but 10 years from now they're going to be 25 years old and entering their professional -- and travel -- lives. It's one of the easiest extrapolations you can make. A billion people are going to travel by 2010, and we are having grave trouble satisfying demand with 680 million passengers right now." 
In the last year, Mr. Mullin, who will mark his fifth anniversary as Delta's boss next week, has emerged as the industry's point man in a nascent drive to change public discourse over the troubled air-transport system. Now that we've blamed and cursed the airlines for delays and deteriorating service, Mr. Mullin thinks it's time to accelerate the debate on what he insists is the real solution to our air-travel woes: a major expansion of airports in the United States.
Other views -- opposing, amplifying or otherwise -- are hereby solicited for a follow-up column on this subject. Meanwhile, Mr. Mullin has the floor.
"What we need to do is create a tremendous expansion in the system," he said. Besides accepting significantly more air traffic at lesser-used secondary airports, as airlines dispatch small regional jets on ever-more-important feeder routes, the country needs to commit to building 50 miles of new runways at major airports by 2010, he said. At about two miles a runway, that's 25 new runways. Right now, fewer than a dozen are even in the planning stage, and it often takes five years or more to get a runway approved.
"Fifty miles of new runways at 25 airports throughout this country would largely solve the problem" of air-system gridlock by 2010, he said, given the already planned technological improvements in government and airline air-traffic management.
Naturally, there is a hitch, and that is the influence of good old American Nimby -- not in my backyard. In the case of air traffic and the considerable noise and other annoyances associated with it, that backyard can stretch from the airport fence to the farther reaches of a metropolis. 
Mr. Mullin, a Harvard trained engineer and mathematician, was a banker in Chicago and ran Conrail in Philadelphia before joining Delta. He is unusual in an industry in which some top executives cower behind public relations assistants who themselves use secretaries to dodge reporters' phone calls. He doesn't dodge controversy.
"There are obviously issues associated with putting in new runways" because "communities in all of these major metropolitan areas have built right up to the edge of the airport," he said. 
A top priority, he said, is a proposed major expansion at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, where local opposition has intensified as plans have advanced. "In my very strong judgment, and I think it's shared by my competitive colleagues in the industry, expansion of O'Hare is absolutely crucial not only to Chicago but to the aviation system in America," he said. "But it is in fact tied up in all these environmental issues and community-concern issues."
Over the last decade, he said, airlines have sharply reduced aircraft noise "far in excess" of levels mandated by governments. "The noise around airports is on the order of one-tenth per airplane of what it was back in the late 1980's," he said. "Of course, there now is a problem obviously created by increased frequency of flights. The noise from an individual airplane might not be as great, but if you have more airplanes flying in, you're still going to have those difficulties." 
Airports ballooning into adjacent neighborhoods is even more controversial. "When we had to expand on the fifth runway here in Atlanta, it went into the town of College Park," Mr. Mullin said of a new runway being built as part of a $5.4 billion expansion at Hartsfield International Airport. 
"There was a major convention center in College Park, and the end of the runway reached right up to that point. So the convention center had to be torn down, and various residences had to be moved."
To serve national air-transport needs, some communities are necessarily going to be made unhappy, just as they are when highways expand into developed areas, he suggested.
In Atlanta, for example, "the next level of expansion, which I would see in the year 2010, is going to have far more serious consequences in terms of the number of households that are going to have to be moved and hotels taken out and so forth," Mr. Mullin said. Similar "community disruption" will occur at other expanding airports, he added.
Like the rail system of 100 years ago, the air-transport system, he argued, "is a fundamental component of the economy of this country."
To Mr. Mullin, that means laying concrete and building, even if some people oppose it. "It is going to create those problems, and communities are going to have to debate these things out," he said. "But at the end of the day, the option of not having an efficiently operating air-travel system is not an option at all."

HEADLINE: In Switch, Transit Ridership Outpaces Cars, Study Finds 

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
No one who has ridden recently on a packed New York subway or bus needs to be told: public transit ridership has exploded over the last few years.
 But a new transportation study has found a surprising corollary to this trend. In the 1990's, for the first time since before World War II, the growth in public transit ridership outstripped the growth in auto use in the five boroughs, according to the study. 
 In effect, the reversal suggests that the Robert Moses era, in which highway expansion and automobiles were favored at the expense of public transit, has come to an end. 
And the tremendous investment that has been made over the last two decades in subways and buses appears to have paid off not only in increasing transit ridership but also, along with other factors, in discouraging car use, an accomplishment that many other congested cities can only dream about.
"If you had told somebody this was going to happen back in 1990, they would have said you were crazy," said Bruce Schaller, a private transportation consultant and former policy analyst for the city's Transit Authority who wrote the study, which is to be released today. "This kind of change was both unprecedented and unforeseen."
It does not mean, however, that the roads are any less jammed with cars or will be any time soon. In the 1990's, the study found, the number of cars owned by city residents still increased, by 6 percent. But the growth in subway ridership vastly outpaced this, increasing 34 percent over 10 years, in part because of the booming economy and booming immigration, but perhaps also because roads were not being expanded nearly as rapidly as they once were and had become saturated with traffic.
The numbers from the 1990's stand in stark contrast to those for the previous four decades.
In the 1950's, under Mr. Moses, the city's master builder, what would eventually become 627 miles of new highways began to lace the metropolitan region. And elevated train lines were being demolished. (New York, in fact, is the only city in the world that has fewer subway miles now than it did before World War II.)
As a result, auto ownership began to inch up, increasing by 1 percent, while subway ridership dropped sharply, by 19 percent.
In the 1960's, as highway building continued, auto ownership increased even more rapidly, by 13 percent, while subway ridership dropped further, by 7 percent.
During the fiscal crisis in the 1970's, which caused high unemployment and drove people away from the city, both auto ownership and subway ridership dropped. But the subways took by far the biggest hit, with ridership dropping 20 percent, while auto ownership declined only 2 percent.
Finally, in the 1980's, even as capital investments began to breathe life back into the hobbled transit system, subway ridership increased only 2 percent while auto ownership rebounded sharply, increasing 21 percent. (The study focused mostly on subway ridership because bus ridership data before 1970 was unavailable.)
The 1990's actually started out inauspiciously for transit, with the recession in the early part of the decade dragging down subway ridership in 1991 and 1992.
But the billions of dollars in capital investments in the subway that started in 1982 had begun to result in more reliable trains, renovated stations and more frequent service. And those improvements, along with the introduction of the MetroCard system that enabled the first volume discounts and the elimination of two-fare zones, are credited with reviving the city's public transit.
"I think it's not just that people are saying that the automobile is such a lousy option that they are going to take the subway," said Jeffrey M. Zupan, a senior transportation fellow at the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group that advises governments on development.
Mr. Schaller, who has served as a consultant to the Federal Highway Administration, the National Academy of Sciences and several cities' transportation departments, said he believed that the other major factors contributing to New York's historic shift were the drop in crime, the city's booming economy and the large increase in immigration during the last decade, which brought the city many more new subway and bus riders than it did car owners.
So many, in fact, that New York City Transit now carries 1.2 billion passengers a year, more than the yearly transit ridership for Chicago, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles combined.
The only problem with this growth, the study suggests, is the same one that began to face the highways decades ago: When you build it and they come -- or, in the case of the subway, improve it and they come -- there is the danger that too much success will overburden the system and drive people away.
"The challenge is to stay ahead of the curve," Mr. Schaller said. "Now that they've come, the system has to continue to improve and to expand the service to accommodate the crowds and keep them happy."

HEADLINE: Labor Groups Join Coalition To Eliminate Sweatshops 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The continuing fight against exploitative conditions in garment factories took a new turn yesterday when labor unions from around the world formed a new coalition to undertake the biggest campaign to fix the problem of overseas sweatshops.
 The coalition began its campaign with a noisy protest march down Broadway in Manhattan, followed by demonstrations in front of Ann Taylor, Banana Republic and Eddie Bauer stores in SoHo. 
Frustrated that they have made little headway in fighting sweatshops, unions from the United States, Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Thailand, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic formed the new coalition, pledging a global fight to improve conditions in garment factories.
Executives from Ann Taylor, Banana Republic and Eddie Bauer say they have worked hard to ensure that the factories they use are not sweatshops, but the coalition's leaders say that virtually all large apparel companies use overseas factories that can be classified as sweatshops. 
"Despite years of public pressure against sweatshops, today's global retailers are greedier than ever, and more workers around the world are toiling in sweatshops to make their goods," said Bruce Raynor, president of Unite, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, North America's largest apparel union. That union organized the new coalition, which includes the A.F.L.-C.I.O., religious groups and United Students Against Sweatshops, which has chapters on more than 200 college campuses.
"For some years, we have observed the lack of real progress on the sweatshop issue, and this is a big concern to us," said the Rev. David Dyson, a Brooklyn pastor who is co-founder of the Progressive Religious Partnership, a group of 10,000 congregations from around the country that has joined the coalition. "In today's global economy, the apparel workers of the world have really become the wretched of the earth," he said.
During yesterday's demonstrations, which attracted more than 500 protesters, the coalition's leaders talked of garment workers in China who toiled for 96 hours a week, of a factory in El Salvador that required employees to continue working through the night, and of child laborers in Cambodia who did not see their parents for months.
Executives at several apparel companies objected to having been singled out. Lurma Rackley, director of public affairs and social responsibility at Eddie Bauer, said, "To make a blanket statement that all big companies maintain sweatshop conditions is unfair." 
Denying that Eddie Bauer uses sweatshops, she said, "We are very, very careful in the selection of factories."
Alan Marks, a spokesman for Gap Inc., Banana Republic's parent company, said Gap had a 100-person compliance team to monitor factories to ensure that adequate working conditions. Ann Taylor executives said they required all suppliers to be socially responsible. 
The coalition's leaders predicted that their efforts would be more effective than previous anti-sweatshop campaigns, which they say have been uncoordinated, piecemeal and inadequately financed. 
Unite organized the new coalition after facing severe criticism for doing too little to fight sweatshops in the United States and overseas, and brought foreign unions into the coalition partly to show that it was not undertaking a campaign to keep jobs in the United States.
"This isn't about protectionism," Mr. Raynor said. "It is about improving worldwide standards."
He said the coalition would focus on pressuring large retailers because they often determine what prices are paid to overseas factories. Those prices, the coalition says, are usually so low that factories are forced to skimp on safety and pay their workers too little to live on.
Mr. Raynor said, "We want consumers to reward good behavior and to punish retailers who pay prices so low that their factories are forced to abuse workers, whether it is in Brooklyn or Bangladesh."

HEADLINE: United Way Is Reporting 3.8% Increase in Donations 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The 1,400 local United Ways raised $3.91 billion in the year ended June 30, an increase of $140 million or about 3.8 percent over a year earlier, Ellie Ferdon, chairwoman of United Way of America, the national organization, will announce today. It is the fifth consecutive year that giving to the fund-raising organizations increased faster than inflation.
 The modest real growth in donations to the nation's largest private financier of social services comes as demand for the services is rising and as President Bush promotes the idea that charities are better suited than government to provide many social services. 
 The United Ways in New York City and Los Angeles County reported larger increases than United Ways overall, with gifts of at least $10,000 more than offsetting the continued erosion of gifts by rank-and-file workers. 
But there are signs that the fund-raising drives that will begin next month face major obstacles in matching the latest results.
In San Jose, Calif., gifts of appreciated stock dropped 90 percent in the first three months of this year, a result of the drop in the technology market, said Greg Larson, the president of the Silicon Valley United Way. The charity also expects unfilled pledges from payroll giving, known as shrinkage, to rise to 6.5 percent from 5.9 percent last year because of layoffs in the high technology industry. Still, the Silicon Valley United Way raised $22.4 million this year, up $100,000 over 2000.
But United Way member agencies in the Silicon Valley will get less money this year because of what Mr. Larson called "a dark cloud on the horizon." That cloud is the trend of donors designating which charities will get their gifts, often agencies with no United Way affiliation.
Mr. Larsen said 45 percent of gifts in the year just ended were designated for specific charities, up from the high 30 percent range in earlier years.
Alarmed at the growth of donor-designation, several United Ways, following the lead of the statewide United Way in Delaware, have stopped promoting designations as a giving option.
Another sign of coming woes tied to job losses appeared in Rochester, home of the nation's richest United Way. Its spring campaign fell $1.8 million short of its $38 million goal. Becky Cania, a spokeswoman, attributed the shortfall to the closing of one big employer, Genesee Hospital, and continued layoffs at Eastman Kodak, Xerox and other employers.
United Way of Tri-State, an umbrella group for 32 agencies in metropolitan New York, raised $108 million from major employers, an increase of less than 1 percent. Its campaign was hurt by layoffs and job transfers at AT&T, Exxon Mobil, Lucent and Verizon. 
"We all face tough challenges this fall," said Kirk Sapa, Tri-State executive vice president.
Nationally, giving was up 68.9 percent at Delta Airlines; 42.4 percent at Honeywell, which merged with Allied Signal; 30.3 percent at Pfizer; and 24.8 percent at J. P. Morgan Chase.
Giving dropped 51.2 percent at Pillsbury; 36.2 percent at Sara Lee; 33.2 percent at Kmart; 24.2 percent at Motorola; 21.9 percent at Lucent; 18.2 percent at PG&E, the utility in California that has filed for bankruptcy protection; 17 percent at Aetna; and 14.5 percent at Verizon.
United Ways traditionally depended on workers, especially factory workers, giving through payroll deduction to support social service agencies from Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts to the Red Cross and Family Service Associations.
In the last decade, this support has slipped because of layoffs at the largest corporations, a trend toward small workplaces that are costly to organize and anger over disclosures in 1992 that William V. Aramony, the longtime president of United Way of America, was living a lavish lifestyle and embezzling money. Mr. Aramony is expected to be released from prison late next month, which will no doubt prompt articles that may rekindle some of that anger.
The number of United Way donors is down more than 25 percent in the last decade, but the steady decline in payroll giving has been offset by a growing emphasis on major gifts from the wealthy.
Donations raised in gifts of $10,000 and more, which United Ways call the Alexis de Tocqueville society, have grown 167 percent since 1995, a period when overall giving rose just 24 percent.
In New York City, the local United Way raised $44.5 million, up 13 percent from the $39.4 million raised the previous year, said Kathy Walling, a spokeswoman. Givers of $10,000 or more increased to 210 from 153 the year before and their gifts more than doubled to $6.2 million from $3 million, she said.
In Los Angeles, giving by those who have donated $1 million or more in their lifetimes increased sharply in the last year, to $12.1 million from $4.6 million the previous year, said Dominic Ng, chief executive of East West Bancorp. in San Marino, Calif., who chaired the campaign.
The $7.5 million increase in such huge gifts was greater than the overall increase in giving of $5 million, illustrating the declining role of rank-and-file givers.
Gifts of $10,000 or more provided 28 percent of the money raised in Los Angeles.
"My vision was to see United Way better reflect the diversity of Los Angeles not just in which charities we distribute funds to, but who gives," Mr. Ng said. "Los Angeles, like New York, is a city of immigrants and many of the newcomers are not participating in the traditional philanthropic activities, but we are changing that."
He said the agency was able to develop new support among immigrant entrepreneurs, high technology firms and venture capitalists. 
"The only industry where we were not successful was the entertainment industry," Mr. Ng said. He said he encountered worries about both Mr. Aramony's crime and a 1986 scandal involving secret loans to Los Angeles United Way executives in which two who paid the money back were forced out, but three others who made only token payments were promoted.
Mrs. Ferdon said that Mr. Aramony's pending release should remind donors that the organization dealt effectively with him. "Our latest results show that United Way is a strong brand," she said, "and donors see us as a premier organization."
In Chicago, giving rose to $96.2 million, up 1.2 percent from the previous year. Giving at the $10,000 and larger level now accounts for 6 percent of all gifts to United Way in Chicago, up from 4 percent in 1998, said Jim Kales, a spokesman.
Many United Ways, including those in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, have not posted campaign goals, or results, on their Web sites. These and many others also do not have current financial information posted at their Web sites nor copies of their Form 990 tax returns, which are public record. 
Mrs. Ferdon said that posting campaign goals and results, as well as current financial reports, was not among the standards that the local organizations must meet to use the United Way brand.

HEADLINE: Productivity Still Gaining Despite Slump 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Even in a sharp economic slowdown, the new economy seems to be surviving. It just may not be as big a deal as many of its most optimistic proponents had predicted.
 In the second quarter of this year, companies managed to become more efficient despite the near absence of economic growth, the government reported yesterday. That unusual feat offers further evidence that, with the help of technology, the economy has emerged from a 20-year productivity slump that began in the mid-1970's and contributed to a decline in inflation-adjusted wages for most workers, economists said. 
 Nonfarm productivity rose at a healthy 2.5 percent annual rate in the quarter, as businesses produced roughly the same output using less labor, the Labor Department said. The growth was similar to the rate during the boom years of the late 1990's and significantly higher than the 1.5 percent average during the previous 20 years.
Productivity -- the amount that a worker produces in an hour -- is considered one of the most important government statistics because it indicates how quickly the economy can grow over a long period. When productivity rises rapidly, both corporate profits and workers' earnings can grow without causing inflation to accelerate.
But the Labor Department also gave some reason for caution yesterday, saying that it had overestimated productivity growth in the three previous years. The productivity gains of the late 90's now look less impressive than those of the 1960's to mid-70's, when people flocked to universities and the government built new highways and airports.
From 1997 until 2000, productivity grew 2.6 percent, not 3.2 percent, as the government had initially reported in March.
"Everybody is giving a little haircut to their long-run growth projections," said Ethan Harris, a senior economist with Lehman Brothers. But, he added, "by no means does this overturn the idea of a new paradigm of higher productivity growth."
Productivity typically increases in an economic expansion, as companies try to make enough products to meet rising demand, and economists have been engaged in a detailed debate about whether the recent increases would outlast the cycle.
The second quarter offered support to the optimists, who include Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. The 2.5 percent increase was a significant improvement over the gain in the first three months of the year, when productivity rose just 0.1 percent. (The government had initially said that it fell 1.2 percent in the first quarter but reported the new number yesterday as part of its regular revisions.)
In recent months, companies became more efficient by dismissing employees or reducing the number of hours they worked, while sustaining virtually the same level of output. They have been announcing large layoffs since late last year, but only since March has the overall number of jobs in the American economy been declining, as early budget cutters, like Whirlpool, actually made their layoffs and other companies, like Eastman Kodak, followed.
Because unemployment remains historically low, inflation-adjusted hourly compensation still rose 1.6 percent, on annual basis, in the second quarter, the government said yesterday. But pay growth has slowed from the roughly 3 percent annual gain between 1997 and 2000 -- the best three-year period for workers since the late 1960's.
If the productivity gains are more than a cyclical phenomenon, and do reflect a country made more efficient by computers and the Internet, the long-term average growth of the economy may be about 3.5 percent, economists said. Previously, many analysts believed it was closer to 3 percent and that inflation would accelerate once growth exceeded that mark.
As believers in the new economy, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues at the Fed decided not to raise interest rates during much of the late 90's, even as growth accelerated. In speeches, some members of the Fed have said that they were able to cut interest rates rapidly over the last seven months because the new economy made inflation less of an immediate threat.
"By all of the evaluations that we make, we are only part way through a technological expansion," Mr. Greenspan said last month, while testifying before the Senate. That expansion will keep productivity growth strong, he said.
Still, recent data has brought some warning signs. Earlier this month, the government said that companies' investment in new equipment and software had fallen 14.5 percent in the second quarter, the worst decline in 19 years.
Many economists saw the investment in equipment and software as the force behind the efficiency gains. As companies cut back, those gains could recede, said Joel Prakken, the chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis.
"There's a pretty significant change here," Mr. Prakken said. "The economy's growth potential is somewhat lower than we thought."

HEADLINE: Budget Crisis, Still Burning, Has Already Left Casualties 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
A plan to open pre-kindergarten classes in thousands of schools this year is dead. Housing construction for homeless people will sputter. The same could happen to day care programs for tens of thousands of poor children.
 Groups that help people with AIDS take their medications stand to see their budgets evaporate. So do those that build housing for the homeless. Thousands -- possibly hundreds of thousands -- of homeowners will get property tax increases. 
 All of these effects, and many more, are likely to come to pass if the $80 billion, stripped-down budget enacted last week is the only budget the state gets for the fiscal year that began April 1. If the Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki can agree on a supplemental budget, a cloudy prospect at best, some of the harm to programs can be averted, but in other places, the damage is done until next year.
"The situation for us is completely devastating," said Brad Williams, executive director of the New York Independent Living Council, an alliance of organizations that help disabled people. "I have no idea how we're going to survive."
The Democrat-led Assembly and the Republican-led Senate, frustrated by Mr. Pataki's refusal to negotiate, agreed last week to a bare-bones budget that leaves out programs they all care deeply about. They hope the resulting pain is so acute that interest groups from hospital administrators to welfare mothers will pressure Mr. Pataki to bargain with them on a multi-billion-dollar supplemental budget.
It is a risky strategy, and many legislators are afraid that it could backfire, leaving the budget cuts in place. A prominent Democratic lawmaker described their approach to the governor this way: "We're cutting ourselves and bleeding all over him."
So far, it does not appear to be working. The governor has spent the past several days barnstorming the state, holding two or three news conferences a day to accuse legislative leaders of being irresponsible and hoping that they, not he, will be blamed.
For groups that provide services to the poor through state grants, the mechanics of spending make the cuts even deeper than they appear at first. Often, money is included in the budget but not spent until the next year. The spending then must be authorized a second time, a "reappropriation." But to turn up the heat on the governor, the Legislature has cut off all re-appropriations, totaling billions of dollars, effective Sept. 15.
The governor's budget proposed leaving out social service programs or cuts in their funding, knowing that lawmakers would later restore the money. But the Legislature refused to make those additions in the bare-bones budget, leaving programs at the governor's lower levels.
That spells disaster for programs like the state's Homeless Housing Assistance Program, which gives money to nonprofit groups to build or renovate housing.
Last year's budget allocated $30 million for the program, but none of that money was to be delivered until October. All of it is a reappropriation and, barring a new budget deal, all of it will evaporate. In addition, the program stands to lose its customary $10 million addition from the Legislature, money that would be spent next year.
"We could be denied all of last year's money and one-third of this year's," said Jennifer Flynn, executive director of New York City AIDS Housing Network, a coalition of groups that apply for the money. "Waiting lists for housing would get longer, our member groups would lay people off, services at existing housing would be cut back. People need to understand, this is a crisis."
The centers for the disabled that Mr. Williams represents stand to lose a $10.5 million reappropriation, most of their budget for the year, plus a $1 million legislative addition for next year. Hundreds of social service groups tell similar stories.
Some nonprofits are in worse straits because their budgets rely on additions by the Assembly.
The Fortune Society, which runs a variety of social service programs and helps former convicts stay out of trouble, faces a $725,000 shortfall for programs to counsel parents of troubled youths, to steer convicts into drug treatment rather than prison, and to help single fathers find jobs and pay child support.
The Legal Aid Society will lose $8 million to represent poor women in domestic violence cases, elderly people who lose Social Security benefits, and people fighting evictions. Prisoners' Legal Services, which files lawsuits for inmates, faces elimination of its $3.5 million budget.
For the biggest area of dispute, aid to schools, the impasse has already had an irreversible effect. Education officials say that even with more spending, it is too late to hire new teachers or find classroom space.
This year, several hundred districts were to become eligible, for the first time, for a state program that pays for prekindergarten classes for 4-year-olds and reduced elementary class sizes.
But Mr. Pataki left more than $200 million for that effort out of his proposed budget, and the Legislature did not restore it. Legislators and school officials concede that, with the start of school a month away, there will be no expansion of the program.
Overall, the governor proposed a $382 million increase in state aid to schools, just enough to keep up with inflation. The Senate wanted $900 million, the Assembly $1.7 billion.
By law, most districts must draft their budgets in May, forcing them to guess how much state aid they would receive. In its bare-bones budget, the Legislature accepted Mr. Pataki's figure, leaving districts with far less aid than they expected.
Most districts send out property tax bills in mid or late August. Education officials say that many districts will raise taxes to make up for the difference. New York City schools and some other cities do not levy their taxes, so they must either find other ways of making up the money or simply do without.
The deepest cuts were at a favorite agency of the governor's, the Empire State Development Corporation, which offers grants and loans for business development. Its operating budget was reduced from $243 million to $4,100, and its $221 million carried over from previous years was eliminated. The Pataki administration is hunting for ways to keep the agency running and pay its staff.
The state's hospitals and nursing homes, which face a difficult round of labor negotiations, are also affected. The budget guarantees that Medicaid payments to them will fall about $500 million short. It also fails to allocate about $250 million in Federal aid to enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care plans.
"We are going to have a real crisis," said Jennifer Cunningham, executive director of the Service Employees International Union, New York State Council, which represents health care workers. "This isn't just the frills. This is the meat and potatoes of financing the health care industry."

Bcom3 Agencies Merge and Plan Layoffs

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler 

 BODY:
The Bcom3 Group in Chicago said yesterday that it is merging two agencies that specialize in digital communications and advertising, Giant Step in Chicago and Novo in San Francisco.
 "The merger will allow Bcom3 to strategically consolidate its online capabilities in the U.S. and maximize the value it brings clients as technology-enabled marketing evolves," Bcom3 said in a statement. 
 "In conjunction with the merger and as a result of the difficult economic environment," Bcom3 said, the merged agency will cut about 30 percent of its staff. 
The new agency, called Novo, will have 222 employees and offices in Chicago, Detroit, New York and San Francisco. Kelly Rodriques, chairman and chief executive at Novo, San Francisco, will lead the combined agency. Steve Weinswig, president at Giant Step, Chicago, will lead its Chicago offices.
In April, Giant Step dismissed 52 of 227 employees.

Connecticut Calls It Nouveau Jersey

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: DARIEN, Conn. 

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY!" the man at the garden supply center said in a tone he might use if you had a geranium growing out of your head. "Who even thinks of New Jersey?"
 Keith Barker, owner of the Gardener's Center and Florist, was responding in typical Connecticut fashion to news that New Jersey was celebrating the release of a census figure this week indicating that the Garden State is wealthier than Connecticut. "New Jersey's not seen as competition," Mr. Barker said. "I didn't even know New Jersey came into the picture." 
 The picture, as far as Connecticut is concerned, includes very little other than Connecticut, and most certainly not New Jersey. Not that people in Connecticut feel threatened, mind you. "I don't think they see themselves in competition with anyone," said Patricia Krusen, the manager of a children's clothing store here.
New Jersey, of course, sees itself in competition with everyone, including itself, or at least its reputation. That may explain why there was such hoopla in New Jersey about a Census Bureau survey showing that New Jersey had the nation's highest annual median household income, edging out Connecticut, $54,226 to $53,108.
Of course, Connecticut still has the highest per capita income and the highest percentage of people whose money is earning money while they're wearing Docksiders.
Incomewise, New Jersey and Connecticut have been competitive for some time, since both are largely suburban, feeding off the nectar of New York City and their own ubiquitous corporate headquarters. But culturally, they're about as similar as pearl earrings and silver tongue studs.
"They've always had that inferiority complex," said Ed Redding, manager of a Darien framing shop. "Remember, they always wanted to get the Statue of Liberty, saying it was technically theirs."
"Nouveau riche, as they say," said Mr. Redding, looking over his reading glasses.
In Nouveau Jersey, home of the supposedly uncouth, no one was half as harsh as the supposedly refined residents of Connecticut.
"They may be WASPy kind of people" was the worst Frank Alliotts, an Alpine, N.J., developer, could say of the criticism. 
New Jersey may be the only place that actually cheers census data. "It's good for us, I think for the image," said Pat Garbe Morillo, of Closter, N.J. "People think of New Jersey as asphalt."
Connecticut likes having everyone imagine that the whole state is Westport, while New Jersey is forever trying to convince people that the whole state isn't Bayonne. 
Martin Krasniqi, the owner of Original Ray's Pizza in Closter, summed up Bergen County this way: "Very nice people. Very rich area. Nobody asks you how much is a slice." (If you're from a depressed area, say Fairfield County, and need to ask, it's $1.42 for regular, $1.60 for Sicilian and 50 cents for each additional topping.)
Jeff Koffler, a psychiatrist in Stamford who was fueling up at a local Starbucks, had the detached view you would expect from a mental health professional. "It's all averages anyway," he said, pointing out that the rich were offset by the poor in both places.
But then, without warning, he was analyzing New Jersey's psyche to explain why its people would crow about income statistics. "They have to have something to say now that they lost Christie Whitman and they have that guy who's not running again," he said, referring to the tumult surrounding Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco.
BUT the psychiatrist, unconsciously, fell into Connecticut's habitual avoidance behavior. Had he forgotten what's been tumbling out of Connecticut's closet?
The mayor of Waterbury promises to return to work just as soon as he's sprung from jail on charges of luring young girls into sex acts. Bridgeport is on a corruption-indictment-of-the-week plan. And Greenwich has found yet another legal strategy against an awful summer hazard: outsiders presumptuously asserting their right to use the town beach. Connecticut acts as if none of that exists, just as it acts as if New Jersey isn't in the picture.
But New Jersey's tough. It can take it. So what if, after all the statistics are taken into account, the state isn't No. 1 in income? O.K., maybe it's No. 1 1/2. But don't believe Connecticut when it says New Jersey's no competition. Everyone in New Jersey knows what's happening behind those solid New England stone walls.
Ask Glen Davis, a camera store owner in Englewood, N.J., and he says, "They're jealous."

HEADLINE: Suburb Approves Adding 3rd Runway At Cleveland Airport 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: BROOK PARK, Ohio, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
Residents of this blue-collar suburb of Cleveland voted today in favor of a deal to raze 468 homes and clear the way for an expanded Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.
 Nearly 48 percent of the registered voters showed up to approve the plan, 3,623 to 2,943, the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections said. 
 "This is an important vote because reason triumphed over emotion," said Dennis Eckart, chief executive of the Greater Cleveland Growth Association. "Every big-league city has to have a big-league airport."
The issue divided the community, which may be best known as the home of two Ford Motor Company plants astride Interstates 71 and 480 at the edge of the airport.
The agreement was struck by Mayor Thomas Coyne of Brook Park and Mayor Michael R. White of Cleveland to free up land to add a third runway at the airport, which is owned by Cleveland, while compensating Brook Park.
The Brook Park Council had unanimously opposed the deal, saying it lacked detail, and backed citizen groups fighting the ballot issue.
"We were probably outspent 20 or 30 to one," Councilman Brian Mooney said. "We were hit almost every day with one, sometimes two pieces of glossy literature."
He said the council must closely watch to make sure Cleveland follows through on promises like paying fair market value for the homes and moving expenses.
Mr. Coyne said opponents ignored the wider issues of what airport expansion would mean to northeast Ohio and its economy. Supporters say that growing businesses often demand access to good air service and that another runway will be needed by 2015.

They May Not Be Dot-Com Zillionaires, but They're Still Working

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
The Internet bubble rose and burst, taking tens of thousands of jobs with it, but computer network managers -- the people who keep company computer systems running and make the Internet work -- have continued to thrive.
 Their numbers have risen steadily and their average wage is better than that of most Americans. 
 Still, not all is sunshine and roses. A survey released today of more than 12,000 network managers shows that there is a gender pay gap in this group.
The survey, conducted by TechTarget, a company that creates Web sites for technology specialists, also found a growing sense of job dissatisfaction. More than 36 percent of the managers said they were less satisfied now than they were last year, and 88 percent said they would be willing to switch jobs in the next year. The primary reasons cited for their willingness to take a new job were: better salary (45 percent), the opportunity to work with new technologies (20 percent) and a desire to be more challenged in their job (13 percent).
"The survey shows these guys are very hard-working and underappreciated," said Greg Strakosch, chief executive of TechTarget. "The only time they get recognition is when the network goes down." DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Cisco Earnings Drop Sharply But Match Expectations 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
Cisco Systems reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings today in line with analyst expectations, but the company, a bellwether for investors, suggested a global malaise in technology spending could continue at least through the end of the calendar year.
 John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, said the economic environment in Europe and Asia in particular might worsen before it improves, though he said there were signs of recovery in the American market. 
 Still, Cisco projected that its revenue for the coming quarter -- its fiscal first quarter -- would be flat or down 5 percent, a result that would continue a slide that began in January and that puts a fine point on the sharp turnaround this year in the fortunes of Cisco and its competitors.
"We'd like to say that the bottom has been viewed in our industry, but we don't think we're there yet," Mr. Chambers said. "We're cautiously optimistic that it'll happen in the next" one or two quarters. 
For its fourth quarter, which ended July 28, Cisco reported pro forma net income of $163 million, or 2 cents a diluted share. Those figures compare with $1.2 billion, or 16 cents a diluted share, in the period a year ago -- a drop of 86 percent.
The per-share figure was in line with a consensus industry estimates. The company's revenue for the quarter, $4.3 billion, was at the low end of industry analysts' projections, and it was down 25 percent from the $5.72 billion that the company reported for the period a year ago.
Cisco shares fell 28 cents, to $19.26, in regular trading and slipped to $18.93 in after-hours trading.
Analysts called the results mixed. Tim Luke, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said the company's returns met expectations, though at the lower end, but he noted that the company's gross profit margins -- revenues minus the cost of manufacturing goods -- were lower than expected.
On a pro forma basis, those gross margins for the quarter were 52.3 percent, compared with 54.5 percent in the third quarter. The figures are down from around 64 percent before the company began to falter and lower than the 60 percent range the company aspires to achieve, according to Larry Carter, the company's chief financial officer. 
This spring, the company, based in San Jose, Calif., took prompt steps to deal with the downturn by taking a one-time charge of an extraordinary $2.2 billion in excess inventory. The company said at the time that it did not expect to be able to use or sell the products and wanted to take the inventory off of its balance sheets.
 Some critics asserted that Cisco would later seek to sell or use the products and enhance its returns because it would appear to gain revenue from selling the products without accruing any associated expense, such as purchasing the raw materials.
 Cisco did say today that it had managed to accrue about $187 million from sales or other disposal of the products. But Mr. Carter said the company was not figuring that benefit into its gross margin and thus is "not taking credit" for the revenue. 
 In a general sense, while Cisco's year ended in a much more sour way than it began, the returns were not nearly as calamitous as those experienced by other telecommunications equipment providers like Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks.
 In late July, for example, Lucent announced that it lost $3.25 billion in its third fiscal quarter, ended June 30, and said it cut an additional 20,000 jobs. In June, Nortel said it would lose $19.2 billion in its fiscal second quarter.
 Industry analysts pointed out, however, that Cisco was different from some competitors in several respects. Notably, the bulk of its customers were in a variety of fields as opposed to being telecommunications service providers like phone companies. Also, analysts said that Cisco had a strong cash position, and was not saddled with debt.
 And while Cisco has fared better because of its different product mix, it nevertheless has seen a severe change in its fortunes over the last year.
Lissa Bogaty, an industry analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said early indications during the fiscal year suggested Cisco's revenue would be 50 to 60 percent higher than it had been in fiscal 2000. In the end, the increase was more like 18 percent. "There was a big change in the middle of the year," she said.
 Added Mr. Chambers of the company's fiscal 2001, "It was like two different years."
And he said Cisco was effectively planning for two different years for fiscal 2002. He said the company had essentially broken down the year for budgeting purposes into two halves: a conservative half that supposes the economy will not improve and that will extend until January, and a second in which the company will re-evaluate its plan based on economic conditions.

HEADLINE: Outcry Grows Over Police Use of Force in Genoa 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
More than two weeks ago, Susan Hager received a telephone call in Portland, Ore., about her daughter, a student who had stopped off in Genoa to join protesters at the Group of 8 summit meeting on her way to a junior year abroad program in Siena.
 "Her friend had found her bloody belongings" at the Armando Diaz school complex in Genoa where protesters had been staying, Mrs. Hager said. There, in the early hours of July 22, 92 young people were dragged from their beds by squads of Italian anti-riot police officers who beat and jailed them. 
 Sixty of those demonstrators -- originally described by Italian officials as marauding anarchists but in more recent official reports as mostly peaceful -- were injured in the raid. At least two dozen were hospitalized, including Mrs. Hager's daughter, Morgan, and two other Americans. 
Witnesses described students crouching as they were kicked, pummeled with clubs and thrown down stairs, and emergency room doctors said a number of the injured would have died without treatment. Television crews arriving on the scene later filmed pools of blood and teeth knocked out during the raid.
It was a day or two "before we knew our daughter wasn't in a coma," Mrs. Hager said. But Morgan Hager, 20, an honors student at the University of Oregon, had cuts and bruises from her ankles to her neck and three broken bones in her hand.
Almost as painful as the news about her daughter, Mrs. Hager said, was the sense that most Americans remain unaware of the brutality of the raid, which Italian officials originally justified by saying that protesters at the school -- made available to nonviolent demonstrators -- had been harboring members of the violent Black Bloc anarchists.
Four Americans remain in jail, including Susanna Thomas, a Bryn Mawr student and Quaker from Warren, N.J., who was arrested with an Austrian theater group as it was leaving Genoa. 
Outrage about the police behavior has built across Europe, where the issue has become a major embarrassment for Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Thousands of people have marched in protest, governments have expressed concern and newspapers have been filled with accounts of police brutality. One young Italian man was shot dead in the protests at the summit meeting, about 200 people were injured and some 300 were arrested.
There have been major demonstrations in Paris, London, Geneva, Rome, Berlin, Belgrade and Athens, where riot police officers used tear gas to disperse several thousand people en route to the Italian embassy. In Amsterdam last week, about a dozen protesters managed to take over the Italian consulate and hung a banner out front: "Italy Tortures G-8 Detainees."
Spain's European Affairs Secretary, Ramon de Miguel, called the scenes a replay of fascism. Hans-Christian Strobele, a European deputy from Germany, said the Genoa police reminded him of "the military dictatorship in Argentina."
Hermann Lutz, chairman of the European Police Union, told the German television network ZDF that as he watched the riots on television he thought "it had to have been in some kind of dictatorship or in Eastern Europe or in Cuba, but not among us in the middle of Europe."
Germany's Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, a left-wing activist in his younger years, has called his Italian counterpart, Renato Ruggiero, to urge the Italian government to investigate police actions. Twenty-one Germans are among the 39 people still being held in Italian jails.
One German who was also arrested in the raid at the school in Genoa, a man who asked that he not be identified, described his ordeal in a statement issued by his lawyer, Dagmar Vogel, in Oberhausen, Germany: "I was hit in the head, the back, and the legs and a hard hit on the head. My skull flattened. I bled badly. I lay in my own blood bath and didn't move at all." After 2 a.m., he was arrested while still in the hospital, and was not allowed to sleep or make telephone calls, he said. During four days of detention, he said he was forced to stand with his hands against a wall for hours, harassed about going to the bathroom and taken from one location to another.
Ms. Thomas was arrested along with two dozen members of the Austrian group Publix Theater. According to the respected Austrian weekly Profil, the conservative Austrian government initially dismissed reports of police brutality and sent Italian officials reports in which Publix performers had been characterized as violent anarchists. But Profil said those reports predated an economic summit meeting in Salzburg in July at which the group protested peacefully with street performances. After reading a full investigation by the Austrian consulate general in Milan, Foreign Minister Benita Maria Ferrero-Waldner is reported to have requested that Italy transfer home the 16 remaining Publix members.
In a summary of the Austrian consulate's report to the Austrian Foreign Ministry, posted on Profil's web site (www.profil.at/aktuell), several members of Publix described being arrested at gunpoint, strip searched, beaten and berated by officers who shouted in English, "I break you!" and "You monster!"
Ms. Thomas's family has complained that the United States government has not done nearly enough in speaking out against what went on.
"The U.S. is conspicuous by its absence in the list of nations that have protested to the Italian government over the imprisonment and the behavior of the Italian police in their handling of the protests in Genoa," her father, Rick Thomas, said in a message on the family's web site.
A spokesman for the American Consulate in Milan said, "We're doing all we can."
Even some members of Italy's center-right coalition now concede that something went terribly wrong in Genoa, though they continue to point fingers at the left, saying that the former center-left government was responsible for planning security for the summit meeting.
Italian courts have opened at least half a dozen separate investigations into various allegations of police brutality, and a parliamentary inquiry began today.
Testifying at a Senate hearing in Rome, Genoa's leftist mayor, Guiseppe Pericu, said Mr. Berlusconi's government should shoulder the full blame for police misconduct.
Mr. Berlusconi has also been criticized recently for suggesting that he would like to get out of being host to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, scheduled to meet in Rome in November.
Interior Minister Claudio Scajola has removed three top police officials who ran security operations at the summit meeting, but has not apologized. "A state must never lose the monopoly on the use of force," he said recently, "and the ability to guarantee the safety of a summit."
But other members of the government coalition have criticized Mr. Berlusconi directly.
"It is not possible that the head of government goes to Genoa four times, and preoccupies himself only with flower pots, dirty laundry and building facades," Domenico Fisichella, a senator of the far-right Alleanza Nazionale, said in a radio interview on Monday, referring to Mr. Berlusconi's comments before the meeting that the city was unsightly.
"Who was taking care of the problems of public order?" Mr. Fisichella asked. "Who evaluated the impact? Why were necessary precautions not taken? It's too easy to liquidate a few functionaries and consider the question closed."

HEADLINE: P.& G. Reports Net Loss After Cost of Revamping 

BYLINE:  By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
Fourteen months ago, A. G. Lafley replaced a chief executive who had sought a radical transformation of Procter & Gamble.
 Although Mr. Lafley's touch has been softer and his approach evolutionary, he seems to have accomplished more than his predecessor, Durk I. Jager, who had offered to buy Gillette, considered remaking Procter into a pharmaceutical company and tried to speed the pace of innovations. 
 Yesterday, Procter posted its fiscal fourth-quarter results, and even though it reported a net loss, analysts praised the report and said it showed the beginnings of Mr. Lafley's efforts to shed many of Procter's food businesses, expand its personal care lines and rebuild declining market share. 
The company's loss came to $320 million, or 23 cents a share, for the quarter ended June 30, mostly because of a $1.16 billion restructuring charge. That is in contrast to net income of $516 million, or 36 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell to $9.58 billion from $9.66 billion.
The loss was expected, and the charges were part of Mr. Lafley's drive to lower costs by jettisoning underperforming brands and cutting jobs. 
Excluding the revamping charges, which included shutting the $88 million Olay Cosmetics business, profit rose 7.7 percent, to $837 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $777 million, or 55 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Analysts had expected Procter to earn 59 cents a share on that basis, according to Thomson Financial/ First Call.
With fair warning that the loss was coming, analysts were pleased with Procter's results, especially the new strength of dental products, including Crest Whitestrips, and better-than-expected growth in the Iams pet food business.
Sales could be off in the next quarter from those in the period a year earlier because of the slowdown in the United States economy, Mr. Lafley warned. But analysts suggested that Procter was better positioned to come through the sluggish economy, in part because it was realizing savings from Mr. Lafley's plan more quickly than expected.
Mr. Lafley has been trying to sharpen the company's focus, making it more like Colgate-Palmolive by putting the emphasis on building its biggest brands. He has tried to bring out innovations under the names of its existing brands and pushed high-margin products like Olay Daily Facials, disposable wipes infused with cleansers that generated more than $71 million in sales in their first year.
"What we might say about Procter & Gamble before Lafley took over was that they were trying to push through changes fast and furious," said Sally J. Dessloch, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase. "Now we have a more measured pace and more focus on core categories."
Mr. Lafley envisions a Procter that emphasizes health, beauty and fabric care products. He added to the hair care portfolio by agreeing to buy Clairol, and to put Crisco shortening and Jif peanut butter up for sale.
"We are making steady progress," Mr. Lafley said in a conference call with analysts. "Strategies and action plans we put in place in the last year are getting P.& G. back on track."
But Mr. Lafley warned the year ahead would not be any easier. Foreign currencies are unpredictable, the economies of many of Procter's markets have slowed and the company faces aggressive competition.
"It's a company that is in reasonable shape and headed in a better direction than it was a year ago," said Henry Asher, president of the Northstar Group, which has a little less than 1 percent of the $145 million it manages invested in Procter but is considering adding to the holdings.
Mr. Asher said he was pleased with Procter's joint venture with the Coca-Cola Company to sell chips and juice. Although that partnership is widely seen as a good deal for Procter, some analysts have said Coke is getting cold feet.
Mr. Lafley said yesterday he was confident that the deal would go through but added that the companies wanted to make sure they designed an agreement that was fair to the shareholders of both companies.
Despite the progress, Procter officials said yesterday that they would not be able to meet their long-term goals of 5 percent sales growth and at least 10 percent earnings growth in the next fiscal year. Amy Low Chasen, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs said Mr. Lafley should continue to find ways to continue to drive down costs in line with those of Procter's rivals.
"I think they are making some good progress," Ms. Chasen said. "They are early days yet. This is not a six-month turnaround, nor should it be a six-month turnaround. He is doing what he said he would do."

A Good Dish Is Worth Its Price
 Time to ask a former aide about that eight-figure book deal. 
 GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS had a four-word reaction -- "Hey, good for him" -- to former President Bill Clinton's $10 million advance, which is roughly three and a half times the $2.8 million that Mr. Stephanopoulos was paid for his own memoir. 
Mr. Stephanopoulos, now a political analyst for ABC News, was ready with advice for the first-time author. The challenge of writing a memoir, he said, is in "choosing what deserves to be in the narrative." In Mr. Clinton's case, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "All he has to do is say what he saw, what he said and what he felt."
But Mr. Clinton won't be spending all his time writing.
According to The Guardian in London, Mr. Clinton has been offered a visiting professorship, with salary, by the London School of Economics. The invitation is well timed, since the Clintons' daughter, Chelsea, will be entering Oxford in the fall.
A spokesman for the London School of Economics confirmed that Mr. Clinton would be giving a lecture late this year, but would not comment on the possibility of a professorship. If the job happens, the salary -- the equivalent of about $14,000 -- will seem like a tip compared with the book deal.

Comedy From Tragedy
A former jewelry wholesaler who started a foundation in memory of his son is worried that the film "Bubble Boy" -- which stars SWOOSIE KURTZ and JAKE GYLLENHAAL and is scheduled to open on Aug. 24 -- will hit too close to home. The film is about a boy born with immune-system problems who grew up in a plastic bubble that was supposed to protect him from germs. But the film is billed as a comedy.
"It's like a punch in the stomach," said FRED MODELL, a founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation, named for his son, who died in 1986 of a form of pneumonia his body was unable to conquer. "This is surely not something that I think can be dismissed with a silly comedy."
Mr. Modell has been circulating a letter that a 10-year-old boy with the disease wrote to MICHAEL D. EISNER, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, whose Touchstone Pictures unit is distributing "Bubble Boy." "I spend many hours a month getting transfusions at the hospital so I can try to stay healthy," the boy, SCOTT McGUIRE, wrote. "It would make me really sad to think while I am at the hospital, lots of people are sitting in a movie theater laughing about a serious disease." A Disney executive maintained the film would not make light of the disease or of people who suffer from it.

Pucker Your Lips and Paint
The trumpeter HERB ALPERT, whose Tijuana Brass had Top 10 hits alongside the Beatles in the 1960's, has just opened his first museum show. We are talking paintings here -- more than 75, as well as 40 bronze sculptures.
"I was overwhelmed by the whole show myself," Mr. Alpert said of the show, which opened on Friday at the State Museum in Nashville. "It was the first time I'd seen so much of my work together. I had it stored in various places around L.A."
"I've always had a little reservation about showing," he said yesterday in New York. "I didn't want people to say, 'Oh, yeah, Herb Alpert, we know this guy, he probably paints on Sundays.' I wanted to make sure the work was received on its own merits. There's a built-in danger of people recognizing you for something else, I think."
But he is recognized for something else. So?
"I'm blowing the horn every day," he said. "I'm in the mood for flamenco jazz."

A Rebate of a Rebate
Don't ask the octogenarian real estate developer SAMUEL J. LEFRAK how he is spending his federal income tax rebate, the $300 check from President Bush's $1.35 trillion tax-cut plan.
"I did not get mine," Mr. Lefrak said. "I got my Social Security check on the first of the month but I didn't get a refund." If the check comes, though, Mr. LeFrak has a plan. "I'm going to endorse it and send it right back. What am I going to do with $300? If you want to talk about taxes, all I know is, the minute I put the key in the door of my office, 50 percent of what I earn, I send to Washington."

HEADLINE: TURF; 
Prairie Home Impresarios

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

DATELINE: BONAPARTE, Iowa 

 BODY:
ONE summer morning, a middle-aged man slowly pedaled a shiny silver Schwinn along the dusty main street here. He passed freshly painted Victorian facades gleaming in the 9 o'clock sunshine. He passed store windows with "For Sale" signs in them.
 Twenty minutes went by. No one else appeared. 
 In this former mill town in southeastern Iowa, about three hours' drive from Des Moines, the population is 462 and dwindling. Tufts of grass grow in lots at either end of the main street, known here as First Street; a stucco filling station, built in the 1920's, is open but never busy. The nearest stoplight is in the next county. There's only one place for visitors to stay downtown: a tiny cabin with a sign that reads "The Cottage: Bed and Make Your Own Breakfast." 
But do not be deceived by appearances. 
This spring, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit group in Washington, named Bonaparte one of its 12 Distinctive Destinations. The award is given to "vacation spots" with "strong, vibrant downtowns."
"We were worried when we won that one," said Steve Adam, a mild-mannered city councilman, sitting at his kitchen table. "We were worried that if anybody showed up, they'd be disappointed. What will anyone do here?"
The inhabitants of Bonaparte have developed a skill that most other rural towns lack: they know how to fill out applications. 
"You've got to sell yourself," said Rebecca Reynolds, 52, a state representative and former mayor of Bonaparte, who refined the art of prairie grantsmanship and then passed it on to her successors. "You've got to put it out in the first two pages. You've got to get your message out on the cover sheet."
While other rural towns struggle to subsist, Bonaparte has learned to promote itself as a buzzing destination, gambling that the reality will live up to their pitch.
Fourteen years ago, when Ms. Reynolds, a nurse with five grown children, became mayor, the little town with the empty storefronts started winning grants and prizes. In 1988, the year after she took office, Bonaparte was granted local-government status, which allowed it to seek state money. Bonaparte's riverfront downtown was also placed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
"It looks good when you apply for grants," Connie Meek, the town clerk, explained. 
The next year, the downtown was designated for urban revitalization, freeing up tax credits to rehabilitate the 19th-century storefronts. In 1990, Ms. Reynolds ran for county supervisor and won. Her gift for grants has been perpetuated by Mrs. Meek.
In 1991, Bonaparte got a state grant to replace First Street's tangle of crisscrossing electrical wires, to erect reproduction gas street lights and to replace the aging sidewalks. When the Des Moines River buried the town in mud in 1993, Bonaparte received $1.3 million in relief grants.
Altogether, the town, whose budget this year totals $225,000, has netted $2.2 million in assorted fix-up funds, plus a handful of morale-boosting titles, including All-America City Finalist (1997) and a Great American Main Street Award (1996).
But of all its prizes, the one that surprised its citizens most, including Ms. Reynolds, was the National Trust award. What did she think of the part about the "vibrant downtown"?
"Well, I didn't write it!" the former mayor replied, laughing.
So far, there hasn't been an onslaught of sightseers, although since the destinations award, some say, the traffic has picked up on weekends. But there still aren't many places to stay: the closest national-chain motel is at least 35 miles away. By contrast, Red Lodge, Mont. (pop. 2,500), another of this year's Distinctive Destinations, has nine chain motels, one 19th-century hotel, 17 bed-and-breakfasts and dozens of rental condominiums.
Many people in Bonaparte say they don't know how they earned the award. Nor do they recall the National Trust ever visiting.
"No, they didn't come here," said Lee Kephart, the current mayor. "But I believe they had some pictures."
Kennedy Smith, who directs the trust's Main Street program, said the mayor was mistaken. "I've been there a dozen times," she said. The new mayor may not have been aware of her visits, she explained, because the last one was "two or three years ago."
She said she had nominated Bonaparte for the Distinctive Destinations list because it had improved so much since the flood of 1993.
Asked how Bonaparte could plausibly be a tourist destination with lodging for only one family, she replied: "It doesn't say national tourist destination. It could be a regional tourist destination."
Like for day-trippers?
"That's right," she said.
It doesn't matter much to the people of Bonaparte how they came to be a destination. Like the citizens of River City in "The Music Man," they have come to believe in themselves. Like Scarlett O'Hara and Little Orphan Annie, they believe in tomorrow. They are boasting of their latest award on their Web site, www.bonaparte-iowa.com.
While the main street sleeps, the Web site is humming. This spring, the home page announced that "nearly half of the Historic Buildings are available." And that "they are stabilized and ready for business development." By June, the site had adopted a slicker design, with a picture from the sixth annual historic cemetery tour. It now offers tourists "a new flavor of potential for those with discriminating tastes."
It has been a while since the town thrived. Bonaparte peaked shortly after 1878, when a four-story gristmill was built. Back then, the town supported four doctors, four grocers, four dry-goods stores, three milliners and two hotels. But by 1895, the population had fallen 37 percent from the decade before: the beginning of a manufacturing recession from which the town has never recovered.
Last year, the Fairfield Glove Company's factory, situated in a brick structure with delicate iron tracery on its metal awning, moved its operations back to Fairfield, Iowa. Today, only glove-making machinery and empty wooden boxes marked "Good Luck Gloves" are visible through the front windows. Only a couple of trucking companies, and Riverside Plastics, up on the hill, remain.
Almost a decade ago, Marilyn Thomas and her husband, Donald, bought an abandoned pottery and began cleaning out the old shards and dirt in preparation for paying tourists. A hand-lettered sign "Admission -- $3" is now posted at the back door entrance. Along with the $3 tour, Ms. Thomas also sells a $12 history of the pottery, bound in blue paper.
Bonaparte has also been picked for a far grander enterprise. Brock Womack, a performance artist and stained-glass maker from Des Moines, has optioned 1,200 acres of farmland on the edge of town for a Renaissance theme park and jousting festival. Mr. Womack, who has a Shakespearean goatee and shoulder-length hair, said he planned to raise $10 million to buy the land and build a jousting arena, castle, museum and walled keep.
There is guarded optimism about the plan. "We've been burned before, with so many investors coming in saying, 'We'll do this and we'll do that,' " said Jacki Gunn, 38, president of Bonaparte Main Street, a local development group. "But he's been here a year and a half. I'm not willing to write it off yet." 
She's more concerned, she said, with the fate of the Township Stores -- the grocery, drugstore and medical buildings rescued from destruction in 1987 by the sale of ownership shares to citizens at $2,000 apiece. There aren't many shoppers in the Township Grocery aisles, and the shelves look a little bare. "There's only 400 people, and they only buy so much," said Michael T. Gunn, president of Township Stores and one of its initial backers. 
"A lot of them go to Burlington," Mrs. Thomas said. "It's about 45 minutes away, but there's shopping malls and that type of thing."
If the store was truly in danger of closing, Mrs. Thomas said, she and a lot of citizens would pitch in. "They'd just open it up again, and we'd all give our $2,000 again."
For all its near-death experiences, there is a certain defiant spirit in Bonaparte. "History tells us that all these small towns are going to disappear," said Charles Easter, a retired security guard and another one of the Township Stores' original backers. 
"But I think Bonaparte is going to hang on longer -- just because the damned people aren't going to give up!"

HEADLINE: Romanov Style At Peasant Prices 

BYLINE:  By JOHN VAROLI 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG 

 BODY:
WHEN Michael Rundell, an artist and interior designer in London, cast about for a second home eight years ago, he dismissed Europe's well-known capitals as too expensive and too, well, developed. Even in Barcelona, he said, "I became tired of how everything is meticulously designed there, right down to the fire hydrants." 
 So Mr. Rundell, like other restless urban pioneers, turned to the rundown historical center of St. Petersburg, a 298-year-old city where both architectural innovation and standard building maintenance, came to a halt nearly a century ago. 
 Inspired by a vision of Russian aristocratic beauty -- and aided by a large pool of cheap skilled labor -- Mr. Rundell, 43, now owns four remodeled czarist-era apartments, with plans to buy two more. He and his family spend several days a month at one of his new apartments, which overlooks the Fontanka Canal. Before the Revolution, it belonged to Modest Tchaikovsky, brother of the composer Peter Ilich Tchaikovsky. 
"I wanted to go where there was a total absence of design, but a rich past and culture to draw from," he said. "St. Petersburg proved to be the ideal answer because it has fantastic pre-1917 architecture, and when you see these structures crumbling, you just want to rebuild them." 
From as far as California and Australia they come, a new class of globe-trotting urbanites, drawn by 12-foot ceilings, gorgeous views and cut-rate prices. There are no official statistics on the St. Petersburg renaissance, but hundreds of foreigners have joined a new Russian elite in reviving the 25-square-mile historical district. Now that Soviet restrictions on foreign residents and investment are gone, anyone with $50,000 can have a piece of St. Petersburg's past. Americans are highly visible, but the newcomers also include Britons, Italians and others.
"The opportunities in St. Petersburg are enormous," said Richard Blinder of Beyer Blinder Belle, an architectural firm that worked on restoring Grand Central Terminal. At a conference here in June on saving historical city centers, he described St. Petersburg as having one of Europe's largest concentrations of architecturally impressive 18th- and 19th-century buildings.
The city's architecturally aware emigres include August Meyer, 38, who quit his job as a deputy public prosecutor in San Diego two years ago and moved here to pursue a career as real estate developer and aspiring innkeeper. He now owns six apartments in the city center and plans to rent five of them to tourists. 
"Where else in the world would I have this?" he asked, gesturing out the window of a 2,150-square-foot apartment, bought in December for about $54,000, on the winding Griboyedov Canal. He has spent more than twice that on renovations, tearing down walls to make one 1,290-square-foot room and putting in parquet floors with floral patterns like those in the czar's Winter Palace.
"The opulence you can acquire here is vastly cheaper" than in other cities, Mr. Meyer said. "I fully intend on dying here. Just think how fabulous this city will be as it develops."
Most newcomers soon discover that remodeling requires a good deal more than scraping off wallpaper and pulling up shag carpeting. During 85 years of Soviet rule, imperial apartments were converted into poorly maintained warrens. When Mr. Rundell bought his 3,350-square-foot apartment in 1993, two dozen people were living there, sharing two kitchens and one bathroom. 
The prospective owner can take possession only after giving each tenant a cash payment or buying each one a new one-room apartment. That usually costs $35,000 to $60,000, total. But the paperwork is staggering, taking at least three months, and it is bewildering to non-Russians. 
"People think that because it's so cheap to buy an apartment, it's a great deal," said Katya Galitzine, a sculptor, who is buying an apartment and is the author of "St. Petersburg: The Hidden Interiors" (Vendome Press, 1999). "But they don't understand how difficult the process can be. Still, I like the rules and the bureaucracy because it protects the city heritage." 
Because of the way the apartments were chopped up in Soviet times, few original details survive. "But foreigners often want to create a palace they couldn't afford in the West, one with marble and perfect parquet floors," said Ilmar Karuso, an Australian interior designer who moved here three years ago and has half a dozen foreign clients. "Most are not interested in restoring the apartment as it used to be but prefer to gut the place and start anew." 
Douglas Boyce, an American who is helping to revive the Imperial Porcelain Factory, bought a center-city apartment five years ago. He tore down the interior walls and hired a Russian designer to create three rooms with strong angles and geometries, a look he said was inspired by the Constructivist avant-garde in 1920's Russia.
Rooms that have lost their original glory can often be brought back by artisans who -- until the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union -- rebuilt palaces damaged during World War II. Mr. Rundell, for example, had no trouble commissioning things like wood doors and kitchen tiles. "The artisans I hired had been working restoring the Catherine Palace in Pushkin," he said. "They were unemployed, and I just snapped them up" -- at about a tenth the cost of skilled labor in London.
It took them four years to do four rooms, among other things creating a pair of glass doors inlaid with real butterflies, using a technique Mr. Rundell developed with Damien Hirst, the British artist.
The workers are up to the kitchen. Mr. Rundell has ordered handmade tiles with a hammer-and-sickle motif: "very 1930's and 1940's Stalinist Soviet kitsch," he said. "The tiles," he added, "will be complemented by a work surface with mosaics of other Soviet-era proletarian propaganda motifs -- tractors, airplanes, blast furnaces, Soviet flags."
Sometimes one great apartment leads to another. Five years ago, Gen. Gianalfonso d'Avossa, 61, retired from the Italian Army in Milan and moved into a spacious 19th-century apartment overlooking the Neva River. Now he's hunting for a second place for visiting friends. 
General d'Avossa has decorated his apartment with ornate 18th-century Neapolitan chairs and sofas and other antiques. "Some of these items have been all over the world with me, and now they are here in Russia for good," he said. He hired local artists and craftsmen to add classical touches, including plaster torsos to flank the gas fireplace. There is now a painting of Mars, the Roman god of war, on the ceiling of the main room. The floor of the balcony has a mosaic of his family's coat of arms and the words strength, courage, intelligence and love in Italian.
Though construction workers in Russia were raised on decades of Soviet propaganda about class warfare, most are happy to see well-to-do expatriates fix up buildings that "would otherwise continue to decay," said a craftsman, who would give only his first name, Maksim. 
Yekaterina Bogolubova, an analyst with the St. Petersburg Association of Realtors, said most Russians believe that when foreigners buy historical properties, "everyone wins." Artisans and construction workers find employment, and former tenants get their first private apartments after decades of tightly shared quarters. 
Members of the new elite meanwhile enjoy the role of patriarchs. "The new owners sometimes feel themselves to be a new noble class inheriting former luxurious czarist-era apartments," Ms. Bogolubova remarked. 
While foreigners are the most conspicuous new residents in the historical district, Russians are also contributing to the renaissance. Sergei Bugayev, 35, a performance artist, has turned his three-bedroom apartment into a showcase for his vast collection of 19th-century rural furniture and Soviet kitsch. He has also installed new furnishings with Soviet motifs. 
Another Russian artist, Aleksandr Arkhipenko, 49, has an apartment inside a 40-foot tower atop an early-20th-century building. He is turning it into a triplex with views of the State Hermitage Museum and of the fortress of Peter and Paul, which serves as the family crypt for the Romanov czars and czarinas. 
A great hall on the windowless first floor of the tower has a four-foot fireplace suitable for roasting meat on a spit, and empty 18th- and 19th-century picture frames hang alongside abstract paintings by Mr. Arkhipenko. A spiral staircase climbs to the second floor, which is flooded by light from 12 windows. 
"In my childhood, it was always my dream to live in a castle, and when I saw this place I knew I had to live here," Mr. Arkhipenko said. 
Anastasia Melnikova, an actress, also has a view of the onion dome on the Church of the Resurrection of Christ. Descended from Russian nobility, she borrowed heavily from friends four years ago to buy one of the finest early-19th-century apartments in the city, at the intersection of the Moika and Griboyedov canals.
"When I saw this place, with its view, I knew I had to live here, no matter what the cost," she said.
So far, working on her own and with advice from friends who are designers, Ms. Melnikova has only been able to tear down the flimsy internal walls and put in new windows. Several rooms are so unfinished that they are impossible to enter. 
But when money allows, she hopes to decorate one room in the simple style of Peter the Great's era, when Russian architecture and decor were influenced by the Dutch. She would like another room to reflect the style of Czar Paul I, who straddled the 18th and 19th centuries, and a third to adopt the Empire style of Napoleon's time, popular in Russia in the early 19th century. 
"My place won't be a museum because it has to be livable," Ms. Melnikova said, "but I think these various styles can be made to work together." 
It's not historical preservation in conventional American terms, but closer to a freewheeling architectural relief effort. But with the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg just two years off, a more coordinated effort may soon begin. The Russian government has announced plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the city infrastructure. As some of that money finds its way into the historical center, it will meet improvement efforts by individuals who are fixing up downtown St. Petersburg, one room at a time.

HEADLINE: Economy Remained Slow in June and July, Fed Reports 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
The economy remained sluggish in June and July as the slide in manufacturing began to spread to other sectors, the Federal Reserve said today.
 "Reports from most Federal Reserve districts point to slow growth or lateral movement in economic activity in June and July," the Fed said in its anecdotal survey of national economic conditions, also known as the beige book. 
 Weakness in the factory sector was seen in almost all regions, the central bank said. "Sustained weakness in the manufacturing sector spilled over to other businesses, with many districts indicating declines in demand for office space and trucking and shipping services," the Fed said. 
The report, compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and based on information gathered before July 30, will be used by the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-setting arm of the Fed, when it next meets to set interest rates on Aug. 21.
Analysts said the generally grim tone of the report lent support to the idea of further cuts in interest rates.
"It confirms the notion that the economy was weak headed into the third quarter," said Richard Berner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
Some of the report's bleakest anecdotal detail dealt with factory activity, which has borne the brunt of the economic slowdown this year. In July, manufacturing shed 49,000 workers. It has lost 837,000 jobs the last 12 months.
"Reports of reduced work hours, lost overtime, forced furloughs, planned shutdowns and layoffs were pervasive," the report said. It noted specific weakness in clothing, computers, semiconductors, steel and telecommunications gear production.
"In addition to conditions in the domestic economy, districts attributed the current malaise in manufacturing to softening international demand for U.S. goods, particularly in Europe and Asia," the report said.
Retail sales were also sluggish and frequently below expectations during the survey period, despite discounts intended to lure shoppers to stores.
Some retailers asked manufacturers to hold onto goods until existing inventories had been sold, and the pessimistic retailing mood also showed up in the form of lower back-to-school and Christmas orders, the Fed said.
The continued weakness in the economy did, however, have a brighter side in the form of reduced pressure to increase prices.
"Continued slow economic growth loosened labor markets and eased wage pressures in most districts in June and July, but rising benefit costs continued to add to compensation costs," the Fed said. Employers were trying to trim those benefit expenses. The Kansas City Fed said area companies were looking at ways to cut free parking and health club perks.
Falling production costs and stiff competition also kept consumer-level prices in check, the report said.
A separate government report showed that inventories on wholesalers' shelves fell slightly in June while sales tumbled, mainly because of slower sales of durable items.
Wholesale inventories fell 0.2 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted $302.3 billion, after posting a revised 0.3 percent gain in the previous month, the Commerce Department said. The inventory decline was slightly larger than expected.
Sales, however, fell 0.9 percent, to $226.83 billion, after a 0.5 percent drop the previous month. The sales numbers were pulled down by the durable goods category, which fell 1.3 percent compared with a decline of only 0.2 percent in May.
The stock-to-sales ratio -- a measure of how long it would take to deplete stocks at the current sales pace -- was 1.33 month's worth in June compared with 1.32 in May. This is the highest ratio since 1.34 in February 1999.

HEADLINE: Ontario's New Welfare Rule: Be Literate and Drug Free 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: ETOBICOKE, Ontario 

 BODY:
The province of Ontario is taking a tougher stance on welfare than has ever been tried before in Canada. It plans to make passing a literacy test mandatory for receiving public assistance and it will screen recipients for drug or alcohol problems, cutting off benefits to those who refuse treatment.
 In a country where government compassion toward the disadvantaged is widely considered a national trait, the strict new measures to be imposed this fall have been characterized as mean-spirited, overly harsh and possibly in violation of Ontario's human rights code. 
 But officials defend the measures, contending that they are necessary in order to push people still receiving assistance toward independence. Years of whittling down the welfare rolls have left only the "hardest to serve" clients still receiving assistance, they say. 
"Our welfare caseload has decreased 60 percent over the last six years, but it has not disappeared," said John Baird, Ontario's minister of community and social services. "The question now is, what is it going to take to get the rest of the recipients from welfare to work?"
Mr. Baird said experts had identified illiteracy and addictions as among the greatest obstacles keeping longtime welfare recipients from entering the work force. Although there is no evidence that people on welfare have a higher incidence of those problems than other people, Mr. Baird said that someone who could not read a business memo or function with alertness because of an addiction would always be shut out of the job market. 
"If someone has a problem with literacy or addiction and refuses to get help, I don't know what else Ontario can do for them," Mr. Baird said. 
The province intends to start screening for literacy and addiction problems by October. People who fail the literacy test will be required to enroll in workfare programs like the Preparatory Training Program, which operates from the second floor of a building in a strip mall here in this western Toronto enclave. 
The government of Premier Mike Harris of the Progressive Conservative Party has won two terms promising that welfare reform will help reduce spending and cut taxes in Ontario, Canada's most populous province. Six years ago, more than a million Ontario residents received welfare. The Harris government has phased in workfare programs similar to those used in the United States, and rolls have shrunk by more than 580,000, reducing annual costs by more than $5 billion. 
But as with the American programs, Ontario's have reached the point at which reducing welfare rolls further is far more difficult. The remaining recipients have been on welfare for many years and often have problems that keep them from finding work even in a robust economy. 
The literacy test, requiring clients to fill in a brief answer sheet, does not strictly measure reading skills but rather measures a facility with words and numbers required for basic work skills, officials said.
In the literacy training program here, which the government sees as a model for an expanded, mandatory program, about 100 students, all on welfare, learn how to write memos, do basic accounting and provide customer service. One student, Sandra Neil, 44, recently began a class on how to operate a cash register. 
Miss Neil, a mother of four, has been on welfare since she lost her job as a janitor at a local college five years ago. She said that forcing people like her to take a literacy test in order to receive public assistance would be unfair because she never finished high school.
"I don't have the education for it," she said. "I'd fail every time."
Other welfare recipients who were born outside Canada are worried that they will be at a disadvantage because they do not know English well enough to pass the test. 
"It's not good when you have to force people to do it," said Mercedes Ubiera, 39, who came to Canada from the Dominican Republic 15 years ago not speaking a word of English. 
Another woman in the class, Fardousa Hassan, 26, came from Somalia nine years ago and has already attended English classes. She said she was not worried about being forced to take a literacy test but she was worried that if she did find a job she might not find day care for her four children. 
Like Mrs. Hassan, critics of the government are concerned about the lack of day care and other social services to help welfare recipients get back on their feet. They say welfare clients are coming under this pressure because it is a politically popular thing to do.
"I do not believe for a second that the goal here is to help these people," said Michael Gravelle, a legislator with the Ontario Liberal Party. "The real goal is finding another way of kicking people off welfare." 
Mr. Gravelle said he especially objected to the drug screening, in large measure because mandatory programs like this have not proved effective. 
Similar efforts to link drug treatment to welfare reform have been struck down in the United States because they required mandatory testing of all welfare applicants. Ontario officials said they carefully studied the situation in the United States and avoided similar problems by requiring screening, not chemical testing, as a first step.
Under the Ontario system, trained social workers would look for evidence of an addiction, like needle marks or incoherence during an interview. If the screener concluded that a welfare recipient had a drug problem, the person would be required to enroll in a treatment program, or risk having welfare benefits cut off. If the person disagreed with the screener's conclusion, the only option would be to submit to chemical testing. 
While Ontario has tried to avoid a clash with the courts, the drug screening may still violate the province's human rights code, said Keith C. Norton, chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission. In the province, alcohol or drug dependency is considered a disability, and Ontario's human rights code prohibits discrimination against disabled people.
"There is a great risk that the test will be challenged and shot down by the courts," Mr. Norton said. 
But the province insists that it will proceed with plans to have a pilot program for literacy testing and addiction screening running by October. 
"If we backed down on welfare reform every time someone threatened to take us to court," said Mr. Baird, the social services minister, "we wouldn't have accomplished anything."

HEADLINE: Web Venture's Woes Spin Cautionary Spending Tale 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Dismissing employees and selling subsidiaries as it runs out of money, Globalnet Financial.com looks like another Internet venture going bust in a hurry.
 But instead of quietly closing shop, the company is the center of a takeover battle for stakes it owns in a few promising businesses, including a broker of shares in initial public offerings and an online seller of personal pensions, life insurance and other financial services. The tussle is a cautionary tale of the consequences of freewheeling spending sanctioned by the Internet boom. 
 At issue is whether Globalnet, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., but does most of its business in Britain, suffered from mistakes or malfeasance. Did the executives make some bad investments, spending $120 million on deals that generated little return, or did they breach their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders through a series of insider transactions? 
Arguing the latter, a group of angry shareholders are trying to oust management by backing a takeover bid by AISoftware, a software company based in Italy. AISoftware today made an unsolicited offer of $13.7 million in stock for Globalnet.
Globalnet managers, who deny any wrongdoing and say they have consistently acted in the best interest of the company, said they supported an earlier $9 million cash takeover offer from NewMedia Spark, a British company that invests in start-ups. The companies have shared some directors, have some joint investments and have offices in the same building in London.
Ron Goldie, Globalnet's chief operating officer, said today that the board backed NewMedia's bid as the only tangible offer on the table.
Michael Whitaker, NewMedia's chief executive and until recently a Globalnet board member, said the close relationship of the two companies could benefit Globalnet's shareholders. "Because NewMedia Spark has a number of investments in common with Globalnet, we are better placed than anyone else to realize value from those assets," he said.
Investors must decide by Aug. 22 whether to sell their shares to NewMedia.
As the debate intensifies, dissident shareholders are questioning some recent deals, like one in which Globalnet sold UK-Invest, its flagship financial Web site, to Advanced Financial Network for $:800,000, or $1.1 million, in stock. As part of the deal, Globalnet agreed to invest $:700,000 in Advanced Financial, in which NewMedia Spark also owns some shares. 
One of the dissident shareholders, Peter Fuhrman of New York, says that Globalnet is spending its precious cash to prop up NewMedia's portfolio.
Mr. Goldie defended the agreement with Advanced Financial by saying that the only way Globalnet can sell assets in such a competitive market is to contribute its own money to the deal.
The takeover debate comes amid a simmering battle over earlier management decisions made after the Internet bubble burst last year and while Globalnet's share value plunged more than 90 percent.
Dissident shareholders, for example, have challenged Globalnet's decision to pay $1.9 million in severance to three top executives, even though its remaining cash reserve of $3 million is not enough to keep operations afloat or to cover liquidation costs. They also wonder why executives adopted a "poison pill" -- a decision to issue new shares to dilute the stake of an unwanted suitor -- if they are truly interested in selling the company to the highest bidder.
Roger Alford, a senior research associate in the financial markets group of the London School of Economics, said poison pills protected management at the expense of shareholders. "It gives them a trump card," he said, by allowing management to negotiate not necessarily with the highest bidder, but with one who promises to "safeguard their jobs or pay severance packages."
Mr. Goldie said the company was legally obligated to pay severance to him and two other executives when they were dismissed last week. None of the executives was expected to remain with the company under its new owner. If a buyer is not found, he said, they will be dismissed regardless because Globalnet will have ceased operating.
He said the poison pill was designed to ensure that potential suitors negotiate with Globalnet's board.
Globalnet started as a brokerage firm in 1987, under the name Galt Financial. A little over a decade later, it began providing financial services on the Internet, and by 1999 had changed its name to Globalnet Financial.com, under the direction of Stanley Hollander, then chief executive.
Globalnet raced to build Web sites that delivered financial news, operated chat rooms and allowed subscribers to buy and sell stocks under the names UK-Invest and America-Invest, among others.
It also invested in a variety of unrelated companies, including $1.1 million in NewMedia Spark. Mr. Whitaker, NewMedia's chief executive, joined the Globalnet board in November 1999, though he resigned before starting his bid. The two companies have offices in the same building off Regent Street in London.
Globalnet, whose shares already traded on Nasdaq, raised $78 million by selling more shares on the Alternative Investment Market in London at the end of 1999. Some of the shares came from executives and investors in the company, who pocketed $16.3 million. The rest of the money was used to expand the business.
Critics like Mr. Fuhrman complain that the money was wasted on a series of imprudent investments, including leasing office space the company never occupied and buying a brokerage firm that closed a year later.
Mr. Hollander, who resigned as chief executive last September but is still a board member, said the deals "appeared to be a sensible strategic investment in the context of financial markets then existing."
While 2000 started well for Globalnet, by the end of the year the company would lose $74.4 million on revenue of $7.3 million. Among the reasons for the loss: Globalnet leased space in Manhattan for an Internet foreign exchange operation that never happened. The space remains unoccupied, and Globalnet is negotiating to get out of $1.7 million in lease obligations, company documents show.
Globalnet also agreed to buy Dalton Kent, a Manhattan brokerage firm, for $20 million in stock just before financial markets tumbled; what had been a profitable business began hemorrhaging $460,000 a month. Globalnet closed the operation less than a year later, recovering almost nothing from the investment, but not before it paid the former Dalton Kent partners a further $3.5 million in cash plus 1.1 million more Globalnet shares to compensate for a steep decline in its own stock price.
Compounding its problems, Globalnet had expanded Dalton Kent's operations to Florida in the months after the acquisition, signing a $3.2 million lease for office space. Now a Globalnet vice president and director, Alan Jacobs, is negotiating to buy the Florida assets from Globalnet for an undisclosed price.
Mr. Fuhrman said he would prefer to see those assets sold to people unrelated to the company. Mr. Goldie said extensive attempts to sublet the office space had proved fruitless in a market with collapsing real estate prices. He said Mr. Jacobs's offer was the only serious one.

HEADLINE: G.M. Official Says Dollar Is Too Strong 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM with GREG WINTER 

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. Aug. 8 

 BODY:
John M. Devine, the chief financial officer of General Motors, said today that the strength of the dollar continued to hurt United States manufacturers and that G.M. had asked the Bush administration to rethink its currency policy.
 "The strong dollar of the last couple of years is certainly giving a lot of strength to the Germans and to the Japanese," Mr. Devine said at an auto industry conference here. 
 "The strong dollar is frankly destroying the manufacturing capability and the manufacturing competitiveness of this country," he added. 
A strong dollar is good news for American consumers who buy foreign-made goods, like cars, or for American tourists traveling abroad. Both the Clinton and Bush administrations have favored keeping the dollar strong. At a Congressional hearing last month, Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, said that moderating the nation's strong dollar policy could adversely affect inflation, interest rates and foreign investment. 
Paul H. O'Neill, the current Treasury secretary, has stuck with a strong dollar policy. He has gone so far as to say that he will rent Yankee Stadium and a brass band if he changes course to say the dollar is too high.
This is not what many domestic manufacturers, like G.M., want to hear. For them, a strong dollar means that competing products exported to the United States by foreign manufacturers can be sold for fewer dollars without lessening profits booked in Japanese yen, South Korean won or euros. It also means that profits from foreign units of domestic corporations are reduced when they are translated back into the dollar, and that United States exports become more expensive for foreign buyers.
Other manufacturers offer similar complaints about the stinging effect of weaker currencies abroad. In its most recent quarter, DuPont said that soft currencies overseas, particularly in Europe and Asia, had dragged down its sales 2 percent worldwide, ultimately costing it $35 million in net income.
Coca-Cola said that weak currencies, mostly in Europe and Brazil, cut 4 percent from its operating income in the most recent quarter, while sales at Gillette dropped 5 percent. Were it not for the effect of weaker currencies abroad, particularly in Europe, Gillette said its sales would have fallen only 1 percent. 
One of the main reasons that weak currencies pose such a problem is that American companies convert their overseas sales into dollars before reporting results. So, even if manufacturers sell the same number of products overseas as they do at home, they end up earning less for them. Manufacturers disdainfully refer to the phenomenon as the translation effect.
"With 30 percent of our business in Europe, a strong dollar and a weak euro mean we're going to have to sell much more to make the same money," said Eric A. Krauss, a spokesman for Gillette.
In New York, the euro settled at 88.08 cents today, while the dollar settled at 123.30 yen. When the euro was introduced in January 1999, a single euro was valued at $1.17.
"The imbalance has gone beyond what would be a reasonable boundary to have against the euro and against the yen," Mr. Devine said. 
"We have not historically been very successful influencing the administration on currency, they do what they please," he said. "Even if the administration wanted to do something about it, currency markets operate in their own universe." 
"But I think it's something we've got to get on the table because it is a fact we're dealing with, and it's turning what is a very competitive market into an even more competitive market," he added. 
Mr. Devine said the strong dollar had not recently been G.M.'s top concern in Washington. The company had vigorously lobbied against significantly tougher fuel economy standards that were not included in the energy bill recently passed by the House. Of the efforts on dollar policy, Mr. Devine said, "it's a dialogue right now."
Frank Vargo, a vice president of the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, said: "The dollar is up about 30 percent in the last four years against the major foreign currencies."
"This is just like putting a 30 percent tax on U.S. exports and saying we have a 30 percent sale on U.S. imports," he added. 
"I'm hearing more from our manufacturers about the dollar than any other issue," Mr. Vargo said. "It's having a devastating effect."
But David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn., which consults with currency traders, said changing the dollar policy now would risk foreign investment at a vulnerable time. "One of the things that sustains that flow is the notion that U.S. currency is not going to lose its value and may even increase in value," he said.
"We have a very weak economy, we don't have much happening abroad in terms of demand, so there isn't much to offset a sudden decrease," Mr. Gilmore said.
Mr. Devine said today that "for us, at least a recognition of the problem would be a step forward."
"We have to be careful on this issue," he added, "because we don't want to be seen as crybabies."

HEADLINE: Chip Sales Are Expected to Fall 26% 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Semiconductor sales worldwide will fall 26 percent this year, more than previously expected, because demand for computers and cellular phones has not picked up, the market researcher Dataquest Inc. said today. 
 Revenue will fall to $168.1 billion from $226.5 billion last year, Dataquest said. 
The firm had previously forecast a 17 percent decline and said today that if conditions worsened, the drop might hit 29 percent. 
 Sales have dropped for chip makers from Intel to Texas Instruments as economic growth has slowed and as customers work through inventories of extra parts built up in boom times last year. Demand has not rebounded, and those stockpiles are still too high, Dataquest said. 
"We are faced with a worldwide semiconductor market downturn that decimated two years of industry growth," the researchers wrote in a note to clients. "We see minimal recovery for the industry during the second half of 2001." 
If the economy stabilizes and demand improves, chip companies will start to show growth in the fourth quarter, Dataquest said. 
It predicted that sales would climb 12 percent in 2002, though it said that figure could come in at 6 percent to 9 percent if the slowdown persisted beyond the third quarter. 
Christy Pettey, a spokeswoman for the researcher, said the report would be released later this week. The revision was reported earlier by Semiconductor Business News.

HEADLINE: Trash Hauler's Profit Soars to $191 Million 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Waste Management Inc., North America's largest trash hauler, said today that its second-quarter net income rose to $191 million from $300,000 in the quarter a year earlier. 
 Net income was 30 cents a share, compared with break-even on a per-share basis a year earlier. Revenue fell 11 percent, to $2.92 billion, partly because of the sale of businesses in Hong Kong, Sweden, Mexico and Britain. 
 Costs fell 17 percent last quarter to $2.47 billion from a year earlier. The chief executive, Maurice Myers, who was hired in November 1999, has improved accounting and reduced expenses, and the company's stock has gained 40 percent in the last year. 
"So far, the company is right on track" to meet its earnings targets, said a Raymond James analyst, William Fisher. "The economy isn't helping, but they are maintaining cash flow and paying down debt." 
The company, which is based in Houston, had struggled to track costs and revenue after USA Waste Services Inc. bought Waste Management in 1998 for $25.6 billion and took its name. 
Waste Management has put in new financial-systems software at 648 districts in North America and expects to install the software at all 1,515 districts by the end of the year. 
Lower recycled commodity prices hurt revenue last quarter, Mr. Myers said on a conference call with analysts and investors. Recycled cardboard prices fell 62 percent, to $48 a ton, last quarter, and the price for recycled newsprint fell to $55 a ton from $90, he said. The company expects prices to be little changed this half from last quarter. 
The company raised prices in some areas and dropped unprofitable accounts to offset some of the lost revenue, Mr. Myers said. 
"Our industrial business has been slower than we like, though business over all continues to be good," Mr. Myers said. "This business is not recession-proof, but it is recession-resistant." 
The company plans to spend about $250 million to buy other businesses this year, Mr. Myers said. The company said previously that it might spend as much as $350 million on acquisitions.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Fall After Worrisome Report From Federal Reserve

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday after the Federal Reserve said the economy stayed sluggish in June and July as the recent slide in manufacturing began to infect other sectors.
 Also hurting the markets was a suggestion from Cisco Systems that a global malaise in technology spending could continue at least through the end of the year. That assessment came as Cisco reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings late on Tuesday that were in line with analyst expectations. 
 The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 61.43 points, or 3 percent, to close at 1,966.36. The Dow Jones industrial average decreased 165.24 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,293.50, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 20.87 points, or 1.7 percent, to 1,183.53. 
"Most everything you've read in the last few days about earnings has been, at best, neutral," said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. "The feeling is that it's going to be next year, at the earliest, for favorable earnings comparisons."
Cisco reinforced that feeling with its earnings report.
"I think the Cisco news was rather damning from an overall perspective," said Steve Massocca, president and head of trading at Pacific Growth Equities.
Shares of Cisco fell $1.28, to $17.98. Other technology issues also declined. Intel slipped $1.01, to $29.61, and Qualcomm dropped $2.47, to $65.09.
Microsoft, which began the process of appealing its antitrust case to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, decreased $1.49, to $64.86.
After struggling to maintain stability for much of the day, stock prices began a sharp slide after the Federal Reserve issued a report saying that the United States economy continued to be sluggish in June and July. The central bank said in its beige book, a survey of economic conditions, that the period was marked by slow growth or lateral movement in several areas, including clothing, computers, semiconductors and manufacturing. 
The report, which is based on information gathered before July 30, will be used by the Fed's policy makers when they meet on Aug. 21. Policy makers, who have already cut short-term interest rates 2.75 percentage points this year, are expected to cut interest rates for the seventh time this year in an attempt to shore up the economy. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories fell 0.2 percent in June. Economists expected the number to decline 0.1 percent. Sales also fell 0.9 percent to $226.83 billion in June. They fell 0.5 percent in May.
Shares of Aetna fell 36 cents, to $25.99, after the company reported a second-quarter operating loss of $95.9 million, or 67 cents a share, more than double its first quarter shortfall. 
Shares of Clorox gained 36 cents, to $35.66, after the company said its fiscal fourth-quarter net income fell 35 percent, partly because it took a charge to close a cat litter plant.

Treasuries Rise Sharply
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury prices rallied yesterday as a grim Federal Reserve survey of economic activity, a 10-year note auction and slumping stock markets sent investors scrambling for government securities.
Thirty-year bonds rose more than a full point, while yields on two-year notes, the most sensitive to interest rate expectations, tumbled to their lowest level since October 1993, when the Federal Reserve was battling a near-recession.
"It's been quite an explosive rally," said Sadakichi Robbins, head of global bond trading at Bank Julius Baer.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 18/32, to 98. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.51 percent from 5.60 percent on Tuesday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 10-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.394
High Yield: 5.078%
Low Yield: 5.030%
Median Yield: 5.070%
Total applied for: $32,395,067
Accepted: $12,043,085
Noncompetitive: $107,692
Interest set at: 5

The 10-year notes mature on Aug. 15, 2011.

HEADLINE: World of Debating Grows, and Vermont Is Its Lab 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., Aug. 7 

 BODY:
Darong Kwon came to the University of Vermont this summer to learn how to speak. There is nothing wrong with Ms. Kwon's voice: she has been talking since she was a toddler, and picked up English as a child when her family lived in Australia. Now 19, she traveled 6,642 miles from her home in Seoul to the World Debate Institute here to learn how to speak up, speak out, speak her mind.
 "In Korea, I find it hard to express my opinion so people can understand me," said Ms. Kwon, a freshman communications major at Kyung Hee University. "In Korea, they tell us to be creative, to argue, but they don't let us do it. Here, we practice." 
 Ms. Kwon was among two dozen students and professors from South Korea, Chile, China, Serbia and Uzbekistan stumbling over new vocabulary words today as they argued about whether economic growth should be sacrificed for the environment, whether the Olympic Games should be abolished and whether a woman's place is in the home.
The 18-year-old debate institute, here on the bucolic Burlington campus, has been nicknamed "boot camp for the brain," but for the growing number of students from restrictive cultures, the two-week course is an eye- -- and throat- -- opening experiment in free speech and democracy.
While competitive debate has been experiencing a renaissance in American colleges and rapidly expanding in urban high schools, it has exploded overseas in recent years, particularly in emerging democracies. Founded in 1994, the International Debate Education Association, or IDEA, has native-language debating clubs serving 70,000 students in 31 countries from Albania to Mongolia.
Far beyond an esoteric academic exercise, debate is seen in many of these countries as a tool to opening up society, a way in which the next generation learns to question authority and engage in rigorous discussion of complex topics.
"To go in and say, 'You don't have a democratic society, you need one,' people say, 'Don't tell us that'; if you go in and say, 'We've got this activity that kids love,' they listen," Noel Selegzi, IDEA's executive director, said in a telephone interview from St. Petersburg, Russia, where 300 people from 35 countries just finished a two-week debate camp.
"We don't care that the kids have debate societies for the rest of their lives," Mr. Selegzi added. "What we do care about is that they're used to thinking critically, they learn to analyze what they're hearing, not just take it for granted, they learn to research positions."
In Vermont, the students have English-language seminars on constructing and tearing apart cases, on preparing evidence, on employing rhetorical flourishes and even on heckling and disrupting their opponents with points of information. One afternoon a professor drew a chalkboard diagram of a person suffering under a very hot sun, eager to turn on a fan, which threatened to knock a big rock onto another person's head. To oppose the argument for turning on the fan, he suggested, a debater could offer an alternative solution, like cooling down by using the shade from the big rock. 
Each morning the novices, clutching Ben & Jerry's tumblers, face off in practice debate rounds, complete with judges and critiques.
"Stand up and tell me a story," Tomislav Kargacin, a high school English teacher from Novi Sad, Serbia, told Ms. Kwon. "You don't need those papers. If you read, I think you do not understand what you say."
Chi Hyoung Kim, a 27-year-old journalism major, who in December won South Korea's first-ever national debate tournament -- and a trip to the Vermont institute -- struggled this morning through a simple speech in broken English. Mr. Kargacin told him to try it in his native tongue.
"You are a very powerful speaker in Korean," Mr. Kargacin said, though he did not understand a word. "Do you have gestures in Korean? Feel free to use them. That gives it impact."
The guru of the institute, and its founder, is Alfred C. Snider, a professor of forensics universally known as Tuna, a nickname he acquired in a high school debate round about organized crime because of his resemblance to a Chicago Mafia figure. Professor Snider, who looks like a scraggly Santa Claus, with a white-gray beard and bright blue eyes, said he had opened the institute to foreigners because he believed that the rigid educational systems of memorization and note-taking in which many of them study were "not sufficient for training people for the global marketplace."
Tuition for the international students is $500 for the two weeks, compared with $850 for American college students and $950 for high school debaters. While the Americans stay up all night researching details of policy on Native Americans, or practicing talking so fast that they are left gasping for air, "in international debating it's much more about personal empowerment, creating civic virtues," Professor Snider said. "It's people who are saying, 'I like democracy, I like the sound of it, but how do we do it?' "
Rodrigo Rojas, a Chilean poet and professor who coordinated the first-ever international Spanish-language debate tournament this spring, said his country remained hesitant about debate because of the censorship and retribution that characterized the Pinochet government. Three Chinese students from Inner Mongolia who arrived late in Burlington because of problems in getting visas said some topics remained off limits in their homeland. But Mr. Kargacin said the war back in Serbia had only reignited interest in debate.
"Violence is not an argument; we can treat unsubstantiated claim as violence," he explained. "Learning how to build arguments is learning how to be part of the community. That goes for the whole world."
Gyeong-Ho Hur, a professor at Kyung Hee University, came to the Vermont camp last summer, then played host to 80 teams from 20 universities in December for South Korea's first national debate tournament. Now he has a new goal: a college debate between North Korea and South Korea.
"Governments," he said, "they are not really talking; what about the students? It's going to be a good starting point.
"We have many commonalities. Something we can talk together. Not something related to politics. Probably we could talk about Japan."

HEADLINE: 2 Mayoral Candidates Focus on Health Care and Another Worries About the Economy 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Mark Green and Peter F. Vallone turned their attention to health care issues yesterday, with speeches that outlined their plans to enroll more New Yorkers, particularly children, in health care programs. In a speech to health-care-policy experts at the Robert F. Wagner School of Public Service, Mr. Green addressed four areas -- the uninsured, children's health, medical research and the troubled public hospital system. 
 Mr. Vallone, the City Council speaker, hit on similar themes at a campaign stop at New York University Medical Center, where he proposed that the city pay the premiums currently paid by parents whose children do not qualify for Medicaid but are eligible for a low-cost insurance program. Those premiums range from $108 to $180 a year per child. He also unveiled an ambitious plan to extend prescription drug coverage to older people, seizing on an issue more commonly regarded as a federal responsibility than a local one. 
 Under Mr. Vallone's plan, announced at New York University Hospital in front of an audience of elderly New Yorkers, older people with incomes of up to $43,000 a year would be able to participate in a city-subsidized drug plan.
Mr. Green, who as public advocate has worked with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in helping to increase enrollment in public insurance programs, said he would like to build on their efforts, using other city agencies and services used by the poor, such as food stamp enrollment sites, to entice people to enroll in Medicaid and Child Health Plus, the low-cost insurance program for children.
Mr. Green also said that he would like to see a health coordinator to oversee a team of caseworkers in schools that have the greatest number of sick children, and a partnership between many of the city's leading academic medical centers that would use city funds to focus on diabetes, asthma, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease.
He took a swipe at the Health and Hospitals Corporation, the nation's largest public hospital system, saying that it has not studied where health needs are the greatest in the city nor taken input from the city's poorest residents. He added that he would like to see the corporation's losses reduced, largely through increased Medicaid reimbursements, which the state must approve.
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president and another candidate for mayor, has already called for using more of the city's share of the nationwide tobacco settlement to treat the uninsured, and for providing asthma nebulizers in elementary and middle schools. He would like to see the $97 million a year that the city has put aside to build jails redistributed to the health care budget.
One of the two Republican mayoral candidates, Michael R. Bloomberg, also addressed health care issues this week, hewing to positions similar to his Democratic rivals' proposals on how to enroll more children in health insurance programs.
Paying for many of these programs or expansions requires state and federal input. The price tag on Mr. Vallone's campaign proposal for expanding prescription drug coverage is $260 million. An additional $147 million would be needed to pay for Mr. Vallone's other health care promise: to pick up the cost of the modest premiums that low-income parents pay for government-subsidized insurance for their children.
Some of Mr. Vallone's rivals questioned how the proposals would be paid for, contending he was not outlining what would be sacrificed in order to shift financing.
But Mr. Vallone offered a carefully detailed payment proposal, from using funds saved by hiring civilians to do some of the work of uniformed police officers to diverting money from the tobacco settlement to better collection of parking tickets.
Not every candidate was talking about health care policy yesterday. Many of them button-holed sweaty subway riders. Mr. Ferrer continued to press for further investigation into the deaths of four people who were struck and killed in Brooklyn Saturday night by an off-duty police officer who has been charged with drunken driving and manslaughter. 
Some of the candidates were also anticipating hefty endorsements. Mr. Ferrer's aides announced yesterday that retired Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan would endorse Mr. Ferrer's mayoral bid at a ceremony today in front of City Hall. Mr. Green planned to lock up an endorsement from the Working Families Party, which drew more than 55,000 votes for the Senate campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton last year and is affiliated with unions, community groups, tenant associations and various advocacy groups.
In a speech before members of the construction industry, Mr. Bloomberg repeated his prediction that the city's economy would continue to slow in coming months. He said the downturn would restrict the choices of the next mayor by cutting the revenues the government would ordinarily receive. 
Even so, Mr. Bloomberg said, he expected the city government to take the lead in big-ticket projects like developing Manhattan's West Side and luring the 2012 Olympic games. He said he hoped the city could capture more federal and state money to help finance such projects.
"We are the Big Apple. We have to do big things," Mr. Bloomberg said. "We just have to get big funds to get big projects."

HEADLINE: In America; 
Let's Clear the Air

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Take a deep breath.
 On second thought, don't. 
 You don't want to risk inhaling too much of that oppressive soup of pollutants that is passing for air in the New York metropolitan region. To say that it's ugly out there is an understatement. Breathing has become problematic. As the mercury streaks through the 90's each afternoon, that harsh, sooty, brownish stuff they call air just sits there, ominously, a caustic haze that sears the eyes and imposes a vague feeling of nausea on those who have to be out and about. 
An ozone health advisory has been in effect, which means the air is unhealthy for active children and adults, and for people with respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease.
For once, the couch potatoes had the right idea: Crank up the air-conditioning and pop in that video. The American Lung Association made it clear that a lengthy jog or a furious game of tennis or an extended burst of Rollerblading was not advisable. 
Conditions have been ideal over the past few days for a buildup of dangerous pollutants like ozone, carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Temperatures have been high and wind speeds low. And the endless, slowly moving traffic has offered up its relentless contribution of poisonous emissions.
After awhile it becomes too much even for healthy people.
"People who are out exercising, and breathing deeply as a result, are drawing all of this stuff into their lungs," said John Kirkwood, the chief executive officer of the American Lung Association.
"They're exercising to improve their health," he said during an interview Tuesday, when the temperature reached 99. "But if they're doing it on a day like today, it's actually adverse to their health."
Children, in particular, can be at risk. "They're more vulnerable because their respiratory systems are not fully formed," said Mr. Kirkwood. Studies have shown that as ozone levels increase, healthy youngsters engaged in normal levels of playground or camp activity can experience breathing problems.
So here's the good news. We know that the air is frequently lousy. And we know that the long-term problem of global warming is already upon us. But as bad as these problems are, they are not yet emergencies.
So what we have here is an opportunity. If we could somehow marshal the resources and the will to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, we could both attack the looming problem of global warming, which may be the biggest problem to face the planet in the 21st century, and combat the debilitating air pollution that damages our health day in and day out. 
Attack one and you automatically attack the other. If we could significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions -- think traffic, think power plants -- we would make an enormous contribution to the easing of global warming. And, as Michael Oppenheimer, the chief scientist at Environmental Defense, noted, "If you reduced carbon dioxide, you'd begin to get rid of most of the stuff that causes these everyday respiratory problems. You'd start to get rid of the nitrogen oxides, which lead to the generation of smog. You'd start to get rid of sulfur dioxide, which leads not only to acid rain but to the tiny particles that people breathe, and which cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems." 
And so on.
California may be showing us the way. Faced with an awesome energy -- and potential economic -- crisis just a few months ago, Californians have been conserving like crazy. Government leaders have helped by establishing policies that offer incentives to conserve. And while the California problem is complex, there is little doubt that conservation has been a key factor in easing the crisis.
The trick for the rest of us -- and that includes government leaders -- is to figure out how to respond to problems like air pollution and global warming before a crisis threatens to consume us.
"Why does it take the threat of a crisis to get this done?" asked Dr. Oppenheimer.
We should act now. We need greater fuel efficiency in our motor vehicles. We need cleaner electric power plants. We need more efficient appliances in our homes.
And a dollop of enlightened leadership from our public officials.

HEADLINE: New Numbers to Crunch 

 BODY:
On Monday the public had its first taste of what could be a yearly gold mine of information about America: the Census 2000 Supplemental Survey. Conducted between late 1999 and early this year, the supplement reports responses from 700,000 households to questions similar to those asked in the "long form" census of 2000.
 The newly released figures bring much of the good news to be expected from a decadelong boom. Americans earned more, saw their material wealth burgeon and obtained more education to guarantee their futures. But the supplement also exposes some areas that beg for improvement. Even in the world's leading economy, over half a million homes still lack complete plumbing. Though the poverty rate for adults is 11 percent, the rate among children under 18 is 17 percent. Only 11 percent of the elderly are poor, a testament to the efficacy of Social Security and Medicare. The federal government does not provide a similar safety net for children. 
 The supplement also raises intriguing questions for social scientists. For example, the median working man earns 59 percent more, in an average year, than the median working woman. Is that mainly because of differences in types of jobs, hours or discrepancies in pay? As Americans got richer, they car-pooled less and commuted longer; did the country's energy situation worsen as a result? A third of renters spend more than 35 percent of their income on housing, compared with only a fifth of owners with mortgages; how much of this difference comes from the tax relief only owners enjoy? The answers to these questions will be fodder for a thousand doctoral dissertations. More important, they will influence the policy debates that make headlines every year.
The Census Bureau would like to replace the long form it sends out to selected households every 10 years with a yearly version of the Supplemental Survey, to be called the American Communities Survey. An annual survey of this kind, which requires Congressional approval, would be extremely useful. The size of the survey would allow the Census Bureau to provide far more information about the standards of living, use of social services and family characteristics of Americans in particular states, cities and even neighborhoods.
Statisticians have proved again and again that sampling 700,000 households, as in the 2000 supplement, can yield results virtually indistinguishable from those achieved by sampling 19 million households, as in the decennial long form. Almost nothing is lost in quality, and much is gained in frequency. Charting demographic, social and economic changes year by year will help to ensure that government policies -- not to mention business strategies -- truly fit the needs of the people.

HEADLINE: Pockets of Protest Are Rising Against Immigration 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: MASON CITY, Iowa, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
At a City Council meeting here last month, Duane Crum objected to Iowa's plan to use this prototypical Midwestern town as a "model city" to recruit immigrants to help ease the state's labor shortages by replacing aging workers.
 "We are not racists nor are we bigots," said Mr. Crum, 51, a former meatpackers' union steward. "We are not interested in doing anything other than preserving a way of life." 
 By the time a mostly pro-immigrant crowd of 300 people gathered at a town hall meeting a few days later to debate the plan, Mr. Crum had gained more supporters. About 1,400 residents had joined him in a petition drive intended to pressure the city to reject a $50,000 state grant to carry out a strategy that he contends would "reduce the standard of living" here. 
In Fort Dodge, another designated model city 60 miles southwest of here, 1,400 residents signed a similar petition, many fearing that new immigrants would take jobs and "the bread off our table," said Greg Nolting, a city councilman who opposes the state's plan. 
The protests caused Gov. Tom Vilsack, the plan's champion, to pull back and say that the pilot programs were not, in fact, contracts required to recruit immigrants, but agreements under which the cities would consider the idea. 
Both Mason City and Fort Dodge, as well as the third city offered a grant, Marshalltown, decided to accept them. 
But the unease over immigration in Mason City and Fort Dodge is hardly unusual in largely white areas where immigrant populations have sprung up quickly, though immigration experts say it does not approach the backlash against immigrants of the early and mid-1990's. 
Yet with United States and Mexican cabinet officers meeting in Washington on Thursday to discuss a proposal to legalize some of the three million Mexicans living in this country illegally, anti-immigrant views are being heard in pockets all over the country.
The protests range from isolated beatings of migrant laborers, as on Long Island, to a small but vocal cry in the halls of Congress that the flow of legal and illegal foreigners threatened to clog schools and take jobs from American workers. 
Groups that back restrictions on immigration, like the Federation for American Immigration Reform and Project U.S.A., which had lost much of their audience in the past five years, have gotten a second wind. They are seizing on the new fears of immigration and providing money and advisers to local campaigns, including the one here in Mason City, a town of 29,000 people that is 93.4 percent non-Hispanic white, according to 2000 census figures. 
In the past two years, groups advocating restrictions on immigrants have sprung up in Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oregon and South Carolina. A national coalition that opposes increased immigration, led by the federation of immigration reform, ran more than $500,000 in radio and print advertisements in 10 states in April and May condemning any new agreement with Mexico to expand immigration. The same group paid for new advertisements broadcast in New York City last week.
But the political climate is far less conducive to a backlash than it was seven years ago, when Californians passed a proposition barring public services to illegal immigrants (ruled unconstitutional) and Republicans like Gov. Pete Wilson of California tried to exploit those resentments.
Now, pro-immigrant sentiments abound, and Democrats and Republicans alike are courting Hispanic voters. Some states are issuing drivers licenses to illegal immigrants to ensure public safety. 
For the first time, labor unions and employers have joined to back a temporary guest-worker program that allows new migrants, as well as illegal ones already here, to earn their permanent residency over time. But the spread of immigrants to states like Iowa and North Carolina -- the first significant influx of foreign workers and families to such places in nearly a century -- is bringing cultural and demographic change.
Anti-Latino sentiment in Siler City, N.C., where poultry operations have attracted thousands of Mexican immigrants, grew to the point last year where David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, was invited to help stem the migrant wave. 
Here in Mason City, an unemployment rate of just over 2 percent, residents are divided over Governor Vilsack's plan. 
"If we're not actively recruiting immigrants, then we should," the Rev. Terry Hamilton-Poore, 39, a Presbyterian minister, said at the town hall meeting. "We can't stay the same. It's not an option. Look at our aging population. I see it in my church. I see it in my neighborhood, I see it in our schools." 
Jose D. Barragan Jr., 40, a Mason City native of Mexican descent who owns an auto body shop, agreed. "What was America built on?" Mr. Barragan asked. "The home of the free. Did Columbus have a green card?" 
Opponents like Janice Easley, 69, see things differently. With help from Project U.S.A., Ms. Easley and others have towed around town a mobile billboard called "The Truthmobile." It reads: "In Your 20's? Immigration Will Double the U.S. Population in Your Lifetime."
"I hope by speaking up, it will bring about changes," Mrs. Easley said. "This is for our city, our state, our country." 
Jordan O'Donnell, 18, a sales clerk at B. Dalton bookstore, said, she discussed immigration issues in classes last year at Mason City High School. "We've got to take care of our own people, and then we can start taking care of others," she said. 
Mason City's tiny immigrant population is watching the debate mostly from the sidelines. Francisco Marquez, 27, assistant manager of a Mexican restaurant here, was born in Chicago, but reared in Mexico and still struggles with his English. 
"Sometimes people here are scared of people who speak a foreign language or have different traditions," said Mr. Marquez, who came here two years ago for work. "But it doesn't matter what country you're from. What matters is if you're a good person and work hard."

PERSON: Nora Sayre 

HEADLINE: Nora Sayre, Film Critic And Essayist, Dies at 68 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:
Nora Sayre, a film critic and essayist best known for her commentary on the cultural effects of the cold war -- died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.
 The cause of death was emphysema, said Mary Sayre Haverstock, her cousin. 
 As the child of parents who knew both the New York and Hollywood writing scenes, Ms. Sayre witnessed firsthand the struggles of writers in the crosswinds of America's anti-Communist fervor, which she later insisted both preceded and continued long after the era of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's red-hunting in the early 1950's. In "Running Time: Films of the Cold War" (1982, Dial Press), her second book, she analyzed the effect of this fervor on Hollywood movie-making in the 1950's. 
In her next book, "Previous Convictions: A Journey Through the 1950's" (1995, Rutgers University Press), she dug deeper into the period. "The readiness to challenge and then contradict official wisdom was supposed to be an American tradition," she wrote, "but that kind of autonomy was rare in the 1950's, and I was fortunate to come of age among people who took their independence for granted."
Reviewing "Previous Convictions," David Caute, a historian of anti-Communism, described Ms. Sayre as "an essayist whose light touch masks the formidable weight of her judgments" and whose "natural province is not so much history as people's consciousness." He continued, "Her fault is sometimes to seek out complications which may not be there -- as in her accounts of former Communists who still feel they were right to be wrong -- but this flaw is no doubt reinforced by her affection for individuals she meets and her refusal to accept any aspect of American cold war ideology."
Nora Clemens Sayre was born on Sept. 20, 1932, in Hamilton, Bermuda, the only child of Joel Sayre, a staff writer and war correspondent for The New Yorker and occasional Hollywood screenwriter -- he wrote "Annie Oakley" (1935) for Barbara Stanwyck and was a co-writer on "Gunga Din" (1939) -- and Gertrude (Lynahan) Sayre, a reporter for The New York World. Ms. Sayre attended the Putney School, in Vermont, graduating in 1950, and Radcliffe College, where, as she later described herself, she was apolitical and hung out with the aesthetes and actors who founded the Poets' Theater in Cambridge, and where she graduated cum laude in 1954.
"Like a lot of my generation, I grew up with no politics at all," she told Brian Close, a student at the Columbia Journalism School, in a recent interview. "I didn't even read the newspaper. Mine was a rather liberated family. But it was a very square time. Even the freest spirts were cautious. Clearly life was safer and easier if you had no politics."
In 1955, the year after her graduation from Radcliffe, she took off for Europe with an eye to "blotting out," she later reported, her parents' unhappy marriage and her mother's suicidal depressions. In London, wafted by her parents' literary connections, she met the likes of Arthur Koestler, his lover the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard (future wife of Kingsley Amis), James Thurber, A. J. Liebling, Walker Evans, Cyril Connolly, Henry Green, Graham Greene and Charlie and Oona Chaplin. She also met members of the American community in exile -- targets of Hollywood blacklisting and the United States' anti-communist campaign -- which was centered around Frognal, the house of Donald Ogden Stewart and Ella Winter, his Australian-born wife.
It was in England that she became more politically aware -- "they may have more of a vigorous opposition than we do," she told Mr. Close -- and realized she was "somewhat of a lefty." As she reports in her recently published memoir of that time, "On the Wing: A Young American Abroad" (2001, Counterpoint), she was often considered fair game by sexually avaricious older writers.
Under the tutelage of the literary critic John Davenport, she began to write for publication. As she recalled in "On the Wing," "He would arrive for an unscheduled lunch in my Bourne Street basement, bringing bacon and frozen string beans and books and imperatives: 'Why don't you eat this, read this, write about that.' Soon these editorial sessions were part of my London week: he read my pieces before I submitted them -- plucking out passages that needed polishing but never suggesting any words of his own" and "instilling a horror of cliches."
She landed a job writing book reviews for The New Statesman. "I don't want to give too much credit to the Brits because I am no Anglophile," she told Mr. Close, "but they give a writer so much more freedom, especially then." Ms. Sayre eventually returned to the United States in the early 1960's. She had been through a brief, unsuccessful marriage to Robert Neild, a former Royal Air Force pilot, a lecturer in economics at Cambridge and a rising figure in the Labor Party.
Ms. Sayre served as New York correspondent for the New Statesman from 1965 until 1970. Her first book, a collection of pieces titled "Sixties Going on Seventies" (Rutgers University Press) -- which covered everything from student strikes and yippies to the 1972 Democratic and Republican Conventions -- led to her employment at The New York Times in 1973 when her book was recommended to Arthur Gelb, then managing editor of the paper, as deserving of a review. Mr. Gelb was inspired by it to appoint her movie reviewer for The Times.
She left The Times in 1975 and for the next seven years worked as a freelancer, writing for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation, The Progressive and Esquire, among other publications, and winning a Guggenheim fellowship, 1975-76, and a National Endowment for the Arts grant, 1978. "I managed for those seven years to break even with no other income at all," she told Mr. Close. "I was able to travel. I was able to go to the dentist." She added: "Freelancer has become a very offensive term. Ten years ago it was legitimate. Maybe. Now it's just another word for 'unemployed.' " 
In 1981 she became a visiting lecturer in Columbia University's writing program. Over the course of her career she also served as a lecturer and instructor in various writing workshops, including as a participant in the visiting authors program of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, the lecture series at the Museum of Modern Art, and at the Museum of Television and Radio. She was writer in residence for a semester at James Thurber House in Columbus, Ohio, and a frequent resident at Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. 
She is survived by her cousin, of Oberlin, Ohio.
Ms. Sayre was proud of having covered every presidential political convention from the time she returned to this country, and she continued to work eight hours a day up until the time she entered the hospital. Living in a New York City apartment bought for her by friends, partly to help her out and partly as an investment, she wrote drafts on yellow legal pads -- "like Richard Nixon," she told Mr. Close. "It isn't all writing," she explained. "Some of it is rewriting or looking at things with a critical eye. It is very easy to fill eight hours this way."
She described herself to Mr. Close as "of a certain age." She added: "It isn't vanity, dear, but unfortunately writers are downgraded in our earnings, based on our age. They think we become less capable of grasping things."

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing Regional Economy Drags 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The New York City regional economy has been sluggish since June, according to a new report from the Federal Reserve Board. Retail sales are slow, office space is increasingly empty, exports have dropped and the cost of a hotel room has fallen sharply, according to the report, known as the Beige Book. The one bright spot remains residential real estate; while the market for very expensive houses has softened a bit, the report says, "the market for starter homes is particularly strong."

HEADLINE: British American Tobacco Finds Opening in South Korea 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
British American Tobacco said today that it would spend more than $1 billion over the next decade to make and promote its cigarettes in South Korea, one of the toughest markets in the world for foreign tobacco companies to crack.
 The company said it would build the first foreign-owned cigarette factory in South Korea, with plans to produce 400 million cigarettes a year at first, and perhaps 25 times as many after future expansion. 
 "We expect to put down roots here," said John Taylor, president of BAT Korea. 
Imported cigarettes and cigarette makers were excluded from South Korea until 1988. Since then, bureaucratic obstructions and nationalistic sentiment have frustrated attempts by British American Tobacco and other industry leaders to penetrate the market very deeply. Only 14 percent of cigarettes sold in South Korea are imports, half the share that foreign makers have gained in Japan.
British American Tobacco's share of the South Korean market is now 3.7 percent, third among non-Korean makers behind Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco. Mr. Taylor said the company hoped its new investment would win it 10 percent of the market.
British American Tobacco decided to start manufacturing in South Korea after the government said on July 1 that it was imposing a 10 percent tariff on tobacco imports, after formally ending the monopoly held by the state-controlled Korea Tobacco and Ginseng Corporation. The tariff is to rise to 20 percent next year, 30 percent in 2003 and 40 percent in 2004, a level that analysts said would sharply curtail imports. 
The decision by British American Tobacco comes as the United States and other countries are pressing South Korea to open fully its tobacco market.
But Mr. Taylor said more than trade regulations were at work; he blamed a popular streak of antiforeignism among Korean consumers for the company's past frustrations. British American Tobacco's market share slipped precipitously in the economic crisis of 1997, he said, when "Koreans turned into a 'buy Korea' mode and wouldn't buy foreign cigarettes." 
Rather than fight such attitudes directly, Mr. Taylor said British American Tobacco decided to build a plant in Sacheon City, 200 miles southeast of Seoul, where cigarettes would be "made in Korea, by Koreans and for Koreans," using Korean-grown tobacco. Some tobacco grown elsewhere would be brought in for blending into the company's leading international brands, Dunhill, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.
The decision to build the plant illustrates British American Tobacco's "long-term commitment in the Korean economy," said Hyuk Kyu Kim, the provincial governor in Sacheon City.
Officials of Korea Tobacco and Ginseng, which dominates the market, shrugged off the announcement and denied that their company used its political strength to squeeze out competition. The company "does not see any big threat" in the British American Tobacco move, said a spokesman, Ghill Ho Chun. "We are in full competition with all foreign brands. We never do anything to stop them."
Korea Tobacco and Ginseng was created in 1899 as a state monopoly on ginseng and expanded to include tobacco in 1921. It was listed publicly two years ago, and its ginseng operations were spun off; the state's remaining 60 percent stake is scheduled to be privatized by the end of the year. Its dominance of its home market has made it the eighth-largest tobacco company in the world.

HEADLINE: Gazprom Sees Room to Grow After Russian-Chinese Treaty 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
On the heels of a treaty of "friendship and cooperation" between China and Russia, Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, is planning to expand into China.
 While Gazprom, which is the world's largest gas monopoly, has been considering a venture in China for years, its interest has become more serious since the treaty was signed on July 16. Gazprom has been invited to bid on a $6 billion pipeline project in China, and the company is considering building its own pipelines to sell Siberian gas in Shanghai and Japan. 
 This week, a top Russian official said that Gazprom would coordinate gas shipments from a large Siberian gas field north of China that is currently operated by BP. BP said Gazprom would have to pay a fair price for any stake it takes in the project.
Though the announcements have been driven partly by politics, China is a giant potential market. And while it is unclear whether Gazprom's intentions will turn into concrete business projects, the outcome may give some indication of where Russia's treaty with Beijing will lead.
"More and more, Gazprom is looking towards Asia," said Philip Vorobyov, a research associate at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in the United States. "China's time is coming. Oil markets in China are ready for real commercial sales via pipeline. Gas isn't far behind."
Gazprom supplies one-quarter of the lucrative markets of Western Europe. This is easy business based on long-term, fixed-rate contracts. But as Europe prepares to promote competition into its market, Gazprom could find itself working harder for lower prices, analysts said. Gazprom's new chief executive, Aleksei Miller, said this week that the company had stopped signing long-term contracts with Europe.
Steven Dashevsky, an analyst with the Aton investment bank in Moscow, said China was "a new, radically growing market, as opposed to slow, mature growth in Europe." 
Although China now consumes only one-tenth of what Europe consumes in natural gas each year, its consumption is ready to grow as its economy expands and it replaces coal with natural gas.
Russian oil companies have already entered the Chinese market. In July, Yukos got approval for a $1.7 billion pipeline that would bring Siberian oil to China. Foreign oil companies on Russia's eastern coast are building a giant plant to liquefy gas to ease shipments to Asia.
But pitfalls abound. For one, Gazprom, burdened by billions of dollars of debt, will not have the financial might to raise the money needed for large projects.
And China remains uncommitted to buying Russian gas. Even BP, with the most developed project, has so far gotten only "a general statement of good will" -- not enough to propel the project, according to a BP spokesman in Moscow. While China is the second-largest energy-consuming country, it is also the third-largest producer. With gas reserves of its own, China may not want to yoke itself to Russian supplies.

HEADLINE: Relief for Rush Hour: Pay as You Go 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE 

 BODY:
TO avoid morning rush hour, Lim Chee Khoong gets into his BMW before 7, dropping his two children at school and making it downtown before 7:30. Kevin Chong waits until after 9:30 a.m. 
 It isn't the traffic per se that has rearranged their commutes from bedroom communities about seven and a half miles away. It's fear of road user fees high enough to make even a BMW owner think twice. 
 Anyone driving to Singapore's business district during peak hours has to pay for the privilege. A sophisticated toll-collection system, introduced about four years ago, automatically deducts charges from a prepaid smart card, mounted on the dashboard, that works like a telephone card. The charges range from about 30 cents to $3.30, depending on traffic and time of day. 
Singapore's high-tech deterrent -- known as road pricing -- is based on the theory that the best way to control traffic is through a driver's pocketbook. The strategy is catching on in the United States, where commuters spend an average of 50 work days a year sitting in traffic, according to Representative Earl Blumenauer, an Oregon Democrat. Mr. Blumenauer, who serves on the House transportation committee, likes to describe Singapore as the most advanced anticongestion laboratory in the world.
Congress, he added, is "a little slow to the party," which is another way of saying that municipal and regional officials, feeling the heat from traffic-weary voters, are leading the way. In the Houston area, for example, cars with two occupants may enter high-occupancy lanes usually reserved for cars carrying three or more during morning rush hour if they are carrying a prepaid pass; an overhead sensor deducts $2.
Thomas C. Lambert, who runs the program, said it boils down to putting a price on access, an approach that has not only generated revenue but also helped stimulate a 13.9 percent increase in car-pooling since it was adopted two and a half years ago. 
Critics say such tolls yield Lexus lanes, but in San Diego County, which adopted a pricing system on a section of Interstate in 1997, it "looks more like Lumina lanes," said Michael A. Replogle, transportation director of Environmental Defense, which has advocated economically driven pollution controls since the early 1970's. Mr. Replogle says people pay to enter a high-occupancy lane not as a luxury, but because they are hurrying, say, to pick up children at day care. 
" 'On-time lanes' would be a better term," said Dr. Janusz Supernak, a San Diego State University engineering professor who evaluated the system when it was a demonstration project. Drivers rushing to the airport should have the option of paying to get there on time, he said, and commuters are often willing to pay for the privilege of knowing how long their commute will take. 
Access to an eight-mile segment of Interstate 15, a popular commuter route to San Diego, is free to those in car pools; all others must install transponders (or readers) in their vehicles and pay fees that run from 50 cents to $4 a trip -- or upward of $2,000 a year. The fee is based on traffic density, which is relayed to the transponders by electronic detectors in the pavement. The system works so well that delays are rare, and significant numbers of people have either converted to car pools or started commuting off peak. Revenues underwrite a commuter bus service. 
Environmentalists take "a nuanced view" of road pricing, Mr. Replogle said, because it often takes so much uncertainty out of commuting that it stimulates sprawl. That was an effect in Orange and Riverside Counties in California, where traffic started running so smoothly on one controlled-access road that it encouraged commuters to move farther out, Mr. Replogle said. He prefers to think of the strategy as a way "to manage the roads we've got and to prevent more roads from being built." 
Here in Singapore, advocates believe the beauty of the idea lies in its simplicity. "You contribute to congestion, you pay for it," said Anthony Chin, an economist at the National University of Singapore, who points out that pocketbook measures help allocate the costs of lost time and increased pollution and aggravation.
It seems to work: while Asian capitals like Bangkok and Manila are mired in cars, Singapore has highways that rarely slow to a stop. In the 70's, the government tried to tame traffic with a value-added tax on vehicles that more than doubled sticker prices, but the main impact was to increase the value of second-hand cars. In 1975 the country tested a less sophisticated version of the current system, requiring drivers in the business district (an area of less than three square miles) to buy and display a one-day pass during peak hours; police officers at crossing points around the perimeter of the district snared violators. Within a year, traffic in the district dropped 45 percent.
Under the electronic system, all cars, trucks and motorcycles are required to carry transponders that pick up signals from gantries positioned over the main roads leading downtown. The smart card, treated to withstand the tropical heat, is slipped into the transponder on the dashboard. As the vehicle passes under a gantry, the transponder deducts a toll from the card; the driver doesn't even have to slow down. If the card does not have enough remaining credit or is not installed properly, a camera in the gantry snaps a shot of the rear license plate and a fine is issued by mail.
The goal is to keep traffic flowing between 28 and 40 miles per hour on highways and between 12 and 19 m.p.h. on main thoroughfares -- speeds that engineers here calculated would keep vehicles moving as efficiently as possible.
Traffic flow is monitored by a global positioning system that is also used to dispatch taxis. Every three months, the transportation authority decides whether prices need tweaking to discourage driving at certain times, said Chin Kian Keong, senior manager of public transport and road pricing. If speeds are too high, charges may be reduced.
Some businesses naturally balk. "If you have a fleet of trucks, going in and out can be quite expensive," said Tham Hock Chee, secretary-general of the Singapore Confederation of Industries. And other critics say taxis are disappearing downtown because cabbies are loath to pay for the opportunity to cruise.
Some drivers protest by "forgetting" to insert their card in the reader. Others go to great lengths to beat the system. One motorcyclist was photographed with his hand over his rear license plate. Some drivers have pulled onto sidewalks or shoulders to evade detection. The police identify about 1,000 violations a day, Mr. Chin said, imposing $5 fines on top of the toll. 
Traffic during the morning rush hour has fallen 13 percent since the system was introduced in late 1997, and by 8 percent in the evening, Mr. Chin said. Drivers spent roughly $42 million to use the roads last year, a significant drop from what they paid under the daily pass system. 
But more to the point are the savings they realized by climbing behind the wheel when other people were still asleep or at their desks. Mr. Lim and Mr. Chong, the early risers, say that between them they have banked almost $1,125 a year.

(Richard Frank Smith/Sygma) Chart/Diagram: "The Singapore Solution"Singapore uses a high-tech toll system to discourage drivers from going downtown during rush hour. Electronic eyes arrayed on gantries automatically deduct tolls from a prepaid smart card in a transponder on the dashboard - there is no need even to slow down. The charges range from about 30 cents to $3.30, depending on where the vehicle is going and when. Houston and San Diego have similar systems. If the driver "forgets" to install a card in the dashboard transponder, a camera in the gantry takes a picture of the license plate and a fine is issued by mail.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
It was not so long ago that married women had no property rights.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the editor at large of Reason Magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." E-mail: vpostrel @reason.com.

 BODY:
WHEN Anne M. Mulcahy became chief executive of Xerox two weeks ago, her promotion occasioned more than the usual notice of a corporate transition. With her ascension, women now make up 1 percent, for a total of five, of the Fortune 500 chief executives. That may not seem like much but only a generation ago, when Ms. Mulcahy was starting her career at Xerox, women were almost completely absent from even the middle ranks of corporate managers.
 If those not-so-distant days increasingly seem like ancient history, it is all the more remarkable how much the economic lives of women have changed over a longer span. A mere century and a half ago, a married American woman like Ms. Mulcahy could not normally own and control property or enter contractual agreements. If she worked outside the home, her husband legally owned all her wages. Her husband was obligated to support her. 
 Rick Geddes, an economist at Fordham University, found this lack of basic property rights hard to imagine. "I thought these laws were changed in the 1600's or something because it seemed so primitive, but the legal change was fairly recent," he said. Starting around 1850, states began passing "married women's property acts," which gave wives full property rights. By 1920, all but four states -- Arizona, Florida, Louisiana and New Mexico -- had changed their laws.
Professor Geddes and Dean Lueck, a professor of economics at Montana State University, examine the economic reasons for that change in a forthcoming article in The American Economic Review. They argue that women gained property rights as economic development and urbanization gave them more opportunities for specialized employment outside the home.
Economic analysis looks at a household as a sort of business. Family members can produce the goods and services they need for themselves or they can trade in the marketplace. In traditional economies, most production is done in the home for household use. Family members grow, preserve and cook food; they spin, weave and sew clothes. The typical person is a jack of all trades rather than a specialist.
In these traditional economies, husbands can for the most part observe and direct what their wives are doing. The skills involved also tend to be fairly general and do not require special schooling, so the investment in human capital is minimal. In this situation, husbands reap obvious advantages from owning their wives' production, with minimal disadvantages.
In effect, the husband is the owner of the household business, and the wife is an employee paid for her labor with living expenses and a share of her husband's estate when he dies.
With the growth of industrial economies and the specialized trades made possible by the large populations of cities, that situation changed. Like men, women have much greater economic opportunities, but only if they invest in their education and do well at jobs that are hard for their husbands to monitor and control. Whether they make those investments and effort depends on their incentives. If they cannot count on any direct benefit, they are less likely to do so. Under these circumstances, husbands who insist on owning everything their wives produce will find themselves worse off.
"One of the nice innovations about our paper is that it shows that husbands actually can be better off giving their wives rights," Professor Geddes said. "If you think of the total household wealth pie, that can be a lot higher when the wife has the right incentive structure, even though the husband is relinquishing some of his control over the household."
If a married woman can now be anything from a brain surgeon to a chief executive, the whole family, including her husband and her children, will enjoy the economic benefits. But she's unlikely to work hard at her profession or to pursue the necessary training in the first place, if she does not own any of her income. And, in a wrinkle the economists do not explore in their article, parents may be less likely to invest in their daughter's education if all her future earnings might be subject to the whims of a low-life husband.
Few turn-of-the-century women were brain surgeons, of course. But they did have opportunities to pursue profitable urban trades, like running shops or working in offices, where their incomes depended on effort their husbands could not easily monitor or control. Even factory work, where supervisors tracked production, was out of husbands' sight. A woman doing piecework in a garment factory, for instance, would be more likely to work as fast as she could if she herself reaped the rewards.
In the modern rights arrangement, husband and wife become essentially business partners, rather than employer and employee. Each contributes to the household's well-being and each benefits from his or her work as well as from the partnership.
By looking at when different states adopted married-women's property acts, Professor Geddes and Professor Lueck were able to tease out what seem to be the most important factors in changing the property rights of women. As their theory predicts, the rights of women expanded along with city populations, schooling and per capita wealth. A 1 percent increase in city population, for instance, increased the probability that a state would pass a married women's property act by 1.6 percent.
Interestingly, there appears to be something of a tipping point for these various factors. The economists write: "Once per capita wealth exceeds $24,000 (again in 1982 dollars), the population in cities over 100,000 exceeds 23 percent, and the rate of female schooling exceeds 73 percent, the probabilities are always greater than 50 percent and usually above 90 percent."
While historians have not found much record of political pressure to pass these acts, the statistical analysis does indicate that the existence of women's suffrage organizations may have had a positive influence. The longer a state had suffrage groups, the more likely it was to pass the property acts.
The historical record in the United States suggests that the current emphasis on women's education as a means to economic development around the world is well placed. But it also suggests a feedback effect that advocates of that approach have largely missed.
Economic development itself makes the work of women more valuable, which in turn creates pressure to give women the property rights they need to enjoy the fruits of their labor. Those rights, in turn, encourage women to contribute more to economic growth, spurring further development and greater prosperity for both women and men.

HEADLINE: TALKING POLITICS: Bushwick and Williamsburg; 
In a Poor Hispanic District, Housing Is Voters' Priority

BYLINE:  By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
In just under a decade, Rafael and Milagros Hernandez have found in New York City many of the everyday comforts that eluded them back home in the Dominican Republic: clean water, reliable electricity, steady jobs and, in the last few years, safer streets for their children.
 Like many others in the city, Democrats and Republicans alike, the Hernandezes attribute much of their good fortune to the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is stepping down Dec. 31 at the end of his second term. Six men -- four Democrats and two Republicans -- are running for the job. 
 The Hernandezes, who hope to become United States citizens shortly so they can vote this fall, do not know the names of any of the six mayoral candidates or the promises they are making. Yet, after eight years in which their lives have improved -- crime is down, subways are cleaner, the landlord has just renovated their apartment -- the couple expect the next mayor to continue to better their lives. 
The question, then, is what do they want the most?
"A three-bedroom apartment," said Mr. Hernandez, 39. 
"Cheap," Mrs. Hernandez, 34, chimed in. "Cheaper than this."
The Hernandez family pays $550 for a tiny two-bedroom apartment on Scholes Street, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Lack of space, for them, means not having a room for their boys, 11, 10 and 3, to play indoors on cold days, a place to put a desk for them to do homework or even to put a table to gather around for family dinner.
In their quest for a bigger and better apartment, the Hernandezes are hardly alone in this working-class slice of northwest Brooklyn, the area in the shadow of the J, M and Z subway lines in Bushwick and Williamsburg. 
In dozens of interviews, residents talked about what they expected from the next mayor. Their biggest concern by far was housing: clean, spacious, cheap homes, free of mice and roaches. 
It is a common request in a city where some people live in apartments that elsewhere would be considered oversized closets. But it is a particularly vexing problem for Bushwick and Williamsburg, where 70 percent of the population is Hispanic and many are on public assistance. 
"I represent one of the poorest districts in the state," said Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, whose district, the 53rd, includes Bushwick, Williamsburg and parts of Greenpoint. "Whoever is the next mayor of New York City needs to make a real commitment to delivering services to minorities in poor communities."
A little more than half of the residents in Mr. Lopez's district are registered to vote, but only 29 percent did so in the last mayoral election, compared with 40 percent citywide. Because so many of the potential Hispanic voters there are not registered, the 53rd District is ripe territory to nurture one of the fastest-growing segments of New York City: young Latinos who have inherited no political allegiances from their parents and whose loyalty is up for grabs. Mr. Giuliani did not carry the district in 1997, but it was close. He lost to Ruth Messinger by only 315 votes.
Many longtime residents in the district are Puerto Rican, but those who have arrived in recent years are from all over the Americas, including the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Mexico. The district is not devoid of diversity: 13 percent of the population is non-Hispanic white, 8 percent is black and 5 percent Asian.
Mr. Lopez, a Democrat, boasts that, on his watch, 1,800 homes and apartments subsidized by the city and state have been built, with 500 more due to be built soon. 
"And we can't keep up with the demand," he said. 
Just a few years ago, few people wanted to live in the district. Crime was high. Drug dealers were recruiting customers alongside mothers walking their children to school. There were 1,500 abandoned buildings or empty lots in the area, the result of years of arson and looting that began after the citywide blackout in July 1977, Mr. Lopez said. The empty lots were a magnet for youth gangs, drug users and rats.
Today, he said, all but 50 of the lots have given way to new homes. Drugs, though still present, are no longer part of the daily landscape. For the most part, youth gangs have been chased away by aggressive policing. Many Bushwick residents said they were pleased that they knew the name or face of the police officer who patrols their streets every day on foot.
But some residents say they know them too well. Carlos Ramos, 34, was sitting with a friend on the steps of a building on Central Avenue. Asked what he wanted from the next mayor, Mr. Ramos quickly said, "To keep the cops off of us."
Mr. Ramos, who works as the manager of a health club, said the police had stopped him countless times. He was arrested once on trespassing charges, but those were dropped. He believes he is a victim of some sort of profiling. He wears a ponytail, a gold chain around his neck and gold hoops in his ears. He has a tattoo on his beefy left arm. 
Echoing the comments of many of his neighbors, Mr. Ramos said he was not sure whom he would vote for this year. That he is Puerto Rican and a Democrat, he said, does not necessarily mean that he would vote for Fernando Ferrer, the Puerto Rican Bronx borough president who, polls show, is a favorite among Hispanics in the city. Some of the candidates have visited churches in Bushwick on Sundays this summer, but Mr. Ramos has neither seen them nor been inspired by their messages. 
"I've got to see what they each bring to the table," Mr. Ramos said. "There are too many issues: schools are overcrowded, kids have nothing to do, there are not enough parks for kids to play in. Meanwhile, everybody is trying to make a better life for themselves, and they can't."
Ramon Rodriguez, 65, has lived and worked in a corner building at Broadway and Whipple Street in Williamsburg for 24 years. He runs a bridal shop on the second floor and lives with his son, Raymond, 14, on the third floor.
Mr. Rodriguez, who says he votes in every election, is distraught at the slow pace of progress. "Why don't they give away the old, abandoned buildings?" he asked. "The private sector can create housing for those who need it and we won't have to look at those abandoned lots anymore. Things are better than 10 years ago, yes, but not yet where they should and could be."
The improved neighborhoods and drop in crime have had an unintended effect, Mr. Rodriguez said. In some areas of the district, rents have gone up, forcing out residents whose incomes did not keep pace.
"Those who can, leave the neighborhood," he said. "Those who stay, don't have anything. So we are always dealing with the poorest of the poor."
Vicente Tarrax says he has no choice but to stay in a dilapidated, tiny apartment on Wilson Street in Bushwick. Retired at 65, after 27 years as a seaman, he said he had been unable to get his building's landlord to fix the water leaks that have stained his walls a dull gray and worsened his chronic arthritis. Last winter, the heat was cut off, he said.
In his shirt pocket Mr. Tarrax keeps pictures of his apartment, which he shows to anyone who cares to look at them. He said he had gone to several municipal offices looking for help, but to no avail. Still, Mr. Tarrax said, he likes what Mr. Giuliani has done for the city and for Bushwick.
"They say he has shown excessive force in dealing with the problems of the city, and that the police are out of control," he said. "But I have been to just about every country in the world and I have seen what an out-of-control police can do to its people, and this is not it."
Still, Mr. Tarrax said, he wished he had a better apartment to go home to after his daily game of dominoes and his occasional fishing outings.
"If I had the money, I'd never return to that place," he said.
Carlos Vega, 29, works two jobs as a security guard, in a public hospital and for a private security company. He said he and his wife, who works as a waitress, can hardly make ends meet with two children and a monthly rent of $800 for a two-bedroom apartment on Leonard Street in Williamsburg.
"And we've been told that it's going up to $1,200 at the end of January," Mr. Vega said, pulling family-size cooking-oil containers and liquid laundry detergent from his car. "How can they expect working families to continue to live in these neighborhoods?"
Mr. Vega, who said he disliked Mr. Giuliani for cutting the budgets of the public hospitals, says the mayor has done little for his community. Yes, the streets are cleaner and safer, but in the park where his children play, maintenance workers sweep up dozens of empty crack vials every morning. And his neighborhood fared less well than the rest of the city in the economic boom of the 1990's, he said.
Carmen Rivera, 40, agrees. A lifelong resident of public housing in Williamsburg, Ms. Rivera said she wished she could move out of the project, where she raised two children, now 19 and 16, and is raising a 2-year-old, but she cannot afford it.
"There is more housing, yes, but people can't pay for it," said Ms. Rivera, who works as an after-school-program coordinator in a public school and as a supervisor in a city-financed summer camp.
Ms. Rivera, who says she plans to vote but does not yet know for whom, has other concerns besides housing. She said the state of the public schools sometimes kept her awake at night.
"Teachers have lost all control of the students," she said, as she kept an eye on her charges playing in Lindsay Park, at Leonard and Boerum Streets. "And if you can't control the classroom, you can't teach. It's not like it was when I sent my two oldest to school."
Marlene Burey, 43, a nurse's assistant who just bought her first home in Bushwick, said her main concern was the poor state of the public schools. With four children, all of them still in school, Ms. Burey said she was particularly worried about the quality of the teachers.
"Giuliani didn't do enough for teachers," she said. "They get so little money that the best teachers get discouraged and go elsewhere." She suggested raising teachers' salaries.
Ms. Burey, who was born in Jamaica, plans to vote for the first time in this election, but does not yet know for whom. 
Ms. Rivera does not have a favorite either, but may not need to. She has other plans. Asked what the next mayor should do for the schools, Ms. Rivera shrugged and said: "Hopefully, I won't be here to see what the next mayor will do. By the time my son is ready for school, I plan to be in Florida."

HEADLINE: School-Building Switch Rejoins What Was Split 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The idea of taking the Board of Education out of the business of school construction first came to Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy some seven years ago when Ramon C. Cortines was chancellor and Mr. Levy headed a special panel on improving school maintenance.
 "I urged him to give the capital planning function away," Mr. Levy said Tuesday. "I told him that he didn't come here to be the chancellor of maintenance; get it off your plate." 
 Now, Mr. Levy is taking his own advice. On Tuesday, after noting that the school construction budget overrun appears to have grown by nearly $1 billion, he recommended switching all responsibilities for the planning, building and renovation of schools from the board's Division of School Facilities to the School Construction Authority, an independent agency.
In doing so, he would reunite two functions, the planning and the execution of new school construction, that were split in 1988 when the Legislature created the construction authority. Such a move would create one agency that could be held responsible for building schools according to a budget and opening them on time. But it is far from clear that such a move would solve the difficulties that have plagued the school construction effort for decades. 
While several other large cities or states have drawn on New York's example of setting up a separate agency to control school construction, many of them have lines of accountability that are clearer and more direct than New York's, where power is shared equally by the chancellor, the mayor and the governor. The chancellor is one of the agency's trustees, and the other two are appointees of the mayor and the governor. 
Whether Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki agree to the chancellor's plan could well depend on whether the chancellor is willing to turn over some authority. Ultimately, any discussion about where the responsibility for planning and budgeting for school construction should lie turns into a discussion about the governance of the school system as a whole.
Since he took the job, Mr. Levy has steadfastly refused to comment on whether he believes the mayor should control the school system, a change that is supported by both Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki. At the least, the chancellor might be pressured to lend his support to the idea that the mayor should control the school construction budget.
Yesterday, Mr. Levy said he believed the consolidation of the school facilities division and the construction authority could be accomplished through a "memorandum of understanding" between the two, and therefore would not require legislation. The law that created the construction authority in 1988 called for such a memorandum. But one was never agreed to by the two agencies.
"This originally was all one agency," Mr. Levy said yesterday. "It was pulled apart as a legislative matter. What I'm proposing is, go closer back to that original effort, and bond these two things together so that they'll function collaboratively, cooperatively."
Mayor Giuliani said yesterday that he agreed with the idea of transferring much of the responsibilities of the school facilities division to the construction authority. But, he added, the removal of Patricia Zedalis as head of the division of school facilities, announced on Tuesday, is not likely to solve the problem.
"I also think there is a degree of scapegoating going on," Mr. Giuliani said. "These decisions were not all made by one person. It may well be the case that the person selected to take the responsibility was really just carrying out their orders."
Asked yesterday about Ms. Zedalis, Mr. Levy said, "This is not about hanging anyone out to dry."
Rather, he said, "It's about putting a better management structure in place and making sure that the people being put into these positions have real accountability."
Mr. Levy appears to be conceding that there is far more to the construction cost overruns than simply the rising cost of construction in a booming economy, the rationale that board officials previously used for much of the new expense. 
New estimates from the construction authority show that it would need as much as $2.8 billion in additional money to complete the projects outlined through June 2004. 
Details about the new estimates will be released in the near future, Mr. Levy said, and it is likely that, in the absence of additional financing, some projects will have to be delayed until 2005 or later.
Whether the construction authority will be any better at estimating costs or adhering to a budget, however, is also far from certain. As long as the construction authority answers to two elected officials and one appointed one, there will remain a lack of strict accountability for decisions about school construction.

HEADLINE: Senate Leader to Challenge Bush Today on Missile Defense 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, plans to continue his challenge to President Bush on missile defense by accusing the president of taking a "single-minded approach" to national security, according to an advance text of a speech Mr. Daschle is to deliver on Thursday.
 The South Dakota Democrat argued in the speech that Mr. Bush's policies increase the risk of nuclear weapons spreading to countries that do not now have them and uses money that ought to be spent on more pressing security threats. 
 Mr. Daschle's remarks, to be made in a speech to the Woodrow Wilson Center , are part of an effort by prominent Democrats to portray Mr. Bush as a unilateralist. They set the stage for a struggle in September when Senate committees, under the control of Democrats, begin considering Mr. Bush's request for $343.3 billion for military programs for the new fiscal year, including $8.3 billion for missile defense.
Trying to paint Democrats as more responsive than Mr. Bush to the broader needs of the American military, Mr. Daschle said the $8.3 billion would represent a 57 percent increase for missile defense, at the expense of other security programs.
"We support an increase in both the Pentagon budget and in missile defense," he said, according to an advance text of the speech. "But a 57 percent increase this year -- along with the prospect of hundreds of billions of dollars in future years -- would cannibalize the personnel and force structure that deal with the threats we are likely to face."
Last month Mr. Daschle, who as the Senate majority leader is now the most powerful Democrat in Washington, was rebuked by the White House for calling Mr. Bush's foreign policy isolationist just as the president was embarking on an overseas trip. Republicans accused Mr. Daschle of ignoring the maxim that "politics stops at the water's edge.
But Mr. Daschle has not backed off. Noting that the administration has recently found fault with six international agreements, he said, "Instead of asserting our leadership, we are abdicating it."
With the cold war over, he argued, "Fear of a common enemy no longer keeps our allies by our side. Our allies will follow us only if we use our unparalleled strength and prosperity to advance common interests. Only then will our power inspire respect instead of resentment." 
As Democrats have stepped up such charges, the president's senior advisers have replied that the administration would apply the standard of American national interest in determining whether to support or reject international accords.
In the case of global warming, administration officials say, for example, that the pact would endanger the American economy and harm global financial health. On relations with Russia, the administration has stated that the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty is outdated and stands in the way of coupling historic reductions in nuclear arsenals with a new defense against ballistic missiles.
While Mr. Daschle said in the text of his speech that Democrats could under "the right circumstances," support a limited missile defense system, he accused Mr. Bush of putting far too much emphasis on a defense shield and of looking at complex relationships with Russia and China through the distorting prism of missile defense alone.
"What else could explain for example, President Bush's personal embrace of Russia's president Vladimir Putin -- while avoiding any public mention of Putin's crackdown on Russia's free press and their continuing atrocities in Chechnya?" he said.
Setting the stage for a battle over Pentagon priorities, Mr. Daschle described the chief threats to the United States as coming not from intercontinental ballistic missiles, but from "biological and chemical weapons and bombs that could be smuggled in a cargo container, bus or backpack" as well as attacks on such infrastructure as computer systems.
"National missile defense," Mr. Daschle said, "is the most expensive possible response to the least likely threat we face." 
His speech cited a list of tradeoffs that could be made if Congress provides the missile defense program with only a 10 percent increase in the next fiscal year, freeing up $2.5 billion for other programs that he says will address "more imminent, more immediate threats."
Among his recommendations were restored funding to help Russia control and destroy nuclear weapons, training for emergency workers to deal with chemical or biological attack, an increased counterterrorism budget, reinforced border patrols, increased research into cruise missile defense, and funding to help control North Korea's nuclear fuel production and re-engage it on ending its missile program.
"These are all here and now threats," he said, "and we could fund all of these programs at levels necessary to start addressing them without shortchanging our troops, the weapons systems they rely on or missile defense."

HEADLINE: Crouching Rowers, Spectacular Dragons, in Races in Queens 

BYLINE:  By SANDEE BRAWARSKY 

 BODY:
The 250-meter dragon-boat race doesn't take much more than a New York minute. In a long, narrow boat with a colorful dragon head at the bow and a spiky tail at the stern, 18 paddlers, seated two by two, dig their wooden paddles into the murky waters of Meadow Lake. Forcefully they pull back, as a 19th team member pounds a drum to keep their rhythm, and a 20th steers at the back with a long oar. They aim to move in perfect sync, propelling the boat across the finish line like an arrow. 
 This weekend Meadow Lake, created as part of the 1939 World's Fair in what is now Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, is to become an international aquatic racecourse as part of the 11th annual Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival in New York. More than 1,000 men and women on 93 teams in several divisions will paddle at lengths of 250, 500 and 1,000 meters. The races run toward the north end of the lake, where the Unisphere is always in view. The Open Championship Race, offering a $10,000 cash prize, is scheduled for Sunday, rain or shine. 
 Onshore dragon dancers will lead a parade of teams tomorrow morning, opening the festival. Henry J. Stern, New York City parks commissioner, and Jacqueline Ann Willis, Hong Kong's commissioner to the United States, will have the honor of painting the red eyes on a fabric dragon, to symbolically bring to life the hand-crafted dragons attached to the boats. The activities surrounding the races reflect the ethnic diversity of the contestants, about half of whom are of Chinese descent. In between cheering on the boaters, spectators can hear Vallenato music of Colombian folklore or the songs of the New York Boys Choir; watch kung fu demonstrations; snack on Italian sausages, sushi or rice dumplings; and learn basic Chinese calligraphy and paper cutting.
This is a festival with a 2,000-year history. In the third century B.C., Qu Yuan, a minister in the Chinese kingdom of Chu, was popular among the people but disliked by the king, who banished him. During his exile he wandered, writing poetry expressing his love for his country. Soon after hearing that the capital of Chu was invaded in 278 B.C., Qu Yuan jumped into the Mi Lo River and drowned himself.
According to legend, local fishermen raced out onto the river to try to save him but couldn't. To distract the fish from devouring his body, they thrashed their paddles in the water and beat drums. They also threw rice dumplings to honor his spirit (and feed the fish). The dragon-boat races, held in many cities in China and around the world, commemorate the rescue attempts and honor this man, who was perhaps the first known of China's great poets.
In Hong Kong, Tuen Ng, or Dragon Boat Festival, is a public holiday, with many people drawn to the island's shores to watch the races. Several of the Hong Kong-born New Yorkers who are to race this weekend recall being part of the festival as youngsters, learning about Qu Yuan in school and especially eating jong, or rice dumplings. Although according to the lunar calendar the date of the race usually falls in June, the New York festival, the largest of several in the United States, is held in August because of weather.
Dragon boats, ubiquitous in Asia, are less recognizable in New York waters. But commuters on the No. 7 train regularly pass a stained-glass mural depicting such a boat at the 33rd Street station in Sunnyside, Queens. The teak vessels, made by hand in Hong Kong and modeled after centuries-old fishing boats, weigh 2,000 pounds each. Before the festival the boats are repainted, some with dragon scales on their sides.
Depending on the number of teams entered in a specific division, there may be preliminary heats before the finals. Usually four boats race at once. The shortest distance, 250 meters, takes less than a minute from start to finish line. The 1,000-meter race takes about four minutes. The races are often very close, and Ian Brooks, known as "the voice of the New York Road Runners Club," is to comment on the races and announce the winners above the roar of the crowd, expected to number more than 30,000. 
Teams come from all over New York City, as well as from around the United States and Canada, including a group of police officers and auxiliary police and corporate-sponsored squads and athletic clubs. Beginners are welcome on many teams.
Some of the more advanced New York City squads also race in the national championship in Philadelphia and the international championship in Hong Kong. The minimum age for racers is 18; there's no maximum, and some participants are over 65. Among aficionados there's a lot of talk -- and wishful thinking -- that dragon-boat racing will be named a demonstration sport at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. 
"Timing, timing, timing" is what most competitors say when asked about the necessary skills behind successful dragon-boat racing. They also mention strength and endurance, but there are no individual heroes, and no one tries to stand out.
"During the race you're all beating as one heart," Good Jean Lau, a member of the New York Wall Street Dragons, explains. "You need to mirror the stroke of the person diagonally in front of you. And you need to trust that the people in front are going to be in sync with the people in front of them. Competition keeps your spirit going."
Mrs. Lau, a dual-language resource specialist at P.S. 1 in Chinatown, who has taken part every year and is now active in getting young people involved in the sport, adds, "Once dragon boats are in your blood, it's hard to let go."
Each team has its own techniques; some raise their paddles out of the water with a twist, while some catch (hit the water) more aggressively. Kin Ng, coach and manager of the DCH team, named for Dah Chong Hong USA, its corporate sponsor, encourages team members to breathe at the same rate and to pull and then relax between strokes.
Mr. Ng, a prosecutor in the Brooklyn district attorney's office who used to race, explains that the people in the first three rows are technically the best paddlers, and they set an even, consistent pace. At the center are the largest team members, who have the longest strokes. ("They're the engine," he said.) The people in the back have the most aggressive strokes.
"It's a sprint race for the most part," he said. "The whole thing revolves around getting a good start so you can pull ahead early on and keep a psychological edge."
"Beside the sport itself, it's a tie for me back to my Chinese heritage," Mr. Ng said about dragon-boat racing. Two years ago he returned to Hong Kong for the first time in 20 years for a competition. In Chinese culture dragons are not evil, he noted, but symbolize energy, benevolence and good luck. "Dragons originated from water and contain mystical power," he said. "They bring good luck."
Raymond Fan, director of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in New York, explained that the Dragon Boat Festival was introduced to New York City in 1991 "as a project to raise Hong Kong's profile in New York City." Mr. Fan, who grew up in Hong Kong, organized the first festival, which was held on the Hudson River, with 3 boats, 10 teams and training help from the New York Fire Department. But the river was busy, and the water was choppy, "not conducive to very proper competition," he said, so the festival was moved to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.
In 1994 the festival was spun off as a separate project from the Trade Office, and the following year Henry Wan, a real-estate developer and builder in Flushing who sits on the boards of several community groups and has been involved with the festival since its beginning, was named chairman.
If Mr. Fan is the festival's father, then Mr. Wan, also born in Hong Kong, is its doting uncle and ambassador. Every Sunday since early June he has been out at the dock at Meadow Lake, coordinating practice for the teams. "Momentum is growing for the sport," he said, "and the festival gets larger every year."
On a recent Sunday, Team Library, sponsored by the Queens Borough Public Library, emerged from the water after a rigorous session. Rob Waters, the team's captain and steersman for the last six years, who serves as director of capital program management and facilities planning the library, was wearing the team's signature black tank top festooned with a dragon and splashed with lake water. He said he always tried to keep his teammates focused on working together.
"This is a venue with all the right stuff," he added, "without all the rancor and ego-driven competitiveness that goes along with athletics." 
When asked about team rituals, Nils Johnson, president of AsiaTone, a New York company that sponsors three crews under the name Xtreme NY, responded as he headed toward the boat for practice, "Our ritual is to go out for dim sum every Sunday." The only non-Chinese squad member, he is now his second year paddling, and he's "totally hooked," he said. "This is killing my summer in the Hamptons," he added. "Now it's summer in Flushing Meadows."
To get a closer look at the paddlers in action, I rode out on a motorized chase boat with Eric Young, a law student who has worked for the festival for several years. To keep up with the dragon boats, Mr. Young revved up the boat's eight-horsepower engine to full throttle.
"C'mon guys, this boat is not moving," a drummer called out to her teammates, who responded by paddling harder and faster, trying not to get much water into the boat, which would slow them down.
Several team members had dragon tattoos on their upper arms; some had them on their backs, peeking from behind life preservers. Since this was the beginning of their practice cycle, their motions were not yet fluid. Their paddles had Hong Kong spelled out in Chinese and English on opposite sides of the blades. Over the sounds of the team members' shouting and their paddles slicing the water, Mr. Young explained, "It's a lot harder than it looks." To this summer camp canoeist it never looked anything but difficult. 
A few New York teams own their own boats and practice in the nearby World's Fair Marina, sometimes five times a week during the season. In the parking lot on a recent evening the members of another team, Women in Canoe, in trim uniforms, did stretches and a kind of group meditation before boarding their boat. As they set off, their boat glided on the water, skimming the surface. Picking up speed, they created a wake of white water in front and behind.
Among the members of Women in Canoe are a banker, a detective, a lawyer, a doctor and a newscaster. "It's like a sisterhood," Elaine Roman, the team captain, explained. "We watch out for each other on and off the boat." 
Last weekend in Philadelphia's dragon boat race, they participated as the United States National Women's Crew, and this weekend they are to compete on Meadow Lake.
To passengers in the low-flying airplanes approaching La Guardia Airport the boats might resemble centipedes, but those creatures lack elegance. The dragon boats move with an unusual mixture of power and grace. My father, a Navy veteran who served on P.T. boats in World War II, came to watch the practice and was "impressed by the amazing speed" of the 18 synchronized paddlers. 
New Yorkers who want to begin their celebration today might head to May May Chinese Gourmet Food Center, at 35 Pell Street in Chinatown, where the Hong-Kong born owner, John Hung, prepares 15 varieties of jong, the traditional rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves and tied beautifully with colored string. Sticky rice surrounds a savory filling, which varies according to the Chinese province. The most popular variety is from Hong Kong, with peanuts, green beans, egg yolk and pork. Several types of May May's jong will also be available at the festival.
Mr. Hung learned the intricate process of making jong from his parents, who once owned a shop in Hong Kong. He has taught a worker to prepare the delicacies. I watched his hands masterly combining ingredients, forming and folding the leaf packet and tying it. It takes less time to win a dragon-boat race.

HEADLINE: Italy Reports Slowdown In Economy As Sales Fall 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
Evidence mounted today that Europe is slowing down, as Italy reported that its economy contracted in the second quarter from the first quarter. The figures signaled that a decline in manufacturing and farming began to infect other areas, producing the first quarter-to-quarter fall in output in three years.
 Over all, gross domestic product in Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro region after Germany and France, declined 0.1 percent from the first quarter, the government statistical office reported, as falling demand from the rest of Europe and the United States took its toll. Year to year, output grew 2 percent. 
 Italy is struggling in particular with weakening sales to two major trade partners, Germany and the United States. The seriousness of the slowdown in Germany became evident on Tuesday when it reported a decline in industrial output in June. That followed a report of a fall in industrial orders, suggesting that economic activity is softening.
"The impact of the external slowdown probably became more immediate during the second quarter," said Carmen Nuzzo, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney, of Italy's contraction. She said the figures were "definitely not very surprising," given a drop in first-quarter manufacturing in Italy, and the fact that the second quarter had fewer calendar days, a factor not compensated for in today's figures. 
The difficulties in Italy and Germany are increasing the pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates and stoke growth. The bank has been loath to do that for fear of unleashing inflation. But in its monthly report today, the bank gave what some analysts saw as a hint that its thinking was shifting. The bank noted that "risks relating to the outlook for growth in the second half of the year remain sizable" and said it would "closely monitor developments" that might lead it to change its mind about the right level of interest rates.
Italian stocks fell for a second consecutive day. The benchmark Mib30 index fell 1 percent, to 36,491.
Italian companies rely heavily on exports. The last downturn in the economy came after the 1998 meltdown in emerging markets in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Fiat Auto, the car division of Italy's biggest corporation, has said it will furlough roughly one-third of its 50,000 workers in Italy for a week in September because of slowing demand. Pirelli, the cable and tire maker, announced an unexpected fall in profits in the second quarter and said the third quarter would be difficult as well. 
Some economists now look to domestic consumption to buoy Italy's economy. Vincenzo Guzzo of Morgan Stanley said "in this kind of environment, it's hard to think of a pickup in investment spending," but that spending on services seemed to be holding up. 
Today's gloomy figures cast doubt on a pledge of tax cuts by the fledgling government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, which was based on a forecast of 2.4 percent growth this year. Economists now expect 2 percent at most. While small-scale tax relief may be possible, Mr. Guzzo said, major cuts will probably have to wait until late 2002.

HEADLINE: Even Paradise Needs Basic Maintenance 

BYLINE:  By Fred Moody; Fred Moody is the author, most recently, of "The Visionary Position."

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
Seattle, long a self-styled paradise, is in serious trouble. The clearest manifestation is its traffic jams. Perennially at or near the top of various "most livable cities" lists throughout the 1980's and 1990's, Seattle placed second this spring on the national list of cities with the worst traffic, after chronic offender Los Angeles. The city's 20-year-long Silicon Rush has sent the population skyrocketing, with huge suburbs sprawling east from Lake Washington, spawned largely by Microsoft and its tech-industry descendants.
 The Highway 520 bridge connecting Seattle with the massive suburban population across the lake is 38 years old, too small for current traffic, and crumbling. Its sister bridge to the south, a floating bridge on pontoons, had to sink some years ago before anyone cared enough to repair it. The city has been so intent on building cyberspace that it has failed to notice the collapse of its physical space. 
 This summer, the State Legislature, facing traffic so bad that entire political campaigns are now run on "the transportation mess," was forced to show it recognized the problem. (Boeing, in moving its headquarters to Chicago this year, cited the horrendous traffic as one of its discontents.) But every proposed solution runs into well-organized opposition: Conservatives oppose spending on mass transit, liberals oppose bigger freeways. And since the State Legislature is virtually evenly divided -- the House has 49 Democrats and 49 Republicans, and Democrats hold a one-seat majority in the Senate -- nothing much ever gets accomplished.
Gridlock on the highways has become a metaphor for political gridlock, which has multifarious causes. Most of Washington is rural, and the rural residents care little for the problems in the Seattle area. Seattleites, for their part, are oblivious to the needs and problems in rural Washington, where people remain relatively poor, the technology boom having passed them by.
But the essential problem is that no one here is willing to pay for anything. During the biggest economic boom the Northwest has ever experienced, antitax sentiment has become positively New Hampshireesque. In 1999, voters approved Initiative 695, which repealed the longstanding motor vehicle excise tax that had provided nearly all of the state's transportation funding. Since then transportation repair and construction have ground to a halt.
The consequence of that spasm of antitax madness is that politicians in both parties now are terrified of taking responsibility for raising taxes to do anything. 
Washington's governor, Gary Locke, and some lawmakers were willing to push for a tax package that would have raised $8.5 billion over 10 years for road and bridge improvements. Governor Locke even called the Legislature into special session three times this year but got nowhere -- a state record for political futility. The public got wind of the tax increases involved -- a 9-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax and a few other fees -- and the package was killed.
It was really no surprise that state leaders declined to levy taxes that they know are necessary. But anti-tax sentiment is only part of the reason for Seattle's fall from grace. Far worse has been a form of environmentalism here that is little more than denial. Attempts to address population growth have been resisted by antigrowth forces moved more by a refusal to acknowledge growth than by a genuine sense of environmental stewardship.
Underlying this denial is a profound sense of entitlement. We've lived with the idea of free things -- good water, natural splendor, abundant exploitable resources like fish and timber. Even the 1990's technology revolution that pumped billions into the local economy was in large part a something-for-nothing phenomenon. Actually paying for public goods -- like a functioning highway system -- now seems like a quaint idea.
In some ways, the collapse of the transportation effort last month is instructive. Ron Sims, the King County executive, says that this state "operates on government by catastrophe." But that's not entirely correct. For a long time, it was government by good fortune. What set this region apart for liveability was not that the politicians and citizens were enlightened (though some were); it was that Seattle and its suburbs were so much younger than the rest of the country.
In time, the Northwest's adolescence was bound to end, and the crumbling roads are proof positive that it has.

HEADLINE: Unrest Intensifies in Struggle to Control Zimbabwe Farms 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: CHINHOYI, Zimbabwe, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
With the government vowing to step up its seizures of white-owned farms and Western countries weighing punitive steps, tension has flared across Zimbabwe in recent days, and this city north of the capital has been one of the hottest flash points.
 Clashes on Monday night between white farmers and poor blacks who had occupied a farm touched off the latest surge in tensions, and landed 22 white men, all but one of them farmers, in jail here, charged with causing public violence. 
 Today, as more than 100 government loyalists chanted angrily outside the courthouse where the men who had been arrested were to appear, dozens of white families were fleeing their homesteads after confrontations with black squatters, the Commercial Farmers Union said.
At least four houses were looted and at least two white farmers were shot at, said David Rockingham-Gill, regional executive of the farmers union. 
"Nothing has been worse than today, not in this province," Mr. Rockingham-Gill said.
George Charamba, a spokesman for President Robert Mugabe, said the increase in confrontations in recent days was driven by the white farmers in a ploy to win sympathy in the United States and among the Commonwealth nations. 
Foreign ministers from several Commonwealth countries will meet next week in Nigeria to try to make some progress on Zimbabwe before a meeting of heads of government scheduled for October in Australia. 
"What they want to do is convince those ministers that there is lawlessness, that there is violence, and what's more that they are victims of that violence," Mr. Charamba said in an interview tonight. "Unfortunately that trick is not working because it's quite clear, in all the cases, that the commercial farmers did initiate the confrontations. These guys have been coexisting for months and it's just now that you have this."
But opponents of the president said another wave of government-sanctioned intimidation is under way in Zimbabwe as the government finds itself under mounting international pressure and the economy founders ahead of next year's presidential election.
"The weaker they feel, the more aggressive they become," said David Coltart, a member of Parliament from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, "and I think this escalation in violence is a result of them feeling increasingly isolated internationally. I think they're realizing that the net is closing in terms of the Commonwealth, in terms of South Africa losing patience. And they've decided that the only way out of this jam is to provoke a hostile response from white farmers."
The confrontations come as the government has pledged to step up its program to redistribute white-owned land to poor blacks. After saying for months that the state planned to acquire about 12 million acres of white-owned land, Agriculture Minister Joseph Made announced last week that the government now plans to take 20 million acres, and warned commercial farmers to avoid antagonizing the black squatters occupying white farms.
The first clash erupted here on Monday, when a group of white farmers came to the aid of a colleague who they believed was being attacked by a black squatter, the farmers union said. In the melee, both blacks and whites apparently were hurt, and the sight of the injured blacks in the state-owned media prompted a spate of revenge attacks this week by supporters of the governing party on whites around Chinhoyi.
Today, as they had done the day before, when they chased away local and foreign journalists, young party loyalists barred all reporters but those working for the state media from the proceedings in the courthouse.
A journalist from The Daily News, Zimbabwe's only privately owned daily newspaper, fled in a car when several young party activists walked toward him. A foreign journalist, who was surrounded and menaced by the same men, had his notes torn up and was warned by a policeman watching the encounter that he was "going to be assaulted."
While most of the people attacked and killed in Zimbabwe's political violence over the last 18 months have been black, the targeting of whites has stirred particular interest in the West, and in the coming months Zimbabwe could find itself even more isolated.
In the United States, the House is expected to take up legislation, recently passed by the Senate, that could freeze overseas assets and restrict the travel of Mr. Mugabe and some of his closest aides while setting strict conditions for resuming the international assistance Zimbabwe desperately needs.
Zimbabwe has criticized the bill as an attack on its sovereignty, and Mr. Charamba, the presidential spokesman, said the world underestimates the determination and fortitude of this former British colony.
"The psychology here is a psychology of struggle," Mr. Charamba said, "a psychology that we may have to go through some of the same circumstances we endured during our liberation struggle."

HEADLINE: Initial Claims For Joblessness Rose Last Week 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
After a three-week decline, new claims for unemployment insurance rose last week.
 The number of workers filing new applications for jobless benefits increased by a seasonally adjusted 33,000, to 385,000, for the workweek ended Aug. 4, the Labor Department reported today. 
That pushed claims to their highest level since mid-July. 
 Claims had fallen sharply in the prior three weeks, offering hope that the rash of layoffs seen in recent months might be moderating.
This time of year, the claims figures usually bounce around a lot as automobile plants temporarily shut down to retool for new models and then call workers back, economists say. That volatility can make seasonal adjustments difficult, analysts say.
Given that, economists tend to focus on another number as a barometer of the labor market's health, the more stable four-week moving average of jobless claims. The moving average, which smooths out week-to-week fluctuations, fell last week to 380,000, the lowest level since the end of March, a sign that layoffs could be easing. The four-week moving average has been down three weeks in a row.
In an effort to avert the first recession in the United States in 11 years, the Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates six times this year, totaling 2.75 percentage points. Many analysts say the Fed will cut rates again at its next meeting Aug. 21. 
The yearlong economic slowdown has led companies to scale back production and capital investment and lay off workers. In July, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent as businesses cut fewer workers than in June.
For the workweek ended July 28, 13 states and territories reported an increase in jobless claims, while 39 reported a decrease. The state data lag the national figures by a week and are not seasonally adjusted.

Retailers' Sales Rise 2.4% As Shoppers Grow Cautious
In malls and Main Streets across the country, shoppers appear to be closely watching how and where they spend their money, with retail sales rising just 2.4 percent over all in July.
 Discount retailers posted the strongest gains, with Wal-Mart and Kmart doing better than expected, but other merchants had disappointing sales. Gap, for example, said that sales in stores open at least a year fell 12 percent, steeper than expected. Page C3.

HEADLINE: Ovitz, Hollywood Giant of a Few Years Ago, Comes on Hard Times 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
Three years ago Michael S. Ovitz, one of Hollywood's titans in the 1980's and early 90's, formed a management company to produce films and television programs as well as represent stars, directors, writers and sports figures. The venture was intended to place Mr. Ovitz firmly back in the Hollywood firmament after several years of setbacks.
 Today, Mr. Ovitz is facing serious economic strains that threaten the future of his project and represent personal and financial embarrassment to a power broker who was once feared in Hollywood and could seemingly do no wrong. 
 Mr. Ovitz -- who committed as much as $100 million of his own money to the company, the Artists Management Group -- may have lost tens of millions of dollars. 
The long-rumored financial problems became public late Wednesday when 18 employees of the television arm of the venture, the Artists Television Group, were laid off.
The dismissals, of half the group's employees, touched off speculation among network executives that the unit -- which had been designed in some ways as the financial heart of the overall operation -- was withering after Mr. Ovitz had failed to find investors for it. He had been seeking at least $150 million to finance just the television division.
What went wrong for Mr. Ovitz? According to rivals in talent management and to entertainment industry executives, Mr. Ovitz miscalculated the high rate of failure in the television business -- especially in today's shifting market, and spent huge amounts of money on deals and expenses without creating a sturdier foundation at the company.
Mr. Ovitz has lost his powerful perch, at least for the moment, and over the years he has made numerous enemies who are almost eager to see him fail. No power broker in Hollywood matches Mr. Ovitz for the number of powerful people -- whether it is Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company; David Geffen, the entertainment industry billionaire; Ron Meyer, the president and chief operating officer of Universal Studios, or the partners at Creative Artists Agency -- who actively dislike him.
His financial straits are indeed embarrassing for Mr. Ovitz, a founder of the Creative Artists Agency, less than a decade ago Hollywood's most powerful talent agency.
In recent years, he has suffered highly publicized blows -- including his dismissal after one year from the presidency of Walt Disney, even with a $100 million severance package. There have also been failed efforts to bring a professional football team back to Los Angeles and to become a Broadway powerhouse by gaining control of the theatrical production company Livent, but then asserting that the company was riddled with accounting fraud. The former executives of Livent denied the accusations.
By all accounts, Mr. Ovitz had been putting his own money into the television company as well as his management company as he sought -- and was unable to find -- investors from Hollywood studios and networks, or companies like AT&T.
At the same time, the company, which had more than 200 people on its payroll in a 40,000-square-foot office in Beverly Hills, is clearly facing financial difficulties because of its high overhead. Entertainment industry executives estimated that the overhead might run as much as $50 million to $60 million a year.
Mr. Ovitz said late today that making the staff cuts "was a very hard decision for me."
"A lot of time and emotion was involved," he said. "We're in a pretty rotten television economy." He said he was unsure about the future of his television business, adding: "That's what we're working on now. It's always been a high-risk venture. We're trying to assess what to do now. But we're still operating."
Mr. Ovitz insisted that the serious problems in his company's television side would have no effect on his other lines of work -- talent and sports management, and making movies. "All these businesses are set up separately, operate separately," he said. "From a pure business point of view, our people are doing great. We've got over 70 projects in development in the film area. On the human side, it's difficult."
And he said that the cuts were necessary for one reason:"We just wanted to cut the overheard."
In scaling back the television operations, the company kept the chief operating officer, Eric Tannenbaum, and several top associates. But executives in business, finance and production were laid off. Two top network executives, who insisted on anonymity, maintained that unless Mr. Ovitz soon found a financial partner, the company's television business would be in tatters.
At one point, the company spent as much as $60 million on television deals with top writer-producers like Darren Star, Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana, and with Adam Chase, a former co-executive producer of the NBC show "Friends." Now, agents said, the company is seeking to come to terms with some of the writers by ending their deals and paying them, perhaps at 50 cents on the dollar.
Mr. Ovitz gambled on finding a big television hit quickly that would, essentially, pay the bills. It did not happen. Only two of his new shows were picked up by the networks this fall -- CBS ordered a comedy, "The Ellen Show," starring Ellen DeGeneres, and the WB Network has a so-called reality program, "Lost in the USA."
Last year, in its first year of operations, the television unit had an impressive debut. It produced four prime-time series -- ABC's "Madigan Men," NBC's "Cursed," Fox's "The Street" and the WB Network's "Grosse Pointe." But none of the shows was picked up for a second season. This left the Artists Television Group with substantial deficits or losses.
A top television agent who has had many dealings with the Artists Television Group said today: "They're in a state of limbo. They're not making any new deals with people. And I think buyers are skeptical of their future."
Of the impact on the overall management company, the agent said: "When a portion of the company goes out of business, it spreads enormous doubt through the rest of the company. It puts everything up in the air."
Mr. Ovitz began the management company with Rick Yorn and his sister-in-law, Julie Silverman Yorn, who brought in star clients like Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. But even with these stars and others, the commissions on their deals were paid for several years to the former company at which the Yorns had worked.
Mr. Yorn said today that the company was disappointed in the downturn in its television business but that the layoffs would have no effect on the management of actors and writers and directors. "If anything, we're in amazing shape there," he said, adding that the company hoped that a business partner would bolster the television business.
"If not, if it doesn't happen, it'll be weaned downward," Mr. Yorn said, adding, "It's ultimately good for the company." 
It was Mr. Ovitz who helped bring in stars like Robin Williams and directors like Martin Scorsese. Separate sports, music and comedy representation units were also set up. The company represents the tennis star Pete Sampras and the rock group Buckcherry. 
But the television group was, at least at the outset, intended to serve as what the head of one talent agency called "the hard asset base of the firm upon which they were looking to raise money."
He added: "Without that, it becomes a far less attractive situation. It has a huge impact."

At least 10 asthma patients may have died after using drug inhalers that were later recalled by the manufacturer, Schering-Plough, according to reports filed with federal regulators that were obtained by the consumer group Public Citizen. The Food and Drug Administration said it was investigating the reports. Schering-Plough said there was no evidence directly tying the deaths to its recall of millions of inhalers in March 2000. C1

Record Drain on Power On Hottest Day of the Year
A five-day August heat wave reached a withering peak across a wide swath of the Northeast as temperatures soared to 105 in Newark, 103 in New York City and 100 or more in many cities, shattering records and straining power supplies on the hottest day of the year. As demands for electricity set records and came perilously close to supply limits, power managers declared emergencies and imposed voltage reductions from Maine to Virginia. A1

E-ZPass Speed Limit Tripled
Less than a month after New Jersey began enforcing a five-mile-per-hour speed limit for drivers using an E-ZPass at its toll plazas, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco bowed to widespread complaints and ordered the speed limit tripled. The new limit will apply to E-ZPass lanes on the Garden State Parkway, New Jersey Turnpike and Atlantic City Expressway. He said he would seek to extend it to the Hudson River and Delaware River crossings. B1

San Francisco Office Dismisses 15 Employees

BYLINE:  By Patricia Winters Lauro 

 BODY:
The San Francisco office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising said yesterday that it had laid off about 15 employees, or about 5 percent of its staff of 250.
 The San Francisco office "has been having a very good year, but the economy is soft," said Susan Irwin, a spokeswoman for McCann-Erickson, confirming reports of the layoffs in the online editions of Advertising Age and Adweek. 
She said the dismissals affect all levels at the San Francisco office, and were caused by budget cutbacks by clients. 
 In April, the San Francisco office laid off four or five employees. In May, McCann-Erickson in New York laid off 35 to 40 employees, or about 3 percent of its staff of 1,300. McCann-Erickson is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.

HEADLINE: Seeking to Regain Fliers, United Cuts Chicago Fares 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
United Airlines, trying to win back passengers from big rivals and to ward off competition from discounters, said today that it was reducing fares on some flights between Chicago and other large American cities.
 United, the operating unit of the UAL Corporation, also removed a Saturday-night stay requirement. 
 The lower fares, from its O'Hare International Airport hub to cities including New York and Los Angeles, will be available for travel starting on Sept. 5 and will be nonrefundable. As examples, some seats on some flights will cost $296 round trip from O'Hare to LaGuardia Airport in New York, $328 round trip to Denver and $376 round trip to Los Angeles,
United, operating like its rivals American Airlines and Delta Air Lines in a soft economy, is trying to regain passenger good will lost in delays and cancellations. 
It particularly wants to win back business travelers lost to American, an AMR unit, which also uses O'Hare as a hub.
And United is seeking to thwart discounters like American Trans Air, which now operates from Midway, Chicago's other major airport. Southwest Airlines, the nation's leading discount carrier, also flies into and out of Midway. 
The airline industry had losses in the first and second quarters of 2001, mainly because of sharply reduced business travel linked to the economic slowdown. The slowdown has hurt United more than some rivals because of service problems it had last year, some labor-related, that put off customers.
American Airlines and Northwest Airlines said today that they were studying the announcement, deciding whether to match United's move.
In trading, shares of UAL fell 34 cents today, to $33.96.

Key Gauges Make Little or No Headway in Uneven Session

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The stock market ended an uneven session nearly unchanged yesterday, as persistent fears about sluggish growth and a mixed batch of retail sales dampened investors' appetite for stocks.
 Abercrombie & Fitch reported a bigger-than-expected drop in July sales and warned that its second-half earnings would disappoint. Banks and brokerage firms limped lower on fears the weak stock market would hurt earnings, and technology stocks closed within a whisker of a four-month low. 
 "The weak economic data and the lousy earnings season we went through have pushed hopes for recovery out further," said Erik Gustafson, a portfolio manager who helps oversee $4 billion for Stein Roe & Farnham Inc. The action yesterday shows a market still churning downward, he added. 
The economic outlook was no less grim, with jobless claims rising to 385,000 in the week ended Aug. 4 from a revised 352,000 for the prior week. The downbeat beige book summary of regional economic conditions on Wednesday already had painted a picture of lagging growth.
"There are all these incremental pieces of news showing that the economy is still slowing -- there's nowhere to run to and no place to hide," said Donna Van Vlack, director of trading at Brandywine Asset Management.
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 3.04 points, to 1,963.32, its fifth consecutive losing session. Yesterday it ended just 4 points shy of a four-month closing low.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.10 of a point, to 1,183.43, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.06 points, to 10,298.56.
Worries that the weak economy and struggling stock market will bite into profits at Wall Street's biggest firms buffeted brokerage stocks, sending a crucial index of financial shares to its lowest level in nearly a month. The American Stock Exchange broker-dealer index fell 2.5 percent, its fifth consecutive day in negative territory and its lowest close since July 11.
"Financial stocks are always very correlated with the markets, and the markets are bad," said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "And there is a lot of macro-economic pessimism out there about when there could be a recovery."
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter was off $2.16, or 3.7 percent, at $56.09.
Nortel Networks slipped 6 cents, to $7.56. Nortel, a telecommunications equipment supplier, sold $1.5 billion of seven-year convertible senior notes to help stabilize its balance sheet amid a steep slide in demand for its products. A convertible bond is a hybrid security that can be converted into company stock, potentially diluting the stock's value. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday after the government's $5 billion bond sale drew below-average demand, fueling speculation that bonds might not rally much more as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.
Bonds have "already acknowledged a ton of slowing in the economy" and "there's a lot of stimulus in the pipeline" after six Fed rate reductions, said Todd Abraham, who helps invest $1.5 billion in bonds at Federated Investors Inc. in Pittsburgh. He is keeping most of his holdings in non-Treasury debt for the extra yield it provides, he said.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32, to a price of 99 25/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.03 percent from 5.07 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/32, to 97 23/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.52 percent from 5.51 percent on Wednesday.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 30-year bonds:

HEADLINE: Thomson 2nd-Quarter Net Rises 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug 9 

 BODY:
The Thomson Corporation, the financial, legal and scientific publisher, said today that its second-quarter income increased because of acquisitions but warned that a slowing economy could hurt its bottom line in the second half. 
 Thomson, which provides specialized information through online channels, CD-ROM's, software and printed materials, said its trademark business had slowed and sluggish financial markets could turn things a little sour in the rest of the year. 
 "Our trademark businesses are dependent on trademark filings, and of course as the economy has slowed, companies in the United States and Canada and Europe have reduced the amount they have invested in new product development, reducing the number of trademarks they've needed," Brian Hall, the president of Thomson's legal and regulatory division, said in a conference call. 
For the quarter ended June 30, Thomson's earnings from continuing operations rose to $110 million, or 18 cents a share, up from $74 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time gain from the sale of Jane's Information Group, earnings were $84 million, or 13 cents a share.
Total sales rose nearly 7 percent, to $1.6 billion.
Officials said that despite the slowdown, they expected revenue to grow 15 percent this year and earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization to increase 17 percent. 
The forecasts excluded the effect of its Harcourt division. In July, the English-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier bought the publisher Harcourt General and sold Harcourt's professional and higher education publications to Thomson for $2.06 billion.

HEADLINE: Italy's Leader Defends Police Actions at Genoa Summit Talks 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, today defended police actions at the Group of Eight summit conference in Genoa last month, declaring the meeting "a political and diplomatic success" even as officials elsewhere in Europe continued to question the heavy use of force against demonstrators there.
 At a news conference on his way out of town for a summer vacation, Mr. Berlusconi looked at several nodding aides rather than at reporters as he said, "Instead of putting the police on trial it would be better to put on trial the violent organizations that have already announced that they will be involved with the next summits." 
 Not that it was a tough crowd. None of the half-dozen questions the prime minister took from reporters, in a hall where some journalists were on his payroll as employees of the various news outlets he owns, dealt directly with either the allegations of police brutality or the resulting criminal and parliamentary investigations. 
The July 20-22 summit meeting became an international embarrassment for Mr. Berlusconi's center-right government after the police shot one demonstrator dead and were accused of beating scores of peaceful protesters. Earlier this week, President Thomas Klestil of Austria formally petitioned Italy to release members of a group that demonstrates through street theater. 
Sixteen Austrians and four Americans remain in Italian jails, including Susanna Thomas, a Bryn Mawr College student and practicing Quaker from New Jersey, who had been working on her senior thesis on nonviolent social protest.
"It all makes Italy look bad, like, 'Oh, well, this is how fascists act,' and of course the intelligentsia here is appalled," said a senior executive with an Italian company. 
But the opposition does not have the votes to bring down the government. Polls show that a majority of Italians generally agree with Mr. Berlusconi about the way the police handled the demonstrators. And the left remains both fragmented and wary trying to capitalize politically on problems at a summit meeting it had helped plan before losing the elections this year.
"There is no doubt the police reaction was excessive," said Sergio Romano, a conservative former minister who writes a column for Corriera della Sera. "But the damage done was excessive, too. We saw pictures of people attacking gas stations to get bottles for their Molotov cocktails, so people are not as impressed as they perhaps should be."
And after a bomb went off in a Venice courthouse around 3 this morning, causing no injuries, some local political commentators saw the explosion as politically beneficial to Mr. Berlusconi, a confirmation of his view that there is leftist violence that must be answered. (So beneficial, in fact, that one leftist group immediately issued a statement accusing government officials of having planted the bomb themselves to justify the police conduct in Genoa.)
Mr. Berlusconi has stayed mostly in the background since the summit meeting, but called the news conference today to grade himself on his first 100 days in office. And, like the American president he so admires, he gave himself high marks.
"We have finished our program for the first 100 days in advance," he said.
When a reporter pointed out that he had failed to keep his promise to come up with a conflict-of-interest bill that would address the fact that his vast holdings necessarily do business with the government he runs, he said he had been too busy but would get to it after the summer break.
"I will present it when I return, but I'm also taking 10 days off, if that's all right with you," he said. "I have a family -- at least I hope I still do -- and so I'm going to be with them."
Meanwhile, government officials said they hoped the storm abroad over the violence in Genoa would pass.
"I hope that we will be able to overcome this moment," Communication Minister Maurizio Gasparri said in an interview this evening. 
Asked about reports of abuse, he said they had been exaggerated.
"There were a few little problems, nothing huge," he said. "For example, the shooting of the young man has been declared to be in self-defense."
Television crews videotaped the young man heaving a fire extinguisher at a police jeep as he was shot and then run over.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Mexico Talks Produce Agreement on Immigration Policy 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
The United States and Mexico agreed in principle today to an expanded temporary worker program that would allow some of the estimated three million Mexicans living here unlawfully to earn permanent legal residency, officials from both governments said.
 After meeting for nearly two hours, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Attorney General John Ashcroft joined their Mexican counterparts, Jorge G. Castaneda and Santiago Creel, at a news conference to announce what Mr. Powell called a "shared commitment" to employ a "humane, family-friendly" migration policy. 
 While much work lies ahead on specific details, Mr. Powell made it clear that some Mexicans living in this country illegally -- those who have jobs, pay taxes and rear children who are American-born United States citizens -- would be included in an expanded temporary worker program. 
"The program will rest on a carefully worked-out partnership between the sending and receiving countries, one that recognizes also the contributions that undocumented Mexicans are making in the United States and that brings together willing workers and willing employers," Mr. Powell said.
The American and Mexican cabinet officers met here to begin laying the groundwork for a meeting in early September between President Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico.
Aides on both sides, who had recently held out hopes that the presidents could announce a detailed framework agreement in September, sought today to play down expectations of any quick accord.
Tacitly acknowledging the policy complexities as well as the political hurdles to clear, Mr. Powell said that putting together a well-designed temporary worker program that enjoyed public support could not be rushed.
"We're in no hurry," Mr. Powell told reporters. "We have to do this right. We have to do this in a careful way, a way that will be seen as fair and equitable by both nations, by the people of both nations."
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher was more categorical, telling reporters later that, "I wouldn't expect that it'll all be finished by the time the presidents get together."
Mexican officials, whom some Americans had privately accused of pushing the legalization plan too aggressively in recent months, also sounded a cautionary note today.
"We are making important progress," said Mr. Castaneda, adding that the overall goal is "to achieve a good agreement in whatever time frame is necessary, and that takes into account the needs of the economy in the United States and the rights that Mexicans need."
But Mr. Creel appeared to voice more of the private satisfaction Mexican officials said they felt after today's talks. "We have taken a very important step on an issue that is essential for Mexico, finding a solution for our countrymen who work and live in the United States," he said.
There is now a small-scale, cumbersome plan that allows "guest workers," mostly agriculture laborers, to get temporary visas. Under proposals discussed today, an expanded pool of new migrants employed in service jobs like hotels and restaurants could apply for temporary work permits with the possibility of earning permanent residency over time.
And at least some of the illegal Mexicans already in the United States could earn permanent lawful status if they could certify that they had been living and working in the country for a specified time, and had been paying taxes.
"There is broad agreement in principle about how and what kind of program we want to design," Mr. Boucher said. "We got into the discussion of the various factors and elements that need to be worked in and balanced as we go into that program. The senior experts and officials that are going to try to work out the details of the program have a lot more structure and guidance."

HEADLINE: With Politics and Market in Mind, Megawati Picks a Cabinet 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: SEMARANG, Indonesia, Aug. 9 

 BODY:
In her first step to define her new presidency, Megawati Sukarnoputri chose a cabinet today in Jakarta, winning immediate praise for her selection of an economic team and for the overall professionalism of her choices. 
 In a difficult balancing act, she paid a number of political debts while putting respected names in many leading positions. 
 Reflecting the traditional strength of the military in Indonesia, several retired generals were included in her cabinet though it did not for the most part have a strong military tinge.
"I think it was worth the wait," said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a leading political commentator, referring to a two-week delay during which some commentators questioned Mrs. Megawati's decisiveness. 
"I'm happy to see that the cabinet is a businesslike cabinet, primarily geared to pleasing the market," Ms. Anwar said. "And on the whole, I think she's got the right people in the right places." The military men who received ministries, she noted, have long political experience and are seen more as managers than generals. 
Economic analysts generally praised Mrs. Megawati's key appointments, led by an economist who has been the ambassador to the United States, Dorodjatun Kuntoro-Jakti, as the overall economic coordinator. The new finance minister is Boediono, the former chief of national economic planning. 
"I give Megawati two thumbs up for these choices," said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, a prominent economist.
Other economic posts went to two of her most loyal supporters, Laksamana Sukardi and Kwik Kian Gie, both of whom fell out of favor with her predecessor, Abdurrahman Wahid, who was forced out of office on July 23.
Mrs. Megawati indicated that stability and consistency were a priority by selecting Bambang Susilo Yudhoyono as her chief political and security minister. A former general who is seen as a reformist, he held the same post under Mr. Wahid, struggling to maintain order until he was fired.
Seen as a respected, low-key manager, he was one of 22 ministers to lose their positions in Mr. Wahid's fractious and unstable government. 
Andi Mallarangeng, a political scientist, said the inclusiveness of Mrs. Megawati's cabinet could invite problems. 
"First, everyone is in the cabinet and almost no one is in the opposition, which is not good for democracy," he said. "Second, the more parties there are in the coalition, the more fragile the coalition is."
Budiarto Shambazy, a journalist and political scientist, noted, however, that for the most part the political appointees were not given influential posts. In addition, he said, they mostly excluded the prominent names that many analysts had expected to be named. 
"This is an indication of her independence," he said. "She showed her good will to party leaders while refusing to be pushed around by them." 
In her announcement today, the president asked for a wide base of support in her attempts to address Indonesia's economic and social crises. 
Mrs. Megawati inherits from Mr. Wahid a country torn by violence, political infighting and continuing instability. 
"I realize how difficult the tasks and the responsibilities of the new cabinet will be," she said. "I am looking for support from all groups."
In one indicative appointment, she chose a senior career diplomat, Hassan Wirayudha, as foreign minister. The move was seen as bringing professionalism to a ministry that had been personalized by the whims of Mr. Wahid, who visited 50 foreign nations during his 21 months in office. 
Mrs. Megawati continued a policy, initiated by her predecessor, of naming a civilian as defense minister. But the appointment of Matori Abdul Djalil, a politician with little experience in military affairs, was a surprise to commentators.
Like several other appointments, this one appeared to be something of a rebuke to Mr. Wahid. 
Mr. Matori had been the leader of Mr. Wahid's political party but became a thorn in his patron's side. As one of his final acts in office, Mr. Wahid fired him from the leadership position.

HEADLINE: CHINA'S LEADERS: JIANG'S VIEWS; 
Chinese President Is Optimistic About Relations With the U.S.

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIDAIHE, China, Aug. 8 

 BODY:
Jiang Zemin has not yet met George W. Bush, but in their single telephone conversation last month, Mr. Jiang now says, "from his voice I could feel that he was a president I could do business with." 
 Mr. Jiang, who is the president, Communist Party secretary general and military chairman of China, was optimistic about the future of Chinese-American relations this week in a rare interview at the leadership's seaside retreat, 170 miles east of Beijing. 
 "Both sides share a positive desire for a good relationship," he said, dismissing as routine background noise the voices in the Bush administration calling for mobilizing against a "China threat." 
"We should try our best to find the common ground between us," he said, almost rising from his chair. Excerpts, Page A8. 
Mr. Jiang met Wednesday with the publisher of The Times, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., senior editors, a columnist and China-based correspondents of The Times for an interview that was initially suggested by Chinese diplomats. Mr. Jiang's chief goal appeared to be to emphasize China's desire for smoother relations as the new American presidency takes shape and as China looks toward playing host to the Summer Olympics in Beijing in 2008 and braces for major transitions in political leadership and the economy.
The 85-minute interview took place in a formal meeting hall lined with red armchairs in a large gardened compound for senior leaders in the fading resort town of Beidaihe. Mr. Jiang, who is 75, appeared cheerful and confident as he defended China's domestic and foreign policies, sometimes waving his arms and citing proverbs.
While his message was one of friendship, he gave no ground on areas of difference with the United States, including Taiwan, Tibet or human rights. Rather, he often suggested that the problem was that foreigners did not understand China's goals and why it must adapt Communist rule to a changing society rather than scrap it altogether, as many in the West might prefer.
"I lived for three-fourths of the last century," he said when asked about the prospect of a major political loosening, "and I can tell you with certainty: should China apply the parliamentary democracy of the Western world, the only result will be that 1.2 billion Chinese people will not have enough food to eat. The result will be great chaos, and should that happen, it will not be conducive to world peace and stability."
Bursting into English, he added, "And so I tell you very friendly and frankly, this is my opinion."
The well-guarded compound where the meeting took place, known as West Mountain, is sprinkled with large two-story, pale-yellow manors. Every summer since the 1950's, leaders from Mao onward have gathered in Beidaihe, (pronounced bay-die-huh), with other party mandarins to hash out major issues, and to swim in the Bohai Sea.
From the glimpse offered this week, the compound does not have the shirt-sleeve ambience of Bush family retreats like Kennebunkport or the Texas ranch. For luncheons and meetings with foreigners, at least -- this day, Mr. Jiang also met a delegation of United States senators -- business suits were de rigueur. During the interview, young women in long silk skirts hovered to top off cups of tea.
"People think we are here for a vacation," Mr. Jiang said. "But actually it's impossible to take a break, even for a single day."
"But there is one thing that I have to do every day," he added proudly, referring to a habit he shares with predecessors like Mao and Deng Xiaoping. "I have gone swimming each of my 11 days here already, no matter what the weather conditions." 
The topics and schedules at Beidaihe are secret, but this year a major subject is said to be the coming changes in party leadership. Over the next two years, a large share of the Central Committee as well as Mr. Jiang and the two other top leaders, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and Li Peng, the Parliament chief, are scheduled to retire.
Mr. Jiang is expected to give up the post of party secretary general in 2002, and his term as president runs out in 2003. Asked whether he might consider keeping an official title after that -- some supporters have floated the idea of his retaining the military chairmanship or another high post -- Mr. Jiang did not respond, and his ambitions and the realistic possibilities are largely unknown.
Mr. Jiang said he felt confident that the next generation of party leaders would continue his general approach: opening the economy more widely to global competition and investment, as China is doing with its entry to the World Trade Organization, but preserving the monopoly of the Communist Party to protect national unity.
Just this week, a book of Mr. Jiang's speeches was published with great fanfare. In it, he calls for the party to embrace the new "advanced productive forces" in society like entrepreneurs and the technological elite. While he has been criticized for abandoning socialism and destroying a worker's party, he said his ideas were faithful to "the fundamental tenets of Marxism, applied to the real conditions in China."
Questioned about democracy and human rights, Mr. Jiang insisted that China was developing its own model and extolled the country's village-level elections, inadvertently suggesting that similar direct elections are also held for township leaders.
But he said it is unrealistic to think of direct elections for provincial or national leaders, in part because 100 million of the country's 1.26 billion people are illiterate.
Mr. Jiang, in a written answer, defended the crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement, asserting that the group had "done great harm to people's physical and mental health" and that no government could sit idly in the face of such an "out-and-out cult." He also wrote that the recent arrests and trials of several Chinese-born scholars, some of them naturalized Americans or permanent residents of the United States, were justified because they were "members of Taiwanese spy organizations," something the scholars have vehemently denied.
Though he acknowledged social strains as failing state industries lay off workers, he was upbeat about the long-term outlook, saying he had told "certain backward industries" seeking protection that "you have to be brave enough to go to the sea -- you have to swim upstream!"
While China will seize the fantastic information potential of the Internet, Mr. Jiang said, he justified the country's efforts to control or block some content, including online versions of some foreign media, again citing what he says are China's unique problems of social stability. 
On Tibet, one of China's most vexatious international issues, he said his government had continuing, indirect communications with the exiled Dalai Lama. But he said that the Tibetan leader had never fully accepted China's conditions that Tibet is an inalienable part of China and that the People's Republic is the sovereign government. 
Though he repeated China's goal of peaceful reunification with Taiwan, he also made it clear that Taiwan's formal status as part of China would never be up for negotiation. If the United States presses ahead with more sales of advanced weapons, then "I can only say that it would be very dangerous," he warned. He added that China would never renounce the use of force in the event that Taiwan moved toward independence.
He also warned that if a proposed American missile defense was perceived as negating China's small force of nuclear missiles, then "we would keep an appropriate number of forces to meet our defense needs," but he declined to be more specific.
Still, Mr. Jiang professed to be unworried by what some describe as a hawkish and anti-China climate in Washington. "At any time, there are all kinds of people with different opinions," he said, and he quoted a Song Dynasty poem: "People part and meet, they have sorrow and joy, just like the moon that wanes and waxes." 
He described a long and friendly acquaintance with the first President Bush and his wife, Barbara. He expressed his hope that the new president's visit to China in October would advance friendly ties, and said, "For two such big countries, it would be strange if they had no disagreements at all."
He made a jocular apology, in English, for there being "too many proverbs in China." Then he ended the interview, and his review of Chinese-American prospects, by citing this one: "It takes two hands to clap."

Strategic Warmth

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: BEIDAIHE, China 

 BODY:
When you ask China's president, Jiang Zemin, whether he is worried about relations with President Bush, in light of their rocky start and the Bush team's push for missile defense, Mr. Jiang gives a charmingly Chinese answer: I'm not worried at all -- I know the young man's parents. 
 "Although I have not met personally President George W. Bush, I have met many times with his parents, George Bush 41 and his wife," said President Jiang, in an interview with The New York Times at the Chinese leadership's coastal summer retreat in Beidaihe. "On the fifth of July President Bush called me. Although it was not a video phone where I could see his facial expression, from his voice I could feel that he was a president I could do business with. Most of the conversation was conducted with interpreters, but at the end, although I do not speak good English, I tried to say directly in English, 'Please send my best regards to your parents.' " 
 All I could think of as I listened to Mr. Jiang was: What's going on here? First President Bush looks into the Russian president's eyes and says he saw a good soul, and now China's president says he's heard Mr. Bush's voice and he sounds like a guy he can work with. What happened to the good old days when Great Powers threatened each other with annihilation to get their way or pounded tables with a shoe?
What's going on here, I think, is this: At the broadest level the Chinese, like their Russian counterparts, understand two things. One is that they are relatively weak vis-a-vis the U.S. right now and therefore they have to be a lot smarter in how they manage American power. And two, they are obsessed -- obsessed -- with internal issues, ranging from a planned change in leadership over the next two years to a wrenching transformation of the Chinese economy now that it is joining the World Trade Organization, and they just don't want trouble right now with America or the world.
Chinese officials will tell you privately, and urgently, that U.S. plans for a missile shield pose a huge strategic problem for Beijing. While all the focus has been on Russia, the fact is that the Russians can easily overwhelm any U.S. missile shield with their 7,000 long-range nukes. That's why in some ways missile defense is a bonanza for Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. He's going to get the U.S. to pay him to scrap the ABM treaty so the U.S. can build a system that Mr. Putin knows can't threaten Russia in any near term, and may never work. 
China, by contrast, has only 18 to 24 nuclear missiles that could hit the U.S. And although China is upgrading that force and making it more mobile, the fact is that even a small U.S. missile shield could conceivably blunt every Chinese long-range nuke and therefore eliminate China's deterrent threat. Add to that the possibility that Taiwan might be integrated into a U.S. missile shield, making it less vulnerable to Chinese attack as well, and you see why U.S. missile defense for China is not a bonanza but a potentially huge bill.
If Beijing can't work out some understanding with the U.S. to limit any shield, China will have to spend billions of dollars to expand its nuclear arsenal -- something it does not want to do right now, when its health care and education systems are both deteriorating and rural unemployment is soaring.
The Chinese understand that there is going to be a struggle in the Bush team over how big a missile shield to deploy and whether to treat China as a potential partner, as Secretary of State Colin Powell suggested, or as America's next great enemy, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld seems to believe. By sending the most soothing signals, and praising the pro-China policies of the elder President Bush, the Chinese are trying to influence that internal debate. They want to strengthen Mr. Powell's hand and to undercut those in the Pentagon who want to make China the new American bogeyman and the focus of our missile defenses. (Incidentally, they are using this same soft-spoken approach now with Taiwan.) 
The Chinese president, though, couldn't resist sowing a little bit of doubt about the size of China's long-range nuclear arsenal. After we noted in a question that China had only about 20 long-range nukes, Mr. Jiang said: "To be frank, it seems that you know how many missiles we have better than I do. I have to say, whether the figure you give is the correct one or not, I have doubts." 
Nevertheless, when asked how China would respond if the hard-liners prevailed in Washington, Mr. Jiang would issue only the mildest of threats: "We would increase our defense capability in keeping with the development of the international situation, and we would do this for the sole purpose of self-defense."
This Chinese approach -- call it strategic warmth -- has enormous support throughout Asia, and it will be interesting now to watch how it impacts the deliberations of the Bush team on missile defense and on China. 
As we got up to leave at the end of the interview in Mr. Jiang's summer palace, where foreigners are rarely invited, the Chinese leader had just one last thing to say: "Let me quote another Chinese proverb: 'It takes two hands to clap.' "

HEADLINE: CHINA'S LEADERS; 
In Jiang's Words: 'I Hope the Western World Can Understand China Better'

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from an interview with President Jiang Zemin by Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The New York Times; Joseph Lelyveld, executive editor; Howell Raines, who is to succeed Mr. Lelyveld next month; Thomas L. Friedman, foreign affairs columnist; Erik Eckholm, Beijing bureau chief, and three correspondents, Elisabeth Rosenthal, based in Beijing; Craig S. Smith, based in Shanghai; and Mark Landler, based in Hong Kong. Mr. Jiang spoke in Chinese, and a government interpreter translated his remarks.

Q. We'd like to know your sense of President Bush now. He's had two meetings with President Putin of Russia. Do you feel China is being left out?

A. First of all, let me be frank and straightforward. I don't feel at all a sense of being left out. Although I have not met personally President George W. Bush, I have met many times with his parents, George Bush Sr. and his wife. Recently, when I visited President Putin, he briefed me about his meeting with President Bush, and on July 5 this year President Bush called me and we had a conversation. Although it was not a videophone where I could see his facial expression, from his voice I could feel that he was a president we can do business with.
Most of the conversation was conducted with interpreters but at the end, although I do not speak good English, I tried to say directly in English, "Please send my best regards to your parents." . . .

Q. Are you concerned about anti-Chinese sentiment within the administration and some senior officials who seem to regard China as a military threat?

A. . . . I'd like to quote a poem written by a famous poet called Su Dongpo of the Song Dynasty. "People part and meet, they have sorrow and joy, just like the moon that wanes and waxes." Things have been like this for thousands of years. So the only hope is that people can live long and can enjoy the beauty of the moonlight, although they are thousands of miles apart.

Q. Regarding missile defense, is it a threat to China? You have only 20 or 25 missiles able to hit the United States. If we put a shield up, you're out of business.

A. To be frank, it seems that you know how many missiles we have better than I do. I have to say that I have doubts about whether the figure you give is the correct one or not. But let me be clear about one thing. The purpose of our possession of weapons is not for offensive purposes. They are all for our own defense. So we would keep an appropriate number of weapons to meet our defense needs.

Q. If the United States does go ahead with this system, would China be forced to upgrade its nuclear force in response?

A. I think I already addressed this question. We would increase our defense capability in keeping with the development of the international situation, and we would do this for the sole purpose of self-defense. As to when and how we are going to do this, as the chairman of the central military commission, I cannot tell the details. . . .

Q. You've described Taiwan as the most important issue in Chinese-American relations. Some in Washington call for a stronger military relationship with Taiwan, selling more advanced weapons, and to include Taiwan in a theater missile defense. If the United States and Taiwan go this route, how will China respond?

A. We are opposed to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. After signing of the Aug. 17 Joint Communique of 1982 , the U.S. side pledged to reduce its arms sales to Taiwan, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. But in fact what has happened has been the contrary. Secondly, on the one hand the U.S. side has said Taiwan should not go independent. On the other hand, the U.S. provides support to make Taiwan stronger in order to oppose the mainland. This is utterly wrong. Such practice will not serve the interests of the people of Taiwan and is not conducive to peace in Asia, and it will also harm the U.S.'s own interests. . . .

Q. But if the United States goes ahead with more advanced weapons sales, will it be possible for the United States and China to maintain friendly relations?

A. I can only say that it would be very dangerous. Let me add one more point. I hope the Western world can understand China better. This is not simply an issue that has a bearing on myself. It actually has a bearing on the pride and feelings of the 1.2 billion Chinese people and the tens of millions of Chinese descendants overseas. They all hope that Taiwan and the mainland can be reunified at an early date. So if this situation does not make a turn for the better, does not head toward such a conclusion, then it will be hard to cope with the emotions and desires of so many people.

Q. Many Taiwan companies are investing in China. Do you think that economic integration is the main trend for the future, and at any point will it make the idea of armed conflict just too expensive for both sides?

A. Our intention is peaceful unification and one country, two systems. This has been our consistent position from the beginning. As you rightly point out, many Taiwan business people make investments on the mainland. The reason is simple -- because of the favorable investment climate. And Taiwan business people also find themselves in an advantageous position to make investments here, because they are all Chinese, they speak the same language, share the same customs, traditions. If with the increase of economic interaction people on both sides have a strong desire for reunification, then why would it be necessary to resort to armed conflict? . . . Should the pro-independence Taiwanese or the overseas separatist forces intervene in the question of Taiwan and try to separate Taiwan away from the rest of China, China can never renounce the use of force. . . .

Q. The Dalai Lama has said that he supports the principle of "one country, two systems" for Tibet, but China has not been interested in engaging him in conversation on that subject. Is there anything he could say or do that would make possible his return to Tibet?

A. People assume that there is no channel of communication between the central government and the Dalai Lama. In fact, the exchanges and communications have never stopped. Of course not directly with the Dalai, but we have alternate channels. But despite all these communications, we still failed to reach an agreement.
The Dalai has to make a commitment and recognize that Tibet is an inalienable part of China, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sovereign government of China. He has to recognize all these points. But so far he has not made the complete commitment. He has only made some statements out of context. So it's impossible to have an agreement. 
Eleven years ago, I visited Tibet myself. Sea changes have taken place in Tibet since the Dalai left. More than one million serfs were emancipated, and they now lead a happy life with a happy family. I have also climbed to the top floor of the Potala Palace. At that time, it was in very poor shape. The floor was actually shaking, very weak. So we decided to give it a good renovation. We used one ton of gold and spent one hundred million yuan $12 million so that its condition has completely changed.

Q. How far do you think political change can go in this country, where do you hope it will be 10 years from now? At any point, do you see an independent press and could you imagine the Communist Party allowing competing parties?

A. It seems that Western correspondents and leaders all believe that China is doing very well in its economic reform but doing nothing in its political reform. This is not correct. Actually, our political reform has been always ongoing. What are the main contents of our political reform? They are to strengthen democracy and to strengthen the rule of law. And we need to strengthen and broaden the channels through which democracy can be practiced, including the role of the media. But there's one thing I have to make very clear. It is impossible for democracy here to be exactly the same as democracy practiced in the Western world, as would be preferred by people in the West.
I remember in 1991 former U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited me, and he was very impressed by the direct elections at the village and township level in China. And he said that now you are doing well with the direct democratic election of the village and township chiefs, why not to upgrade it to have direct election for governor of the province, or even president of the country? My reply to him was that it absolutely will not work, because China has a population of 1.26 billion, and over 100 million people still cannot read and write. 
How can we have direct elections? I was elected through indirect elections to be president of this country. I was elected by 3,000 deputies to our National People's Congress. I'm presently a deputy to the National People's Congress from Shanghai. 
I believe that our world is one of color and diversity. There should be all kinds of election methods. There should not be only one model, the Western model. I have received many U.S. senators and congressmen in Beijing. They ask me why in China there is only one party, the Communist Party. I tell them that no, we also have eight other democratic parties. And then they ask me which among the eight are opposition parties? I tell them that none of the eight are opposition parties because all of them are participating in the discussion and administration of state affairs. . . . 
I am 75 years old now. I lived for three-fourths of the last century, and I can tell you with certainty: should China apply the parliamentary democracy of the Western world, the only result will be that 1.2 billion Chinese people will not have enough food to eat. The result will be great chaos, and should that happen it will not be conducive to world peace and stability. In English And so I tell you very friendly and frankly, this is my opinion.

Q. What more changes do you expect to see in China in the next five years?

A. It has been made very clear in our 10th five-year plan. Our G.D.P. will continue to grow at a rate of 7 percent annually. And many large-scale projects will be undertaken, and we'll further develop high tech.
Of course, there's no denying that we face a political challenge. For instance, people can be laid off and wait for re-employment. Things like this were unimaginable in the past. 
But now people have accepted it as a normal situation, because to improve the efficiency of an enterprise it has to keep the size of the work force at a reasonable level. Therefore, some will be asked to leave their posts and seek re-employment. And over these years, we have developed the social insurance and Social Security system, and we've also extended more job opportunities. . . . 
The Chinese people have improved their living standards immensely since the beginning of reform and opening 20 years ago. We should not just envisage where China will find itself in five years' time, we should look into the next 50 years. After 50 years, China will become a country of medium-level development.

Q. Do you think the next generation coming up has any different values and ideas than your generation? If you are asked, will you consider retaining an important position in the government yourself?

A. Undoubtedly the Chinese people are also having these kinds of discussions. Actually I have done a study of the political systems of almost all the developed capitalist countries. I studied the political systems of 27 countries. I moved from Shanghai to work in the central government in 1989, and now more than 12 years have passed. I've seen too much of people being promoted or demoted or retired. But I'm also told that although the leaders change in the Western world, because of the Civil Service the administration will not be affected much.
But according to my observation, once the candidate of a political party gets elected in the Western world, it is quite difficult for him to stay with the program of his predecessor. By the time I leave the historical stage, I don't think there will be any change in the policies, in the direction that we have already set. The next generation of leaders will keep to this road. Maybe I'm too confident.

Q. We are interested in your recent opening of the Communist Party to capitalists and entrepreneurs. Why would you open a workers' party to capitalists?

A. By the time I leave the historical stage, I believe I can be a very good professor in a university, giving lectures about this. Because what we insist on doing is a combination of the fundamental tenets of Marxism applied to the real conditions in China. But we have to know that Marx and Engels lived more than 150 years ago. The Communist Manifesto was published 153 years ago. It is impossible to apply every single word or sentence they wrote at that time to today's reality. . . .

Q. Do you surf the Web yourself?

A. My grandson is much more technically proficient than I am. As an electrical engineer, it is not a problem for me to surf on the Net. But I have to admit that it is quite difficult for me to work with the mouse. But people working around me, including my bodyguards, my secretaries and nurses, they all know pretty well now to surf on the Net.

Q. Unfortunately, The New York Times Internet site is blocked in this country. We wonder why, and how do you square China's incredible progress with information technology with its practice of blocking some important information sources on the Web, such as our newspaper's own Web site?

A. Actually, the answer to this question can be related to my earlier comments. We have a population of 1.2 billion, and stability is very important for them and for them to lead happy lives. Everything has two aspects, pros and cons. The pros of the Internet are that it makes it very easy for people to communicate, to share advances, expertise and information about science and technology. But that aspect is affected by some unhealthy things. You raised a very specific issue about The New York Times Web site in particular, I cannot answer this question. But if you ask my view of The New York Times, my answer is it is a very good paper. . . .

Q. Does the Internet make it harder for you to rule? Do you hear more from the people now? Is that a big problem for you?

A. It has not caused any inconvenience in administration. As for views from the public, apart from press reports, I also have my own direct channels to know how they feel. I have many, many private friends, like a worker who many years ago, perhaps 40 years ago, was working with me. He talks to me not by e-mail, but by telephone. And professors, and engineers, people from many professions are my friends.

Q. To what extent is joining the W.T.O. a challenge for you, especially managing the social strains that will follow?

A. Everything has two aspects. But on the question of Chinese entry to W.T.O., I think it will do more good than bad for China's competitiveness in international markets in the 21st century. Certain backward industries in China would very much like to have more protection from competition. I told them no. It's just like swimming at Beidaihe. You have to be brave enough to go to the sea. In English You have to swim upstream!

Q. What hopes do you have for development of Sino-U.S. relations in the next several years? What helpful steps could President Bush take before his visit in October?

A. It now looks like the momentum is good for bilateral relations. Both sides share a positive desire to have a good relationship. It is in the interest of the whole world. It is in the interest of Asia. It is also in the interest of China and the United States. Not long ago I received visit from Secretary Powell, and President Bush, and I talked on the phone.
In October, there will be the APEC meeting in Shanghai, and President Bush will also visit Beijing. All these steps will push the relationship forward.

Q. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate and you just don't want trouble with the U.S. right now. Is that a fair assessment?

A. I think this should be the desire of both countries, not just myself. Let me quote another Chinese proverb -- we have too many proverbs in China. "It takes two hands to clap." So it actually depends on the shared desires of both sides.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 10 about an interview by The New York Times with President Jiang Zemin of China, and the textual excerpts with it, included an erroneously translated phrase from a Chinese government interpreter in some copies, regarding the spread of local elections. Mr. Jiang should have been quoted as praising direct election of leaders at the village level and the township level; he did not speak of the county level. His reference to townships, however, was apparently a slip; elections have not taken place at that level.

HEADLINE: Globalization Now, A Sequel of Sorts 

BYLINE:  By ALEXANDER STILLE 

 BODY:
"The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth. . . . He could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages. . . . He could secure . . . cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality."
 The author of this passage was not writing about today's world of globalization, mail order shopping and day trading. Rather, he was the great British economist John Maynard Keynes, and he was looking back on the decades before World War I, which many economists now refer to as "an earlier golden age of globalization." 
 The volume of trade, measured as a share of income and gross domestic product, "was comparable to what one observes now," said Jeffrey Williamson, a professor of economics at Harvard University who is one of a growing number of scholars who have been studying the earlier globalization for clues to our own time. He continued: "The barriers to trade were much lower than they were until very recently. It was a liberal environment, and there was a hell of a lot of trade." 
In fact, writes Michael Bordo, an economist at Rutgers University, before 1914 foreign assets accounted for fully 20 percent of the collective gross domestic products of the world and declined to as low as 5 percent in 1945, only reaching their pre-World War I levels in 1985. Recently, he says, they reached a peak of 57 percent.
In some ways, the level of economic integration was greater then than now. "Before World War I, half of British savings were invested overseas, far more than the U.S. or any European country now does," Mr. Bordo said in an interview. "Levels in Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands weren't far off."
There were no passports and virtually no restrictions on immigration, making for perhaps the biggest migration in human history. J. Bradford DeLong, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, writes that one-seventh of the world's working-age population moved from one country to another between 1870 and 1925, when immigration barriers became increasingly strict.
This early experiment in trade liberalization ended with a cataclysmic world war, and that has provoked lively debate. Harold James, a historian at Princeton University and the author of a new book, "The End of Globalization," said in an interview that increased competition in trade and unfettered immigration stimulated the growth of nationalism, aggravating tensions beween countries leading up to World War I.
Most economists argue that, on the contrary, liberal trade was a central feature of a time of relative peace and prosperity. But both sides agree that there was a growing backlash to early globalization starting in the early 20th century that led to high tariffs, barriers to trade and immigration, all of which contributed to the Great Depression. "History shows that globalization can plant the seeds of its own destruction," Mr. Williamson and his co-author, Kevin O'Rourke, write in "Globalization and History."
In a growing body of books, articles and symposium papers, scholars are re-examining what some have called this "earlier golden age of globalization" while asking questions about the global present and future. Are there substantial differences between then and now? Are there built-in limits to globalization? The gap between rich and poor nations has grown significantly in the last two centuries: did the liberalization of trade aggravate the problem or create widely shared wealth?
The first era of globalization, like today's, was ushered in by a series of technological breakthroughs. The invention of the steamship and the railroad in the mid-19th century drastically reduced the cost of transportation, while the laying of the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable in 1866 and the invention of the telephone made it possible to track overseas investments.
"The biggest revolution was the dramatic improvement in transportation costs," Mr. Williamson of Harvard said in a telephone interview. Suddenly it became cheaper to ship wheat thousands of miles from places like Australia or Canada than for Europeans to produce it in their own backyards. At the same time, workers left densely populated Europe, attracted by the cheap land and high wages in the sparsely populated areas of North and South America and Australia.
During this period of relative peace, European governments opened themselves to overseas trade. In 1846 Britain repealed the Corn Laws, which heavily taxed imported grain, and lowered tariffs on foreign goods. In 1871 Germany joined Britain in adopting the gold standard, and within a decade most major economies followed suit, creating the financial framework for a global trade network. By pegging their currencies to gold, the countries protected investors against fluctuations in the local currency, making foreign investments extremely attractive.
The parts of the world that participated in this vast experiment in classic economic theory were greatly transformed. Europe sent much of its surplus labor to populate the New World and provided the capital to build its infrastructure. The bargain on balance proved mutually beneficial, at least to the countries that were part of the new market. The economies of the United States, Canada, Australia and Argentina grew enormously, but their success had indirect benefits back in Europe. Wages rose in many parts of Europe as the labor pool became smaller, and living standards in the poorer countries of Europe like Ireland and Norway gradually rose.
But Barry Eichengreen, another economist at Berkeley, and others argue that pre-World War I globalization differed from today's in important ways that should give policy makers pause.
"Foreign investment is riskier in today's world of floating currency exchanges than in the days of the gold standard," Mr. Eichengreen said in an interview. Foreign governments were committed to redeeming their local currency with fixed amounts of gold and had to maintain a high degree of fiscal and monetary discipline to keep this pledge. Today countries may devalue their currency to make it cheaper for local companies to export their goods, but the value of foreign investments may also be reduced.
This technical change is part of a larger political change, the economists say, with nations wanting to take back control of monetary policy. In the age of imperialism, keeping foreign investors happy was of paramount importance. When the Egyptian government faced bankruptcy in the late 19th century, the British government bombed the port of Alexandria and installed a new government in Cairo.
Meanwhile the autocratic governments of the 19th century could maintain stringent monetary policies even if it meant doubling unemployment, because few countries allowed more than a small percentage of their citizens to vote.
"As long as the right to vote was still limited to middle and upper-class males, those rendered unemployed when the central bank raised its discount rate and tightened monetary policy had little voice in politics," Mr. DeLong of Berkeley wrote in a recent history of 20th-century economics.
The late 19th century saw the gradual expansion of the franchise, and the rigid but efficient system of the gold standard fell apart during the era of mass politics. Today governments fear riots and internal unrest more than the blandishments of the International Monetary Fund.
These political changes were, at least in part, stimulated by the new world of trade. For although Mr. Williamson argues that trade's overall effect was beneficial, it did, in the short run, create winners and losers, and the losers began to raise their voices politically. "The arrival of cheap foreign labor drove down wages in the U.S. and elsewhere, and falling agriculture prices hurt landowners in Europe," Mr. Williamson said, leading to calls for commodities tariffs and immigration limits. "We feel that the world was better off over time because of trade, but elections are not held worldwide; they are held country by country."
It is one of the paradoxes of globalization that the changes it brought helped stimulate the growth of the national politics that ended it. In other words, the wild fluctuations in prices, employment and wage levels that came with being part of an international system created a demand for a social safety net as well as demands for protection and a halt to immigration.
Dani Rodrik, a professor of economics at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, has built on Mr. Eichengreen's work to formulate what he terms the "political trilemma of the world economy." In an e-mail interview, Mr. Rodrik said, "We can have at most two out of the following three: a) high degrees of international economic integration, b) nation-states and c) mass politics." In the 19th century, you had economic integration and nation-states but relatively little mass politics.
The European Union has responded to this trilemma by eliminating the power of nation-states to adjust their own monetary policy and creating a new Europe-wide currency and political authority. But whether other countries will be willing to lose elements of national control and identity is far from clear. "I think the European case is an exception. It's a reaction to the wars of the 20th century," Mr. Bordo said. "Other countries attach a lot of weight to monetary and political sovereignty."
Mr. Rodrik is more optimistic, predicting in a recent paper the emergence of what he calls, "global federalism in which the reach of markets, jurisdictions and politics are each truly and commensurately global."
Others are struck by how stubborn the forces of national and regional identity and how slow the growth of world trade has been, despite its obvious economic logic. "I think it will be gradual," Maurice Obstfeld, another Berkeley economist, said in an interview. "Investors hold a puzzling small share of their portfolios in foreign equities. There are still great differences in prices in different markets. Integration has a long way to go."

HEADLINE: Drop in 2 Gauges Raises Some Expectationson Rate Cuts 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Industrial commodity prices fell this week to their lowest level in 15 years and the yield on the two-year Treasury note dropped to its lowest point since the fall of 1992, not long after the last recession.
 The decline in both indicates that the economy, in the United States and in the rest of the world, may be weaker than had been thought, according to some analysts. That means that Federal Reserve policy makers may cut interest rates more than expected when they meet on Aug. 21. 
 They are widely expected to reduce the benchmark short-term interest rate a quarter point, to 3.5 percent. Many forecasters had thought that such a rate cut would be the last one for a while. But now more analysts are expecting additional cuts, with some even predicting that the central bank will move the short-term rate below 3 percent. 
The government reported yesterday that producer prices at the finished level fell 0.9 percent in July. The core rate, which excludes food and energy, rose just 0.2 percent, showing that price pressures are restrained and giving the Fed room to move interest rates lower without inflationary concerns, analysts said. Over the last 12 months, producer prices have risen just 1.5 percent. Only three months ago, producer prices were rising at a 3.7 percent annual rate.
Some of this price restraint has come from the decline this year in overall commodity prices, which are down 12 percent. The CRB/Bridge index of raw industrial prices, which is seen as a barometer of manufacturing demand, fell on Tuesday to 238.28, its lowest point since October 1986, and bounced up only a few tenths of a point by the end of the week. The current level of the index, which includes prices for copper, lead, steel, tin, zinc, rubber and cotton, puts it more than 20 points below the 260 level it reached after the end of the last recession in 1991.
James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan, said the fall in commodity prices "is reflecting, I think, the global industrial recession."
"It tells you," he said, "not to expect the United States to rebound rapidly out of this slump."
In the bond market yesterday, the yield on the two-year Treasury note was 3.68 percent, down from 3.73 percent on Thursday and its lowest level since October 1992. Yields of long-term interest rates have also declined recently, with the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note falling to 4.98 percent, from 5.03 percent on Thursday and from 5.52 percent in May, its high for the year.
"I think there is still some denial out there about how long this will go on," Maureen Allyn, chief economist at Zurich Scudder Investments, said of the current economic slowdown. She said the sharp drop in corporate profits this year probably meant more big layoffs to come as companies try to reduce costs.
She also said that despite the six interest rate cuts by the Fed since Jan. 3, "we really shouldn't expect Fed policy to have any traction until the first quarter of next year."
Mr. Glassman of J. P. Morgan said, "There is a feeling in the markets that what is going on around us is getting worse."
He said the next eight weeks would be critical for the economic outlook because some sign of a bounce is awaited from the spending that is expected to be inspired by the $38 billion in tax rebates now on their way to American taxpayers. "If in the next eight weeks we just get more of the same economic news, then we are in a worse slowdown than people thought," he said.
He is expecting a quarter point cut in the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks -- the Fed's interest rate benchmark -- this month and another later in the year.
Ms. Allyn still thinks that a quarter point this month will be the last rate reduction for a while. This is because she expects tax rebates to perk up consumer spending. "I think they will come through pretty nicely," she said of the tax rebates.
The July decline in overall producer prices for finished goods was the sharpest since August 1993, led by a 5.8 percent drop in energy, including a 17.7 percent decline in prices for gasoline. But prices for residential electricity rose 2.2 percent last month, after a 1.5 percent decline in June.
Producer prices for foods also fell, by 0.6 percent. Prices for fruits and vegetables plunged 13.6 percent after a 1.7 percent decline in June. Prices for consumer goods, excluding food and energy, inched 0.1 percent higher as prices rose for passenger car radial tires, book publishing, pharmaceutical preparations, women's apparel and light motor trucks. Prices fell for some paper products and health items, cigarettes, passenger cars, cosmetics, and household appliances.

HEADLINE: The Mideast Maelstrom 

 BODY:
The escalating violence in the Mideast is horrifying, but the Palestinian leadership seems unwilling to rein it in. Israel, for all its military might, seems unable to deter it. Thursday's suicide bombing in Jerusalem, claimed by the militant Islamic group Hamas, was one of the worst outrages of the conflict. Israel's swift retaliation against Palestinian Authority targets, including the symbol of Palestinian political presence in East Jerusalem, was understandable but is unlikely to calm the situation. 
 The Bush administration cannot simply stand aside until both sides are prepared to stop fighting. Only America has sufficient influence with Israeli and Palestinian leaders to reverse the dangerous dynamic. In the current atmosphere it seems unrealistic to talk about questions of boundaries, settlements, refugees and Jerusalem. The first need and only achievable goal right now is to stop the killing. That will require both sides to take difficult political decisions, which Washington must encourage. 
 Yasir Arafat may not be able to prevent every Palestinian terrorist from attacking Israelis, but he has formidable means of political persuasion and police compulsion at his disposal. He cannot present himself to Israelis and Americans as the leader of the Palestinian people and then plead powerlessness to order and enforce a cease-fire. As a result of the Oslo agreements, he commands a large and well-armed Palestinian police force. By not effectively preventing terrorism, he shares responsibility for incidents like Thursday's suicide bombing. By not arresting known terrorists, he plays into the hands of Israelis who favor assassination strikes against Palestinian militants. A concerted campaign against violence would be resisted by groups like Hamas. But it would serve the Palestinian people as a whole, offering the only realistic path to ending Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and reviving the Palestinian economy.
Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, can help by reaffirming that once an effective cease-fire is in place he will ease blockades against Palestinian workers and traders. He should also support increased international aid for development projects serving Palestinians, while pledging that a cease-fire will lead to serious discussions about a final peace treaty. 
Washington needs to persuade Mr. Arafat that an effective cease-fire is necessary for further diplomatic progress. It ought to encourage Mr. Sharon to resist more hawkish Israelis who dream of purely military solutions. Those are formidable diplomatic challenges. But without Washington's active involvement, the violence is unlikely to abate.

HEADLINE: Cryptographer Held in E-Book Case Prefers Paper 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
Dmitri Sklyarov rarely reads electronic books. "There are almost no e-books in Russian," said Mr. Sklyarov, the 26-year-old Moscow cryptographer who was arrested in Las Vegas last month under a 1998 digital copyright law. "I prefer paper books. They're much easier to carry with me, and can be read anywhere."
 In fact, most people still prefer paper books. Unlike music and film, books have yet to be popularly accepted in digital format. Nevertheless, the nascent market has heightened the publishing industry's sensitivity to the potential for digital piracy, enough so that it has initiated the first criminal case under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. And Mr. Sklyarov is the first to be charged. 
 Mr. Sklyarov, who is now free on bail in Northern California, was charged with trafficking of a program that decrypts Adobe Systems' software for electronic books, allowing them to be copied.
The lanky, mild-mannered father of two spoke about the case, and his path to a career in cryptography, in an interview yesterday, four days after he was released from a jail in San Jose, Calif. 
Mr. Sklyarov was arrested at Def Con, a conference for hackers, on July 16, the day after he had given a presentation on electronic book security to an audience of several hundred. As he was preparing to check out of the Alexis Park Hotel to go to the airport, F.B.I. agents told him and a co-worker to put their hands on the wall. According to a statement by the co-worker, Mr. Sklyarov laughed, thinking the F.B.I. agents were part of a bad joke, because the presence of federal agents is a longrunning theme at the counterculture Def Con convention. 
He spent three weeks in captivity as he was being transferred from Las Vegas to Oklahoma City to San Jose, where Adobe is based. 
"I can't say I was depressed or panicked," he said yesterday. "I was curious that I was in such a situation, because I never considered I would be in jail in anytime of my life."
He did say he misses his wife, Oksana, and his two children, ages 2 and 4 months. 
"My children both are very little," he said. "I don't know if they understand what happened." 
Released on $50,000 bond on Monday, Mr. Sklyarov, as a condition of his release, went to live in Cupertino with Serguei Osokine, a Russian-American software engineer who agreed to be Mr. Sklyarov's custodian. Other conditions include limiting travel to the northern district of California and checking in with a court monitor.
His next court hearing is scheduled for Aug. 23.
For the time being, he spends most of his free time meeting with his lawyers. 
At his lawyer's office in San Francisco yesterday, Mr. Sklyarov was prevented from discussing the specifics of the arrest or his work at ElcomSoft, his Moscow-based employer where he worked for more than a year. But he did speak of his life in Russia.
He said he had long been interested in math, computers and cryptography. He was born in Moscow in 1974 to two computer engineers and studied math intensively in high school before attending Bauman Moscow State Technical University.
His work on electronic book security started as an academic interest that was a result of the process of elimination. DVD's, a much more popular digital medium that has also attracted the attention of cryptographers, would seem a more obvious candidate for security research. But e-books were easier to obtain in Russia. 
The title of his graduate dissertation is "Methods of Testing E-book Security: How Secure Is Your Book."
"E-books is just one application of security," he said. "It's not special. It's not the aim of my life." 
But Adobe sees that security as critical to its economic future. It approached the F.B.I. after asking ElcomSoft to stop selling its Advanced eBook Processor.
The federal government continues to pursue the case, despite the fact that Adobe later pulled its support of the prosecution.
The arrest has made Mr. Sklyarov a rallying point for critics of the copyright act. He has been the subject of songs and opinion pieces. Web sites and e-mail lists monitor Mr. Sklyarov's situation. Demonstrators have protested in dozens of cities across the United States and even in Moscow with photographs of Mr. Sklyarov.
"When I was released I was impressed with the scale of the movement, of how many people were involved," Mr. Sklyarov said. 
A few dozen supporters attended his Monday bail hearing, including one who e-mailed a dispatch from his personal digital assistant around the world. 
Mr. Sklyarov says he has been struck by the level of organizing among his supporters.

HEADLINE: Cautious Concern on Arena Is Voiced by Newark Council 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, AUG. 10 

 BODY:
For the last several months, as officials around New Jersey have debated whether to help build a sports arena in downtown Newark, this city has spoken with one voice in support of it. 
 But this week some muted qualms were heard from the Newark City Council. In a carefully worded letter, the Council said that while it continued its "longstanding support" for the arena, it had a number of concerns about the plan -- including the amount of influence the city and the Council itself would have over the arena. 
 The letter was sent to the Senate sponsors of the bill that would allow the YankeeNets, which owns the Nets and the Devils, to build an arena in downtown Newark. It comes as the office of Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco is negotiating with Assembly leaders for their support of the $355 million arena to replace the Continental Arena at the Meadowlands, which would be demolished. Mr. DiFrancesco shepherded the proposal through the Senate at the close of the legislative session in June. 
Mr. DiFrancesco recently said that he thought the negotiations would be completed in time for a special session of the Legislature in early September. At that time, they will also consider measures intended to help both the southern part of the state and Bergen County, which would lose the Continental Arena. 
"The reason we are extremely careful is that we don't want anyone among the opponents of the arena to view this as an excuse for suggesting that Newark itself was split and doesn't want this economic engine," Gayle Chaneyfield-Jenkins, councilwoman-at-large, said. "We are all practicing some restraint for the first time and not making it a political issue."
But at least one member of the Council, Cory A. Booker, said that the letter was a sign of deep frustration with Mayor Sharpe James, the city's chief cheerleader and negotiator on the arena project and, as a state senator, one of the cosponsors of the legislation authorizing the project.
Mr. Booker, a frequent critic of the mayor, said that Mr. James had "failed to keep us in the loop" during the months of discussions and that consequently the legislation passed by the Senate did not reflect important community interests.
Sounding a conciliatory note yesterday, Mr. James conceded in a statement that in the rush to draft the legislation in the closing days of the session, "there were some omissions." He invited the City Council to join the discussions to fine tune the measure and offered whatever information it needed to participate. 
In their letter, the council members suggested strict limits to the boundaries for the proposed sports and entertainment district around the arena, where a new 6 percent state sales tax will be charged to pay off the funds the YankeeNets is borrowing to build the arena.
Both Mr. Booker and Ms. Chaneyfield-Jenkins said that they wanted to be assured that the sales tax in much of Newark where local residents shop would remain at 3 percent and that they would not be disproportionately bearing the burden of paying for the project.
The Council also expressed concern about wide authority given to the governing agency of the sports and entertainment district over just about everything that takes place within it. It called for specific provisions in the law for "consenting authority" for Newark officials.
The legislation calls for a local advisory council to the state's sports and entertainment district, with four seats for "public members." But no role is specified for the Council. The Council said there should be one seat for a member, a suggestion Mr. James immediately endorsed. 
The letter also called for specific language in the legislation requiring affirmative action in construction employment, purchasing and contracts within the district.
Ms. Chaneyfield-Jenkins said that in January the Council had hired financial, legal and lobbying consultants to evaluate the arena project. "We need to make sure that our consultants can analyze the deal to make sure that the city of Newark and its citizens are represented fairly," she said. 
"This is not about egos," she said, "although I am sure there are one or two among us who are ready to throw a brick for political ambition."

HEADLINE: BIG AIRLINES RELAX STAY-OVER POLICY FOR LOWER FARES 

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
For more than 20 years, the Saturday night stay-over has been the bane of corporate travel, with airlines forcing businesspeople to choose between being home for the weekend or getting a cheap fare. The airlines' bet -- that business travelers would pay more for less restrictive tickets -- paid off handsomely, helping turn them into the carriers' most profitable customers.
 Now, though, the nation's biggest airlines -- mired in a deep financial slump and hoping to lure back business travelers who have been staying home or straying to low-fare regional competitors -- are dumping the stay-over requirement on some of their most competitive routes. 
 The No. 1 carrier, American Airlines, said yesterday that it was matching No. 2 United Airlines in cutting fares and dropping mandatory Saturday stay-overs on selected routes into and out of Chicago. The next three biggest airlines -- Delta, Northwest and Continental -- quickly did the same. 
With the economy slowing, business travel began falling off in February. Since then, numerous rounds of fare cuts have presented travelers with some of the deepest discounts on airline tickets in recent memory. 
As recently as mid-May, a nonrefundable seven-day advance purchase round-trip fare without a Saturday night stay-over requirement was about $832 for travel between Los Angeles and Chicago. United's new discount fare for selected flights on that route, also without a Saturday stay, is $376 and also must be purchased seven days in advance. 
The airlines now hope to stimulate business travel by relaxing the Saturday-night-stay rule on certain routes. But whatever success they have could damage the hotel business, another industry struggling amid the economic slowdown. Hotels catering to business travelers have been able to fill more rooms on weekends as companies forced more employees to buy cheaper tickets with Saturday night stay-overs.
"To the extent that airlines cut back on Saturday-night-stay requirements, it will definitely have a negative effect on many hotels -- in a year that is already very weak for the hotel industry," said Robert Mandelbaum, an analyst with the research firm PKF Consulting.
Over all, air travel is no worse than even with last summer. But with corporations reducing trips or insisting that employees use cheaper advance purchase fares, the airlines' per-seat revenue has plunged.
Last month, the Air Transport Association, an airline trade group, abruptly revised a prediction it had made in May that domestic airlines would make $2 billion in profits this year. Instead, they are expected to lose $1.5 billion -- which would make this the industry's worst year in a quarter century.
United, which set off the round of lower fares and loosened restrictions on Thursday, said the new policies represented a "fundamental shift" in pricing strategy, at least for the eight affected routes. They include travel between Chicago and Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, Boston, Washington, Denver and San Francisco; the changes are effective for flights on Sept. 5 and after. 
"This is not a 'now you see it now you don't type' fare sale with a quick booking window and travel period," said Joe Hopkins, a spokesman for United. "This is open-ended. It's going to be there for a while." Airlines are restricted by law from discussing future rate plans, and none would say whether they were considering dropping the restrictions on other routes.
Airlines acknowledge that the Saturday-night-stay requirement for cheaper advance purchase fares was conceived to discourage business travelers from flying at the discounts that leisure travelers routinely expect. Until Thursday, it was an all but sacrosanct component of airline pricing.
"It's a huge issue for business travelers," said Thom Nulty, president of Navigant International, a travel management company based in Denver that specializes in corporate accounts.
"That has been the one barrier that has always prevented them from taking advantage of air fares that they see advertised in the paper," Mr. Nulty said. "We get people all the time who say: 'What do you mean the ticket's going to be $2,200? I just saw it in the paper for $300.' And we have to say, 'Well, yeah, but you have to read the fine print. To get the $300 fare you have to stay over Saturday night, and you only want to go for two days on a Tuesday.' "
Just how long fare cuts and relaxed rules will last, or whether they will expand, is anyone's guess, a number of industry analysts said. They generally agreed, though, that the airlines may be facing a future in which they cannot depend so heavily on business travelers, whose higher fares in recent years have represented as much as two-thirds of the carriers' revenues.
Officials of several major airlines said that United's move might have been aimed not just at resuscitating business travel but at batting down competition in Chicago from a low-fare competitor, Amtran Inc.'s ATA. ATA, the 11th-largest domestic airline, operates out of the city's secondary airport, Midway. These competitors said they thought any further relaxation of Saturday-night-stay requirements would be temporary and limited to highly competitive routes.
Mr. Hopkins, the United spokesman, acknowledged concern about competitors of every stripe.
"We not only battle American Airlines and everybody else at O'Hare, but down at Midway Airport, you've got the likes of ATA and Southwest," he said. "There's a perception if you live in Chicago that you have to go down to Midway to get low fares. And that's part of what's behind what we did."
Mark Slitt, a spokesman for American Airlines, said, "You need to be competitive, especially in times when business travel is down." American had never before relaxed the Saturday-night-stay requirement for business fares, but decided to match United because "business travel is down dramatically, and we're looking for ways to entice our business travelers back," he added.
Mr. Nulty, the travel manager, said that United's move was "incredibly bold." He expects it will not be permanent, even on the selected routes, but suspects that airlines may extend the benefits to additional routes.
Ultimately, however, "the airlines hope to eventually start cranking fares back up to where they think they're supposed to be, once business travelers return to the game," Mr. Nulty said.
"The airlines know they cannot raise the prices for leisure travelers, who just don't go if the price isn't right," he added. "But they really can't afford to give that low fare to business travelers indefinitely. My advice to business travelers is: This is an opportunity that's not going to last forever; jump on it."

HEADLINE: Tiny Part of Settlement Money Is Spent on Tobacco Control 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

 BODY:
The settlement was perceived as a major victory for antismoking crusaders and state agencies paying vast sums to cover the health care costs of smoking. To end years of litigation, the major tobacco companies agreed to pay 46 states $205 billion over 25 years, with the expectation that a large part of it would pay for tobacco-use prevention programs.
 At least that is how the attorneys general who negotiated the deal understood it. But three years and $21.2 billion into the payout schedule, states are spending far below levels that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended they spend for programs that would effectively reduce smoking. 
 Instead, settlement negotiators say, politics and a slowing economy have trumped promises to fight smoking, leading many states to use the money for other needs, like public schools, elderly care and balancing the budget.
"It's moral treason to me," said Michael A. Moore, the Mississippi attorney general who led the legal campaign against the tobacco companies. "We got all this money, then legislatures and governors who were not even in this fight act like the money fell out of heaven and spend it on the political whim of the day."
A new report by the National Conference of State Legislatures, found that the 46 states that joined in the settlement, plus the four that reached separate deals with the tobacco companies -- Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas -- have used 5 percent of the money so far for smoking prevention and cessation programs.
In June, a similar undertaking by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, found that states were using "about 7 percent" of the settlement money for new or expanded tobacco programs.
The difference reflects the source of information. The newer report uses data from the legislative branch of state governments; the Congressional study, from the executive branch.
In either case, the amounts fall well short of the recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control that states use at least 19 percent of their tobacco money annually, from $8.1 million in a less populous state like Alaska to $165.1 million in California, for tobacco-control programs. 
Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a nonprofit group, said that once the money started flowing, many states abandoned earlier assertions that epidemic levels of smoking had to be addressed.
"That's why they said they were settling the lawsuit," Mr. Myers said. "This is truly a case of promises made and promises not kept."
But to some governors and state lawmakers, the centers' recommendations were not mandates.
While some states, like Idaho (46.8 percent), Nebraska (30.9) and Maine (27.0) have chosen to allocate sizable amounts of their settlement for smoking prevention, according to the state legislatures' report, four states -- Alabama, Arizona, Michigan and Tennessee -- are using all the money for other purposes.
Scott D. Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, said some states felt justified in shifting money from tobacco prevention programs because they were forced in the past to add money to health care ones.
As reasonable as that is to many state officials, some attorneys general who were involved in the settlement negotiations insist that states have always wrangled with priorities and that the point of the settlement was to solve a specific problem.
"The laggards should be publicly flogged, and the good guys should be lauded," said Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, a state that has used 1.5 percent of $401.8 million in settlement money for prevention programs.
"And now," Mr. Blumenthal added, "the public has become complacent. There isn't that sense of outrage anymore and it may become difficult just to sustain the levels we have."

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld in Russia: Less ABM, More Warm Ties 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is about to travel 10,000 miles to Moscow and back for one day of talks on missile defense and nuclear reductions at which no agreements are expected -- because, many officials believe, the outcome is preordained and the American position has prevailed.
 On missile defense, the United States is unyielding. 
 President Bush has said that the treaty that limits American missile systems is obsolete and that he will not slow testing or deployment. It was Mr. Rumsfeld who wrote the report on ballistic missile threats that poured the fuel and lighted the fire under Republicans who support accelerated missile development and withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. 
On strategic arms reductions, Moscow can barely sustain its current nuclear arsenal, anyway. Defense Department officials also say if current economic trends continue, Russia will be forced to slash its 6,000 warheads, to 2,500, 2,000 or even to 1,500 over the next decade or so, regardless of arms control consultations with the United States.
So what is on the table for the talks on Monday? What can be negotiated? Why is Mr. Rumsfeld bothering to go to Moscow?
"The idea is to build a new relationship between the United States and Russia, a relationship that will be entirely different from the relationship that existed between the United States and the Soviet Union during the cold war," a senior Defense Department official said today. "And it's a relationship that will require us to be moving beyond some of the institutions of the cold war such as the ABM treaty."
Mr. Rumsfeld's trip fits into a schedule of rolling consultations between senior administration officials and their Russian counterparts on nuclear policy, proliferation, economic development and commercial cooperation ahead of Mr. Bush's next two meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin, in Shanghai in October and then at Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., the next month.
Presidents Bush and Putin have instructed their national security teams to link consultations on missile defense with talks on reducing nuclear warheads, and the administration would certainly welcome a deal with Moscow to scrap the ABM treaty and slash both sides' warhead arsenals.
Russian agreement to such a bargain would certainly silence the vocal opposition to missile defense in Europe and among Congressional Democrats.
But if a deal cannot be struck, then Mr. Rumsfeld's trip can be cited as proof of Mr. Bush's good faith effort to bring along the Russians arm in arm as a respected strategic partner before the president moves ahead and invokes the six-month notification process allowed by the ABM treaty to withdraw from the pact.
The United States has planned an aggressive test schedule that by late next spring is widely expected to conflict with the treaty.
In Moscow, Mr. Rumsfeld will consult on nuclear issues, of course, but he will also conduct a bit of public diplomacy with the Russian news media, some personal diplomacy with Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov -- and no small amount of straightforward American diplomacy.
The distinct channels by which the United States managed its relations with the Soviet Union and which traditionally gave the State Department dominion over arms control are blurring in this post-cold-war era of transforming relations with Russia, the senior Pentagon official said today.
"I think it's inevitable that there will be a fair amount of overlap," the official said. "What we're talking about fundamentally is a relationship, and when you have a normal and healthy relationship, the elements interrelate. And so the quality of political relations, economic relations and commercial relations have strategic significance. They're part of the issue of strategic stability."
As evidence of the overlap, Mr. Rumsfeld's entourage to Moscow includes Douglas J. Feith, under secretary of defense for policy, as well as John R. Bolton, under secretary of state for arms control and international security.
In preparation for the meetings on Monday in Moscow, Mr. Feith led two days of talks at the Pentagon this week with a delegation of Russians headed by Col. Gen. Yuri Baluyevsky, first deputy chief of staff.
One presentation was by Lt. Gen. Ronald T. Kadish, director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, who reported on successful test last month of an interceptor to shoot down ballistic missiles.
The multimedia briefing on how the "kill vehicle" smashed into a dummy warhead high over the Pacific so focused the Russians' attention, officials said, that General Kadish was asked to return for a second day of questions and answers.

HEADLINE: Administration Backs Affirmative Action Plan 

BYLINE:  By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
In its first opportunity to take a stance on affirmative action, the Bush administration asked the Supreme Court tonight to uphold a Transportation Department program intended to help minority contractors.
 In a brief filed with the court, the Justice Department took the same position as the Clinton administration had in the case, which grew out of a challenge brought years ago by a white-owned construction company in Colorado Springs. 
 The company, Adarand Constructors, had submitted the low bid for a Transportation Department contract. But the contract was awardedto a minority contractor as part of the department's "disadvantaged business enterprise" program. Adarand sued, challenging the policy. 
The case has become somewhat muddled since the Supreme Court first ruled on it in 1995. Then, by a 5-to-4 vote, the justices set strict limits on federal affirmative action programs, ruling that such programs must be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government interest.
The court found that the program appeared flawed and should be reviewed by lower courts to see whether using race as a factor was justified in the award of federal contracts.
Last September, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, said the program met the "strict scrutiny" test and was constitutional.
Moreover, since the Supreme Court's first ruling, the program has been sharply altered.
Under the revised program, even white-owned small businesses can apply for consideration as a disadvantaged business. In addition, the new version of the program no longer distributes financial bonuses to contractors that use minority-owned companies as subcontractors.
In January, during its last day in office, the Clinton administration argued that the program now met the Supreme Court's objections and that the court should decline to reopen the matter. When the justices voted in March to hear a renewed appeal by Adarand, the Bush administration faced its first significant test on affirmative action.
In its brief filed tonight, the Justice Department said that "the program is not unconstitutional."
The 50-page brief cited the program changes that let companies that are economically disadvantaged apply for the same preferences in receiving contracts. The department argued that the program was revised to minimize harm "to innocent third parties" and to create "as level a playing field as possible."
But the Bush administration brief also appears to accept an underlying tenet of affirmative action: that some businesses have suffered as a result of their minority ownership.
During the presidential campaign, George W. Bush said he opposed quotas but spoke of a need for "affirmative access," a stance that left his position on the issue ambiguous. 
The decision today by the Bush administration was sharply criticized by traditional opponents of affirmative action. Linda Chavez, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative group that studies affirmative action programs, said she was deeply disappointed.
"It's both bad policy and bad politics," said Ms. Chavez, who had been President Bush's choice for secretary of labor before she withdrew her nomination. "First of all, it's never good politics to betray your principles, and all the people involved in making this policy are people who have opposed racial preferences." 
Attorney General John Ashcroft was one person Ms. Chavez cited. As a senator in 1998, Mr. Ashcroft voted against the program.
But Mindy Tucker, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said that "this is John Ashcroft doing what he said he would do in the confirmation process," noting that Mr. Ashcroft had pledged in his Senate testimony to defend even those laws with which he disagreed.
Georgina Verdugo, the executive director of Americans for a Fair Chance, a coalition of several major civil rights groups that advocates affirmative action, said she was pleasantly surprised by the Bush administration's approach.
"It's the administration's first real statement on affirmative action," she said. "This particular program has been through so many changes it is quite clear that it now meets the Supreme Court's requirements that it be better tailored as a remedy."
The case is to be heard by the Supreme Court sometime this fall.

HEADLINE: Earnings Rise 21% at Berkshire Hathaway 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: OMAHA, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the holding company run by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, said today that earnings rose 21 percent in the second quarter, helped by higher gains from sales of investments and profits contributed from recently acquired companies.
 Berkshire Hathaway said it earned $773 million, or $506 a share, in the quarter ended June 30. 
The profit included $420 million in gains from selling investments. It earned $640 million, or $421 a share, in the period a year earlier, when it posted a profit of $395 million from sales of investments. 
 Insurance is the main business of the company, which is based in Omaha. But Berkshire Hathaway also has subsidiaries in a range of old-economy sectors from furniture to jewelry to aircraft leasing, and wide holdings in the stock of other businesses. It said profits from its operations rose to $353 million, or $231 a share, in the quarter, from $245 million, or $161 a share, a year earlier.
Berkshire Hathaway's stock, which has never been split in Mr. Buffett's 36 years in charge, fell $1,050, to $68,800 a share, before the results were announced.

HEADLINE: Clinton, as John Q. Public, Campaigns for Array of Causes 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
With the $10-million-plus advance he secured for his memoirs, Bill Clinton would seem to be on his way to becoming a very rich man. In September, he will become even richer, when he undertakes a two-week paid speaking tour of Australia and Southeast Asia, continuing a string of such engagements since he left office. 
 But if Mr. Clinton is testing the limits of the marketplace on his own behalf -- charging a minimum of $125,000 for domestic speeches and $250,000 for international ones -- he is also beginning to use it for less self-interested ends, stitching together an eclectic array of causes and nonprofit organizations to which he is lending his support. Their common thread is the use of private resources to tackle public problems. 
 So the capital of American capitalism is proving a good fit. The former president is beginning to look to New York's corporate leaders and their deep pockets. 
Mr. Clinton's network in New York alone includes many people capable of making very large charitable contributions, although he says he is still trying to figure out which of the many people he got to know in the White House actually live in New York. A reception last Tuesday for an AIDS fund drew people like Donald Trump; Harvey Weinstein; Dr. Samuel D. Waksal, the chief executive of ImClone, the city's largest biotech employer; Jerry Inzerillo, executive vice president at Sun International; and John Sykes, the president of VH-1. Together, the crowd -- fewer than 100 people -- could probably provide AIDS drugs for tens of thousands of people. 
On a very small scale, Mr. Clinton is re-creating an informal cabinet. His staff of 10 -- paid for by the General Services Administration, his speechmaking and his foundation -- includes a domestic policy coordinator, and soon will include an international policy coordinator. A group of informal advisers, including John D. Podesta, Erskine Bowles, Bruce Lindsey and Cheryl Mills, receive memos on his future work. 
Given that his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, is still in the government, Mr. Clinton is careful to coordinate his activities, and his causes, with her. Their schedulers talk. Their press people talk. Their chiefs of staff talk.
The issues he has attached his name to so far have arisen from a combination of his personal passions and his relationships with world leaders. A phone call to India's prime minister after the earthquake in the state of Gujarat in January, for example, led to the creation, and Mr. Clinton's chairmanship, of the American India Foundation, which has raised more than $7 million to rebuild villages devastated by the earthquake. 
Top executives at companies like McKenzie Consulting, Citibank, PepsiCo and United Airlines are Indian-Americans, and they are working closely with Mr. Clinton to raise money. A prolific fund-raiser, Mr. Clinton has spoken free of charge at three benefits for the foundation, which intends not only to rebuild 100 villages, but also to leave residents with better homes, schools and infrastructure than they had before the earthquake.
He has also agreed to head the board of advisers of the International AIDS Trust, which also relies on private contributions, to try to develop effective prevention programs and methods for delivering treatment. He now talks about influencing policymakers to make the right decisions. 
And Mr. Clinton, who as president preached the power of government to uplift, now talks about the limits of government. At a news conference recently, he sounded suspiciously like the man who replaced him in the Oval Office. "There is no way government can do this alone," he said of tackling the AIDS crisis. 
Stemming the crisis, he said, will require getting hundreds of thousands, even millions of people, to make decisions they would not normally make -- to take a drug, or use a condom, for example. Government, he suggested, is not naturally suited to force those decisions.
And whatever government does, Mr. Clinton said, "there will still be a lot of work to do for private citizens." Of course, he can no longer direct tax dollars as he sees fit. Instead, he must appeal for charitable contributions, as he did last week.
On another front, Mr. Clinton has developed a plan with City Year, a corporate-financed national service program for young people, to create the Clinton Democracy Fellows. Young people will come from South Africa, under a plan enthusiastically supported by Nelson Mandela, and eventually perhaps from Bosnia and Ireland, for a City Year in Little Rock, Ark. The hope is that they will return home to develop City Year programs of their own, and to become leaders in their own countries.
Closer to his new home, the question is how Mr. Clinton will fulfill his pledge to be a good neighbor in Harlem, beyond buying things like office supplies in the neighborhood, as aides say they plan to do. Mr. Clinton is trying to figure out how he can best help the private sector help Harlem, then replicate that model in other urban centers and in needy areas like American Indian reservations. 
Mr. Clinton met recently with business leaders and Henry R. Kravis, the chairman of the New York City Investment Fund, which pools private capital to try to create jobs. They discussed the two tiers of businesses in Harlem -- those that need more capital to grow, others that need help to stay alive in the area's increasingly ruthless real estate market -- and how best to help them. 
Mr. Clinton and his aides are looking in particular to Deborah C. Wright, president of Harlem's Carver Bancorp, for guidance. She said her first advice was, "Take some time -- it's a complicated assignment." 
A lot of the issues Mr. Clinton is passionate about, like using economic development to help small businesses, "are tough to move," she cautioned. The question, she said, is what can an ex-president do?
As Ms. Wright sees it, Mr. Clinton can use his bully pulpit to get technical assistance for Harlem's small businesses from major institutions and universities. And he can use his ample Rolodex to bring the venture capital and corporate customers that will enable minority businesses in Harlem to grow in scale and create more jobs. 
Of course, even as the private citizen Mr. Clinton is now, figuring out how to help Harlem, with its array of competing leaders and constituencies, is hardly an apolitical task. Ms. Wright said she recently heard Harlem referred to as "the Jurassic Park of politics," a description she found fitting. 
"The best I can tell him is good luck," Ms. Wright said. "But he's been a politician a lot longer than I have. I don't think he needs any advice from me on that score."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 13, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about former President Bill Clinton's support of charitable causes and nonprofit groups misstated the name of a consulting firm with which he is working to raise money. It is McKinsey & Company, not McKenzie Consulting. The article also referred imprecisely to the financing of City Year, a service program involved in planning for Clinton Democracy Fellows. While it has received $7.4 million in corporate contributions, those were exceeded by its government grants.
An article on Saturday about former President Bill Clinton's support of charitable causes misstated the name of a consulting firm that employs an executive with whom he is raising money. And a correction in this space on Monday misstated Mr. Clinton's relationship with the firm. The firm is McKinsey & Company, not McKenzie Consulting. Mr. Clinton's involvement is with the top executive, not with the firm itself.

HEADLINE: The Dirt in the New Machine 

BYLINE:  By Blaine Harden; Blaine Harden is a national correspondent for The Times. His last article for the magazine was about a doctor who died fighting the ebola virus.

 BODY:
Before you make another call on that cell phone, take a moment, close your eyes and reflect on all you've done for Mama Doudou, queen of the rain-forest whores.
 Thanks to dollars that you and millions like you have spent on cell phones and Sony PlayStations, Mama Doudou had a knockout spring season in a mining camp called Kuwait, deep in central Africa. Kuwait -- a name suggesting big money from below ground -- was one of 20 illegal mines hacked in the past year out of the Okapi Faunal Reserve, a protected area in the Ituri rain forest of eastern Congo. The reserve is named after a reclusive, big-eared relative of the giraffe that is found only in Congo. Along with about 4,000 okapi, the reserve is home to a rich assemblage of monkeys (13 species), an estimated 10,000 forest elephants and about the same number of Mbuti people, often called pygmies, who live by hunting, gathering and trading. 
 Mama Doudou, though, didn't mess with wildlife or pygmies. She sold overpriced bread in the mining camp and negotiated terms of endearment among 300 miners and 37 prostitutes. For a miner to secure the affections of a prostitute, he had to bring Mama Doudou some of the precious ore he was digging up in the reserve: a gritty, superheavy mud called coltan. 
Coltan is abundant and relatively easy to find in eastern Congo. All a miner has to do is chop down great swaths of the forest, gouge S.U.V.-size holes in streambeds with pick and shovel and spend days up to his crotch in muck while sloshing water around in a plastic washtub until coltan settles to the bottom. (Coltan is three times heavier than iron, slightly lighter than gold.) If he is strong and relentless and the digging is good, a miner can produce a kilogram a day. Earlier this year, that was worth $80 -- a remarkable bounty in a region where most people live on 20 cents a day.
Coltan is the muck-caked counterpoint to the brainier-than-thou, environmentally friendly image of the high-tech economy. The wireless world would grind to a halt without it. Coltan, once it is refined in American and European factories, becomes tantalum, a metallic element that is a superb conductor of electricity, highly resistant to heat. Tantalum powder is a vital ingredient in the manufacture of capacitors, the electronic components that control the flow of current inside miniature circuit boards. Capacitors made of tantalum can be found inside almost every laptop, pager, personal digital assistant and cell phone.
Mama Doudou, who is 45, is formally known as Doudou Wangonda, but she is called Mama because in the rain forest she is widely respected. She told me she doesn't understand what "rich white people" do with coltan. But she's exceptionally well versed in how much they pay for it. Late last year, exploding demand for tantalum powder created a temporary worldwide shortage, which contributed to Sony's difficulties in getting its new PlayStation 2 into American stores, as well as to a tenfold price increase on the world tantalum market. Mama Doudou abandoned her position as a traditional chief and joined thousands of people who walked into the Ituri forest hoping to get rich quick. 
When the price of coltan was soaring, Mama Doudou made an absolute killing. First, she sold bread to miners at a scandalous price. She made as much as $800 worth of coltan for every $50 in cash that she spent on baking supplies. Then she used what she called her "natural leadership abilities" to win election as president of the camp prostitutes, most of whom were poorly educated, town-bred women in their late teens. As president, Mama Doudou collected -- and turned over to the owner of the mine -- a variety of fees and fines related to the mating habits of miners and their women.
The normal arrangement in the camp was for a miner, after forking over a kilo of coltan to Mama Doudou, to pair off with one woman for the duration of their respective stays in the forest. The miner's "temporary wife" would cook his food, haul his water and share his bed in a shack made of sticks and leaves. In return, he would give her enough coltan to keep her in cosmetics, clothes and beer. If a miner decided that he wanted a prettier young woman to haul his water, he had to pay Mama Doudou another kilo of coltan.
"This is called the infringement fee," she explained.
Likewise, if a woman decided, as many did, to dump one miner in favor of another who happened to be a better producer of coltan, then she, too, had to pay Mama Doudou a kilo of coltan.
"This also is called the infringement fee," she said. 
Frequent swapping of "temporary wives" in an equatorial forest where hygiene was problematic and condoms all but nonexistent led to an explosion of gonorrhea.
"There was too much sofisi," Mama Doudou said, using the Swahili word for the disease. Soon half the people in Kuwait had it. Antibiotics that could knock down gonorrhea were on sale in the camp for a tomato tin of coltan (worth about $27). They sold exceptionally well.
Mama Doudou's business ventures were part of a squalid encounter between the global high-tech economy and one of the world's most thoroughly ruined countries.
Congo -- always too well endowed with natural resources and too weakly governed for its own good -- is a nation in name only. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is in the late stages of a political malady that students of modern Africa call "failed state syndrome." Roads, schools and medical clinics barely exist. Malnutrition and poverty have brought back diseases, like sleeping sickness, that had been under control. The World Health Organization recently estimated that the monthly toll of "avoidable deaths" in Congo was 72,800.
The eastern half of the country, with about 20 million residents, has no real government and no laws except the ever-changing rules imposed by invading armies from Rwanda and Uganda and roving bands of well-armed predators. 
A scalding report that was presented this spring to the United Nations Security Council said that coltan perpetuates Congo's civil war. The report, based on a six-month investigation by an expert panel, said the war "has become mainly about access, control and trade" of minerals, the most important being coltan. The one thing that unites the warring parties, according to the report, is a keen interest in making money off coltan.
"Because of its lucrative nature," the report said, the war "has created a 'win-win' situation for all belligerents. Adversaries and enemies are at times partners in business, get weapons from the same dealers and use the same intermediaries. Business has superseded security concerns."
Environmental groups have added emotional fuel to the accusations in the U.N. report by cataloging the devastation that the coltan trade has brought to Congo's wildlife. About 10,000 miners and traders have overrun Kahuzi-Biega National Park, according to a report released in May by a coalition of environmental groups. Before the civil war, the park was home to about 8,000 eastern lowland gorillas. That number may have since been reduced to fewer than 1,000, the report estimated, because miners and others in the forest are far from food supplies and must rely on bush meat. Apes are killed for food or killed in traps set for other animals. If something is not done to stop mining and poaching, the report said that the eastern lowland gorilla "will become the first great ape to be driven to extinction -- a victim of war, human greed and high technology."
While coltan extraction has taken advantage of Congo's ruin, it did not cause it. That has taken more than 110 years of misrule, during which Congo has attracted a string of shady suitors.
The most malign of the courtships began in the late 19th century, when agents of King Leopold II of the Belgians started stripping central Africa of ivory and rubber. To enforce production quotas on the locals, Leopold's agents chopped off their hands, noses and ears. Before the king was forced to trade away the hugely profitable colony in 1908, an estimated five million to eight million Congolese were killed.
In the 1960's, the Americans waded in. To fight Communism and secure access to cobalt and copper, the Central Intelligence Agency helped bring about the assassination of Congo's first democratically elected prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. That was followed by three decades of White House coddling of his successor, Mobutu Sese Seku, Africa's most famous billionaire dictator, who set a poisoned table for the chaos that followed his eventual overthrow in 1997.
Since then, Congo has been locked in a sprawling and numbingly complicated civil war that by some estimates has become the deadliest conflict in the history of independent Africa. The war has caused the deaths of 2.5 million people over the past two and a half years in eastern Congo alone, according to a recent report by the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based aid agency, which described the emergency in Congo as "perhaps worse than any to unfold in Africa in recent decades."
The Coltan story seemed clear when I flew to Congo early this summer. Globalization was causing havoc in a desperate country. For the sake of our electronic toys, guerrillas were getting rich, gorillas were getting slaughtered and the local people were getting paid next to nothing to ruin their country's environment. Traveling inside Congo, however, I found clarity on the question of coltan to be as scarce as paved roads, functioning schools or sober soldiers.
What muddied up the story, first of all, was the curiously egalitarian quality of coltan mining. Just about anyone with a shovel and a strong back can dig it up. It's easier to find and more plentiful than diamonds, which have created their own blood frenzy in Africa. It has injected hundreds of millions of dollars into an economy that had virtually ceased to function. True, much of that money has been creamed off by warlords and profiteers, and very little of it has been redistributed in social services. Some, though, has filtered down to miners, middlemen and commercants.
To discover the importance of coltan's trickle-down effect (and to meet Mama Doudou), I first had to take a spine-mashing, 13-hour ride on the back of a Yamaha trail bike over a mud track that used to be the main east-west highway across northern Congo.
The road I traveled is all but impassable to motorized vehicles, excepting a trail bike driven by someone who knows how to negotiate mammoth mudholes, many of which are deeper and longer than a New York City garbage truck, as well as when to bribe drunken rogue soldiers and when to run from them.
Riding through the reserve, I was menaced by a Congolese soldier, a member of the Front for the Liberation of Congo, a poorly disciplined rebel group supported by the Ugandan Army. He demanded my boots, explaining that he didn't have boots. He demanded money, explaining that he had none. He pointed his AK-47 at my stomach. Gunning the Yamaha, my driver sped away before the soldier, who was stumble-down drunk, could react. This encounter, my driver later explained, was normal.
In Epulu, a village that is the administrative center of the Okapi reserve, I spent an afternoon with a coltan miner named Munako Bangazuna, a quiet, wary man who stood only 4 feet 6 inches tall. Early this year, Bangazuna enjoyed what he called "my richest period." In a mine inside the Okapi reserve, he dug about a kilo of coltan a day, he said. Working seven days a week, he made more than $2,000 a month for two months in a row -- a fortune in the forest. 
He is 26 and married with children. Mining allowed him to provide his family with food and consumer goods he never dreamed he'd be able to afford. Besides food, he bought a bicycle, a radio, a foam mattress, cooking pots, dishes and clothes for himself, his wife and his kids.
Bangazuna does not claim to have spent his money wisely. The mining camp where he lived was called Boma Libala, a phrase that means "kill the marriage." It was the largest and, by reputation, nastiest mining camp in the reserve, with 3,000 miners and several hundred prostitutes. 
"I lost a lot of my money on prostitution and also on Primus," said Bangazuna, referring to a brand of Congolese beer. His wife cooked for him in Boma Libala, he said, during the time he was drinking lots of beer and spending most of his money on prostitutes. "I was lucky," he said. "She did not divorce me."
Bangazuna was hardly alone in his bad behavior. One coltan moment that particularly nauseates authorities occurred this spring in Epulu, when a drunken miner and a seminaked prostitute fornicated in broad daylight on the lawn of the primary school, in front of village children. 
Like several miners I interviewed in the reserve, a territory controlled by the Ugandan military and its rebel allies, Bangazuna was compelled to give up a slice of his coltan diggings to an extortion racket run by Ugandan soldiers.
"In the morning, when you get up, the Ugandans hand you a pack of cigarettes, and they give you two bottles of beer," said Bangazuna, explaining his daily routine. "In the evening, when you finish digging, you have to pay them back with coltan. It was very expensive. One bottle of beer cost me two spoons of coltan" -- about $8 -- and cigarettes were one spoon. If you refuse to pay or if you don't have coltan, they beat you and threaten to shoot you."
When I talked to Bangazuna, he was broke. He had spent all the money he'd earned digging coltan. He also happened to be under arrest. Game wardens (whose expenses are paid partly by donations from several American zoos) had caught him digging coltan in the reserve after he'd been warned not to do so. 
When the wardens let him go, Bangazuna confided, he planned to dig more coltan.
This spring, the price of coltan crashed, falling from $80 a kilo in March to $8 in June. As cell phone sales slumped and the Nasdaq shrank, demand for coltan from companies like Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola fell precipitously. Suddenly, a Congolese coltan miner had to dig coltan all day simply to afford to eat in a mining camp, and he had to dig for three or four days to find enough coltan to pay for the drugs that would clear up a case of sofisi.
At the Kuwait mine, everything came unglued. The prostitutes, then the merchants, then the miners and, finally, Mama Doudou herself abandoned the mine and walked out of the rain forest.
A few days before game wardens burned it to the ground, I visited another mine in the Okapi reserve. It was more accessible than Kuwait and, unlike the infamous but shut-down Boma Libala camp, where Bangazuna had squandered so much of his money, it still had a few working miners.
To get to Tuko-Tu camp, I walked for about two hours on a well-trod trail beneath a high canopy of trees. They shrouded the rain forest in permanent shadow. It rained hard as I walked, and the dark, soggy forest was threaded with filigrees of mist.
For all its gloom, the forest was about as primeval as a rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike. Every half hour or so, two or three giggly women, seemingly dressed for a party in glistening lipstick and gaudy dresses, smelling of strong perfume, would materialize out of the dank greenery. Their bare feet were caked with mud; they carried their shoes. They were prostitutes from Tuko-Tu, and they were walking out to buy bread and beer in a village on the main road.
On both sides of the footpath, a towering mainstay of the forest was dying for the sake of coltan. The eko, one of three giant trees that form the rain forest's canopy, has a durable, waterproof bark. Miners strip off a long girdle of the bark to make a trough into which they shovel coltan-bearing mud, which is then flushed with water. Stripping bark has killed thousands of eko trees in the reserve, which greatly upsets the local pygmies. They rely on the tree, whose flowers attract bees, as depots for gathering honey.
The mining camp squatted in a clearing hacked out of the forest. It was a jumble of stick huts with roofs made from forest leaves. Most of the huts were empty. The camp was down to 57 residents, from a high of 320 when coltan was at $80 a kilo. Out in front of the huts, a few toddlers stood stoically in the mud as bored young mothers picked lice from their hair. Ugandan soldiers used to come here, I was told, to force miners to buy beer and cigarettes. But they had stopped coming in May, when the price of coltan began to fizzle. There were still miners, of course, but they were out digging, deeper in the forest.
So I walked on, following a streambed. After about an hour and a half of walking, the streambed suddenly disappeared. A bombing range took its place -- or what looked like a bombing range. Craters, hundreds of them, many 10 feet deep, all of them partly filled with muck, marched on for miles through the forest -- until they ended in a cluster of about 25 miners. With shovels, picks and plastic wash tubs, they were creating more craters in the streambed.
Jean Pierre Asikima, 43, was among them. He gave up digging gold two months earlier, he said, to come into the forest in search of coltan. But the digging was poor, the price was low and he said he was losing weight in the forest. 
"I have come too late, and soon I will quit," he said, standing in a crater he had dug, waist-deep in muddy water that was the color of chicken gravy. 
Still, Asikima worked with a fury. With mud and gravel from his crater, he built a seven-foot-high mound. Then he shoveled and scraped the mud into an eko-bark trough, while another miner, a 16-year-old who said his name was Dragon went to work with a blue plastic washtub, pouring several hundred tubs full of water through the makeshift sluice.
After about an hour, a glittering black stain had gathered at the foot of the trough. It was an ounce or so of coltan, the fruit of five hours of digging and washing. Asikima said it was not enough to buy a tin of rice for dinner. As he began to dig another crater, I asked him about his life in the forest. He said he despised it.
"If I had another job," he said, "I would not come here. But there are no other jobs. When this mine closes, I will go and find another one." 
He is not alone. Although the price has crashed, many coltan-bearing regions of eastern Congo remain thick with miners, commercants and prostitutes. In a country with a 20-cents-a-day living standard, the chance of earning a few dollars from coltan is still a powerful enough reason to live in the bush and shovel muck, sell bread and risk sofisi.
To halt war profiteering and the destruction of wildlife, the report to the U.N. Security Council called for an embargo on the export of coltan and other natural resources from Uganda and Rwanda. 
Although the embargo has yet to be imposed by the Security Council, European and American companies that profit from the coltan trade have been scurrying to avoid bad publicity. Pictures of dead gorillas and of environmental ruin in Congo's national parks have been particularly effective in triggering alarm among companies that pride themselves on their environmental images.
Sabena, the Belgian airline named in the report for hauling Congolese coltan to Europe, announced in June that it will no longer carry the ore. Nokia and Motorola are among several major mobile-phone makers that have publicly demanded that their suppliers stop using ore mined illegally in Congo. And so it has gone down the supply chain. The world's largest maker of tantalum capacitors, Kemet, in Greenville, S.C., has asked its suppliers to certify that ore does not come from Congo or bordering countries, including Uganda and Rwanda. Cabot Corporation, a Boston-based company that is the world's second-largest processor of tantalum powder, announced this spring that it "deplores all unlawful and immoral activities" connected with coltan mined in Congo and declared that it will not buy any ore from that part of the world. 
The high moral ground that companies have been quick to stake out has the added attraction of being profit-neutral, at least for the moment. The tantalum market is glutted because of declining demand in the slumping technology sector. As important, there has been a sharp increase in production by a giant Australian mining company, called Sons of Gwalia, which now produces half the world's supply. 
In the immediate future, it looks as though less and less of the world's tantalum will come from Congo's coltan mines. And as the U.N. sees it, this will be a very good thing. Its report concluded, "The only loser in this huge business venture is the Congolese people."
But inside what's left of Congo, a wide array of influential people (who are not combatants in the war and are not getting rich from coltan) make a persuasive case that these demands are naive and could well produce disastrous consequences. They argue that in a collapsed state where the likelihood of constructive Western intervention is next to nil, there simply are no easy fixes.
"For local people who are trying to make a bit of money out of coltan, how can an embargo possibly help?" asked Aloys Tegera, who directs the Pole Institute, a nongovernmental social-research institute in Goma, in eastern Congo. Tegera is well aware of coltan's destructive side: he is the lead author of a study on the severe social impact of coltan mining, which describes how teachers have been lured to the mines from the country's few functioning classrooms and explains why teenage girls have turned to prostitution.
"Coltan fuels the war; nobody can deny that," said Tegera. "That is why we maybe will never get peace. But civilians, especially those who are organized, also are getting some money from this."
He and many others find it more than slightly insulting that in a country where millions are hungry and coltan is helping to feed some of them, a de facto embargo is gathering steam among high-tech companies apparently worried less about human beings than about the public-relations downside of dead gorillas. And, like many other Congolese, he declines to become morally riled up about foreign domination.
"Of course, the Rwandans are pillaging us," he said. "But they are not the first to do it and they are no worse than the others. King Leopold did it. The Belgians did it. Mobutu and the Americans did it. The most sorrowful thing I have to live with is that we are incapable of coming up with an elite that can run things with Congolese interests in mind."
Terese Hart, an American botanist who helped create the Okapi Faunal Reserve and has worked there since the early 1980's, supports neither an embargo on coltan nor a quick pullout of Ugandan forces from northeast Congo.
"The world wants to intervene from a distance and pull the strings on the puppet," said Hart, who works for the Wildlife Conservation Society. "The problem is that the strings are not connected to anything. When outsiders struggle to find solutions for Congo, they often assume there is some kind of government. There is no government. There is nothing."
As for coltan mining, Hart said it is silly for the outside world to try to squeeze one of the few ways for poor people to make a bit of money.
"Outside the reserve, I think that coltan mining is the lesser evil of the types of exploitation that occur when there is no government," Hart said. "I prefer mining to logging. Cutting timber in the rain forest is part of an irreversible ecological process. I don't think coltan mining does as much permanent damage. The miner will not get much, but at least he will continue to live."
Among the Congolese I spoke to about coltan, the consensus was that they could not risk the simple solutions that outsiders had prescribed. Struggling to survive in a failed state, they saw no straightforward answers, no moral high ground. For them, the only thing worse than mining coltan is not mining it.
What progress there is in eastern Congo tends to be slow, small-scale and subject to sudden reversal. 
The World Health Organization has succeeded in working with rebel groups to vaccinate most children for polio, but it says 7 of 10 children have not received any other vaccines in the past decade. Western donors are distributing some medicines, seeds and tools, but three-quarters of the population still has no access to basic health care. 
When progress is being made, it often involves the mixed blessing of coltan. In eastern Congo, two mining entrepreneurs, Edouard Mwangachuchu, a Congolese Tutsi, and his American partner, Robert Sussman, a physician from Baltimore, are struggling to build a legitimate business in an illegitimate state.
They run a company that even their competitors say treats miners fairly. It supplies shovels and picks to about a thousand men who operate as independent contractors in mines located far from national parks, protected forests and endangered gorillas.
The land belongs to Mwangachuchu, whose herds were slaughtered in 1995, as the Mobutu era was sputtering to an end. Desperate to shore up popular support, Mobutu encouraged Congolese in the east to attack the ethnic Tutsi minority. A mob pulled Mwangachuchu, then a financial adviser to the provincial government in Goma, out of his Suzuki jeep on his way to work. They choked him with his necktie, ripped off his clothes and dumped him at the Rwandan border. Crowds later stoned and shot at his house.
Mwangachuchu, his wife and their six children were granted political asylum in the United States in 1996, and they rented a house in Laurel, Md. Two years later, homesick and bored with his job at a Carvel ice-cream plant, Mwangachuchu returned home for a visit.
Civil war was raging. His cattle farm had been destroyed, his herds gone, his buildings burned. But he still owned the land, which he had long known was rich in coltan. In 1999, a year after his first trip home, he heard that there was money to be made mining it. All he needed was a partner, someone with a bit of money.
Robert Sussman, 55, sold his medical practice in Baltimore in the early 1990's. Comfortably well off, he began a second career as a mining-camp doctor in remote countries, including Myanmar and Congo. Intrigued by mining, he began thinking of going into the business himself. He met Mwangachuchu in a Goma hotel in 1998, and they became partners the following year, as the price of coltan began to go up. 
Sussman and Mwangachuchu say they are investing in Congo for the long term. They believe they can operate profitably despite the recent slump in coltan prices and despite the fact that their mines are still periodically fought over by roving bands of armed men. The partners say they have laid the foundation for a solid business.
"We are proud of what we are doing in Congo," Sussman told me. "We want the world to understand that if it's done right, coltan can be good for this country."
Sussman and Mwangachuchu, of course, are also in it for the money. High coltan prices last year gave them an unexpected windfall. Sussman said they sold 22 metric tons of coltan, which earned them about $7.5 million -- before they paid their many bills.
Since then, they have bought about 25 more tons of coltan from miners in the field -- ore that they have not been able to sell.
Last year, Sussman and Mwangachuchu shipped their ore to Europe on Sabena airlines. That airline now refuses their business, and they are scrambling to find another shipper. They fear that a corporate embargo could cripple their business and idle miners who have come to depend on them.
"We don't understand why they are doing this," Mwangachuchu told me. "The Congolese have a right to make business in their own country."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
Hotel Discounts: Be Sure to Ask

BYLINE:  By TERRY TRUCCO; TERRY TRUCCO writes frequently for the Travel section.

 BODY:
I KNEW for months I'd need a hotel room in San Francisco for a two-night visit this past June. But as I was uncertain of the exact date, I put off making a reservation. I wanted to stay at the Monaco, a stylish 201-room hotel a couple of blocks from Union Square, whose Web site had posted double rooms for mid-June at $249 a night several weeks prior to my trip. But when I called the hotel four days before I needed the room, the lowest price I could get was $349, more than I wished to pay.
 On a friend's recommendation, I phoned the Chancellor, a more modest 137-room hotel just half a block from Union Square. Its $163-a-night rate promptly fell to $149 when the reservation agent learned I was an AAA member. My room was small but pleasant, and I had no complaints about the price. Yet I couldn't help thinking I'd have done even better if I'd shopped around more. 
 After several years of buoyant occupancy and steep rates, hotel rooms at discounted prices are easier to find throughout much of the country. Occupancy at New York City hotels is projected to fall to 81 percent this year from 84.6 percent in 2000, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. Business travel has slowed, resulting in an abundance of rooms at some of the nation's luxury hotels, while a strong dollar has sent Americans overseas and prompted foreign travelers to stay home. "The hotel industry is going into a down cycle, and that's good for consumers," said Richard Brush, dean of the Hospitality College at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I. 
This is an excellent time for guests to negotiate a deal with a hotel, whether it's a free fourth night added to a three-night stay or daily breakfast on the house. And the more you know about how hotels set rates and determine discounts, the better you can decide whether to hand over your credit card or continue the hunt.

Yield Management
Figuring out the cost of a hotel room on a given night was once as simple as reading a rate sheet. But the rules have changed over the last decade, as hotels, eager to keep rooms from going unsold, copied the flexible pricing system known as yield management, put into practice by the airlines in the late 1970's after deregulation. At most large chains, room prices are determined by the demand the hotel expects for a particular night based on previous occupancy for the same period. Besides the rack rate (the published price hotels use to position themselves in the market), there's usually a menu of lower prices not always made public, with modest to deep discounts that are made available as the hotel sees fit, depending on occupancy fluctuations. In mid-July for example, the Monaco Web site showed rooms available in August for $189.
"At times of high demand, the hotels want to identify the people most likely to pay the full rate, and make sure they get rooms before they start offering discounts," said Sheryl E. Kimes, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration.
At the same time, the system allows hotels to trim prices swiftly when a full house isn't expected. Deep discounts are often a last-minute management decision, so it's wise to consult the hotel Web site, 800 number, local number and perhaps an online reservations discount service before you book. "The price could be $300 on the Web site but $250 if you phone," Mr. Brush said.
Some travelers request a discount as a matter of course, a ploy that can work. On a recent trip to Bologna, Edward Schneider, a New York editor and translator who always asks for the best available discount, paid $225 at the Grand Hotel Baglioni and was upgraded to a $324 room. "You can always ask if you can get a discount, and you should always ask if the hotel has any deals," said Professor Kimes. And you can push, she added. "The hotels are trained to deal with people who push." 
Until a few years ago, United States hotels often gave discounts to anyone who asked, when room was available; now they're more likely to offer deals to guests who fit a specific category, like business travelers or AAA members, Professor Kimes said. "People who didn't ask and wound up paying full price often got angry," she explained. "Discounts are still available, but you have to qualify for them."

Discounts for Members
In addition to special promotions at slow times, many hotels offer reductions to members of groups that have negotiated deals, like AAA, the American Association of Retired People (AARP), Sam's Clubs at Wal-Mart, Costco, American Express Platinum Card, Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report's Q Club and veterans' organizations, like the American Legion. Corporate travel rates sometimes extend to pleasure travel for certain employees. Savings range from a modest 10 percent off the rack rate to aggressive discounts, often with strings attached. AARP members who book 21 days in advance, for example, can get 50 percent off the rack rate at Marriott hotels when rooms are available, but cancellations aren't allowed. 
Most deals must be negotiated when you book, but if you forget, mention a membership at registration. When she arrived with her husband for an off-season stay at Cap Juluca, an elegant resort in Anguilla, Suzanne Santry, a public relations consultant from New York, heard a lower price quoted for a guest who was a Q Club member. Mrs. Santry whipped out her Q Club card, apologized for not mentioning it when she booked and was given the discount. 
Web sites specializing in reservations at a discount, like Hotel Reservations Network, Quikbook and Expedia, can deliver attractive deals. Discounts can range from 10 to 60 percent off rack rates, though some of the services charge cancellation fees and demand payment up front. 
If you plan to sweet-talk a hotel into a deal, industry experts suggest a few guidelines:
Stay up to date on the economic situation of the places you plan to visit. Your chances of success are obviously much better if the city isn't going to be host to a convention or going through a boom period. At the very least, ask for an upgrade if the hotel seems empty when you arrive. 
Be aware of the amount of business you can bring to the hotel. If you plan to visit Kansas City one week a month, tell the hotel you'll be a regular guest and request a discount. 
And if you're traveling with children, ask to have the fee for an additional bed or occupant dropped. 
Not all hotels have embraced the floating array of prices associated with yield management. Small, independently owned hotels often set rates the old-fashioned way, by season instead of by week or category. Yet discounts are not unheard of. 
The reservation agent at the front desk of a small hotel may, in fact, have considerable authority, and that can result in a perk on a slow day. Last summer I booked a room for a Friday night at New York's TriBeCa Grand. The price was a steep $399, and when I asked if there was anything else, the reservation agent described a $600 suite. "That's way too expensive," I exclaimed. But when I checked in, I'd been upgraded to a suite. "I guess the sales agent just liked you," said the attendant who handed me the key.

HEADLINE: Blasts From The Past 

 BODY:
Jeff Goodell's thinly-veiled attack on coal (July 22) has as its premise the notion that the recently improved economic fortunes of the industry are a result of some unholy alliance between powerful coal executives and the Bush administration. The more prosaic truth is that coal companies have become more profitable because reserve depletion, a severe shortage of coal miners (the average underground miner is over 50 years old) and more stringent environmental regulations have saved the industry from its tendency to mine more coal than the market can absorb. 
 If the environmental activists are looking for a conspiracy to explain why we are still "burning rocks" to power the Internet, perhaps they should look in a mirror. The environmental movement's relentless attack, in the 1970's, against further development of the far cleaner and safer production of electricity through nuclear power virtually guaranteed that coal consumption would increase, irrespective of who occupies the White House.

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
Hurling Your Basic Rock at the Arty Crowd

BYLINE:  By JOE HAGAN; Joe Hagan's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about outsider music.

 BODY:
THE White Stripes may not be what they seem. They bill themselves as a sibling act: Jack White on guitar and vocals, his sister, Meg, on drums. But if recent press reports are true, they are actually ex-spouses. The duo's spokeswoman says they are sticking to the sibling story. And that's good. The ambiguity lends itself to their aura, that of a kind of Adam and Eve in their own rock 'n' roll Eden.
 Last month, these pale, handsome mid-20-year-old rockers -- he head-to-toe in red, she in white -- appeared on national television for the first time. In the middle of a raw, clanging two-chord rumble called "Screwdriver," they threw down a rock gauntlet: for nearly half a minute, they vamped on a single chord spiked with sharp stops. The thudding simplicity and reckless disregard for valuable air time resonated with power. Mr. White then signaled to his sister, and the drums fell away as he dipped unexpectedly into "Your Southern Can Is Mine," an old blues song by Blind Willie McTell. Finger-picking the chords, his mouth closing in on the microphone with a new intensity, he slurred the darkly ambiguous yet funny lyric "You might read from Revelation, back to Genesee/ you get crooked, your Southern can belongs to me." 
 Mr. White then returned to the brute two-chord riff, which crescendoed with him warbling, "I got a little feelin' goin' now!" over and over in a flurry of spit, cymbal crash and ecstatic rock triumphalism. 
It would have been one of the most thrilling rock performances in television history -- if only it had been seen by more than a few die-hards willing to stay up until 1:30, when it was broadcast at the end of "The Late Late Show With Craig Kilborn" on CBS. In 2001 rock music doesn't hold the cultural weight it once did in, say, 1964, when the Beatles appeared on "The Ed Sullivan Show.' But with a stripped-down grace, the White Stripes, who recently released their third album, "White Blood Cells" (Sympathy for the Record Industry SFTRI 660), have achieved something uncanny: They have made rock rock again by returning to its origins as a simple, primitive sound full of unfettered zeal. On this new album, blues-metal, acoustic pop, punk, schoolyard ditty and piano-driven dirge are all brought to life by Ms. White's rudimentary drumming, Mr. White's soulful, unaffected voice and a low-fi garage aesthetic. (The band will headline a free concert on Thursday at Pier 54 on 14th Street in Manhattan.)
Over the last 20 years, blues-rock has become nothing if not passe, kept alive mainly by bar bands and high-minded stylists like the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. Cranking up a stack of Marshall amplifiers and sweating out, say, "Whole Lotta Love," as Led Zeppelin did in the 1970's, has become something of an embarrassment for successive generations of rockers. Chalk it up to the urge to reinvent the genre and the slow creep of irony into the culture. In the last decade, rock music has broken down into a zillion niches, from cliched acts like Bush and Matchbox 20 to arch nerd-rockers like Weezer and Ben Folds Five. There's been a little something for everyone but no longer one big thing for all. Having lost the power to one-up itself, rock has been trumped by hip-hop and electronica.
Recently, the five-piece English band Radiohead was hailed as the savior of rock by virtue of its album-length opuses, which modernize classic rock with themes of techno-dystopia and the avant-atmospherics of Pink Floyd. Led by the stuffy Thom Yorke, Radiohead has managed to wriggle free of cliche, but only by drifting away from simplicity and into the nonlinear blips and squiggles of electronica. The band makes art-rock, not rock rock, the difference being the basic fact that one can't really rock to blips and squiggles.
On the surface, the White Stripes would appear to be as clever and self-aware as any other underground rock act: a novel brother-sister conceit, kitschy outfits reminiscent of 1960's proto-garage acts and the use of just two instruments. As part of their stated call for simplicity, they gave their second album the pretentious title "De Stijl," recalling the Dutch Minimalist art movement of the 1920's. There's enough here to lure the buzz-obsessed world to its curiosities and enough pretense to ease the skepticism of the jaded indie-rockers who have embraced them. At its heart is a mystery: Is Mr. White, a 25-year-old former upholsterer from southwest Detroit, concocting this stuff with a wink? Or are the White Stripes simply naive?
While the critics sort out the riddle, the two are freed to play blues-rock with a depth and feel completely incompatible with their image. Like so many icons of yore, Mr. White sounds as if he has struck a deal with the Devil. For beneath the arty facade lies one of the most cagey, darkly original rockers to come along since Kurt Cobain, capable of evocatively plain lyricism and chilling emotional turns.
Incidentally, Mr. White's sound seems an appropriate segue from Mr. Cobain's last recorded song, "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?" -- a variation on Leadbelly's "In the Pines." On "The White Stripes," the duo's debut album, from 1999 -- recorded in their living room and dedicated to the Delta blues legend Son House -- Mr. White reanimates Robert Johnson's "Stop Breaking Down," Bob Dylan's "One More Cup of Coffee" and the 1930's standard "St. James Infirmary Blues," all with a believable pathos that would sound brittle or stylized in the hands of a less inspired player.
Having grown up in Detroit, a city that missed the economic high times of the 1990's, the White Stripes flaunt their sense of insularity from the culture at large: on "The Late Late Show," they performed with the flag of the City of Detroit pinned to the scrim behind them. They have also ignored overtures from major labels in favor of a local outfit. This provincialism could be a reason songs like the sweet, childish "We're Going to Be Friends," from the latest record, sound untouched by a modern climate. Lyrics like "Walk with me, Suzy Lee/ through the park, and by the tree" aren't so much classic rock as traditional American music, the kind that can turn singsongy rhymes into the mysterious parables we associate with early blues recordings. 
LISTENING to this music, one begins to realize that De Stijl art motif is less a pretension and more an earnest Midwesterner's idea of an art-school aesthetic. Taken together, the patriotic color-coordination and blues roots summon up a sort of rock nationalism, a homage to a time when the Rolling Stones could disrupt the status quo with a clanging, two-chord rumble. Mr. White's shameless simplicity is precisely his allure. As he sings on "Hotel Yorba," a porch-stomping pop rag, "It might sound silly to think childish thoughts like these, but I'm so tired of acting tough and I'm gonna do what I please."
Whether the White Stripes' brand of back-to-basics rock can subvert today's tepid corporate creations remains to be seen. Like so many "alternative" bands, it could remain a refined pleasure for a limited but studious niche of rock lovers. But if discovered by MTV, the very insularity that makes them so original will be tested. Belying any naivete, the cover of the group's latest record depicts the anxious-looking Whites, both dressed in red and white, backed against a red-brick wall and surrounded by obscured black figures. Inside the CD case is the next frame of the story: the figures are paparazzi with cameras, and the Whites are now smiling, looking every bit the stars. Whether this is wishful thinking or a wry commentary on fame remains as it should, a mystery.

Some Signs of Normalcy

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
TRADITIONALLY, the Gold Coast towns of Fairfield County barely flinch when the rest of the state may be in serious economic pain. In the current economic slowdown, there is softening in the support for high house prices, but many real estate agents say that Wall Street's problems have affected them very little.
 Most towns had fewer homes for sale between May 1 and July 31 than they did in the corresponding period last year. But prices have risen. Some brokers attribute the increase to a shallow inventory, while others say that multiple bids for well-maintained homes in desirable neighborhoods keep driving prices up. 
 However, more buyers are negotiating down than up. Amounts have varied widely from $2,700 off on a house listed at $134,900 in Bridgeport to a $50,000 reduction on a $1.095 million New Canaan house. 
Multiple-bid situations, and the consequent nudging of prices up rather than down, have not disappeared, however, agents from a number of real estate offices around Fairfield County say. Last month, Elayne Jassey, an agent at Prudential Connecticut Realty in Stamford, had four multiple-bid situations.
Since May 1, 141 homes have been contracted for in Stamford at prices averaging $603,013. Last year, there were 237 contracted for or sold in the same time period at an average price of $534,793. "Young couples are coming from Manhattan, where they are spending $3,000 a month on a one-bedroom apartment," Ms. Jassey said. "We also have people from Westchester. Taxes of up to $30,000 in Scarsdale on a $1 million house are about $10,000 to $13,000 here." 
In Greenwich, where prices rarely fall, 269 contracts from May through July of last year averaged $1.8 million, according to figures from Preferred Properties. This year, 295 contracts in that period dropped to an average $1.76 million. Two homes priced at more than $6.5 million -- one at $7.9 million and the other at $16.8 million -- were contracted for this year in the May-July period, down from nine sales in that price range last year. 
The high ranges "are suffering" in Norwalk, said Carol Ann Falasco, a sales agent at Coldwell Banker. "There are more $500,000-to-$700,000 homes staying on the market longer," she said. "Anything you can find in the $300,000's or $200,000's goes right away. People are going back to condos. They can't afford houses any more." Last year's total of contracts on 164 homes from May through July dropped to 143 this year.
Attractive lending rates, down to 7.375 percent from 8.5 percent last year for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, are stimulating the market. 
Renters and people priced out of the lower Fairfield County market are becoming buyers in Bridgeport. "We have been signing contracts and closings on about 150 homes a month since May," Mark Greengarden of Century 21 in Bridgeport said of the local market. "Foreclosed properties start at $40,000 and the upper end is around $319,000. We are 20 percent up in sales from last year and 27 percent up in prices."
The usual influx of corporate transferees has dwindled with the contraction of corporations but has not completely dried up. Starwood Hotels moved Thomas Conophy, an executive; his wife, Jody; and their two daughters from Texas to New Canaan in March. "The house went for $1.456 million, over the asking price of $1.435 million," said Denise Gannalo, a vice president at William Raveis Real Estate, which represented the seller.
THERE have been 80 New Canaan homes for sale on which binders have been signed this year, up from 78 last year.
Westport's Coldwell Banker office tabulated 132 contracts this year, with an average sale price of $909,772. Last year, 149 homes were contracted for and sold at an average of $862,841.
"Everything under $1 million continues to sell," said Gino Kelly, who owns Kelly Associates Real Estate in Darien. "We had 114 transactions from May through July at an average of $1.022 million. Last year, we had 100 homes contracted in that period at an average of $956,970."
Summing up the market, Casey Jones, a managing partner at William Pitt Real Estate, said: "Last year, the market was white hot. What we're looking at now is a return to normalcy. We're operating at 1999 levels and the good news is pricing has gone up since then or held. Last year, there were boatloads of money around. This year, there's just a lot of money around."

Home Buyers Are Shopping With Gusto

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
"FABULOUS." "Best May ever." "Best June on record."
 New Jersey residential real estate brokers and agents are so energetically upbeat about the direction of sales prices in the spring that the image of a new chorus line for "The Producers" leaps to mind: high-kicking realtors belting out "Springtime for real estate in New Jersey!" 
 Both the retail and the commercial markets may be showing signs of slowing, but residential home sales? Ah, the fresh, sweet smell of rising dollar volume after a weak winter. 
At Weichert Realtors, "we came off the best May on record, and we are paced for the best June on record," said Jacelyn Botti, a senior vice president. Ms. Botti added that early in-house numbers indicated that the average sales price for July would be more than 20 percent higher than for July 2000.
Coldwell Banker's president and chief operating officer, Maureen Passerini, who is a director of the 12,000-member Garden State Multiple Listing Service, said: "Momentum has been picking up in April, May and June around central and northern New Jersey. Sales were up 6 percent this June over last."
In the dollar value of homes sold, Mrs. Passerini said the numbers were up 11 percent for the year to date, with 6 percentage points of that surge occurring in May and June.
"I've been doing real estate for five years," said Betty Anne McKenna, a Coldwell Banker saleswoman in Monmouth County, "and this is the busiest summer I've had. At the office meeting here last Tuesday, they had to tape extra pages onto the bottom of our board where we show activity for the month. It holds 40 in each column, sales and listings. The sales were off the page, and listings were almost to the bottom."
Mrs. McKenna held a Sunday open house for a home in Manalapan priced at $539,000, high for an area where an average home sells for almost $200,000 less. She said the home was newer than many in the area -- three years old, while others are 30 to 40 years old -- and bigger, with five bedrooms and three baths. Eighteen people or couples showed up, and one couple, Steve and Sandy Kaplan, had signed a contract to buy it for $525,000 by Monday evening. 
Almost uniformly, realtors say that home buyers who may have waited anxiously while the stock market gyrated earlier this year are now shopping with gusto.
A contrary view comes from Jay Schweppe, who owns Schweppe & Company, a one-office real estate agency in Montclair.
A man of singular confidence and outspokenness -- Mr. Schweppe says happy-talking real-estate specialists are "trying to make everything look good" -- he says the New Jersey residential market is on the down slide.
"This is strictly a cyclical business, with value entirely based on consumer confidence," Mr. Schweppe said, "and consumer confidence is going down."
Not because of the shaky stock market, Mr. Schweppe insisted, but because home values are inflated due to the tight inventory and because overpricing feeds on itself.
When there are fewer homes to sell, fierce buyer competition and multiple bids become commonplace in towns like Montclair, where homes are generally in good condition, schools are good and the commute to New York City is short. "Somebody steps up to bat every time a desirable home comes on the market and pays whatever it takes," Mr. Schweppe said.
Ms. Botti of Weichert says that only a few years ago, when a buyer's agent found out that multiple offers were being made, the agent would suggest that the client offer 10 percent over the list price. "Now," Ms. Botti said, "you really have to extend yourself."
In certain towns, there are cases of people bidding $100,000 or more over asking price and still losing out, according to Mr. Schweppe, Ms. Botti and others.
However, the Schweppe view is that things have begun to shift:
"The buildup is happening, and it's because we've overpriced the product. You can see it all over, even in the so-called safe towns like Montclair, and Short Hills, and Chatham, with houses sitting on the market for two and three months."
On Lloyd Road in Montclair, he continued, "Right now, there's one that's been on the market for two months. It's because it's a $2 million house that's not worth it. The sellers, and ineffective real estate people, see a house that has multiple bids and sells for way over asking price, and then they price the house next door or up the street based on that. Then, when other sellers see that asking price, they base their asking price on that. It's ridiculous, and buyers have had enough."
THE current teeter-totter relationship between inventory and sales price -- while not yet substantiated in official listing service numbers, which are not reported until sales are closed -- can be discerned by looking at reports of signed contracts. The New Jersey Multiple Listing Service, which has 5,500 members in north-central New Jersey, mostly in Essex and Bergen Counties, offers numbers for June with a clear pattern: number of sales down, average home prices up.
That same pattern appears in the Garden State listing service numbers comparing June 2001 with June 2000 in Essex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset, Sussex, Union and Warren Counties.
In big, booming Bergen County, where new antisprawl regulations have yet to slow new construction as they have elsewhere, the pattern is different, but positive. Both the number of sales and the average sales price are up for January through June of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to the listing service.
The specter of an inventory buildup caused by the continuing rapid rise in sales prices hovers in every locale, however.
Judy Reeves, president and chief operating officer at Burgdorff Realtors, called her company's June business fabulous, with signed contracts up 8 percent from a year earlier. June closings were "way off the charts," she says, for homes that had signed contracts earlier in the spring.
"Things in good locations, cream puff locations, still receive multiple offers even though there is apprehension in the market about layoffs and the economy," says Ms. Reeves, whose company is based in Parsippany.
"Sellers have caught on to multiple offers, and some are becoming too greedy. That's when a property sits."
Coldwell Banker's president, Mrs. Passerini, says the market is robust in most places. She cited the case of a young New York City couple looking for a house in Mountain Lakes, where the man grew up.
"They found a nice colonial with a hot tub, very unusual in Mountain Lakes. They outbid everyone and got the house. While the sale was undergoing the three-day attorney review -- and offers can still be accepted -- four more came in."
Mrs. Passerini says that inventory will inevitably begin to grow and prices to drop but adds that the marketplace can remain strong because demand for houses is so pent up.
"We represent a lot of builders," she said, "and this never happens. I've been doing this 27 years, but they are building $3 million to $4 million houses on spec. There are seven going up right now."
Ms. Botti of Weichert, predicting "no letup," continues to advise sellers to be very aggressive in setting list prices. Some appraisers are applying a certain percentage per month that a home will appreciate while the closing is pending when setting its value for a mortgage company, Ms. Botti says.
"We tell sellers, 'You should have the value of that appreciation up until closing, not the buyer,' " she said. Ms. Botti says Weichert has also represented buyers who closed on a property, put it back on the market immediately and made thousands of dollars.
Ms. Reeves of Burgdorff says she cannot make predictions. "Hey, this is a fun market to watch," she laughed. "You can't really tell what will happen!"

HEADLINE: Home Prices Are Up, but Not as Much 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
SHOWING a degree of resilience in the face of the national economic slowdown, the residential real estate market in the New York metropolitan region clung to its penchant for price increases in the first half of the year, even as buyers became more choosy (or wary) and sellers lost a bit of their swagger.
 Though more moderate than during the frenzy of recent years, price increases were recorded in most precincts of the city's suburban ring and in the boroughs outside of Manhattan. At the same time, sales volume remained strong in some areas while slipping in others -- with brokers, exuding their seemingly inherent optimism, citing low inventory as the culprit. 
 If there were clear signs of a leveling off, they were most apparent in the upscale environs of Manhattan -- a market particularly affected by Wall Street worries and the winnowing of the high-technology sector.
Some real estate observers said they were seeing a more rational market, as well as a seeming paradox: people increasingly interested in the security of buying a home instead of stocks while also being deliberate in their search for the right property rather than charging into bidding wars for fear of being priced out of the market. 
"It's the safe port in the economic storm," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. Dr. Hughes pointed out that interest rates remain low, near 7 percent; that an unprecedented concentration of the population is in the age range of peak housing consumption, and that nationwide sales of existing homes are on track to surpass 2000 as the second-best year ever.
At the same time, the senior regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Rae Rosen, saw cause for some concern, particularly because of layoffs in manufacturing and an increase in the number of people falling behind in their mortgage payments. "We didn't get the kind of decline in foreclosures that you would expect during a strong expansion," Ms. Rosen said. "And in recent months there have been sharp declines in manufacturing jobs. So there could be further weakness in the residential market."
"Prices seem to be holding in the metropolitan area," she said. "But it takes longer to sell, and volume has slipped" -- a pattern evident, with some exceptions, from county to county in the region.
For example, the multiple listing service covering Westchester and Putnam Counties reported that the median, or midpoint, price for single-family houses in the second quarter was $465,000, up 12.8 percent from $412,000 in the same period in 2000. But the number of single-family houses sold in the second quarter was 1,296, down 10 percent from the 1,447 sold in the same period last year -- just before the stock market tumble. More encouragingly, the listing service reported that the 1,296 single-family houses sold from April through June represented a 29 percent increase over the 1,004 transactions in the first quarter of 2001.
In Morris County, N.J., the median price just in June was $290,000, up 3.6 percent from $280,000 in June 2000. But the number of sales in June was 635, down 14 percent from 739 in June 2000. For Sussex County, N.J., the median price in June was $175,000, up 9.4 percent from $159,950 in June 2000. But sales for the month stood at 282, a 7.8 percent drop from the 306 in June 2000.
There is no central source for statistics in Fairfield County, Conn. But according to data compiled from three large brokerage houses, the median price for Fairfield (not including Greenwich and Darien) was $360,000 from May to July, a 7.4 percent increase over the $335,000 median in the same period in 2000. And while, by way of illustration, 141 sales have gone into contract in Stamford since May 1, there were 237 contracts in the same period last year.
The pattern was more robust in three of the four boroughs outside of Manhattan (the Bronx Board of Realtors does not compile sufficient data). In some instances, local realty boards were asked to provide statistics on contracts rather than closed deals because, while they are less firm, contracts provide a more current snapshot of the market.
According to the Staten Island Board of Realtors, for example, 1,941 deals went into contract in the first six months of this year, compared with 1,783 in the same period in 2000 -- an 8.8 percent increase. The average price for those contracts also rose, by 10.9 percent, to $243,792 this year from $219,852 in 2000.
And in Queens, according to the Long Island Board of Realtors, which covers the borough, there were 388 transactions in contract in June, an 18.3 percent increase over the 328 contracts in June 2000. At the same time, the median contract price for Queens in June was $245,000, up 22 percent from $200,500 in June 2000. A similar pattern was evident in Brooklyn.
Only in Manhattan -- a market that in recent years has been characterized by dizzying price leaps and seemingly insatiable demand -- have both prices and sales volume shown signs of leveling off. 
According to the Douglas Elliman Report, the most comprehensive survey of the Manhattan market, the average price for closed sales in the second quarter was $894,617, a 2 percent increase from the first quarter's average of $876,612. The survey covers sales from Battery Park to West 116th Street and East 96th Street.
"Over the past two years, we've seen quarter-to-quarter changes as high as 29 percent, so this 2 percent increase seems indicative of the early stages of price stabilization," said Jonathan Miller, president of the Miller Samuel appraisal company, which prepares the Elliman report. Tracking sales volume, the Elliman report recorded 2,039 closings in the first quarter and 1,829 in the second quarter, a 10 percent decline.
Examining median prices, which factor out the extreme ends of the price range, the Manhattan median in the second quarter was $540,000, an 8 percent increase over $500,000 in the first quarter. "What's interesting is that the median is usually viewed as a more conservative indicator," Mr. Miller said, "but in this case the 8 percent increase is skewed upward due to the decline in transactions that occurred in the smaller apartment categories." In the first quarter of 2001 there were 704 one-bedroom sales, while in the second quarter there were 447, a 37 percent decline. "That moves the midpoint upward," he said, "which makes it look like a greater change than the average price does." 
To gauge the most current indicators, Mr. Miller also examined contracts. In the first quarter, there were 315 deals under contract, and in the second quarter, but extended through July 10, there were 270, a 14 percent decline despite the additional two weeks. The median price for those deals in the first quarter was $498,000, compared with $525,000 in the extended second quarter, a 5 percent increase.
In the rarefied heights of the Manhattan market -- where money, it seemed for several years, was no object -- sales volume has held fairly firm, but prices have taken a bit of a breather.
Kirk Henckels, director of Stribling Private Brokerage, said there were eight co-op closings in the $10-million-or-more category in the first six months of 2000, for a total of $121 million, or an average of $15.1 million. And while there were also eight closings in that category in the first six months of 2001, their total dollar value was $96.4 million, or an average price of $12.1 million. "That's a decline in dollar volume of 20.3 percent," Mr. Henckels said.
North of Central Park, said R. Kenyatta Punter, president of the Greater Harlem Board of Realtors, "We are starting to see the effects of a slowing economy."
Mr. Punter cited a one-family, five-bedroom brownstone with six fireplaces on Convent Avenue that "came on the market in October 2000 at $850,000, and recently closed at $775,000." A three-bedroom condominium on St. Nicholas Avenue was listed in September at $375,000 "and the owner recently took it off the market because she could not get her price," he said. "These are telltale signs that purchasers are starting to be affected by the economy and, as a consequence, we're seeing resistance to prices that have risen significantly in recent years."

Brooklyn
Nuts-and-Bolts Areas Report Solid Sales
There was not much resistance when Al and Janice Alper put their house in Marine Park, Brooklyn, on the market in June. The Alpers and their children -- Kaitlin, 8; A. J., 6, and Alexandra, 4 -- needed a larger place, even though they bought their three-bedroom home on East 33rd Street only two years ago "for just over $220,000," Mr. Alper said.
"My wife and I were worried about what we would get in today's market," he said. "And I really thought it would take closer to six months. You see, we hadn't actually begun looking for a place, and then, inside of four days, we had 12 offers and three at our asking price" -- $335,000.
"I said, 'Oh, my God, we better start looking,' " recalled Mr. Alper, chief information officer for a financial management company. Over the next three weeks, the Alpers looked at two dozen homes.
They are now in contract, at "just over half a million," for a five-bedroom home in Mill Basin, Brooklyn, that also has a dining room "and a den!" Mr. Alper exclaimed, "with a lock on the door, because that's mine, make no mistake about it."
"You go into this anticipating having a couple of months to think about it, to research areas, to quietly decide over dinner which of five houses you might want to buy, and then it goes into this freneticism," he said. "I need a vacation from that; I go to work to relax."
There are three multiple listing services -- South Shore, Midcounty and Bay Ridge-Bensonhurst -- covering what might be called the nuts-and-bolts parts of Brooklyn, as opposed to the more affluent, Manhattanesque downtown Brooklyn.
Nuts-and-bolts Brooklyn has performed solidly so far this year, said Gerard Longo, president of the South Shore Multiple Listing Service, who compiled data in cooperation with the other listing services. 
In the first six months of last year, 3,771 contracts were recorded by the three services. In the first half of this year, 4,039 contracts were recorded -- a 7.1 percent increase. And while there were 1,911 contracts signed in this year's first quarter, there were 2,128 signed in the second quarter -- an 11.3 percent rise.
Mr. Longo was not able to gather price statistics covering all three listing services. So, as a barometer, he looked at numbers for his own company, Madison Estates Realty. In the second quarter of 2000, including the first two weeks of July, Mr. Longo's company had 132 deals in contract with a median price of $315,000. For the same period this year, there were 153 contracts with a median price of $330,000 -- a 16 percent rise in sales volume and a 5 percent increase in median price.
"I am a little surprised," he said. "Historically, real estate follows Wall Street by six months to a year. Fortunately, that has not been the case this year. As a matter of fact, if Wall Street is looking for where the bulls are, maybe investors should look to real estate. It seems like that's the best bet outside of Pamplona."
The picture is a little less clear in downtown, or brownstone, Brooklyn.
According to Christopher Thomas, vice president for Brooklyn at the William B. May Company, which specializes in the area, the average sales price for deals brokered by his company in 2000 was $579,238. So far this year, the average is $563,242 -- a 2.7 percent slip. "I have to say that I don't consider that statistically significant because it's perfectly possible that we sold one more $2.5 million house in 2000 than we have so far in 2001," Mr. Thomas said.
Reluctant to disclose precise sales numbers, Mr. Thomas did point out that "dealing with only closed deals, we are, to date, off by 5 percent from the year 2000." More encouragingly, however, "in terms of contracts pending as of June 30, we are up by 36 percent, 2001 versus 2000," he said.
"I really see buyers and sellers coming together," Mr. Thomas said. "Finally, after several years of just a strong sellers' environment, we're coming to a greater balance; available listings as a function of the number of people who want to purchase."
"Buyers now are able to make more informed decisions with more product to choose from," he said. "Sellers are able to find buyers at what are still historically record levels, and interest rates remain low. From my point of view, this is smooth, blue-water sailing."

Queens
A Jump in Sales And Also in Prices
In Queens, said Joseph E. Mottola, chief executive of the Long Island Board of Realtors, "The story is the magnitude of the increase."
And a parallel between contracts and closed deals lends credence to that assertion. While the 388 contracts and their $245,000 median price this June represented jumps of 18.3 percent and 22 percent respectively over June 2000, there were 320 transactions that actually closed in June 2001, or 17.6 percent more than in June 2000. And the median price for those closed deals was $235,100, 23.4 percent higher than the $190,500 median in June of last year.
"That's significantly more than the increase in Nassau County," Mr. Mottola said.
Asked to offer some site-specific examples, James F. O'Kane, president of ERA O'Kane Realty in Maspeth, said: "We closed one on July 13, a one-family frame in Maspeth, three bedrooms, finished basement, garage, and it sold for $399,000 -- full asking price. Now a year ago, if this house sold for $300,000, $310,000, it would have been a good price." 
"There's no slippage," Mr. O'Kane continued. "Mortgage companies and banks have the money, and they want to lend it."
Walter Messina, vice president of Glenjay Realty in Forest Hills and president of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, pointed to an attached stucco, three-bedroom home on Fleet Street in Forest Hills. "It's in contract, as of early July, for $365,000," Mr. Messina said. "A year ago, it would have been $300,000."

Staten Island
Seeing a Shift From Stock to Houses
Likening the housing market in her borough to a peculiar traffic pattern, Sophia Gibaldi, president of the Staten Island Board of Realtors, said: "Sometimes you're on a highway, the traffic slows and you wonder if there's an accident up ahead. Then you just proceed and there was no accident, and you move full speed ahead. My opinion is that people got scared, started selling their stocks. They passed that intersection where the traffic slowed down, but haven't stopped going into houses."
Data from the Staten Island Board of Realtors compared the second quarter of 2000 -- about the time that the Nasdaq bubble burst -- with the second quarter of 2001. There were 937 contracts with an average price of $226,133 signed from March 1 to June 30 of last year, and in the same period this year, there were 1,092 contracts with an average price of $252,221 -- increases of 16.5 and 11.5 percent respectively. 
In the first half of this year, the Staten Island board reported, the average price for a single-family home in the West Brighton section was $166,852. In Huguenot, it was $219,751; and in Heartland Village, $238,196.

Bronx
Prices and Sales Holding, Agents Say
The Bronx Board of Realtors does not gather sufficient data to provide a profile of the borough. But Susan Goldy, president of a Riverdale brokerage firm that bears her name, offered her impression: "We would have more sales if we had more houses to sell, and prices have held their own."
Ms. Goldy cited a three-bedroom row house on Liebig Avenue that was listed in June for $388,000 and sold for $375,000; and a six-bedroom, five-bath stucco home in Fieldston, built in 1899 with a 1920 addition, that listed for $1.1 million and sold for $995,000. "I think they both would have sold for a little less last year," she said.
In the less tony Williamsbridge section, said Floyd Cooper, president of the Cooper Group on the Grand Concourse, a two-family house on East 225th Street sold in June for $265,000 after being listed for $285,000. And on Pond Place in Kingsbridge, a one-family, four-bedroom sold for $160,000 in June. "They were asking $170,000," Mr. Cooper said. "And a year ago, I think, it would have sold for $140,000."
Two weeks ago, Tamar and William Greeley moved into a three-bedroom condominium in Riverdale, after getting a taste of the current market. "We sold in Manhattan, a one-bedroom condo in Murray Hill," Ms. Greeley said. "We have a 16-month-old girl, Gabriella, and needed more room."
The Greeleys -- she a printing company executive, he a futures trader -- bought the Manhattan apartment in 1997 for $216,250. "We sold for $385,000; it's pretty ridiculous," Ms. Greeley said. 
"The problem was that for what we were looking for in Manhattan -- a two-bedroom doorman building in the same neighborhood -- the prices were close to $1 million," Ms. Greeley said. Instead, they got a three-bedroom apartment with a terrace in a high-rise building with 24-hour concierge service and a health club -- for $380,000.
"We have almost triple the space we had in Manhattan, beautiful views of the Harlem and Hudson Rivers from every window," she said. "Manhattan is just not affordable for us these days. We're just Greeleys, not Rockefellers."

'Let's Go for the Bronze'

BYLINE:  By NEIL GENZLINGER 

 BODY:
Lucky New Jersey. Poor Connecticut. Or maybe it's the other way around.
 The Census Bureau disclosed last week that it had been determined that New Jersey had the highest median household income in the country, $54,226, while Connecticut, once the top dog, had fallen to No. 2, at $53,108. 
 The bureau admitted that the numbers might not be accurate and that the difference was probably statistically meaningless. But that did not prevent a storm, or at least a slight breeze, of reaction, from pride to wariness; from concern to indifference to outright befuddlement.
There was, for instance, Tammy Zazuri of Southport, Conn., who seemed a bit skeptical that much-maligned New Jersey outranked her state.
"Oh my God, that's definitely wrong," said Ms. Zazuri.
Mel Braverman, who was standing outside a jewelry store in Greenwich, Conn., also showed signs of disbelief.
"This is where the 400 live," Mr. Braverman said, referring to the legendary list of the social elite. "You've got some of the richest families in America here. Nobody brags about New Jersey. It's famous for its mosquitoes. Garden farms. Chicken farms. The image is quite different. This is where the gentry live."
Mr. Braverman, it should be noted, qualified as a disinterested party, since he lived in Melville, on Long Island, and he offered this prediction for the home state of Joseph I. Lieberman, Al Gore's running mate last year: "Connecticut is going to ask for a recount. They're not going to accept this."
Oddly, a recount was also on the mind of at least one New Jersey resident, Edward Tenner of the department of English at Princeton, whose book "Why Things Bite Back" is all about the bad side of seemingly good things.
"New Jersey's ranking is frightening news," Mr. Tenner said, tongue slightly in cheek. "It's not just that it makes most individual citizens feel poorer rather than richer. It's also that media superlatives -- Person of the Year, Most Respected Company -- so often are followed by a close encounter with some malevolent, headline-scanning, tall-poppy-lopping force.
"How much better to be known as second or third -- not haughty One or envious Two," as New Jersey's own Nathaniel Burt put it. "Let's hope some people merely punched the wrong census chad and that the error will be corrected in due course. When it comes to gold, let's go for the bronze."
Indeed, becoming No. 1 did not produce the kind of in-the-street celebrating in New Jersey that might greet a national championship for the Rutgers football team. Seth McLaughlin, a New Jersey real estate agent, suggested why.
"Someone in Morris County who makes $54,226 has a very slim chance of even buying a small condo or house," Mr. McLaughlin said. "Unfortunately, the average people are being forced to move west, south or north and commute excessive distances. We lucky ones who have a house already are benefiting, but our area is turning into an area where only the rich can live."
Still, Fred Kelly, dean of the School of Business Administration at Monmouth University, said high real estate prices did have their advantages if one happened to be about to retire, sell and flee. ("That's money you can take with you to Florida," he noted.) But for anybody else, Mr. Kelly said, having a high income in a high-cost state is a dubious blessing.
"It's good for your bragging rights and it's probably good for people who will be spending a lot of time here and are looking toward retirement," he said. "But for most workers, it's going in one hand and out the other."
Karen Plunkett-Powell, who is currently peddling the new paperback edition of her book "Remembering Woolworth's," sees bad things ahead for New Jerseyans, and for her dream of bringing back the glory days of the 5 and 10.
"Once national retailers get wind of it, they'll institute a special, higher New Jersey price for everything," Ms. Plunkett-Powell said. "A stampede of out-of-state entrepreneurs will head to the suburbs to open boutiques featuring $25 designer paper clips and $100 bags of saltwater taffy. In five years the motto of the Garden State will change from 'N.J. and You -- Perfect Together' to 'N.J. and You -- Broke Together.' "
So it is not as if the Garden State is gloating. Yet in Connecticut, there is resentment in the air.
"It's Jersey," said Al Ojeda, assistant manager of Sunglass Hut International at the Connecticut Post Mall in Milford. "We're always going to be compared to Jersey now, which is probably not going to be cool."
Chris Carletti of Greenwich, though, at least gave New Jersey credit for helping itself by going after small entrepreneurs and technology companies. 
"I don't see that as much in Connecticut," Mr. Carletti said. "What do we have in Connecticut? We have people who work on Wall Street and come here for tax reasons. We have defense spending, and there's old money. What else do we have here?"
Connecticut, he added, "is living in the past."
A less involved theory of how Connecticut fell from highest-income grace, was offered by Jim Cullen, a truck driver of Trumbull.
"Did Paul Newman move out?" Mr. Cullen asked.
And then there was Chris Moriarty, who grew up in relatively well-off Cheshire, Conn., but jumped to New York City years ago for the not-so-lucrative life of a cabdriver (a career he will soon be trading in for the even less lucrative life of a public school teacher). Mr. Moriarty has always felt a tad ridiculous for leaving the big-money state. 
"It is such a pleasure to see New Jersey take over the reins," he said. "It makes leaving Connecticut a little less painful. Now if only all the rich people from the suburbs of Jersey would consider taking my nice, air-conditioned taxi home from the city for a cozy $100 fare . . . "
As for the outside world, the battle for household-income dominance seems not exactly to have captured its full attention. Told of the news of New Jersey's triumph, Gerry Flahive, a film producer and humor writer in Toronto, had this to say: "I once changed planes at Newark, and the people there seemed very nice. I was not aware that there was an entire state that went with it. Congratulations, Governor Cuomo."

Schoolyard Solutions for Crown Hts. Youths

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
AS the days get hotter and the new school year looms, the fretting starts for Richard Green, chief executive of the Crown Heights Youth Collective in Brooklyn. He faces a shorter list of diversions to lessen the temptations of drugs and gangs on blocks where youth unemployment stands at 85 percent and some young men see prison as a rite of passage.
 Simple things work best. Mr. Green recently put up a basketball hoop on a block near the collective at 915 Franklin Avenue. The neighbors complained about the noise, so he took it down. Then he attached a hoop to a fence at a nearby school, but the school custodian complained and asked that he remove that hoop, too. 
 After the failure of his hoop dreams, it occurred to Mr. Green that a good place for young people to congregate on summer nights might be the schoolyards. They already have hoops and other equipment and plenty of space. But Mr. Green noted in frustration that most of the neighborhood schoolyards are locked in the evening.
"Everything is locked up in New York: the school, the churches, the bathrooms," said Mr. Green, a dreadlocked former marine, as he sat in his cluttered office the other day. "There are four schoolyards in a two-block radius. Where do young people hang out? On the corner, on the block."
And on the streets, he said, those young people are bait for all manner of trouble.
"There is no place now where people can come together to be friends," he said. "The schoolyards should be open all the time. During the school day they should be off limits, but during the evening they should be open to anyone's use."
When Richard Green talks, people listen. In the last decade he has emerged as an important figure in Crown Heights, getting people from different communities to talk and keeping young people from harm's way. Next Sunday is the 10th anniversary of three days of street battles between blacks and Jews in Crown Heights, after a car accident in which a black child was killed by a Jewish driver and a Jewish man was killed by a black mob in apparent retaliation.
Race relations in Crown Heights are a different story these days. But Mr. Green is perturbed by all those locked schoolyards, because a dreary constant is how disfranchised the neighborhood's children are, as reflected in high rates of infant mortality, overcrowded schools and long waits for day care.
In August 1991, young people were the bulk of the rioters, and some said their frustration with life in general was a reason they took to the streets.
Some neighborhood youth advocates said services have not improved enough since a 1992 report by a group called the Crown Heights Coalition found that fewer than 9 percent of youth agencies offered organized recreational or sports facilities, and that there was one youth service worker for every 2,300 youths.
Mr. Green is smart enough to know that unlocking schoolyard gates is the proverbial drop in the bucket, even though he hopes to sit down with some principals this fall. It's just one idea, he says, a symbolic open door.
Others who work with young people in the neighborhood also deplored the paucity of services, but had a mixed reaction to open schoolyards.
Citywide, there is no hard and fast policy on locking schoolyards, said Kevin Ortiz, a Board of Education spokesman. Some are locked and some not, based mostly on the wishes of the principal and the community. If crime is a problem in the area, or if the sounds of late-night basketball bother neighbors, the gates are locked, Mr. Ortiz said. 
"Generally, the yards are closed at dusk and they are locked," he said.
The other day, at a Police Athletic League play site at a playground on Sterling Street between Nostrand and New York Avenues, some children and adults said they liked the idea of unlocked schoolyards. But others thought they would be a magnet for gangs and vandals.
"Any diversion from the stuff out there is needed," said Lance Johnson, an auxiliary police officer with the 71st Precinct and the play site's program director. "I think I'd rather do it in the schools than in the schoolyards."
"She just became a mother," he said, pointing to a 15-year-old girl strolling into a nearby building. "Maybe when that gentleman came knocking on the door she would have been busy with other things, like a step class, if we had it to offer."

 New Jersey companies eliminated 26,378 jobs last month, the second highest number in the nation, according to a monthly survey released by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago job placement firm. 
California topped the list with 45,095 jobs lost. The cuts are attributed to the state where the company headquarters is located even if the workers do not live in that state. New Jersey's total job loss was attributed in large part to the announcement by Lucent Technologies that it would cut nearly 20,000 jobs. Karen DeMasters

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Wall Street Still Sees No Wolves In Its Midst

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The future always seems to look the same.
 In January 1990, with the American economy on the verge of slowing, Wall Street economists predicted growth would accelerate in about six months. When Iraq invaded Kuwait that August, they quickly lowered their forecasts but predicted the economy would pick up in another six months. By October, when a recession was well under way, they further downgraded their estimates -- but again they said the economy should be growing in six months. 
 If you were to look only at Wall Street's long-term forecasts, you might never know that the recession of 1990-91 occurred, says Ethan Harris, an economist at Lehman Brothers. Think of it as the Street's version of the boy who cried wolf.
The ever-optimistic prognostications have returned during this slowdown. First, the recovery was going to begin in the second quarter. Then it was the third quarter. Now -- any minute now, it will begin in the second half of the third quarter.
And it might. The prediction, by its nature, will be correct eventually, much as it turned out to be in October 1990. These days, companies' inventories are shrinking. A $38 billion tax rebate is in the mail. Interest rates are falling. For all those reasons, optimism is the consensus.
But the very consistency of the predictions means that the other view deserves a hearing, too. The contrarians are rare on Wall Street and, apparently, in the White House. They are more common in Washington research centers -- both conservative and liberal -- and in academia.
"It is time for economists to quit touting a second-half recovery," John H. Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote recently in an article on its Web site. "An unbecoming chorus of denial is only making a bad situation worse."
The rose-colored view, he says, results from a long expansion that has made a recession seem unthinkable. It also does not help that many Wall Street economists are paid partly based on how much stock their firms sell and so have an incentive to appear bullish, Mr. Makin added.
The pessimistic argument consists of more than psychology. A crucial part of the optimists' story is the idea that companies are making decisions more quickly as a result of computer systems that give them up-to-date information about their business. According to conventional wisdom, companies have used this knowledge to cut jobs and hours more rapidly than in the past, laying the groundwork for a fast recovery.
The story sounds plausible, and that probably accounts for its popularity, but the government's statistics do not support it. 
SINCE private employment peaked in March at 111.9 million jobs, it has declined 0.34 percent, according to the Labor Department. That is more significant than it sounds, but it also is nearly identical to what happened in the four months after employment peaked in June 1990. At that point, jobs had declined 0.37 percent, and they still had seven more months to fall. 
Look at hours worked, too. Over the last year, the average workweek for nonsupervisory employees -- about 80 percent of the work force -- has declined to 34.2 hours from 34.4 hours, the Labor Department said. It is down from a peak of 34.7 hours more than three years ago. But guess what? In January 1991, when the recession still had two months left, the reduction in hours was slightly more severe.
Most troubling, perhaps, corporate profits continue to sink, despite the cuts so far. Without the revenue to support their costs, companies are unlikely to stop dismissing workers or start investing in new computers and equipment again. Already, such investment is in a free fall, having dropped 1.1 percent, 4.1 and 14.5 percent, respectively, the last three quarters, after 38 consecutive quarters of growth. "In order to get a recovery, the investment slowdown has to at least level out," Mr. Makin said in an interview last week, "and I don't see any compelling evidence that that's happening."
Mr. Makin does not doubt that consumers will spend some of their tax rebate, giving the economy a lift of perhaps one-half of a percentage point, on an annual basis, in the second half. The interest rate reductions should help, too.
But skeptics think that the still-deteriorating labor market and large consumer debt load will end up being more significant. Add it all up, and the third quarter will actually be worse than the second. A meaningful recovery begins next year.
Who's right? Check back in six months. By then, Wall Street will probably be very excited about the summer of 2002.

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; 
Treasury Officials Reluctantly Become Global Firefighters

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
TREASURY Secretary Paul H. O'Neill is not going to be asked to be an honorary member of the International Association of Fire Fighters. In his first seven months on the job, he has made it abundantly clear that he does not like fighting fires, which is the way he characterizes running to the rescue of emerging market countries that have gotten into financial trouble, as Argentina has right now.
 He has said repeatedly that he wants to reduce the time and money that international financial institutions, led by the International Monetary Fund, spend on firefighting. "Certainly, there will always be unexpected events that we and the institutions will have to deal with, but firefighting should be the exceptional cases for these institutions, not the norm," he said in April. All these comments were a rebuke of the Clinton administration's hands-on firefighting, from the rescue package for Mexico in 1995 to aid for Brazil in 1998. 
 The Bush administration was in lock step with the O'Neill approach as Argentina, in mid-July, teetered near the brink of default. Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, told reporters that "Argentina is trying to take some steps to deal with its economic and financial situation and that is really the best course of action." A spokesman for the International Monetary Fund said there was no plan on the table to speed up the release of future aid for Argentina or consider additional aid.
But that was theory and Mr. O'Neill and the Bush administration are now facing the real world, where events can overtake the best of intentions. Already in April, the administration backed a $10 billion emergency aid package to Turkey. 
Now it seems that Argentina's problems may force the administration back into the fire trucks. Nine days ago, the administration supported a new $15 billion loan for Brazil, the Latin American neighbor that is suffering from the fallout from Argentina's crisis.
Argentina may not have to go it alone. John B. Taylor, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs who as a Stanford professor once proposed the abolition of the I.M.F., met with Argentine officials the first weekend in August and said he was "impressed" by their efforts and supported the speed up of the delivery of $1.2 billion to Argentina from the monetary fund.
Argentine officials are now pressing the fund for as much as $9 billion in additional new assistance. A Treasury official denied one Argentine press report last week of an agreement on new aid but said the Treasury was "monitoring the situation."
Michele A. Davis, assistant Treasury secretary for public affairs, said limiting rescue packages is a goal, not a new policy. "We want to get to where we are not fighting fires. In the meantime, there is a lot of dry kindling lying around and you have to deal with that."
Pointing to an interview with The Financial Times in July, she argued that Mr. O'Neill has made this distinction clear. "The fact that this is not picked up in the press accounts, I can't do anything about," she said. "When you give a speech you are laying out where you want to get too," she said, explaining why Mr. O'Neill's distaste for firefighting has received all the notice.
Geoffrey Dennis, Latin American equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, explained the administration's drift toward firefighting this way: "Whatever the theoretical model is, it is hard to let these countries default on their watch."
BUT because this adjustment is being made without clear enunciation, it is giving the impression that the Treasury Department is being rolled by events. It is adding uncertainty and volatility to emerging markets. And it may be contributing to a quick change in expectations for Argentina, which if dashed now could make its troubles even worse.
"We all came in Monday thinking that Argentina had been cut loose," said Mr. Dennis. The $1.2 billion speedup of aid was not considered to be enough help to satisfy Wall Street, which, of course, would like a bailout that would reduce or even eliminate its recent losses in Argentina and other emerging markets. 
Now, Mr. Dennis said, "it will be a huge surprise if they don't get more funding" in the $6 billion to $9 billion range. And that, he said, "would be firefighting."

The Perils of Planning One's Own Prepaid Funeral

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP

 BODY:
LIKE most people, Louise A. Underwood was used to getting frequent solicitations at her home in Orange, Calif., from just about every type of business, except maybe funeral homes and cemeteries. Only on rare occasions would she find a pamphlet from, say, a cremation company in her mailbox.
 But several weeks ago, she started receiving phone pitches from a cemetery trying to persuade her to prepay her funeral costs. With such plans, the entire cost of a funeral is paid in advance at today's dollars, and the money, or a part of it, is put into an annuity, an insurance policy or a funeral trust. 
 Ms. Underwood, who did not want to saddle her three children and five grandchildren with burial costs, said the prepaid plan sounded tempting, particularly after the saleswoman told her the cost of a funeral could more than double over the next 15 to 30 years. "For every negative concern that I brought up, this woman had an answer," said Ms. Underwood, 49, a grant writer for the Blind Children's Learning Center in Santa Ana, Calif. She passed on the offer. 
There was a time when cemeteries and funeral homes relied primarily on word of mouth, when marketing meant taking out a small ad in a church bulletin or stamping their names on free calendars or pencils. 
But death care, a $15 billion business that includes casket sellers and monument makers, has become increasingly aggressive at promoting itself. Analysts who follow the business say the shift is the result of an industry that is still in debt after a number of acquisitions in the late 1990's as well as the growing popularity of less expensive cremations and the fact that people are simply living longer.
To attract customers, especially to the prepaid plans, some companies are offering new types of services and promotions, like online memorials, which are simple Web sites that honor a deceased loved one. Others are giving prepaid customers a year's worth of access to 24-hour "compassion" help lines or coupons worth thousands of dollars in funeral expenses if a child or grandchild should die before age 21 (the coupon carries the name of the child). A few companies have even changed or adopted names that sound more like a memorial society and less like a business, like the Ohio Cremation & Memorial Society, which is a network of 10 cremation companies.
Several trade groups like the National Funeral Directors Association and the International Cemetery and Funeral Association have been trying to help consumers sort through the marketing melange. Their Web sites (www.nfda.org and www.icfa.org) contain consumer tips and pricing information. (The funeral directors' group noted that the average adult funeral, excluding cemetery charges, costs $5,800.)
Still, some consumer advocates complain that people are being inundated with products and services that they neither want nor need, and at prices that are often questionably high. Other efforts, they say, have come close to violating federal marketing laws that require companies to fully disclose their prices.
SOME companies have engaged in affinity marketing, which usually entails selling discounted services through an umbrella organization. Last March, for example, Service Corporation International of Houston, the world's largest funeral and cemetery company, sent letters to veterans in California and Connecticut who belong to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Service Corporation hoped to interest veterans in its Dignity Memorial prepaid funeral, which costs $3,295, or its cremation plan, which costs $1,995. 
But some consumer advocates have objected to the company's enrollment form, which asks people to send in a payment before providing pricing information.
Lisa Carlson, the executive director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance in Hinesburg, Vt., (www.funerals.org) said the form violated the federal Funeral Rule of 1984, which requires companies that sell funeral goods and services to first provide an itemized price list and a statement of the goods and services selected.
Jerry Norman, a managing director of marketing at Service Corporation, said that the Dignity Memorial plan is set up so that consumers who sign up have 30 days in which to cancel. Besides, Mr. Norman said, because the company has more than 1,500 sites in North America, it is unable to give consumers itemized price lists unless the company first knows which funeral home has been picked. Consumers are free to get the lists from the homes, he added.
The Internet has turned into an especially potent marketing tool for the funeral industry. Many companies are linked to Internet portals like HeavenlyDoor.com or Forethought.com, as well as the online memorials that offer families and friends many services, including chat rooms and photo galleries of the deceased. 
At LifeFiles.com in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the memorials cost $295 for two years, and are set up so that visitors can gain access to hundreds of other services for funerals, including an online card and flower shop. The sites are renewable annually for $29.95.
Not all consumers are taken with such efforts. After calling the Funeral Consumers Alliance, Ms. Underwood discovered that the local cemetery saleswoman was offering services that cost almost twice as much as those available elsewhere. For example, the saleswoman told her that cremation would cost at least $1,000, when Ms. Underwood knew that her mother and father had recently bought such services from their local cemetery for $650 each.
Cemeteries, unlike funeral homes, are not covered by the federal Funeral Rule, and are required to provide price lists only if they handle the remains. Yet many cemeteries also sell prepaid funerals, and some of those arrangements are falling short.
Last October, the family of Gladys L. Bohn of Modesto, Calif., filed a lawsuit against a mortuary company in Santa Cruz, accusing it of ignoring the specific details of a prepaid plan that Mrs. Bohn had bought in 1989, and which eventually cost $1,866. The suit said that in her contract, Mrs. Bohn had asked for amenities like a light-colored "Princess" casket, the services of a professional cosmetologist and a car and driver for transporting flower arrangements.
But according to the lawsuit, after Mrs. Bohn died at 96 in January 2000, the mortuary could not find her body for three days, then buried her in a particleboard box, without honoring any of her wishes. Her family claims that when her remains were disinterred six months later, she was in a body bag, still wearing her hospital gown.
In June, the AARP Foundation, an affiliate of AARP that provides educational services to older Americans, decided to help represent Mrs. Bohn's family in the lawsuit, which is pending in a California state court.
"We're hearing a lot of complaints about cemeteries," said Stacy J. Canan, a lawyer for the AARP Foundation. "A lot of them run roughshod over consumers because they are in such a vulnerable position and often have no ability to seek recourse."
John Carmon, president of the funeral directors association, said he was aware of the aggressive marketing by certain companies. His group, he says, opposes the telemarketing of any funeral product.
In 1999, the Federal Trade Commission began reviewing the Funeral Rule to assess whether its price disclosure requirement should be expanded to include cemeteries, mortuaries, monument dealers and casket sellers; the agency hopes to decide by fall. 
Eileen Harrington, associate director of marketing practices at the F.T.C., said the prepaid plans were the agency's main concern when it came to the funeral industry.
Ms. Carlson said she had concerns about how the money in the plans was invested. Money that goes into funeral insurance generally does not grow at the same rate as money paid into a trust, she said. And it may not keep up with inflation because a certain amount is used to pay administrative costs, she added.
As for refunds, she said, if consumers change their funeral plans or need to withdraw the money, they generally lose from 5 percent to 30 percent of what they paid in premiums and possibly accrued interest.
Funeral trusts, on the other hand, generally allow the money plus interest to be withdrawn.
Ms. Harrington said individual states, and not the commission, had jurisdiction over insurance policies. 
Another concern, she said, is the lack of authority that her agency has over prepaid policies that are sold by nonprofit entities like churches. 
At least eight states, including New Jersey, now have legislation that either partly or completely bars most funeral homes and cemeteries that are selling prepaid plans from making uninvited contact with consumers, Ms. Carlson said. And even some funeral homes now seem to think that the marketing has gone too far. 
DURING a recent discussion on the Internet, a Florida funeral director complained about a saleswoman at her funeral home. After receiving a call from a man whose father was dying, the saleswoman rushed to the hospital to sell the son a prepaid funeral, and get a $50 commission. The man died hours later.
Ms. Carlson said her organization would like to see prepaid plans sold only by licensed funeral directors.
Ms. Underwood, meanwhile, says she thinks she knows how her name appeared on a phone list. In May, she and her family attended a veteran's memorial at the cemetery, just as they had for the past three years. This time, Ms. Underwood filled out a card that asked for her address, so that she could receive a small American flag stickpin for her 4-year-old grandson, Dane. Within two weeks, her family received its first call.

HEADLINE: The National Pastime Falls Behind in the Count 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
THERE are places where baseball games last just two and a half hours, where batters spend most of their time at home plate trying to hit the ball rather than fidgeting with their equipment. There are also places where the fans of every team legitimately dream of a championship. There are even places where the teams that do fall to last place continue to inspire passion until the final weeks of the season.
 And then there is Major League Baseball. 
 In its world, games stretch beyond midnight, past the school-night bedtimes of the people who should be its most fervent fans. Only the richest of the sport's teams win even a single World Series game. Every September, when many also-ran teams have long since given up hope, their stadiums are empty and at-home fans turn their televisions to other channels. 
It is a strange time for the $3.3 billion business also known as the national pastime. Overall revenue has almost doubled since 1996, and ballparks like Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park are fuller today than they have ever been.
But average attendance for the league still has not recovered to the levels it reached before the 1994 labor dispute -- despite a long economic boom, the construction of 10 stadiums, a doubling of the number of playoff teams and the addition of interleague games pitting, say, the Mets against the Yankees. Meanwhile, the fall of television ratings for games makes the National Football League look good, and the number of children playing organized baseball is plummeting.
All in all, it is enough to make the sport's commissioner sound as if he is living in a Lewis Carroll story. "Baseball is in the midst of an incredible renaissance," said Bud Selig, the sport's top executive -- later acknowledging, "the economic problems are so pervasive that all options should be on the table."
At times like this, companies often seek outside help. So Money & Business has turned not to the usual experts for inspiration, but to the world beyond Major League Baseball -- from the sport's own minor leagues all the way to baseball-agnostic Europe. These are the places where well-paced games are the norm or where even miserable teams can keep fans interested. 
Now is the time to be creative. In less than three months, after the World Series, the current labor agreement between major-league owners and players will expire. Each time the deal has come up for renewal in the last 30 years, there has been either a strike or a lockout. If baseball is going to flirt with that pain yet again, it might as well see what can be gained.
Here are four ideas:

Remedy One
Copy Bush Leagues, Bring Back the Fun
Name one of the nation's largest metropolitan areas, and it probably has a thriving baseball team. It may even have three or four.
The BlueClaws in Lakewood, N.J., playing 60 miles from Philadelphia, have already broken the all-time attendance record for the Class A South Atlantic League, and their inaugural season still has a few weeks left. The Brooklyn Cyclones have sold almost every seat -- about 7,500 a game -- in their first season. In the outer suburbs of Chicago, the Kane County Cougars built a new deck of seats last winter to accommodate their ever-growing crowds.
Every night, thousands of people who could see Cal Ripken Jr. or Sammy Sosa instead choose to watch error-prone 21-year-olds.
"We kind of got laughed at when we started," said Jeff Sedivy, the general manager of the Cougars, who opened for business in 1991. "People were saying, 'Why would anyone be interested in minor-league baseball with two major-league teams in the market?' " But attendance for the Cougars -- four notches below the majors -- has more than doubled in the last 10 years, to 7,500 fans a game. 
Of course, that is far less than the average crowd of 30,000 at a big-league game. On a typical midsummer night, 500,000 people are at major-league parks, compared to the 350,000 watching minor-league games.
But the gap is narrowing. Between 1993 and last year, when per-game attendance fell 4 percent for the major leagues, it rose 19 percent in the minors. At the minors' lowest levels, where the stadiums are smallest, tickets cheapest and players youngest, attendance has risen the most. 
"It's accessible and easy, and it's all fun," said Steve Rogers, who was watching the Cougars beat an Ohio team, the Dayton Dragons, 11 to 2 on a recent Wednesday with his wife and three children. "There's an excitement in the air here. The kids can really see the players." Mr. Rogers said he stopped attending Cubs games after the 1994 lockout.
The majors have copied a few gimmicks from the minors, like having entertainment on the field between innings. On the whole, though, the big leagues have become less like the bush leagues.
Major-league games now last an average of almost 3 hours, about 10 minutes longer than they did in the early 1990's and about 15 minutes longer than a minor-league game does. In the playoffs, they often drag on even longer. 
"You can't have the most important games of the year end at midnight on a school night and not have that come back to bite you," said Bob Costas, the NBC broadcaster and author of "Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball" (Broadway Books). Watching highlights on ESPN, he added, "can't replace the drama of seeing it as it unfolds and remembering where you were the instant the balls hits the bat."
Shortening games need not involve the one move baseball has made -- its controversial attempts to expand the strike zone -- or the dream fans have about the eliminating the designated hitter. Baseball could, for instance, simply order batters and pitchers to stop wasting time. 
"After every pitch, Chuck Knoblauch" -- the Yankees' left fielder -- "steps out of the box, straightens his helmet, fixes his batting gloves, takes three or four swings," said Geoff Brown, the general manager of Lakewood's BlueClaws, whose home games are averaging 2 hours and 32 minutes. "You don't have guys doing that in the minors." 
Guys weren't doing it 30 years ago in the majors. Just watch an old baseball video.
In a typical minor-league park, fans can also carry on one of baseball's most cherished rituals: a conversation. They don't have to out-shout the music and commercials that dominate so many big-league parks. 
At least one major-league team has seen the virtue in this. The San Francisco Giants recently canceled a team-sponsored "scream off" between fans on opposite sides of the ballpark and turned down the volume on songs played during the game. "It gave everybody a headache," Larry Baer, the team's chief operating officer, said. "We found that by dialing it down a little bit, we have not lost the casual fan."
Two other big differences between the majors and the minors are more complicated. Since 1993, the average ticket price in the big leagues has increased 61 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis to $19, according to Team Marketing Report, a newsletter in Chicago. A typical minor-league ticket costs $6.
Meanwhile, the growing number of luxury skyboxes, which have the best views, has pushed the location of many major-league seats nearly into the clouds. That has stopped John Forni, a Cougars fan, from attending Chicago White Sox games. "Last time I went down there, do you want to know how far up I was? I was so far up, I got seasick," he said. "I'm not kidding."
Roger G. Noll, a Stanford economist who has studied sports business, says there is good reason to reconsider the emphasis on selling to the top end. "The real problem with baseball is that it is increasingly marketing itself to the top 25 percent of the income distribution," he said. That has helped baseball sell more $100 jackets, but he added, "over the long run, it probably undermines building a fan base." 

Remedy Two
The Worst Teams Go to the Minors
It was the final day of the soccer season in Huddersfield, England, where the local team was mired near the bottom of the standings. But odd things -- to American eyes -- were happening all around. Not only was the stadium almost full, but some of the fans had brought radios to keep tabs on a rival.
Far from being unusual, though, similar scenes happen every spring all over Europe. To stoke interest, soccer leagues there "relegate" the worst teams at the end of each season to the minor leagues. They are replaced the following year by the most successful minor-league teams. The demoted teams -- usually three or four, depending on the country -- can return to the top-ranked league only by finishing at the top of the lower league during the next season.
The battle to avoid relegation unfailingly captures attention. "It keeps the season alive," said Russell Thomas, a sports editor at The Guardian in London. "There's sort of a gruesome interest in the grimness of their plight." 
Compare this to the grimness that will take place in Kansas City, Tampa Bay and other downtrodden baseball cities at the end of this season. 
"The thing people are really keen to avoid in Europe is meaningless games between two teams who really don't have anything to play for," said Dan Jones, a consultant with Deloitte & Touche Sport in Manchester, England. "You tend to get a lot of those in baseball."
In fact, the perpetual weakness of some franchises has led Mr. Selig, the commissioner, to say that Major League Baseball should consider disbanding a few teams. "There are many owners who strongly believe we have too many teams," he said. The relocation of one or two teams, to wealthy areas without one, however, is a more likely outcome.
But suppose baseball let the free market solve the problem, as Europe's soccer leagues do. It would be more exciting than contraction or relocation, and maybe more efficient. Baseball would start by deciding how many teams to have in the majors -- say 26, four fewer than currently, to reverse the dilution of talent caused by recent expansion. Baseball would then relegate the two worst teams to the minors -- and, for the first two years, not replace them.
Suddenly, a dreary September game in Montreal between the Pirates and Expos, which now draws maybe 5,000 fans, would bring a Coliseum-like excitement: the loser would be facing the baseball equivalent of death.
At the same time, baseball could award four new franchises to cities that want a major-league team: Charlotte, N.C., Portland, Ore., San Jose, Calif., and Washington come to mind. These teams would join the relegated teams in a new minor league that would soon promote its top two teams to the majors at the end of each season.
In the new league, "everybody who was playing above .500 would have promotion as part of their marketing in the second half of the season," said Mr. Noll, the economist, who has studied English soccer teams.
The markets with the biggest fan bases and television audiences would generate enough money to remain in the majors consistently. Others would find a comfortable place in the lower league or would bounce up and down between the two. Owners who seek profit but not wins would have to the face the consequences of the terrible teams they put on the field. In future years, those teams would no longer be able to play against the game's stars.
This plan may be radical, but it has another advantage over contraction: If baseball had decided to eliminate some teams in the 1980's, Atlanta and Seattle, two of the worst, might have gone. Today, both are in first place, and among baseball's richer teams. If they had been disbanded, they never could have staged their resurrection. 

Remedy Three
Find New Customers In Other Countries
When American companies absolutely, positively need to increase profits, they often go overseas for new consumers and cheap labor. Major League Baseball has figured out the second tack. Rosters are filled with Latin-American players, who command small signing bonuses, and proven Asian stars, like Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki, are becoming more common, too.
Now baseball is trying exports. It has sold broadcast rights to more foreign television stations, pushing international revenue to $60 million last year, from $2 million in the early 90's. But the strategy is hardly aggressive. When McDonald's moves into a new market, it doesn't sell frozen Big Macs in supermarkets; it opens restaurants. Baseball, though, sells only a derivative of its product -- broadcasts of the games.
The sport has not always been so tame in its exports. In 1954, Cincinnati moved its top minor-league team to Havana. The team was called the Cuban Sugar Kings, and their slogan was, "One more step, and we'll get there." It referred to the major-league ambitions of both the players and the city itself, according to Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria, the author of "The Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball" (Oxford University Press).
The team's high point came in 1959, when it won the Triple A championship. The final games in Havana drew 30,000 fans, including Che Guevara in a box behind home plate and Fidel Castro, who threw the ceremonial first pitch. The following season, as tensions between the United States and Cuba rose, the league moved the team to Jersey City.
These days, several cities within a short flight of the United States are again intriguing possibilities for new minor-league teams. When Major League Baseball played its opening game of the 1999 regular season in Monterrey, Mexico, tickets sold out within hours. The same happened in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in April, when the Texas Rangers played the Toronto Blue Jays.
Monterrey has three million people, and President Vicente Fox has called it a model of economic development. San Juan is a typically baseball-loving Caribbean city and has already had one brush with the minors.
In the mid-1990's, David Hersh was planning to move the team he ran in Nashville, Tenn., to San Juan, which he considered to be the largest untapped market in the United States. But the Seattle Mariners, whose up-and-coming players were on the team's roster, blocked the move, saying they wanted the team within the continental United States, Mr. Hersh said. 
Yes, Monterrey and San Juan are quite poor by American standards. "There are the sponsorship dollars for a Triple A franchise" in San Juan, Mr. Hersh said. "There are not the ticket-buying dollars," because the island has a small middle class. 
Yet both cities are within reasonable flying distance of the double-A Texas League. Just as most companies enter new markets without expecting immediate profitability, baseball would probably need to view new foreign franchises as an investment in their initial years. 
But it would be an investment almost certain to create new fans of American baseball. The teams might even become part of the big leagues one day, as the Sugar Kings hoped to.

Remedy Four
Can't Beat 'Em? Share the Wealth
The Oakland A's seem to be the perfect rejoinder to those who think baseball's richest teams dominate the sport. Playing a short drive from the more popular Giants, the A's generate relatively little revenue and have a small payroll. Yet, with talented young players, they won their division last year and could make the playoffs this year as a wild card. 
Oddly, though, their fans don't seem particularly moved. Only 25,100, on average, go to a game -- leaving the A's 20th, among 30 teams, in attendance and well below the pace they set in the late 1980's, when they were last up-and-comers. 
It's hard to blame the fans. When the A's were stumbling at the beginning of this season, its executives began talking about trading Jason Giambi -- last year's American League most valuable player -- because he was expensive. Giambi remains in Oakland, but no clear-thinking A's fan can expect the core of the current team to stay together for the next few years. And this version of the A's still has not won a single playoff series.
"What matters to a fan," Mr. Costas said, "is the perception of a team's ability to contend."
By every measure, fewer teams have that ability today than just a decade ago. The gap between the richest team's local revenue and the poorest has grown to almost 20 to 1, from 4 to 1 a decade ago, driven by the big differences in television rights fees across the country. 
"The disparity is so large," said Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve Chairman, who served on league-appointed committee to study the game, "that it leads fairly directly to a chronic inability on the playing field of a considerable number of clubs ever to get on the winning side of things."
"Presumably, that weakens interest in baseball," he added.
True, wealthy teams, like the Yankees, dominated the sport in earlier eras, but the problem has not always afflicted the sport. In the 1980's and even the early 1990's, when the difference between a small and large payroll was much less, more frugal teams -- like the 1990 Cincinnati Reds or 1985 Kansas City Royals -- regularly played in and even won the World Series. Since 1995, no team with a payroll ranked lower than 7th has won a single Series game.
The National Football League offers an alternative. In the 1960's, on the eve of their first big television contract, football's large-market owners agreed with their colleagues and Pete Rozelle, the commissioner, to split revenue almost evenly.
Football is now the most-watched sport on television, and in the last five years, New York, St. Louis, Nashville and even Green Bay, Wis., have all had teams appear in the Super Bowl.
Baseball and football may seem to be opposite in many respects. George Carlin even wrote a stand-up routine about their differences. ("Baseball begins in the spring, the season of new life. Football begins in the fall, when everything's dying.")
But changing its financial structural would hardly threaten baseball's romance. "We have not served our long-term problems well," Mr. Selig said. "It's one thing I'll give Pete Rozelle and the owners of the N.F.L. a lot of credit for."
Like almost everything else in baseball, this issue is tied up in the rocky labor situation. The owners are using the revenue gap to try to force a salary cap on players. The players scoff at the owners' complaints that many teams are no longer profitable.
Few people question that the issue is the biggest one now facing baseball, however. In the upcoming negotiations, "we expect it likely that the most signigicant topic will be revenue sharing," said Don Fehr, the head of the players' union. 
Whatever specific form a new system takes -- a salary cap or a steep tax on rich teams, perhaps phased in gradually -- many fans just want a return to the days when anything seemed possible. After all, what is the point of watching a sport if a good part of the outcome is already clear?

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Modern Preservation; 
It's Still All About Form and Function

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY VIDLER; Anthony Vidler, just named dean of the Cooper Union School of Architecture, is author of "Warped Space: Art, Architecture and Anxiety in Modern Culture."

 BODY:
THE word "preservation" evokes images of cathedrals and chateaus, colonial homes and Civil War sites, historic monuments that have a fixed place in the local or national heritage. But as historical research and shifting public tastes identify more and more recent buildings as worthy of conservation, the public is being asked to weigh the intrinsic cultural value of somewhat more ephemeral structures, built for commercial or public use over the last century and now threatened by pressures on real estate and changing business practices.
 The current debate about proposed alterations to Eero Saarinen's dramatic icon of 1960's aesthetics, the Trans World Airlines Flight Center at Kennedy International Airport, with a public review set for Tuesday, points to an increasing problem in our culture of obsolescence: what to do with buildings that have outlived their original purposes. 
 Thus neighborhoods like the meat-packing district on the West Side of Manhattan, office buildings like Gordon Bunshaft's elegant Lever House on Park Avenue and not-so-old structures like Edward Durrell Stone's museum for Huntington Hartford at the southwest corner of Central Park, join the T.W.A. terminal as environments radically different in form but with the same interest in survival. All are at the center of battles over preservation, restoration or adaptive re-use now common in urban politics. 
As increasing numbers of relatively recent buildings are seen to have historic and aesthetic value, these battles will only intensify. The organization Docomomo, established in 1990 for the worldwide "Documentation and Conservation of the Modern Movement," has brought to public attention structures from Brazil to Sweden that, 10 years ago, were not thought worthy of preservation yet represent the heritage of modernist design. 
Preservation is not a new issue. It has been a battle cry in expanding metropolitan areas since the early 19th century, when lovers of Gothic architecture were angered by the perceived "vandalism" of the French Revolution.
But the recent cases refocus the issue in two new ways. First, these are buildings designed in an era when "modern" architecture was seen as the ultimate answer to the problems of technological society -- when architecture proclaimed itself free of the burden of history. The aim was not to design monuments, but "machines" for living and working, mass-produced for mass society. The shock is realizing even modernity has a history with its own monuments. Second, the special nature of functionalist designs -- "form follows function," as modernists kept repeating -- often created buildings that seem resistant to change.
The problem is compounded when opinion is divided over a building's merits. The lattice-facaded museum by Stone is a good example of a work derided from the outset, but that many historians now feel warrants preservation. Or consider if Walter Gropius's Pan Am Building, now the MetLife Building, atop Grand Central were at risk. How to evaluate a building castigated at its inception for blocking the vista of Park Avenue, but that remains a significant work of an important architect? Like the T.W.A. terminal, it represents a historic moment in the aspirations for flight as an aid to global communication. What criteria -- aesthetic, historical, functional -- are to be used for so recent a monument?
What Victor Hugo called "The War of the Demolishers" in 1832, is still without clear issue. Indeed, it has become evident that there are no real winners in these preservation debates. Wholesale preservation and restoration of buildings and districts has tended to turn them into species of theme parks, where the activity of looking has replaced the activity of original use. "Adaptive reuse" often destroys a building's original character. Comprehensive demolition and redevelopment usually wipe out all traces of a district's historic past. 
The issue seems divided into two opposing solutions. Should we adopt the premise that nothing should alter an architect's original intention, even if it means preserving a structure no longer useful save as a large museum object? Or should we be blind to historic value, transform at will, and let later generations sort out what was good, bad or indifferent in modern architecture?
The discussion of the T.W.A. terminal poses the problem starkly. Its dynamically sculptural form, inside and out, where the curves of the roof shells merge gently into the walls, and smoothly join with the floors and ramped levels, and these again into the building's very furnishings -- benches, ticket counters and information stands -- seems to have been cast from a single mold. Such total unity calls for total preservation. The terminal is a perfectly self-contained object -- anything subtracted or added necessarily "spoils" this perfection. To cut off one of the access tubes that once led to the planes would be like cutting off an arm from a sculpture of a figure. 
Here, perhaps the solution is not to transform the building to fit new functions but rather to reverse the process, and imagine new functions for the old form. Where one activity has ceased to inform a space, another might give it new meaning. This epitome of 60's symbolic modernism, once the expression-filled instrument of seamless flow between curb and aircraft, may take on new significance as the iconic anchor to the new high-tech hangars for the masses. As a center of business exchange and elegant restaurant service, it could serve today's travelers.
What is needed is less a costing out of one obsolete structure against its apparently more efficient replacement; less the measuring of an old form against new demands; less even the fierce debates over the aesthetic worth of older buildings, than a creative assessment of a building's formal values and spatial qualities, in relation to a gamut of possible new uses, followed by a reshaping of these uses themselves. After all, even a new building like Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, has demonstrated that buildings alone can provoke significant economic and cultural renewal. The concept of "adaptive reuse" might then be applied to function, not to form. 
BUT even with inventive solutions, the basic question remains. To what extent should cities or areas become "museums" of their own past, set in amber for the delight of future generations, as opposed to dynamic centers of growth?
The answer will affect economic development, but will also reflect the shifting values of communities with changing ethnic and cultural identities. It will bring many new kinds of structures -- everything from freeway intersections to industrial constructions -- within the purview of preservationists.
How to manage this heterogeneous heritage without indiscriminately subjecting it to the wrecker's ball or blocking needed development is a problem of public policy that requires an equally heterogeneous range of solutions. The outcome of the T.W.A. terminal debate will, in this sense, be a measure of our society's ability to confront its history.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: TRIBECA; 
600-Foot Office Tower Is Proposed In an Area Where Lofts Abound

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
In 1961, when TriBeCa was the butter-and-eggs district and Washington Street was a desolate fold of raw warehouses and leftover markets, the city created a 25-block urban renewal area to spur development.
 Four decades later, the city is planning a 32-story office tower on the last open parcel, an L-shaped site known as 5B, which is bounded by West, Greenwich, Warren and Murray Streets. And residents say this is just too much development in what has become a heavily residential area. 
 The building would be two blocks shy of the World Trade Center and the World Financial Center. But across the street are Public School 234 and the Greenwich Court condominiums, as well as numerous converted lofts.
"It's hard to imagine a more inappropriate location for a commercial building of this size and bulk," said Bernard D'Orazio, president of Save Our Space, a community group formed to fight development.
The developer chosen by the city, Edward J. Minskoff Equities, has proposed a 600-foot-tall granite-and-glass building with a landscaped plaza, a ground-floor retail pavilion and one million square feet of offices. It was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Rick Matthews, a spokesman for Minskoff, said the building would satisfy a huge demand for downtown offices.
The proposal must pass environmental review as well as win city approval. If approved, it would be the first new office building in lower Manhattan in a decade, and among the first without tenants already committed since the 1980's.
Some real estate experts say the project's timing makes sense, even with a softening market. "Assuming Minskoff gets financing, it would be shrewd to be contrarian," said Robert L. Billingsley, vice chairman of Colliers ABR, a commercial real estate firm. "In another three years, it will be a brave new world." DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: Travel to Exotic Places and Buy, Buy, Buy 

BYLINE:  By RUTH LA FERLA 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
FLUTED columns and an outsize copy of Michelangelo's "David" dominate the Forum and the Appian Way, the shopping arcades at Caesars Palace. But they were fleeting distractions to Rebecca Bennett, who toured the resort hotel on a summer day with only one object in mind. "Since I got here this afternoon, I've done nothing but shop, said Ms. Bennett, 24, a student from San Diego. She burrowed into a gilt-embossed shopping bag and produced a pair of leather sandals. "I have 10 more bags in my hotel room," she gloated, "all shoes, all sandals, and I have even more CD's and a gorgeous chamois-colored leather jacket. I've been to Las Vegas six times, maybe seven. Each time, the only reason was to shop."
 For travelers like Ms. Bennett, this city founded on legalized sin has improbably morphed into America's premier shopping destination. Today, Las Vegas Boulevard, the fabled Strip, is a mile and a half of theme-park-style casino hotels, synthetic volcanos and more retail stores than Madison Avenue, including all the luxury names: Tiffany, Gucci, Neiman Marcus. With so many temptations in the paths of tourists, it was perhaps just a matter of time before they were bypassing slot machines in favor of malls, their pursuit of the perfect tank top or stiletto heel eating into ever larger chunks of their vacation time. 
 Four years ago, gambling was the No. 1 priority of Las Vegas visitors. Now, the city's Convention and Visitors Authority says, gambling ranks No. 2 behind entertainment, which includes dining out, floor shows and shopping. Visitors spend more on shopping, $166 on the average trip, than on shows or sightseeing. Every major designer and mass merchant is represented, including Versace, Banana Republic and F. A. O. Schwarz. 
Vacationers have always shopped, of course, picking up mementos wherever they stayed. But now, shopping, once a byproduct of travel, has moved to the top of vacation agendas, competing with and sometimes superseding activities like museumgoing, theater and sports. "For many Americans, shopping has taken over not just Sunday afternoons, but entire family holidays," said Candace Corlett, a partner at WSL Strategic Retail, a New York consulting firm. 
Shopping -- long viewed by students of retail as entertainment in its own right or as consumer self-expression -- has lately emerged as the primary reason for many Americans to take to the road. A study by the Travel Industry Association of America this year reported that shopping was the No. 1 or No. 2 reason for taking a trip, according to 51 percent of those surveyed. "It can be submitted," the study said, that "shopping is a cause, not effect of the decision to travel." 
The study also corrected the impression that travelers mostly buy T-shirts and souvenir mugs. The average shopping traveler spent $333, with one in five spending $500. The most common purchases were clothes or shoes. 
On both coasts and in between, well-stocked shops and boutiques often draw bigger crowds than historical sites and landmarks. "Increasingly, stores are tourist destinations in and of themselves," said James Gilmore, the author with Joseph Pine of "The Experience Economy" (Harvard Business Press, 1999), which argues that Americans are likely to place a greater value on the experience of shopping than on what they buy. 
Catering to that mind-set, malls and cut-price outlet centers aggressively blur the distinction between shopping and tourism. 
One of the best known, the Mall of America in suburban Minneapolis, with a seven-acre theme park in its midst, attracts 43 million visitors a year, more than a third of them tourists. By contrast, Graceland draws 650,000.
Since opening a decade ago, the Mall of America has offered vacation packages that include a stay at one of the hotels within walking distance. In partnership with Northwest Airlines, the mall offers "Shop Til You Drop" bargain airfares to day-trippers from nearby cities like Fargo, N.D. and Des Moines. 
These days, malls have learned to compete with museums and other traditional tourist attractions by including shops that masquerade as theaters, learning centers or gyms. At the same time, museums and restaurants, with their inevitable expanding gift shops, have come to resemble stores. 
"We have reached a moment when culture and retailing can no longer be separated," said Jeffrey Inaba, one of the editors, along with the influential Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, of the essay volume "Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping," to be published in October. The book argues that shopping now defines the modern city, influencing all aspects of its design. 
"Churches are mimicking shopping malls to attract followers," the introduction states. "Airports have become wildly profitable by converting travelers into consumers. Museums are turning to shopping to survive."
Culture, entertainment and commerce began converging in the early 1990's in retail extravaganzas like REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.) in Seattle, a store that offers a trail loop for bicycle test drives; and Niketown, whose first megastore in Chicago had three-story video screens and sports memorabilia. It became Chicago's top tourist port of call. That city is also home to the American Girl Store, where visitors pay $25 to dine and to see a live stage show, and cap their visit by buying one of the company's popular period dolls, for about $80.
In the hope of inducing shoppers to extend their stays, some new malls are anchored not by traditional department stores, but by skateboard parks and multiplex theaters. The Mills Corporation, a developer based in Arlington, Va., also includes Bass Pro Shops for fishing demonstrations and Gibson guitar showcases at its malls, which are expressly designed to attract tourists. The company says it is a leading tourist draw in every state where its 12 malls are found. Its Ontario Mills in Ontario, Calif., east of Los Angeles, has 24 million visitors a year, more than Disneyland, the company says. (Disney does not make attendance figures public.)
In New York, the Guggenheim Museum and Radio City Music Hall would have to wait for Rachel Turner, 22, a law student from Stuart, Va., shopping in the city. She sifted the racks at Bloomingdale's looking for the perfect pumps. She had missed a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art while she did the stores. She did not mind, though she did have one regret: "By the time I got to Tods, the sale was over."
On Fifth Avenue, Terry Hutchison, 48, a homemaker from Newport Beach, Calif. was combing the H&M fashion emporium, with three children. "We've been here about eight days and spent about four of them shopping," she said blithely. "We've hardly done anything else."
No wonder that museums and other cultural institutions feel the pressure to expand into retailing. A new Guggenheim branch designed by Frank Gehry for Lower Manhattan has two shops in its plans. 
But it is Las Vegas, perhaps more than any other city, that has become a magnet for the storestruck. 
"Twenty years ago, the vistor was primarily gambling and looking for the $1.99 all-you-can-eat buffet," said Terri Monsour, the general merchandise manager of the Neiman Marcus branch at the Fashion Show Mall in the middle of the Strip. "Now many of them come with the sole intent of shopping." 
Optimistic that the trend will continue, the 140-store mall plans to double in size starting next year. 
The casino hotels along the Strip are stage sets, self-contained universes in which visitors can lose themselves. Nearly all of them include shopping arcades. The Bellagio Hotel has the Via Bellagio, a glass-domed retail ringer for the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milan. The Desert Passage at Aladdin's Resort Casino is designed to evoke a Middle Eastern souk, with more than 130 stores, among them Tommy Bahama, Billy Martin's and Aveda. 
Amanda Welch, 20, a student from Pittsburgh, held a reserve of $200 from her vacation budget for shopping. She stood rapt at the window of Gucci in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. 
"There is a watch here I really covet, but its costs $450," she said with a sigh. "If it was half of that, I might consider it."
At the Venetian Hotel, 70 or so retailers in the Grand Canal Shoppes include Burberry, Jimmy Choo and the Gap, strung like pop beads along a quarter-mile of brick and stone streets. Next month, the Venetian will add two outposts of the Guggenheim Museum, both of them close to the stores. 
It also has plans to expand its "streetmosphere" program, a kind of traveling troubador show of mimes, jugglers, strolling opera singers and warbling gondoliers. 
Such efforts may be lost on Kelly Kinser, 12, of Carbondale, Colo., who visited the arcade with her mother and grandmother, its waterways and Moorish storefronts serving as a backdrop for a spending spree. 
"Shopping, that's the reason I'm here," Kelly said, as her mother beamed approvingly.

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
DON'T you love it right after the rain?" Elizabeth Barlow Rogers asked, pointing delightedly at a pair of ducks as she walked through Central Park one misty morning. "Look! Mr. and Mrs. Mallard!"
 Ms. Rogers not only knows almost every inch of the park, but loves it as if she were its mother. Many are glad she does, crediting her with its revival under the care of the Central Park Conservancy, which she founded in 1980 and led until 1995. 
 At least that's what they tell her, and she finds the idea amusing. She knows her efforts have sometimes been met with skepticism. She remembers her first news conference as Central Park Administrator, a post she was appointed to in 1979. When she referred to "my park," a newspaper photographer interrupted her. 
"Lady," he said, "it's everybody's park."
Still, to a large extent it is her park, a reflection of her relentless drive to turn what had become a dusty, dangerous wasteland into an emerald miracle, the urban gem that Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned more than a century earlier. Though its work has been criticized, the conservancy became a national model for saving urban green space through the marriage of private and public money.
Ms. Rogers had hoped for similar success in her next project. In 1995, she founded Cityscape Institute, a group devoted to beautifying New York's sidewalks and street furniture: benches, telephone booths, trash cans, street lights, traffic signs and stoplights. She wanted to start with Central Park North, then infiltrate the city with classier pedestrian designs.
Her enemy, she said, was the "general indifference to the visual blight that has grown with the progressive coarsening of the environment as it has been allowed to become dominated by highway engineers and commercial interests."
More simply, she recalled the adage of her Texas mother: "Honey, looks matter."
But Cityscape has made only fitful progress in achieving its goal, as Ms. Rogers concedes. The institute and its founder have become mired in dozens of messy battles with city bureaucrats over designs for light poles, plans to reroute traffic and other issues. The one accomplishment may be on Central Park North where it abuts Central Park. The rebuilding of the street according to the institute's design began in mid-July, and is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. But there are still many unresolved issues.
Ms. Rogers has recently taken on other projects. In April, she became head of a new postgraduate program on the cultural significance of landscape at the Bard Graduate Center for the Decorative Arts. Her new book, "Landscape Design: A Cultural and Architectural History," will be published by Harry N. Abrams this fall.
Yet the question is: Why has Ms. Rogers, who is lionized by city planners and whom Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern recently called "the woman who saved Central Park in the 20th century," been unable to work her magic on city streets?
 THE answers are not clear cut. Ms. Rogers says she has had little support from the Giuliani administration, saying that since she founded Cityscape, she has not once met with the mayor. She says most of her efforts have been lost in the haze of bureaucracy, as she has battled with one low-level official after another about minute matters.
But even those who admire her achievements raise concerns about her work with Cityscape.
"We applaud what Betsy's doing, but she has to understand the mandate various agencies have in protecting the public," said Iris Weinshall, the city's transportation commissioner, who says that in Ms. Rogers's zeal to beautify Central Park North, she has neglected practical matters like safety.
Others find fault with her aesthetics. On Central Park North, though Ms. Rogers's efforts are largely supported, some residents fear that she wants to turn the area into a theme park, criticizing Cityscape's plan to adorn light poles with portraits of famous Harlem personalities. One member of the Arts Commission, which regulates public art, called the design kitschy.
Others say beautifying sidewalks is different from rescuing Central Park. The park was a pre-existing feature of the city. The sidewalks have changed drastically over the years.
For one thing, there used to be more of them. Early in the last century, hundreds of miles of sidewalk were amputated to make way for traffic lanes. Greenery and other adornments became a frill in a world ruled by the automobile, and were removed. What sidewalks were left have become increasingly cluttered with traffic signs, trash cans and newspaper boxes.
Tony Hiss, a visiting scholar at the Taub Urban Research Institute at New York University, said few New Yorkers were old enough to remember when the city cared about how its sidewalks looked. "We've reached the point where we don't even know what we're missing," he said.
Another difference between the two projects is that Ms. Rogers had raised a substantial amount of money from New York's wealthy to save Central Park, an international symbol of the city, before she took on city government. So far, she has been unable to inspire the same generosity from private donors to beautify sidewalks.
"You can't equal the success she had in Central Park," said Raymond Gastil, director of the Van Alen Institute, which tries to improve public spaces. "You're not going to build a conservancy for every street."
Ms. Rogers, 65, is an unlikely savior of Central Park. Born into privilege in Texas, she grew up knowing which fork to use and she married well, twice. She lives a life of elegance, with an apartment on the Upper West Side and houses in the Hamptons and Santa Fe, N.M. She is sometimes criticized and admired for the same qualities. What some say is elitism and ambition, an attitude that only she knows what is best, others call drive and strength of purpose. Some remark on her attention to detail, but others view her as a crank, she said, obsessed with minutiae. 
Yet few dispute her credentials as a city planner or her devotion to her causes.
Ms. Rogers was born Elizabeth Browning in San Antonio, and fell in love with nature while chasing salamanders by the creek near her home. Her father was a general contractor.
Her family's plan was that she would go to a nice Eastern women's college for a couple of years, then return to the University of Texas, marry well and become a respected matron. She went to Wellesley College and discovered art history. One night she had an epiphany: "I don't have to go back to Texas!"
After graduation, she married her college sweetheart, Edward Barlow. He went to work at the Pentagon and his young wife busied herself with their baby, Lisa, and a writing course. She wrote about the importance of parks.
"It was like the blind finger of destiny was leading me along somehow," she said.
Her husband then went to Yale Law School and she got a master's degree in city planning. In 1964, they moved to New York and she volunteered with the Parks Association, a precursor of the Parks Council. She wrote a book, "The Forests and Wetlands of New York City," published in 1971.
Then, she fell in love with Olmsted and was curator of an exhibition on him at the Whitney Museum in 1972, the year her son, David, was born. The catalog she helped write was published as a book, "Frederick Law Olmsted's New York."
Ms. Rogers became seriously interested in Central Park. She volunteered with the Parks Department and joined the Central Park Task Force, which was organized in the mid-70's when the city could not afford to maintain its greatest park.
In 1979, the year she and Mr. Barlow were divorced, she became Central Park administrator. This was a new position, and she had to raise her own salary from private donations. But she got an office in the Parks Department's headquarters. It was a basement cubby next to the pesticides.
At the same time, she founded the conservancy to raise money for the park.
The early days were hard, especially since few people took seriously her dream of a revitalized Central Park. One of her ideas was to seek money for the park as if it were one of the city's cultural institutions, turning to New York's wealthiest companies and families, from Exxon to the Rockefellers. The symbol of the conservancy became the rich ladies in big hats at the springtime luncheon in the Conservatory Garden that Ms. Rogers dreamed up.
Another idea was to bring interns into the park, first to run children's programs and then do horticultural work. Unions seethed, but Ms. Rogers persisted. Today, conservancy employees outnumber civil servants, and the conservancy provides more than 80 percent of the park's operating budget.
In the next two decades, the conservancy raised $150 million. The park had other heroes, but few people dispute Ms. Rogers's achievements. 
Still, her work in the park has been criticized.
"The problem with a public-private partnership on this scale is that with every ingenious new mechanism, the city disinvested a little more," said Tom Fox, former president of the Hudson River Park Conservancy, the precursor to the Hudson River Park Trust.
Others ridiculed some of her ideas: wanting to remove ball fields and cut down trees in the Ramble. But most praised her efforts.
"Betsy set the benchmark for what a park can look if properly maintained and managed," said Tupper W. Thomas, administrator of Prospect Park in Brooklyn.
The idea for Cityscape grew out of the conservancy's work in the northern part of the park. But it also had its roots in Ms. Rogers's increasing concern about the city's streets.
She said that she had become horrified at the ugliness of the streets, which she calls hardscapes, and sees as another form of landscape. She said she began to see people's indifference to the streets as a kind of visual illiteracy.
Referring to the great parks and avenues of Paris, she said, "We should make places out of public spaces."
Ms. Rogers was ready for a new challenge, anyway. "I don't want to be just Mrs. Central Park," she said.
IN 1992, the conservancy gave $1,000 to residents on Central Park North to clean up graffiti. By 1995, the conservancy got federal money to study Frederick Douglass Circle at the park's northwest corner.
A large design workshop was held, as were scores of meetings with neighbors. The outcome was a plan for a traffic rotary at the intersection and an array of improvements. Ms. Weinshall said the Transportation Department is studying the proposals.
Ms. Rogers began to wonder: Could the north edge of the park become a template for thousands of other blocks?
Because of her urban planning background, she knew how the streets used to look. Architects once designed street lamps to illuminate pedestrians, not vehicles. With the onslaught of the auto, engineers and the mass production of street lamps took over. Green patches on the streets were slowly eliminated. Even Park Avenue's park, which took up the middle of the street, was reduced to flower gardens. People got used to an increasing amount of street clutter.
Ms. Rogers asked questions like: Why do traffic signal poles have to be yellow? Why can't they be a tasteful black?
"Betsy has this crackpot idea that the life you find in the streets of the city doesn't have to be ugly," said Hugh Hardy, the architect whose work includes restorations of the New Victory and New Amsterdam Theaters and Radio City Music Hall.
Ms. Rogers pursued her vision with the panache that has become her hallmark. But she met with frustration at every turn. She imported mayors and experts from other cities to describe how they made their public spaces more beautiful. She took a group of city officials to Paris in 1997 -- on her own money -- to inspect the streets. They had "a swell trip," she said, but nothing tangible came of it.
City Hall encouraged her to develop a model stretch of sidewalk on West 55th Street, she said, then dropped the idea. She wanted to choose the design team for the new City Hall Park, and for new lights for Battery Park in Lower Manhattan, but never got permission to do so. She had a trash can designed, hoping it could become the new city standard. So far, the city plans to use it only on Central Park North and Battery Park.
Several spokeswomen for the mayor declined to comment on these proposals, saying that many of the people involved in the decisions had left the government.
Ms. Rogers said she also wanted to work on Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn and with business improvement districts in Manhattan. Again, she got nowhere.
About the best she can say of her efforts is, "Nobody said, 'Drop dead and get lost.' "
Daniel Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership and other business improvement groups, said people were so used to cluttered sidewalks it was hard to imagine a change. "There aren't huge numbers of people who understand this," he said.
Meanwhile, even when Ms. Rogers applauds what the city has done, like building the Duke Ellington memorial at the northeast corner of Central Park, she finds fault with the details. She asks why the metal fasteners that hold the base of the Elligton statue not hidden by granite? Why is Duke not facing north toward Harlem?
CITYSCAPE'S one apparent success is Central Park North, where its plan includes new signs for parking and other regulations, new streetlights and landscaping. The light fixtures, Ms. Rogers said, were designed to "complement the architecture of most historic neighborhoods and provide appropriate light levels for both pedestrians and motorists."
But in addition to the conflict with some residents, she has also argued with the Transportation Department.
Ms. Weinshall ordered that streetlights designed by Mr. Hardy pass safety tests before installation. Because the tests may not be completed before the mayor dedicates the new street, Ms. Weinshall plans to put up quaint-looking temporary lights. Ms. Rogers worries that they will become permanent, as temporary things often do. She would rather have utilitarian cobra lights to ensure temporary means temporary.
Ms. Weinshall said cobras were not what she had in mind for a mayoral dedication.
Ms. Rogers's supporters say it is too early to judge her work with Cityscape a failure, even as she prepares to devote more time to teaching and writing.
"She's accomplished more than she thinks," said Larry Condon, chairman of the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, which gave Cityscape $1.2 million.
Ms. Rogers said she understood that city government is "a big old lumbering dinosaur." She is patient and determined. Walking through Central Park, she pointed to one landscape feature that took a decade to accomplish, another that took 15 years.
"Being married to Betsy is like being married to a tank in creep gear," said her husband since 1984, Ted Rogers, a businessman who heads American Industrial Partners, a private investment firm. "You can barely see it moving, but before you know it, you've been run over."

Conrad/The New York Times)(pg. 8) Chart: "IN HER OWN WORDS: Five Targets"Cityscape Institute was founded to combat what Betsy Barlow Rogers calls "the coarsening of the public environment." Here are a few examples of items found on city streets that Ms. Rogers thinks are particularly objectionable. "In the age of cell phones, our public telephones are a marginal public convenience; their chief purpose is to serve as sidewalk billboards, a source of advertising revenue." "Cobra-head lights such as are used on highways may illuminate the roadway, but they do little to make the night time sidewalk safer and friendlier for the pedestrian." "These flimsy litter receptacles get easily bent out of shape, and the bandage on the side with a usually illegible message admonishing the public not to litter is itself a bit of visual litter." "Promulgating park rules is important, but this should be done in a less messy and more verbally economical and graphically coherent manner." "In a city where there are already many newsstands, these bulky little curbside news boxes are redundant; they constitute both a pedestrian impediment and a visual eyesore." (pg. 8)

HEADLINE: New Economy, Same Harassment Problems 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN E. REED

 BODY:
ALMOST from the moment she started her new job as a software engineer at Juno Online Services Inc. in 1997, Lori Park had been intrigued by the tall and wiry Matthew Battles. After they met at a party, they wound up in a hip-grinding dance in the wee hours of the morning at Au Bar, a nightclub on East 58th Street in Manhattan. Over the next couple of weeks they ate meals together, went to museums and got to know each other.
 But the young man with the long blond hair was not only a friend and not just a colleague -- Mr. Battles was a senior vice-president of the company. As they decided how intimate they would become, the propriety of an executive dating an employee became an issue. 
 "He said if I don't get involved in a relationship with him he can be like my No. 1 fan in the company," said Ms. Park, recalling their conversation. "If I date him, then he won't be able to help me out at all." 
But in the insouciant world of Internet companies, where old economy conventions were disdained and rule books rejected, office romances and other corporate taboos flourished. The medium itself, the Internet, commingles the intensely private with the openly public, and this idea suffused the relationships that developed among high-technology workers. Many believed that they were building a new world, with new ways of doing things, and with that conviction came a sense that many of the old verities -- about management techniques as well as office protocol -- no longer applied.
But less than two years after Ms. Park began dating Mr. Battles, she sought redress from this new world and sued him, as well as her former supervisor, Mark A. Moraes, and Juno itself, for $10 million. It was one of the first publicized sexual harassment suits against an Internet company, and it shocked the industry because harassment, sex discrimination and retaliation were supposed to be diseases of the old economy. The new economy was supposed to be better for employees, but in some ways it turned out to be worse.
In her suit, filed in November 1999 in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Ms. Park alleged that Juno created a hostile work environment in which Mr. Battles and other male supervisors considered women to be "sexual objects," discussed which female employees they wanted to have sex with and referred to others with vulgar terms such as "slut" and "whore." 
Juno's lawyers denied these charges in a written response to Ms. Park's subsequent demand for arbitration. They also contended that Ms. Park herself routinely indulged in profanity and sexually charged language.
At the peak of the Internet boom early last year, disgruntled new economy workers rarely tried to settle differences through the courts. They simply quit and got a couple of job offers from other start-ups as they walked out the door. "People wanted to get on with their jobs, and in a red-hot economy they could," said Garry G. Mathiason, a partner with Littler Mendelson, an employment-law firm based in San Francisco with no stake in the case.
If a woman went to the trouble of hiring a lawyer to formally protest her treatment, said Mr. Mathiason, a check for $10,000 or $15,000 might have been issued, apologies made and the matter closed. But this year alone, Internet companies have already shed more than 80,000 jobs, according to the outplacement firm of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. As new jobs became harder to find, former employees began to couple claims of wrongful termination with unequal treatment, harassment and other charges.
Littler Mendelson, which has represented more than a thousand Internet-related businesses, estimates that two out five managers at such companies will be the targets of lawsuits in the coming years, twice the rate of the managers of bricks-and-mortar businesses, mainly because they didn't have the policies and procedures in place to handle employee complaints.
Although many Internet businesses tried to limit their liability by requiring workers to sign employment contracts agreeing to settle disputes through arbitration, some still wind up in protracted legal battles. In Ms. Park's case, the court compelled arbitration because she had signed such an agreement at Juno. But the suit nonetheless dogged the company for a third of its existence: from just after the company first sold its stock to the public in May 1999, to its recent announcement that it planned to merge with another Internet service provider, NetZero Inc. Juno would not say if settling the suit was a condition of the merger. 
THIS summer, the suit was finally settled for an undisclosed sum between $75,000, the figure offered by Juno, and $300,000, the amount demanded by Ms. Park before negotiations began.
Ms. Park's suit was "resolved without any admission of liability or concession by any of the parties," according to Terri Ross, a lawyer who represents Juno. Although none of the parties was allowed to comment on the case once settlement talks started, Ms. Park had earlier described her experience with the company and her relationship with Mr. Battles. Several interviews with her over the course of almost a year show how this young couple, who grew up with the values of the women's movement, came to be involved in charges of sexual harassment, and how Ms. Park was at the center of many forces -- management inexperience, a new old-boy network and rampant office intimacy -- that to one degree or another ravaged the Internet industry.
Ms. Park came to Juno at the end of 1997, lured by a salary of $70,000, a signing bonus of $25,000 and the promise of a year-end bonus of perhaps $20,000 -- all told, more than twice what she had been making as a software engineer for Sun Microsystems Inc. at its site in Chelmsford, Mass. At that time, Juno had been providing free e-mail to people without Internet access. She was hired to help write the server software needed to enroll paying customers in the company's new Internet-access service.
As part of the free-spending Internet culture, Juno put her up in what she described as "this really huge, nice apartment" on West 86th Street and Broadway in Manhattan while she looked for a place of her own. Less than two weeks after arriving, Ms. Park, who was then 23, celebrated her good fortune by throwing a party; among the guests was Peter D. Skopp, a Juno senior vice president who had interviewed her for the job. Mr. Skopp brought along Mr. Battles, who was then 24.
When the party broke up, Ms. Park and several guests went to Au Bar. She said she started dancing by herself and was joined by Mr. Battles, who began "dirty dancing" with her.
"I just stood back from him and I said, 'You are so bad,' " she said. "And he was like, 'No, you are so bad,' and I was like, 'No, you are so bad' and I said, 'You are a senior vice president' and then he like ran away." Mr. Battles, she said, left the club. Mr. Battles did not respond to requests for an interview. According to his Web site, he is currently in Mexico City studying Spanish.
Nonetheless, she continued to see Mr. Battles, and the two became romantically involved. There were half a dozen couples in the office, and the president and chief executive, Charles E. Ardai, dated and later married a woman who had worked there. Juno's corporate policy only prohibits managers from dating employees they supervise. Ms. Park, a programmer, never reported to Mr. Battles, who worked on the business side.
To understand how a consensual relationship wound up in a sexual harassment charge, it helps to know how Ms. Park viewed harassment. She said she thought Anita Hill was lying about sexual harassment during her testimony at the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas in 1991. Ms. Park was 17 then, and said she did not believe that sexual harassment existed. She said she had not experienced it growing up near Lansing, Mich., or later while studying at Harvard.
In fact, Ms. Park said she didn't think she had experienced sexual harassment at Juno until she read a sexual harassment complaint filed by a former Juno employee, Lisa Bongiorno. It was then, Ms. Park said, that she realized "the same thing had happened to me."
In August 1999, Lisa Bongiorno, a former marketing manager at Juno, filed a $10 million lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan against the company, claiming she was pressured into having sex with a vice president, Jordan S. Birnbaum, and then fired when she stopped sleeping with him. Juno said Mr. Birnbaum no longer worked there, and Mr. Ardai, the chief executive, declined to be interviewed for this article. But on the Web site of The Industry Standard, a magazine about the new economy, and in Glamour magazine, Mr. Ardai has been quoted denying this allegation. Neither Ms. Ross, the lawyer for Juno, nor Robert Levy, who represents Ms. Bongiorno, responded to requests for interviews. The case is in arbitration.
Reading the complaint's depiction of a hostile work environment and descriptions of retaliation educated Ms. Park about harassment. At the time, Ms. Park no longer worked at Juno and was negotiating a settlement with the company because she felt she had been forced out for "being a woman in a man's role," she said. 
Ms. Park's sexual harassment charge against Mr. Battles and the firm arose after a more protracted struggle she'd had with her former boss at the company, Bruce Zenel. Mr. Zenel managed a technical group of four, and then five programmers, of whom Ms. Park was the only woman.
She said that almost from the start he would look over her shoulder and tell her what keystrokes to make. "He would like try double-checking every little thing," said Ms. Park.
Ms. Park said she thought her work was more closely scrutinized than that of the male programmers. "I'm telling you, I never messed up," she said. As time went on, she said, Mr. Zenel stopped inviting her to meetings with the other programmers, and did not give her technical specifications on a timely basis, although she needed them to do her job. 
Mr. Zenel did not respond to requests for an interview. He has since been promoted to vice president at Juno. Lawyers for Juno, in their response to Ms. Park's charges filed with the American Arbitration Association, said she had "received supervision appropriate for a junior programmer with limited work experience," and acknowledged that she "was not included in some design meetings," and "was told that she did not have strong communication skills."
Mounting research on the failure of women to thrive at work indicates that they have good reason to be concerned about the kind of communication problems that Ms. Park experienced. 
In her book "Why So Slow? The Advancement of Women," Virginia Valian, a psychology and linguistics professor at Hunter College, wrote, "A woman who aspires to success needs to worry about being ignored; each time it happens she loses prestige and the people around her become less inclined to take her seriously."
SEEKING advice on how to resolve the problems with her supervisor, Ms. Park said she turned to Mr. Battles, who told her that the technical area preferred to resolve problems on its own, without involving other departments such as human resources. She then sought guidance from Mr. Skopp, the senior vice president who had hired her. But Mr. Skopp, she said, acknowledged that because he and Mr. Zenel were friends from graduate school at Columbia University, it was hard for him to be impartial. (Mr. Skopp did not respond to requests for interviews.)
As communications with Mr. Zenel deteriorated, Ms. Park said she sought help from Merrily Sturcke, the head of human resources. Initially, Ms. Park said she had resisted Ms. Sturcke's suggestions that Ms. Park meet directly with Mr. Zenel, fearing he might retaliate against her. But in December 1998, she agreed to participate in a meeting with Ms. Sturcke, Mr. Zenel and Mr. Moraes, who was Juno's executive vice president of technical services.
During the eight-hour meeting, when Ms. Park tried to argue that she was treated differently than the other members of the team because she was female, she said Mr. Moraes demanded to know, name by name, whom she was accusing of discrimination. Ms. Park was "harangued and abused" at the meeting, according to the complaint.
In their response to her arbitration demand, lawyers for Juno said there was frustration on both sides during the meeting because of Ms. Park's "continual refusal to accept that her role in the department was that of a junior programmer and her failure to accept responsibility for failing to follow the work directives of her supervisor." They also said that the human resources department and her managers investigated her "speculation" that the "complained-of treatment" might relate to her sex, but concluded that it did not and that "she received direction and compensation commensurate with her status as a junior programmer."
The length of the meeting shows how underdeveloped Juno's human resource procedures were, experts said.
"Anybody who is skilled in H. R. would tell you that any part of that kind of arrangement was dead wrong," said Mr. Mathiason, the Littler Mendelson lawyer whose firm represents employers. "Putting the two antagonists in a room, putting them there together for eight hours, just invites all kinds of claims." Such an arrangement, he said, could easily lead a judge or jury to conclude that the manager became angry at the employee for bringing the charge instead of patiently and dutifully conducting an investigation.
Such situations demonstrate the inexperience of young managers, said Kerry J. Sulkowicz, a psychiatrist and president of the Boswell Group, a consulting firm in Manhattan that often advises young entrepreneurs who are having difficulty managing their staffs. "Without understanding the tools of leadership, the managers adopt a very authoritarian style like the way adolescents, who are feeling very insecure, become bullies," he said.
At a meeting the day after that marathon meeting, where they were supposed to design a better way of working together, Ms. Park said Mr. Moraes yelled and snarled at her.
In its response to Ms. Park's demand for arbitration, a copy of which was made available to The New York Times, Juno rejected her characterization of this meeting, saying that she and Mr. Zenel, who also attended the meeting, had a constructive dialogue about how they would work together in the future.
By this time, another employee might have given up and left, but Ms. Park felt she had done nothing wrong, and saw the issue as one of equal opportunity. Her mother, Carol Park, encouraged all three of her daughters to take calculus in school because she herself had been afraid to take it. She gave Lori, the eldest, a halter-top that said "Anything boys can do, girls can do better." Lori Park said she became accustomed to competing in mathematics, mechanical engineering and computer science, areas traditionally dominated by men.
Following the December meetings, Ms. Park scored a 2.8 in her year-end review, lower than her midyear review of 3.0. "They made a special new category for me called "Relationship with Management" and I got a special low score on that. They said I was a technical superstar but I have such bad behavior problems," said Ms. Park, who interpreted the review as retaliation for her complaints. She requested a transfer out of Mr. Zenel's programming group and said she was demoted to the mail-server group. In the arbitration documents, Juno's lawyers denied that this was a demotion and said she received a negative performance review because "her difficulty interacting with her co-workers and her continual refusal to follow her manager's instructions was a drain on management resources."
Perhaps the Juno environment sent mixed signals about her expected contribution. By putting her up in an expensive apartment on the Upper West Side, casually attending her party and becoming very friendly with her, senior managers seemed to give the impression that she, a subordinate, was welcomed among the decision makers. While Juno officers, like those at many other Internet startups, sported the image of an egalitarian organization, Ms. Park saw it as a rigid, even club-like hierarchy.
HER ordeal strained Ms. Park's relationship with Mr. Battles because she said she increasingly saw him as part of the hierarchy that no longer wished to hear about her problems. "He thought they were treating me badly, but he didn't do anything about it, and it was his responsibility as a senior officer to do that even if it is his girlfriend," said Ms. Park.
Just after 1999 began, Ms. Park said she wanted to break up with Mr. Battles, but feared she would be fired if she did. The way Ms. Park saw it, women at Juno who ended relationships with co-workers -- who were often senior to the women -- had to leave. Mr. Battles' previous girlfriend had left the company, and there was Ms. Bongiorno, who had been fired.
When she asked Mr. Battles whether she would lose her job if they broke up, she said he told her, "You know you're not in the club like I am." She said she tried to meet with the human resources representative several times to tell her about her fears, but was not taken seriously. In its response to Ms. Park's charges, the company asserted that Ms. Battles "never influenced or sought to or threatened to influence Juno's personnel decisions concerning" Ms. Park, and that she never complained of sexual harassment. The couple broke up in the spring of 1999.
When Juno first sold shares to the public, the stock opened at $13 and fizzled to $11.64 at the close. That evening, staffers gathered to mark, if not celebrate, the event at Citron 47, a bistro on West 47th Street. Ms. Park said she asked Mr. Battles to leave the party and escort her to his apartment to retrieve some of her things. Outside the restaurant, she alleged in her lawsuit, he dragged her down the street, punched her in the stomach and slapped her. In its response to her demand for arbitration, Juno said that Ms. Park was intoxicated and had provoked the incident by "verbally and physically assaulting" Mr. Battles.
Ms. Park filed an assault complaint with the New York City Police Department, but did not press charges. When asked if there were any witnesses to the incident, Ms. Park said she was trying to find a waitress at the restaurant.
After the incident Ms. Park said she started taking the antidepressant Paxil, which had been prescribed by a psychiatrist she had been seeing, to reduce her anxiety. That spring, she said she lost 13 pounds.
Ms. Park's personal and professional worlds were wrapped up in Juno. When they unraveled, she again sought a solution to her problems from the firm. She said she met with Mr. Ardai, the chief executive, and told him she was being driven out of the company. She said they discussed giving her a year of severance pay if she would quit and Mr. Ardai asked her to have her lawyers get in touch with the company's lawyers. In a subsequent meeting with Mr. Ardai, she said she informed him of the alleged assault by Mr. Battles.
"He said that it wasn't clear that I should have told him and that it does not really relate to Juno," Ms. Park said. "I said I disagree."
Ms. Park said Juno offered her only $10,000, instead of the year's severance she had discussed with Mr. Ardai. She refused the offer and filed her suit.
Ms. Park said she first embraced the culture of Juno because it was filled with young people she thought she could trust. During her last interview with a reporter before settlement negotiations began, she said that she regretted getting involved with Mr. Battles, but was proud of her effort to stand up to the company. "If I don't stand up for myself," she asked, "who else will?"
Since her experience, Ms. Park said she had been informally counseling other young women who believed they had encountered harassment and discrimination at work on how to build a legal case against their employers.

Anonymous Interbrew Takes on the Kings of Beer

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
YOU might have expected beer connoisseurs to shudder when the family-owned brewer of Beck's, Germany's best-known export beer, agreed to sell it to an anonymous-sounding multinational corporation called Interbrew.
 In fact, it was the financial community that seemed most critical of the $1.58 billion acquisition announced last week, one of the most expensive purchases in the history of brewing. Knowledgeable beer enthusiasts appeared unruffled. 
 Interbrew has been unobtrusively amassing dozens of brands around the world for years, a strategy that has let it rival Heineken as the second-biggest brewer after the Anheuser-Busch Companies of the United States. And Interbrew likes to boast that drinkers have noticed no change in what they are drinking. Many are not even aware their brew is owned by somebody new. That may help explain why drinkers who quaff a Labatt, Rolling Rock, Bass, Dos Equis, Leffe or Hoegaarden, just to name a few, are sometimes surprised to learn they are patronizing Interbrew, which now produces beer in 19 countries and sells it in 110. 
Even beer drinkers in Interbrew's home market in Belgium are not fully aware of how many small local breweries are in fact owned by Interbrew. Some think Leffe, a popular beer whose label depicts an abbey, is brewed by monks. In fact it is made at a technologically advanced brewery in Interbrew's home town of Leuven, near Brussels. 
Similarly, some people in the business of selling regional beers are surprised to learn of Interbrew's scope. "We stock Interbrew beers like Leffe, Stella Artois, but I never looked at the company in a global sense," said Bobby Wong, beverage manager of the Wall Street Kitchen and Bar, a raucous restaurant in Manhattan's financial district that carries 50 beers on tap. 
Interbrew's corporate anonymity is part of the secret behind its rapid growth. The company describes itself as "the world's local brewer," and for the past 10 years it has been acquiring small breweries in eastern Europe, Russia, China, South Korea and Canada and turning them into market leaders or No. 2 brands in their local markets.
Just last month, Interbrew won an auction for the Bosnian government's 53.9 percent stake in the Banja Luka Brewery, owner of a brand called Nektar.
But with the Beck's purchase, Interbrew's 5th acquisition this year and 30th in the last decade, Interbrew faced tough questions by investors in the beer industry. Not only was the price expensive, they said, but Beck's could compete with Interbrew's flagship brand Stella Artois -- meaning Interbrew would essentially be competing against itself. 
Hugo Powell, Interbrew's chief executive, said Beck's 2.5 percent share of the fragmented German market was only a minor reason for Interbrew's purchase. "Our primary motivation for the deal was to acquire a world trademark," he said in an interview. "An opportunity like this won't come around again in the next five years." 
He said Beck's would not cannibalize sales of Stella Artois because their markets did not overlap. And to fend off criticism that he overpaid, Mr. Powell said that if Interbrew had not bought Beck's at that price, "another brewer would have." 
A Beck spokeswoman, Ulrike Gruenroch-Kern, confirmed that Anheuser-Busch, Scottish and Newcastle and South African Breweries had all competed against Interbrew for Beck, which had been family owned since 1873.
Beck's is "a brand that already has a high profile in the premium sector of the market, and that's where the real growth lies," Mr. Powell said. 
ADDING Beck's as a global brand, however, is only a part of Interbrew's growth strategy.
"We start with the premise that our local operations should be strong, and we maintain a high respect for local culture," Mr. Powell said. "Then we introduce our international brands and our local operations treat them as their own brands." 
In the United States, Beck's is the seventh-largest imported beer, while Stella Artois does not even make it into the top 10, according to the Association of Brewers, a trade group in Boulder, Colo.
Beck's strongest United States markets are the New York area, Florida and California. Mr. Powell said Interbrew will use Labatt USA for its sales force in the United States, to build the brand beyond these core markets. Beck's local strengths, he said, will help the other Interbrew brands.
None of Interbrew's beers sells as well as Heineken in the United States, but together, even without Beck's, Interbrew's range of brands dwarfs sales of Heineken's distinctive green bottles.
Heineken also has a cluster of specialty beers and a second mainstream brand, Amstel. But it has focused most of its marketing energies on promoting Heineken above all else. That strategy, to Mr. Powell's apparent irritation, appears to be winning more favor from investors.
"We will work hard to deepen investors' understanding of us as a corporation," Mr. Powell said, calling the company's operating performance "second to none."
The rivalry between Interbrew and Heineken has grown intense, and in fact both now claim to be the No. 2 global brewer. Tom Beyers, a beverage industry analyst at KBC Securities, a Brussels-based brokerage firm, said Interbrew would surpass Heineken in volume if Bass brands were included in its totals. Based on 2000 sales, however, Heineken is bigger: Its revenue last year was 8.1 billion euros or about $7 billion, compared with Interbrew's 5.7 billion euros.
Mr. Powell, not unexpectedly, called his company the better performer, pointing to the company's strong growth rates not only in beer volume but earnings. Interbrew's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a common barometer of profitability in the industry, rose 59 percent in 2000 to 1.2 billion euros, after a 16 percent increase in 1999.
Yet Interbrew's stock, which was listed on the Euronext exchange last year, has fallen 13 percent percent from the initial public offering price of 33 euros a share.
Opinions vary over why. In addition to Interbrew's low corporate profile, analysts say too few of the shares are publicly traded -- 70 percent of the company remains in the hands of a holding company owned by a cluster of Belgium's richest families. 
The stock has weakened further as a result of Interbrew's prolonged effort to acquire Bass and, most recently, the Beck's deal. The stock has fallen about 5 percent since the Beck deal was announced, largely because Interbrew's price was 13 times Beck's earnings before interest and tax. Many analysts consider eight times earnings a more reasonable price.
To some degree, the price Interbrew paid reflected the competitive pressure on all big brewers to expand, which is reducing the total number of brewers and raising the price of those seen as the most attractive takeover candidates.
Alex Genart, an analyst with the Belgian brokerage Petercam, who downgraded his rating of Interbrew stock to neutral after the Beck's deal, called Interbrew "a victim of asset inflation, which is being fueled by consolidation in the industry."
Mr. Powell agreed. "Other brewers are acquiring, too," he said. "We know this because most situations are auctions between a small group of big brewers." Germany, Europe's largest and most fragmented beer market, with about 1,200 breweries, is in the throes of consolidation.
"People who say consolidation is still a long way off in Germany are wrong," Mr. Powell said, adding that he has had "many phone calls, many conversations" with German brewers that might become takeover targets. "The Beck's acquisition will only accelerate the process, and we hope for further opportunities there," he said.
So how come such as acquisitive corporation is not seen as the evil multinational parent by lovers of local beers? "We see Interbrew as the least worst option," said Iain Loe, research manager at the Campaign for Real Ale, a Britain-based advocacy group fighting against what it considers the trend toward homogeneity in beers.
"We oppose consolidation in the business, and there is no question that Interbrew has become a very dominant player in the U.K. as well as in its home market," Mr. Loe said. But to its credit, he said, the Belgian brewer, which traces its roots to a Leuven brewery called Den Hoorn founded in 1366, "has retained the diversity in beer styles, and it remains a pure brewer, unlike many of the other brewing majors that have diversified into other activities."
LAST year, British competition authorities blocked Interbrew's acquisition of Bass Brewers because of fears that Interbrew would come to dominate the British beer market. Interbrew successfully appealed that decision in the British courts. Although Interbrew will likely have to sell some properties of Bass, regulators have not yet specified which ones.
Mr. Powell said the Beck acquisition was unlikely to arouse regulatory opposition in Europe or the United States. "Consolidation of regional and national beers still has some way to go," he said. 
But at some point, he said, the takeovers will diminish, and "there could be one or two mergers among the big groups."

Argentina and the Aid Next-Door

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
WITH Argentina's economy in meltdown and Brazil's straining under growing market pressure, the Bush administration is now facing its first full-fledged international economic crisis. Thus far, it has acted with so much reluctance, hesitancy and awkwardness that it risks leaving both countries more vulnerable than ever.
 The International Monetary Fund on Aug. 3 offered Brazil a $15 billion credit line but told Argentina no new money was coming. The "reward Brazil, punish Argentina" approach, prompted by mixed signals from the United States, the fund's main contributor, has perplexed Latin American analysts. 
 "The Fire Department has been called into South America, but instead of attacking the source of the conflagration, they've gone to the apartment on the next floor and given the people there a fire extinguisher," Gustavo Franco, an ex-president of Brazil's Central Bank, said. "By ignoring the blaze on the floor below, they're allowing it to worsen, which is going to make it all the more difficult and expensive to put the fire out."
Mr. Bush and his team came to the White House with reservations about the role of the monetary fund and the notion of bailouts. That is a sharp contrast with the Clinton administration, which worked with the fund to design emergency rescue packages for Mexico in 1994 and for Brazil in 1999. 
This time, the United States and the fund seem to have decided that Brazil, the world's eighth largest economy, cannot be allowed to founder. But Argentina is seen as far less conscientious, and far less important. (That isn't new: Henry A. Kissinger is said to have once dismissed Argentina as "a dagger pointed at the heart of Antarctica.") 
Initially, the Bush administration appeared determined to keep its distance from the mess in Buenos Aires altogether. In mid-July, Condoleezza Rice, the White House's national security adviser, said that no new assistance was in the works for Argentina. And another administration official argued: "This is a problem the Argentines can resolve, and they are taking the right steps to do so. They have a plan, it's a workable plan, and now they have to cut spending and put policies into place that will attract investment. Nobody can do those things for them."
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, though, was telling a more damaging story to investors. With an extraordinarily blunt assessment of Argentina's troubles most remarkable, his Latin American critics say, for its lack of sympathy and knowledge, he has helped torpedo investors' interest.
"They've been off and on in trouble for 70 years or more," Mr. O'Neill said in the British magazine The Economist. "They don't have any export industry to speak of at all. And they like it that way. Nobody forced them to be what they are."
Argentina's supporters have counterattacked, noting that the United States, for all its talk of free trade in the Americas, continues to placate domestic lobbies with high tariffs on many Argentine products. 
But there is also a feeling of political betrayal. No Latin American country's foreign policy has been more aligned with that of the United States over the past decade than Argentina's. The country participated in the Gulf War and has even been designated a "non-NATO ally."
As a candidate and at a hemispheric summit meeting in April, Mr. Bush vowed to make the region a top foreign policy priority, saying that the days of American neglect of Latin America were over. 
But his inaction suggests otherwise. "Whether in Latin America or the Middle East, the instinct of this administration is to back away any time there is a crisis," said Michael Shifter, a fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a research group in Washington. "The initial attitude is 'we don't want to become involved -- it's messy, it's complicated.' Then things deteriorate further, and they end up in a worse situation." 
THE administration's tone may have begun to shift slightly. Former President Clinton visited Argentina and Brazil on a lecture tour last month and called the White House to express his concerns. Earlier this month, Treasury Undersecretary John Taylor was dispatched to Buenos Aires, and said he was "impressed" with Argentina's determination. But he also said he could not offer any new money.
To Wall Street, which former Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has accused of "dancing on Argentina's grave," the waffling seems to say that the Bush team still does not recognize the gravity of the situation. And that only feeds market nervousness about the rest of Latin America. 
EVEN with the $15 billion in "armor plating" that the monetary fund has offered as a morale booster, Brazil's credit outlook was lowered from stable to negative last week, and its currency, which has declined in value by 25 percent against the dollar this year, gained back no ground. In Chile, which has openedits economy wider and faster than any country in Latin America, the peso sank to a record low.
The betting here is that Argentina's troubles will eventually force the fund to step in. An Argentine delegation arrived in Washington on Friday to urge the fund to act, but the fear is that any aid may come too late, not only for Argentina but also for Brazil.
"At the moment, the Bush administration doesn't have a policy and lacks the political will to put the money that is needed on the table," said Mr. Franco, the former bank chief. "Without those two things in tandem, I don't see a solution. We're thankful here in Brazil for the $15 billion we've been offered, but it doesn't resolve anything."

It's Not the Heat, It's the Economy

BYLINE:  By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The record heat that smothered the Northeast last week was not the problem on Wall Street. Stock market investors had a different worry -- the health of the economy in general and technology issues in particular. 
 Downgrades of Intel and other semiconductor makers led to selling through much of the week that pushed the Nasdaq composite index to end a week below 2,000 for the first time since April 12. The uncertainty spread to other technology companies including Oracle and Siebel Systems. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 96.53 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,416.25. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 109.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 1,956.47. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 24.19 points, or 2 percent, to 1,190.16. 
 New evidence of economic weakness, notably an unexpected decline in industrial commodity prices to the lowest level in 15 years, raised expectations that the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee would cut interest rates again at its Aug. 21 meeting to stimulate the economy. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a barometer of interest rate trends, fell to 4.98 percent from 5.16 the week before. ROBERT HURTADO

First-Half Bond Fever Cools

BYLINE:  By Jeff Sommer

 BODY:
Spurred on by lower interest rates, United States corporations have already issued more investment-grade debt this year than in all of 2000, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
 The total for 2000 was $353 billion, itself a record, according to Thomson. 
For the year through Aug. 6, the total was $364.5 billion, the agency said. 
 The torrid pace of debt issuance this year came as the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a total of 2.75 points, reducing borrowing costs for corporations and adding to investors' return. 
Debt issuance appears to be slowing down, though, several analysts said. Corporations have already refinanced much of their expensive short-term debt, Salomon Smith Barney said in a report last week. Mergers and acquisitions, which generally trigger the issuance of debt, are proceeding slowly, the report said. Salomon expects debt issuance to drop by about 40 percent in the second half of the year, and Moody's says the drop-off is likely to be 35 to 40 percent. Capital expenditures by American businesses have declined, and companies appear to be adopting more conservative financial practices, both factors that tend to reduce corporate borrowing, according to Moody's.
To be investment-grade, bonds must be rated at least Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor's and Fitch. Jeff Sommer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re the Market Watch column, "Dispelling the Myth That Options Help Shareholders" (July 29), which challenged the assumption that repricing stock options helps retain valuable executives: 
 Companies that reprice their stock options do so for one reason -- the options are under water and now have lost their ability to motivate and retain valuable employees. 
In general, this happens when a company or industry has experienced problems with its business. This could be due to many factors such as a recession, poor industry conditions or poor management.
Shareholders should object to the repricing of options if the stock price has fallen due to poor management but not if the problems are a result of a recession, stock market drop or poor industry conditions.

PERSON: James A. Corbett 

HEADLINE: James A. Corbett, 67, Is Dead; A Champion of Movement to Safeguard Illegal Refugees 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
James A. Corbett, a rancher and Harvard-educated philosopher who helped start a movement to guide Central American refugees illegally across the United States border, died on Aug. 2 at his home in the Arizona desert, about 30 miles from Benson. He was 67.
 The cause was a rare brain disease, paraneopalpic cerebellar syndrome, his wife, Patricia, said. 
 Mr. Corbett's crusade to help the illegal immigrants, most of them from El Salvador and Guatemala, came to be called the sanctuary movement. Its adherents believed that the Central Americans streaming to the United States to escape political oppression were equivalent to slaves escaping their masters in the years preceding the Civil War, and likened their effort, which involved hundreds of churches, to the Underground Railroad. 
"After the Second World War, the U.S. government bound itself by law never again to expel or return refugees to any country in which they would face persecution," Mr. Corbett wrote in an essay in 1988. "Consequently, our transporting of refugees is not an act of civil disobedience."
But prosecutors insisted that the Central Americans were economic refugees, not political ones. In a trial in 1986, in which Mr. Corbett was one of 11 people charged with breaking immigration laws, Judge Earl H. Carroll said, "Good motive is not a defense to intentional acts of crime."
Mr. Corbett and two others were found not guilty on all charges. Six of the defendants were convicted of conspiracy and two of lesser charges. They were sentenced to probation. 
"The work of sanctuary will continue exactly as it has," Mr. Corbett said immediately after the verdict. "We'll stand trial as often as we have to. It'll continue as it has because the refugees and their needs actually set the agenda."
As the Central American refugees dwindled, the sanctuary movement gradually faded. 
James Albert Corbett was born on Oct. 8, 1933, in Casper, Wyo., a descendant of Blackfoot Indians, Kentucky pioneers and Ozark Mountain mule traders. 
His father had given up a law practice in Missouri and gone to Wyoming to teach in high school. His mother brought in extra money by substitute teaching. In the summer they moved to an Indian reservation, where they kept food on the table by foraging for berries and fishing for trout.
Mr. Corbett won a scholarship to Colgate University and graduated in three years. He went to Harvard on a Woodrow Wilson fellowship and completed a master's degree in philosophy in a year. He married and took his wife to live on a Wyoming ranch. She did not like ranch life, and they divorced after a few years of marriage and three children.
He joined his parents at a ranch they had bought near Tombstone, Ariz., hoping to recover from his marital breakup and the first signs of the arthritis that would eventually almost cripple him. He decided to study library science at the University of Southern California.
There, he met Patricia Collins, married her, and moved to Douglas, Ariz., where Mr. Corbett was head librarian and a philosophy instructor at Cochise Junior College.
When college officials censored a book on an instructor's reading list and a work by a visiting artist, he notified the American Civil Liberties Union. His contract was not renewed.
Mr. Corbett took several teaching jobs in California, became a Quaker in the early 1960's and organized efforts against the Vietnam War. He then returned to Arizona to ranch and work on projects like the development of a bee hive and goat husbandry techniques for use in poor countries. 
By 1977, his arthritis had worsened, and the couple moved to Tucson, near where a fence had been built to deter illegal border crossings. At first, Mr. Corbett had no interest in immigration issues.
"I took the fence for granted and had never been particularly interested in border problems," he wrote in an essay in 1988. "The only time I had ever gone over the fence was to stop a grass fire in Mexico."
But on May 4, 1981, he heard about a Salvadoran refugee who had been caught by the Border Patrol. Mr. Corbett found the refugee in jail in Nogales, Ariz., then followed him to an immigration detention center in California, where he said he discovered hundreds more Central Americans who had fled wars and persecution in their home countries.
Mr. Corbett was soon housing two dozen refugees in his home. Fluent in Spanish, he would sometimes lead groups from the Guatemalan border all the way to Arizona. He mailed 500 letters to Quaker groups throughout the United States, asking for their help.
Mr. Corbett realized his home and his finances could not accommodate the flood of Central Americans. He went to John M. Fife III, pastor of the Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson, who agreed to harbor refugees and helped organize a system for passing illegal immigrants from church to church across the country.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Corbett is survived by his daughters, Laurie Longtin and Megan Schaefer, both of Casper; his son, Geoffrey Corbett of Buffalo, Wyo.; and three grandchildren.
In recent years, Mr. Corbett devoted himself to providing simple housing for those seeking solitary retreats in the Arizona desert. He was also active in the Saguaro Juniper Corporation, a group of property owners and leasers in southeastern Arizona interested in wildlife protection and other environmental concerns.
He and his friends had been discussing the possibility of a new sanctuary movement for Haitian refugees, Ms. Corbett said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 20, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Aug. 12 about James A. Corbett, a founder of the sanctuary movement for Central American refugees, misspelled the name of his illness. It was para neoplastic cerebellar syndrome, not paraneopalpic.

HEADLINE: All Aboard, Vladivostok! A Dream Is Growing 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: WHITEHORSE, Yukon Territory Aug. 10 

 BODY:
The motorman of a tourist trolley near the Klondike-era train depot here dreams of a day when passengers and freight roll out of this old rail terminus destined for such places as Fairbanks, Shanghai and London. 
 "If the Panama Canal was physically feasible, this one would be a snap," said Mike LaForet, of the century-old dream to link Asia and North America by steel rail. "With the Soviet breakup, the Americans and the Russians are not enemies, they are customers." 
 Although the narrow-gauge gold rush line, the White Pass & Yukon Route, stopped running here from the Pacific Coast in 1982, railroading is again the talk of northern North America. 
This week, a proposal to build 900 miles of track linking Canada and Alaska was debated in Calgary at a two-day meeting attended by business and political leaders from Alaska and western Canada. The meeting built on a bill, the Rails to Resources Act, signed into law in December by President Clinton. The bill authorized spending $6 million to study the creation of a northern rail link and called for establishing a binational commission to study establishing a line from northern British Columbia to Fairbanks. 
"The rail link was very enthusiastically received here in Calgary," Jeannette James, an Alaskan State Representative, said by telephone today after the two days of talks. Now, Ms. James said, the idea is winning new momentum as engineers discuss using a railroad right of way to bury part of a natural gas pipeline that oil companies plan to run from Alaska to Alberta, tapping the gas reserves of the Prudhoe Bay region.
In Calgary this week economic development officials said that joining Yukon and Alaska with southern Canada and the lower 48 states would cut prices of goods sold in the north and would also open up certain mineral and energy deposits for development.
With railroad talk turning serious in this old rail town, conversation turns to what people here call "the second stage": drilling a tunnel below the Bering Strait to link Alaska and Russia by rail. The Yukon's lone member of Parliament and a backer of a Yukon-Alaska link, Larry Bagnell, cautioned against loose talk about a Russia link, saying, "It would get the guys who are against the railroad to Alaska to say you are dreaming in Technicolor." 
But with Canadian newspapers publishing maps showing how a rail link could arc from British Columbia to Siberia, railroad people in Russia and North America are seriously mulling the idea.
On the Russian side, Viktor Razbegin, director of the state-run Center for Regional Transport Projects in Moscow, has endorsed the proposal in several interviews. Mr. Razbegin estimates that a Russia-North America rail link would cut trans-Pacific shipping times by up to two weeks and could carry 30 billion tons of cargo a year. He has estimated that the overall cost, including a tunnel under the Bering Strait, would cost $50 billion. On the Russian side, 2,000 miles of track would have to be laid from the Baikal-Amur Railroad to the Bering Strait. On the Alaskan side, about 750 miles of track would have to be laid from the strait to Fairbanks. 
Overall, Russia's government increasingly sees its continental land mass as a lucrative transportation corridor. 
In February, Russia embarked on a liberalized over-flight policy, hoping to garner $300 million annually by 2010 in fees for commercial jets on transpolar routes between North America and Asia. In addition, Russia is promoting a summertime shortcut for ships through the Arctic that links the Barents Sea with the Bering Strait. 
On the Alaskan side, caution is the official watchword.
"Linking Asia and North America by a transportation route under the Bering Strait has tremendous appeal, but there is no infrastructure linking either side," said Robert King, spokesman for Alaska's governor, Tony Knowles, a Democrat. Recalling a visit to the Trans-Siberian Pacific terminus in Vladivostok, Mr. Knowles added, "One can sense the allure to such a link, but it's a lot of track to lay between Vladivostok and British Columbia."

HEADLINE: A Dearth of Young Miners in Flush Times for Coal 

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: FINLEYVILLE, Pa. 

 BODY:
The shift change came and members of the night crew dragged themselves up from the hole. Their faces were stained and their eyes unfocused. Their faces were old.
 The morning crew members had old faces, too. The average age of the worker in this coal mine is 52. Although it was the beginning of a damp work day, the men were laughing, because for them, these are the best of times. They have a saying: The only thing worse than this work is not having it. And for many years they did not have it. 
 "When this mine closed down I thought that was it for me," said Gary Hill, 51, who had 18 years in the tunnels before he was laid off four years ago. "Then I got the call saying the mine reopened and come back to work. I got two years to make full pension. I didn't think I was going to make it." 
But with the energy crisis creating new interest in coal, these are boom times in coal country. 
"The good times have created a dilemma in the industry," said Ed Yankovich, the president of District No. 2 of the United Mine Workers of America, as he drank coffee with the men at the Mathies mine here, about 20 miles south of Pittsburgh. 
"There is a generation of miners missing," Mr. Yankovich said. "The average age of a miner is 50 years old. Now that the companies want men, we don't have enough."
For decades the industry limped along. Steel manufacturing, which depends on high-grade coal, dried up. Power plants started moving toward clean-burning natural gas. Coal prices flattened. Mines closed and men were replaced by machines. 
There was no job for the old, experienced coal miner, much less his son or daughter, so for more than a decade there were few new miners in the pipeline. Then the price of natural gas quadrupled and California was hit with rolling blackouts. President Bush made coal a centerpiece of his energy strategy and 22 new coal-burning power plants have been proposed.
The price of coal has doubled since February to more than $40 a ton. "These are boom times just because there are job gains in the industry instead of loses," said Dominic Toto, an economist who studies mining for the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
A thousand miners have gone back to work in Pennsylvania this year, and companies are looking to hire more, Mr. Yankovich said. In 1990, 149,000 people made their living in the mines across the United States. By last December, the number had plummeted to 75,000. As of June, however, the number increased for the first time in years. There are now at least 77,000 coal miners.
When a miner gets laid off, his name goes on a seniority list. If a job reopens at his mine, he may apply. For the last decade, there were no job openings. People do not give these jobs up. The labor is dark, damp, dirty but it pays $18.91 an hour and perhaps $6 more an hour in benefits. It is one of the top-paying occupations in this area. 
Under the union's contract, a jobless miner can not apply with another mining company. He, is in effect, the lifetime property of the mine owner. 
So the work force has aged and few young miners have been able to break into the business. Those who were laid off went to loading docks or to teach school or to work as mechanics. Union rules require that they had to be called back before any new miners could be hired. 
"In a way, the strong union is a victim of its own success," Mr. Yankovich said.
All of the miners at the Mathies mine have been called back. Most will retire in five years, union officials say. And when they do, there will be no one to teach the greenhorns who will replace them.
"Young guys don't pay," said John W. Hatch, president and owner of the Mathies mine. Mr. Hatch, 49, once was a mechanic in this same mine. But he says, he made good, got out, cleaned his nails and started wearing collars. Now he owns a big desk and a leather chair and at least has an understanding of his men.
"I can't find experienced men," he said. "It's dangerous work and a new man takes the supervision of two experienced miners. I can't afford that." 
Mr. Hatch's mine is the old underground room-and-pillar operation.
Unlike the surface strip and pit mines, underground mines are very labor intensive, because the roof of the tunnels must be reinforced before coal can be carved out.
A year ago, the mine was idle because of the low price of coal and the high cost of labor. Now, Mr. Hatch employs 164 people and is looking to hire seven more. He is running round-the-clock six days a week.
After generations of men telling their sons not to work down in the mines, this last generation of sons finally listened.
"A lot of young guys wanted this job and couldn't get it," Mr. Hill said. "I told my son to stay away and he did. He's a paramedic. A lot of young people have moved away or make pizzas and things."
And in a small way this has made the coal miners sad. What dream can be made in the service industries, they ask? 
"No one will write songs about the life and struggles of the hamburger flipper and bed maker," said Mike Kasavich, who, at 46, is one of the youngest men in the mine. Mr. Kasavich loaded docks for a couple of years after he was laid off. He stayed drunk for a couple of more, he said.
"I'm just glad to get back," Mr. Kasavich said. "It's in my blood." 
The country is still heavily dependent on coal. More than half the electricity is generated from coal. Roads and highways cannot be built without it. Steel, gold, roofing materials and batteries, all depend on coal. 
So at 7:30 a.m., the men strapped on their emergency oxygen boxes and turned on their headlamps and carried their lunch pails into the bowels of the earth. There was a blanket of cold mist and an old trolley that took them 300 feet down.
The roar of the machinery is frightening to the unaccustomed visitor. Most miners have hearing problems from the noise and bad joints from the dampness and puddles that form when it rains. A man who is 55 and works underground has the face of a 70-year-old who works in an office building. Still, the miner is sinewy and strong and humps bags of stone on his back, shovels rocks, repairs equipment in poor lighting and works on his feet all day. 
"You work in a coal mine you're going to get hurt," said Bill Shaneyfelt, 64, who is the oldest man in the mine. When he got laid off, he went to work as a repairman in the nuclear power plants. 
"Radiation or coal dust," Mr. Shaneyfelt said. "Either way, it's a pretty good living. Somebody's got to do it." 
The loss of a thumb will pay about $50,679. The big toe is worth $20,272. The eye goes for about $139,367. A miner's life is valued at half of his average weekly earnings -- about $378 -- paid to his widow for life.
But coal miners do not think about the danger. They think about the money. And when the workday is over they drag themselves out of the hole and shower. Some go home and others go to the bar. 
There, the bridge builders have settled in and the working people start talking about their jobs.
"Those young guys are crazy working 300 feet above ground," said Joe Hohol, 56, who has made a 20-year career working 300 feet below. "Funny things a man will do for a dollar."

HEADLINE: 2-PARENT FAMILIES RISE AFTER CHANGE IN WELFARE LAWS 

BYLINE:  By BLAINE HARDEN 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE 

 BODY:
Five years after Congress overhauled welfare laws, with the intention of creating more two-parent families, the proportion of poor American children living in households with two adults is on the rise, two studies say.
 Nagging questions remain, however, about the stability of these new households and the well-being of the children growing up in them. 
 The most significant change in family structure, the studies suggest, has occurred among low-income blacks. After a decade-long slide, the proportion of black children living with two married parents increased significantly from 1995 to 2000. An analysis of census figures shows a 4.1 percentage point jump, to 38.9 percent from 34.8 percent. A separate survey by the Urban Institute found that single mothers are increasingly likely to live with unmarried partners. The increase in cohabitation has been sharpest among those who have felt the prod of welfare change, the institute, a research organization based in Washington, said. 
Here in central Milwaukee, in a rented house with a sign saying "No Loitering or Prowling," Ophelia and Lamont Burks are on the front lines of the changes that Congress wanted to engineer.
After eight years on welfare and seven out-of-wedlock births, Mrs. Burks found a nursing aide job in 1997 and, in 1998, married Mr. Burks, then the father of five of her children. Wisconsin's welfare-to-work law, she said, nudged along her decisions to get a job and a husband. 
"I knew if I got married, my husband would be reliable for the kids while I was at work," she said. "And I would be reliable for them, while he was at work."
The Burks's marriage, however, has had more than its share of trouble.
The low point came in 1999, when Mr. Burks, 35, became addicted to crack cocaine and quit his job as a house painter. To get clean, he left Milwaukee for five months of drug-abuse treatment. Without his paycheck, his wife could not pay rent and was evicted from their apartment.
Children in tow, she moved in with a cousin who had a live-in boyfriend. He put a pistol to the temple of Mrs. Burks's oldest son, 11-year-old Kwame, she said. She moved out in a panic and placed her children in a homeless shelter.
A number of social workers and ministers in Milwaukee, along with several national experts in child welfare, say the Burks's problems are an all-too-typical reality check for those inclined to get carried away, after just five years, with the family-engineering success of the welfare overhaul.
"These marriages and cohabiting households are all about survival," said Helen Gee, a supervisor at Community Advocates, the largest advocacy agency in Wisconsin for low-income families. "They are crisis-driven. Women need help with high rent, utilities, child care and transport. Their struggle is so great they think that two heads are better than one. Many women are leaving their kids at home all day with these guys they hardly know. We are seeing a lot of stressed-out clients."
In the partisan minefield of American welfare policy, a powerful consensus has emerged in recent years among social scientists, as well as state and federal policy makers. It sees single-parent families as the dismal foundries that produced decades of child poverty, delinquency and crime. And it views the rise of such families, which began in the early 1960's and continued until about five years ago, as a singularly important indicator of social pathology.
From a child's point of view, according to a growing body of social research, the most supportive household is one with two biological parents in a low-conflict marriage.
Yet, in many of the two-adult households that have been cobbled together by necessity in Milwaukee and across the country in the wake of the welfare overhaul, a primary ingredient for child development -- stability -- often goes missing.
"You just can't say that these are low-conflict families and they are not likely to be any time soon," said Ramona Bell, who counsels families for Community Advocates.
For poor children, growing up in a household with cohabiting -- but unmarried -- adults is probably not an improvement over growing up in a single-parent family, said Kristin Moore, a social psychologist and president of Child Trends, a nonpartisan research group based in Washington.
"Mostly they don't seem to be better off," said Dr. Moore, adding that more research needs to be done on the subject. "There is a lot of turbulence in those families and turbulence is really hard for kids."
Despite concern about the stability of two-parent households formed in the aftermath of welfare change, there is widespread agreement among welfare experts that something remarkable has been going on in poor urban communities, particularly in the last five years.
The confluence of positive trends includes falling rates of crime and drug abuse, the greatest decline in child poverty, particularly black child poverty, since the 1960's, and sharp increases in employment among mothers who head families, especially those who have never been married. In the last decade, there has also been a steady decline in the teenage birth rate, with the steepest decline among black teenagers.
In 1996, there were dire predictions by advocates for children that welfare change, by ratcheting up stress in families where mothers were required to find work, would lead to an increase in child abuse and neglect. Yet, so far, several national studies show no increase. Here in Milwaukee, as across Wisconsin, reported cases of domestic violence have declined since 1995. A Michigan study has shown that former welfare mothers with jobs are significantly less likely than mothers still on welfare to report domestic violence or homelessness.
There are exceptions to the pattern. Early studies of families in three welfare-to-work programs, all of them precursors to the federal welfare overhaul, have found unexpected evidence that adolescents have more behavior problems and lower performance in school than children in other welfare households. 
On balance, however, the dovetailing of positive trends has surprised and intrigued many social scientists.
"There seems to be something going on -- people are talking about a tipping point," Dr. Moore said. "It is hard to achieve social change, but once the norms have changed, it can pick up speed."
While the sustained economic boom of the 1990's probably supported all of these trends, including the increase in two-parent families, there is considerable agreement, even among skeptical policy analysts, that welfare change deserves considerable credit.
"In many ways welfare reform is working better than I thought it would," said Wendell Primus, who in 1996 resigned as deputy assistant secretary of health and human services to protest what he feared would be the severe impact of the welfare overhaul on children. "The sky isn't falling anymore. Whatever we have been doing over the last five years, we ought to keep going."
Working with census surveys, it was Mr. Primus and his colleague Allen Dupree from a Washington-based research group called the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who uncovered the decline in single-parent families and the increase in marriage and cohabitation, particularly among lower-income blacks.
The Urban Institute study, which found that single mothers, especially poor single mothers, are increasingly likely to live with unmarried partners, was based on different data -- a survey of 100,000 people in 13 states in 1997 and 1999.
Echoing many welfare experts, Mr. Primus speculates that there is a complex cluster of possible reasons, including welfare change, behind the decline in single-parent families. They include a community-based fatherhood movement that insists that young men take responsibility for their children, as well as an aggressive effort to establish paternity and enforce child support.
"Last year was the first year in which we had more legal paternities established -- more legal connections between Dad and Baby -- than we had out-of-wedlock births," Mr. Primus said.
But, like the social workers in Milwaukee, Mr. Primus said that the desperate need for cash among welfare-to-work mothers is also a key to understanding the trend toward two-parent households. The squeeze shows up clearly in census figures. While the poorest 40 percent of single mothers increased their yearly earnings by $2,300 from 1995 to 2000, their disposable income increased just $292, mostly because of lost welfare benefits and food stamps.
Stephanie Brown, a welfare-to-work mother in central Milwaukee, was told this month that she made too much money to receive food stamps. Mrs. had been getting $200 worth of stamps a month.
"It will be hard, but I just have to budget a little better," said Mrs. Brown, 30, who has five children.
Seeking both respectability and financial security, she got married last year to Truneil Brown, 26, the father of her youngest child.
"The welfare reform was a push for me," she said. "We were going to get married anyway, but it speeded things up."
Marriage has worked out well in some ways, she said.
"We did it pretty much for the family sake," she explained. "He was good with the kids. Marriage is a better example for the kids. They feel more secure experiencing the wedding. They feel like an average American family."
But Mrs. Brown said that her financial squeeze, so far, has not been eased much by marriage. Her husband has bipolar disorder, a mental illness that can be characterized by extreme mood swings. He lost his warehouse job at the beginning of the year and is unemployed. 
Mrs. Brown, who left welfare in 1998, holds two jobs to pay her bills. She works 40 hours a week, from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m., with mentally disabled adults, making $7.60 an hour. In the mornings, she is on call as a home-health aid.
"It's stressful," she said. "But you just feel better because you know what you are working for is not handed out."
The Rev. LeHavre Buck is in the business of trying to teach young black men to take responsibility for their children. As director of the Fatherhood Initiative at the YWCA of Greater Milwaukee, he has come into contact with more than 2,000 families since the welfare overhaul began.
The movement toward "responsible fatherhood" has received enthusiastic support from the Bush administration, which has pledged $200 million in grants over five years to community groups promoting fatherhood and marriage. Mr. Buck said he wished that he could report that the movement was already infusing responsibility into the family lives of the young fathers he counsels. But so far, he said, the going has been slow.
"I know there are many more guys in the home than there used to be and not necessarily with women who are the mothers of their children," he said. "Many of them are there because of lack of employment and lack of options. These guys are one argument from being homeless."
Arguments, the minister said, come along quite often.
"They are in conflict with their babies' mama on a regular basis and they are often in conflict with the women they are living with because they don't have any parenting skills," Mr. Buck said.
The arguments that Lamont Burks provoked in 1999 with his wife, Ophelia, when he became addicted to cocaine, were by far the worst of their marriage.
The Burks, however, have somehow worked it out. He is back at home and learning to be a forklift operator, with the help of a state program. After the birth of Ophelia's eighth child four months ago, Mr. Burks said he decided enough was enough. He had a vasectomy.
His wife said the operation proved "he really loves me." She said she knew that Lamont had to endure the ridicule of his friends, who accused him of throwing away his manhood. 
"It was the right move to get married," her husband said. "It forced me to grow up."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Renew Relationship With Military In Indonesia 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
The Bush administration plans to renew some American ties to the Indonesian military, the most powerful institution in the sprawling Southeast Asian country but one fraught with human rights abuses. 
 The decision is part of an effort to cement stronger ties with Indonesia, one of the most important but unstable countries in the region, after the relatively smooth coming to power of the new president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, whose ascent was supported by the military. 
 The Pentagon once had longstanding ties with the Indonesian military, dating back to the early days of the cold war. But relations have been circumscribed since the early 1990's over human rights abuses. 
Critics of the plan to revive ties say America's past training of Indonesian troops did little to prevent the widespread abuses, in particular those that accompanied the secession of East Timor from the country three years ago. 
In re-establishing military ties, the Bush administration says it would like to help ensure the stability of the country, a vast archipelago that has been riven by separatist movements. 
Indonesia is seen as pivotal for the stability of Southeast Asia and, administration officials say, has assumed new significance as the broader region stumbles through an unexpected period of economic downturn and political uncertainty. 
In a special gesture, the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, was dispatched on a detour from India to Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. He arrived there today to discuss a range of issues beyond his usual trade portfolio. Next month, the Pentagon plans to send Adm. Dennis C. Blair, the United States Pacific commander, to begin plans for re-engagement with the army. 
But as the administration moves forward, senior members of Congress and human rights groups warn that the Indonesian military has shown little interest in serious reform. They fear that Mrs. Megawati, a proud nationalist, will give the military a free hand in crushing a new secessionist rebellion that has been building in the province of Aceh. 
Gareth Evan, a former foreign minister of Australia who is now the president of the International Crisis Group, which specializes in conflict prevention, acknowledged last month that many of Australia's efforts to train a more professional Indonesian military had "helped only to produce more professional human rights abuses." 
Senior Bush administration officials say, however, that they will take a step-by-step approach that will allow them to exercise a positive influence. The army, they argue, stayed mostly on the sidelines during the crisis when President Abdurrahman Wahid was removed from power.
"The military has acted with honor and correctness during the transition to democracy," a senior administration official said. "We think that now is the time to think of re-engagement. They have behaved well for the most part."
Administration officials say they plan to stop short of training the Indonesian military and of selling it weaponry, both of which are banned under Congressional restrictions. But officials said they had asked Congress to consider some flexibility so that junior Indonesian officers could be trained in operations like peacekeeping and disaster relief. 
But Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the author of much of the legislation that circumscribes any relationship with the Indonesian military, said he was concerned that the administration wanted to rush ahead. 
"They want operational contacts, search and rescue, fisheries patrol, nonlethal arms sales, high-level meetings," Mr. Leahy said. "I think that's moving very, very quickly." 
Michael Jendrzejczyk, a spokesman for Human Rights Watch, said it was "premature to move toward significant re-engagement with the military." He added that Mrs. Megawati needed to demonstrate a willingness to seek accountability for the abuses committed by the military in Aceh, East Timor and other restive areas. 
In shaping their policies, administration officials said they would not go beyond the Congressional constraints. But they also emphasized that now was the time for the United States to seize an early chance to promote a model of military professionalism in an institution whose formal role in politics was terminated during the Wahid era. 
During his visit to Jakarta, Mr. Zoellick invited Mrs. Megawati to the White House in early September, signaling the administration's willingness to embrace her. 
As they map their course in Indonesia, the administration is guided at its most senior levels by Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz, who once served as ambassador to Indonesia.

HEADLINE: Killing Touches a Nerve in Ex-Soviet Land 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
No one heard the close-range gunshot that killed Giorgi Sanaia here last month, but the death of the popular young television anchor at the country's top-rated network reverberated powerfully across this capital city. 
 Hundreds of people gathered outside his rundown apartment house when word spread he had been killed. Young men and old women shouted insults at the city's police chief and at the country's minister of internal affairs as Mr. Sanaia's shrouded body was carried out. 
 Within hours, President Eduard A. Shevardnadze canceled an important foreign trip, fearing Georgia could be plunged into chaos by outrage over what most people assumed was a political assassination. He also sought help from the F.B.I. to bolster the credibility of his police. 
"What we have here is a thoroughly thought out and targeted provocation, the goal of which is to provoke instability, fear, distrust in society," said Mr. Shevardnadze in an appeal for calm on state radio. 
In fact, distrust is not far below the surface of this tiny nation, and Mr. Sanaia's killing has touched a nerve here. Corruption is rampant, and it is a common belief that Mr. Sanaia was killed for political reasons -- and that the people behind it will never be known. 
The prospect of instability in Georgia, a route for Caspian Sea oil and gas and an anchor of Western-oriented democracy in the region, is unsettling to the United States and its allies. 
Western governments and international lenders have backed Mr. Shevardnadze and Georgia's 5.5 million people with billions of dollars of aid since it gained its independence from the Soviet Union a decade ago. The United States provides about $100 million a year.
But instability has been a part of Georgia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since Mr. Shevardnadze became president after a civil war, he has survived two assassination attempts. A mutiny in May by soldiers who had not been paid in more than a year nearly escalated into an attempted coup. Two breakaway republics in northern Georgia are seen as continuing threats to stability.
In a country weary of poverty -- the average annual income sank below $750 this year -- and fed up with corruption, people's reaction to the killing of Mr. Sanaia reflects not only a deep-seated distrust of the police but also growing dissatisfaction with Mr. Shevardnadze. Criticizing him directly, however, remains taboo. 
"I don't trust the police and I don't have confidence in the government," said Eteri Kuchukhidze, 79, who lived next door to Mr. Sanaia. She wept quietly in her darkened apartment as she continued: "It was a political killing. He was a nice young man who had no enemies."
While tending a blazing oven at the small neighborhood bakery, Dato Kirimeli said flatly: "I don't trust that this will be investigated. I don't have trust in the police."
Identical sentiments surfaced in a poll of 500 residents of this capital city, completed Friday by Georgian Opinion Research Business International. Fifty-seven percent of the people surveyed said political interests were behind the killing, 63 percent did not think the killer would be found and 69 percent did not think the person who ordered the killing would be identified. 
More than half the people did not think the government was interested in investigating the matter, and 47 percent did not think it was appropriate for the F.B.I. to join the inquiry. 
A national poll in June by the organization ranked corruption as the second biggest problem, after unemployment and ahead of poverty. More than a third of the respondents said almost all government officials were corrupt; a quarter more said most were corrupt. Mr. Shevardnadze's approval rating was a dismal 6 percent.
Last year, Mr. Shevardnadze identified corruption as a major problem and appointed a commission to attack it. But diplomats said the commission had done little, and senior Georgian officials said it was difficult to root out corrupt officials who had built their own power bases.
The president's governing Citizens Union Party has been fragmented by its inability to combat corruption or to improve the economy. A group of prominent businessmen left to form their own party, and the remaining ranks split into factions of young reformers and older conservatives. 
In a startling example of the rift, Mikhail Saakashvili, the young justice minister, stood before a meeting of government ministers on Wednesday and angrily accused several of them of profiting from corruption. He waved photographs of their lavish homes and demanded a law to confiscate property bought with illegal gains.
"Corruption is a big problem and it is very difficult to fight without a harsh dictatorship," said a senior adviser to Mr. Shevardnadze.
Unlike counterparts in other former Soviet republics, Mr. Shevardnadze does not rule with an iron hand. Criticism of the government and protests tolerated here would be brutally suppressed elsewhere.
Whether because of tolerance or indecision, corruption batters the economy at every level and the government cannot collect enough revenue to operate. Businessmen pay off tax inspectors, and the poor bribe the police. In the June survey, people said they had to bribe doctors for treatment.
Nothing, however, has galvanized public anger like the killing of Mr. Sanaia. Only 26 years old, he was the host of the leading news show on Rustavi 2, the top-rated private network, and a friendly face in most living rooms at 11 each night. 
Journalists have been attacked across the former Soviet Union for reporting on corruption or criticizing public officials. The slaying of a Ukrainian Internet reporter last fall prompted months of protests against President Leonid Kuchma.
By all accounts, Mr. Sanaia was evenhanded and respected, and his show did not delve deeply into wrongdoing. "He was a gifted journalist who was never biased or aggressive," said Erosi Kitsmarishvili, general director of Rustavi 2. "That is why we think his murder was not just to kill him, but a message."
The message, if it was one, remains unclear and there are no clear beneficiaries from his death. The police are also investigating the possibility that the slaying was personal.
Mr. Sanaia's body was discovered on the evening of July 26 after he failed to show up at work. His wife and 6-year-old son were away on vacation, and colleagues said he had spent the previous evening at a bar with friends. 
The one-room apartment was locked, and the police entered from the balcony. They found Mr. Sanaia lying on his back in a pool of blood, wearing boxer shorts and eyeglasses. He had been shot once in the back of the head. There was no sign of forced entry. 
The public reaction led Mr. Shevardnadze to cancel a trip to Azerbaijan, where he was to sign an agreement for a natural gas pipeline through Georgia to Turkey. The pipeline and a parallel oil pipeline are vital to the country's economy. 
The president pledged a full investigation. With the permission of the American Embassy, an F.B.I. agent arrived to help collect forensic evidence, which was sent to the bureau laboratory in Washington.
A few days after Mr. Sanaia's death, several thousand people marched down Tbilisi's main street to honor his memory. On July 31, Mr. Shevardnadze attended Mr. Sanaia's funeral, and 50,000 people joined the procession. 
Now, public protests have faded and Mr. Sanaia's body is interred beneath a simple wooden cross in Saburtali Cemetery, where many of Georgia's prominent figures are buried. The distrust and cynicism bared by his death remain. 
"Even if we arrest someone, I don't think the public will believe us," said a senior Georgian government official.

HEADLINE: A Sip of Wine, a Rustic View, and Hog Waste 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: PENN YAN, N.Y. 

 BODY:
David DeMarco, the owner of Seneca Shore Wine Cellars here, knows that most visitors to the Finger Lakes expect to indulge their senses. They want to taste award-winning wines. They want to see rustic farmhouses and Mennonite buggies. They want to smell a bouquet of lake breezes and fresh-cut hay.
 But these days, people sometimes have little choice but to inhale another potent local product: pig manure. 
 "The only thing I can vaguely compare it to," said Mr. DeMarco, who quit his job as a software engineer in Manhattan to move here in 1993, "is on the worst day of summer -- hot and humid -- and the worst subway in -- pick your borough -- and you go down, where the drunk has been vomiting and urinating, and it's stagnating for two weeks. Well, that isn't as bad as the pigs." 
In just the last few years, the Finger Lakes, a region best known for its deep waters and bucolic beauty, has become the hog farming capital of New York. But with that distinction has come controversy, touching almost every facet of life here and casting an awkward spotlight on the people most associated with the animals, Mennonite farmers. 
For some residents, the proliferation of large farms, those with 1,000 or more hogs, has adversely affected the quality of life, the environment, the wine business and the tourism industry. Wine and swine, in other words, do not mix.
For others, though, the hog business has helped to resuscitate a stagnant economy and stave off suburban creep. It is simply unfortunate, they say, that some residents -- particularly newcomers with lakefront weekend homes -- have little appreciation for the rural life or respect for the Mennonites.
"It's a way of life," said Lilly Hoover, a 20-year-old Mennonite who works at her family's butcher shop, Shirk Meats, in Dundee. "People got to realize that pork chops don't grow on trees."
New York's hog farms -- the largest of which, in Genesee County, has 6,000 animals -- pale in comparison to those in states like Iowa and North Carolina, where farms have up to 50,000 hogs. And over all, hog farming is on the decline in New York, with the number of hogs dropping by 40 percent between 1992 and 1998. But not in the Finger Lakes, which unlike other major hog-raising areas is also a prime vacation spot. Yates, Seneca and Cayuga Counties increased their hog production by 70 percent, and now account for one-third of the state's 60,000 hogs.
Given that growth -- and recent hog-farm accidents in North Carolina -- several Finger Lakes communities have halted or are considering halting the construction of barns used for concentrated animal feeding operations. In Albany, meanwhile, two lawmakers from the New York City suburbs -- Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, and Senator Vincent L. Leibell, a Putnam County Republican -- are sponsoring legislation that would require farms with more than 200 hogs to get a pollution permit.
"You get one really bad manure spill, and it will be one of those things where everyone will wonder why no one did anything leading up to it," Mr. Brodsky said.
In New York, as elsewhere, these are not heady times to be an independent farmer, as more families, squeezed by economics, sell their farms to large corporations. But one exception has been Yates County, thanks to the Mennonites, who operate 90 percent of the dairy farms and the three sizable hog farms.
"There's always this undercurrent that farming is now dominated by Mennonites," said Judson Reid, an agricultural educator with the Cornell Cooperative Extension in Yates. "But I think they're essential. They stabilized the economy in this county. There's no doubt about that."
Like their better-known Anabaptist brethren, the Amish, most Mennonites work as farmers, craftsmen or skilled laborers. Most dress simply and send their children to private religious schools. Some travel by horse and buggy; others use cars and trucks, as long as they are dark.
The Mennonites began to move to the Finger Lakes region in the 1970's because farmland had become too expensive, and the landscape too commercialized, in Lancaster and other traditional bases in Pennsylvania. Today, there are perhaps 600 Mennonite families in the region, dozens of Mennonite businesses, more than two dozen Mennonite schools and perhaps a dozen Mennonite churches.
One Mennonite businessman, Melvin Kurtz, moved here in 1985 from Ephrata, Pa., to establish a division of his family's 107-year-old feed mill, Keystone Mills, in Romulus, N.Y.
To complement its production of livestock feed, Keystone Mills buys thousands of hogs and contracts with individual farmers to raise those hogs, which swell to 250 pounds from 60 in three or four months.
The farmer provides the labor and the building, which is usually 150 feet long by 50 feet wide, atop a six-foot manure pit. The company provides the feed until the hogs are shipped to Pennsylvania for slaughter. The farmer spreads the manure on his fields, usually once in the spring, once in the fall.
The work is far from easy. Many farmers raise the hogs part time, relying heavily on automation, and even those who do it full time say that they can gross only $30,000 in a good year.
More than two dozen farms with 1,000 or more hogs now dot the Finger Lakes region, almost half of them run by Mennonite families, said Gerald Swartley, general manager of Keystone Mills. And while "the last four years have seen more growth than the previous 10 years," Mr. Swartley said that he did not forecast any additional growth.
To critics, though, what currently exists is already too much.
First, there's the stench, which even hog farmers acknowledge is usually worse than, say, cow manure.
People say that it forces them to keep their windows shut and prevents them from hanging laundry outside. It also prohibits them from inviting friends over for barbecues and discourages outdoor sports. They have complained of headaches, nausea and respiratory irritation. Some have even fled their homes for a few days to take comfort in the odorless house of a friend or relative.
"It becomes a rather significant psychological stress to have this with regularity," said Thomas Bjorkman, a horticulture professor at Cornell and a resident of Varick. "It's like being inside an outhouse." 
Another major concern is the manure's impact on the environment. The lakes are so clean that many people drink the water, untreated. But pig manure contains antibiotics and other chemicals that could eventually contaminate the lakes or the groundwater, said Jack Ossont, a longtime environmental activist who in March helped found FARM Yates, the initials standing for Families Addressing Rural Messes.
"There's nothing I can find in the literature that convinces me that hog feces are less dangerous to human health than human feces," said Dr. Stephen I. Rosenfeld, director of the allergy training program at the University of Rochester medical school, who owns a weekend house on Keuka Lake.
For the 75 wineries in what bills itself as the second-largest wine-producing region in the country, the issue is a delicate one. The grape growers feel a real kinship with the hog farmers. But they worry about the environmental consequences. And since up to 90 percent of their sales come from walk-in visitors, they fret that tourists, ever fickle, may be repulsed by the odor -- and spread the bad news, said Mr. DeMarco of Seneca Shore Wine Cellars.
Anne Parker, executive director of the Finger Lakes Wine Country Tourism Marketing Association, agreed. "You like to think of a wine region as something that's a little bit more upscale, and it's kind of hard to be upscale if the air doesn't smell too good," she said. 
In New York, "right to farm" laws are intended to preserve agricultural districts like the Finger Lakes, and many hog farmers here are very opposed to regulations that would limit their livelihood. It would also cost the average hog farmer in the area an extra $25,000 to $30,000 a year to comply with more stringent requirements, said Mark James, executive director of the Finger Lakes office of the New York Farm Bureau, a nonprofit advocacy group.
Some hog farmers here have already spent more than $2,000 on food additives in an effort to reduce the odor, and they tell their neighbors in advance when they plan to spread manure. Four years ago, one farmer, Ed Hartman, began inviting neighbors to a pig roast at his Harty Hog Farms in Waterloo, because "once we can talk to them, they can understand what we do."
Still, Mr. Hartman said he was frustrated by what he called misperceptions about what he does, and he eagerly offered two visitors a tour of his farm. Like other hog farmers, he has groused about animal rights advocates who have criticized the hog farms as inhumane, unsanitary corporate factories, and new residents who have romanticized rural life as odor-free.
"The community is so far removed from what farming is," said Stewart Tietjen, a 38-year-old Mennonite farmer in Dundee who began raising 1,000 pigs in February. "They think farming is like the children's books where you have these red-gabled barns with a few pigs and one cow. Well, you can't survive like that. You need 1,000 pigs to survive."
Until recently, the relationship between the Mennonites and the outside community here was amicable, and sometimes quite close. But hog farming has strained the relationship. While most Mennonites say they cannot fathom why people have been complaining about rural odors in a rural area, hog-farm critics say that the Mennonites have different values, rooted in a not-so-modern world.
On a recent languid summer day, for instance, Joan Teichner, a member of the Varick Town Board, listened to the concerns of Virginia Olsowske, who lives a quarter-mile from a Mennonite hog farm, and within a mile of three hog farms.
In 1997, Mrs. Teichner, a music teacher, became the first woman elected to the Town Board, after pledging to restrict hog farming. And though Mrs. Olsowske grew up on a dairy farm, she said that pig manure was a different beast altogether, permeating clothes, leaving a lingering taste in one's mouth and ruining many an outdoor activity.
"What's irritating is that we built the home from the ground up, and you can't enjoy it because of them," Mrs. Olsowske said, pointing out the window to a nearby Mennonite farm. "They have no compassion for the neighbors, in my book."
On the other side of Seneca Lake, at dusk, the Colegrove family, of nearby Phelps, were enjoying a lakeshore picnic and swim when they paused to talk hogs. Mark Colegrove, 35, a truck driver, said that he had worked on a hog farm as a teenager. And while he has tremendous respect for the farmers, he also said he cared deeply about the lake that his daughters, Samantha and Jolene, now enjoy.
"It's a half-and-half situation," he said. "I think they ought to limit the size of the farms so it doesn't have an impact on the lake."
His wife, Diane, also 35, did not disagree. But she added that the controversy, at its most basic level, signaled a growing divide between people who have competing visions for the Finger Lakes.
"Sometimes I wonder," she said, "if it's not the farms that smell bad, but the people who think it should smell better."

HEADLINE: Invisible Hand Now Clamping Onto Wallets; 
Gloomy Economic News Takes a Toll on Optimism

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
In a study some years back, psychologists took up the issue of accurate perceptions of reality.
 They compared a group of clinically depressed patients with supposedly normal people and found that the nondepressed group had an exaggerated opinion of their abilities and social skills. 
 It was the depressed people who had a far more accurate view of reality.
The economists Robert J. Frank and Philip J. Cook cite this study in their book "The Winner-Take-All Society" (The Free Press, 1995) to make the point that it is fundamentally human to be optimistic. Our perceptions about the world around us may be correct, but even if they give us reason to be concerned or fearful, we may not take action. 
Given this premise, how much bad economic news does it take to sober up after so many years of boom? Or put another way, what does it take to get the average person truly worried about money?
It's a question worth asking after more than a year of sour economic news, like falling stock prices, layoffs and announcements of poor corporate earnings.
The answer, naturally, depends a lot on what you mean by the average person. It may well be different if you live in a tough city neighborhood or a manicured suburb, or if you are one of those to get the most palpable sort of economic bad news, a pink slip. Among those are the thousands of Lucent Technologies employees laid off to help reduce the company's work force by nearly 100,000 in little more than a year, with many cuts also due to early retirements and corporate spinoffs. The latest cuts, of 20,000 workers, were announced late last month.
"People's situations differ so incredibly much," said Mr. Frank, a professor of economics at Cornell University. "If you're a professor with tenure, you're not worried about your job. But if you're in the tech industry, you're looking at Lucent obviously with concern." And if you read the newspapers and watch television, you may be looking at other recent news with concern, like the economy's pallid growth rate of seven-tenths of 1 percent for the second quarter, or analysts' recent predictions that they now expect corporate profits to drop more than 8 percent, or $30 billion, this year, which would be the first decline since 1991.
There is no shortage of anecdotal evidence that the mood has darkened.
Daniel W. Saalman, an American Express financial planner in Valhalla, N.Y., stumbles on hints every day. One client declines to consider a systematic savings program. Another opts for term insurance instead of a more expensive permanent policy. Another refinances a mortgage.
"Everybody's talking about limiting the downside," he said. "Nobody's really pumped up about what the upside potential could be, like two years ago, when everybody was talking about doubling your money with this mutual fund, or where that stock would go."
Yet what was remarkable, in interviews with more than a dozen people across the metropolitan area, was how many tales of woe ended with dollops of optimism. 
Terry Winthrop, a 37-year-old accountant from Union, N.J., was shopping with her son, Trevor, 6, at a supermarket in Millburn, N.J. The downturn has hit her family, she said, and the evidence was in her shopping cart: the store's house brand of frozen pizza, rather than a more expensive brand. 
"I still buy the same amount of food and shop the same in the stores, but I watch my wallet a little closer," she said. "For the last few years, all we heard was great things about the economy, that it was all right to spend all the time. Now everything is on shaky ground, unemployment is rising and the market falters all the time." 
Nevertheless, Ms. Winthrop is confident that it won't be long before the good times return. 
"We've gone from one extreme to the next, and I feel that we'll be all right after a time," she said. "After so long of just being able to spend and having extra money from the market, it's hard to come back to reality, but it's a good lesson to learn."
Indeed, Professor Frank said, there is nothing like reality. People in their 20's and 30's, or those who started investing only in the boom times of the 1990's, naturally have a much higher level of optimism than the those who lived through the Depression or later recessions.
Robert B. Stevens, 48, an independent record producer who lives in Manhattan, considers himself a knowledgeable but relatively new investor, having started doing so on his own in 1998, as online investing grew popular.
"You know how something spirals in and gets closer and closer to you, and you hear that a friend of a friend of a friend lost a job? And then the friend of a friend, and then a neighbor?" he said. "You hear about it and initially there's denial, but as the news begins to get overwhelming and moves from the business page to the front page, the reality moves in and you start to not spend as much.
"It started to hit me a couple of months ago when I couldn't see an immediate happy ending," Mr. Stevens went on. "For about a year, I think no one was really aware of the magnitude of what happened. My loss of denial kicked in later than some and probably sooner than most, judging by those consumer figures that come in and say everything is hunky-dory."
Mr. Stevens was referring to strong spending by consumers, which is credited with helping to keep the economy afloat through the slowdown.
According to the latest Commerce Department figures, consumer spending rose by four-tenths of 1 percent in June over May. But confusingly, the consumer confidence index produced by the Conference Board fell to 116.5 in July from 118.9 in June. 
Sometimes it is a small thing that produces an economic epiphany. For Thomas Loeser, 43, a writer from Edison, N.J., it was a piece of mail.
"Last week, I received my daughter's college tuition bill in the mail," he said. "When I went to pay it, I noticed that the account that I had set up to partially pay for it was not making quite as much money as it used to. 
"My accountant said it was the slump in the economy and that funds like mine are not generating as much revenue as they used to and that my stocks are much weaker than they were last year. I never paid that much attention because the accounts were always making money."
And actual economic losses are often not necessary to shake a consumer's confidence. Sometimes perception is enough. Research by an economist at the Federal Reserve Board, Maria Ward Otoo, several years ago suggested that consumers may be swayed as much by news of the market's overall performance as by the state of their own portfolios.
New York City has its own special confidence index: the health of the financial industry, a vital part of the city's economy. And what Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, sees is not good.
The securities industry employed 188,000 people in New York in February. The number, seasonally adjusted, fell to 184,000 in June, a small drop. "If the securities industry is actually reducing staff, there's a good chance that incomes and bonuses of people there are being cut back, too," Mr. Bram said. "If these Wall Street layoffs continue, it would have more of an effect on the real economy, but I think it would have an effect on the psychology of New York specifically."
In areas like construction, which are closely tied to the economic ebb and flow, the knowledge of the work that's out there can be the most powerful influence on mood.
"There is not as many jobs as there used to be, and I know a lot of guys who have not worked in the last two months, but that's the nature of the beast," said Rando Landrau, 28, a construction worker from Elizabeth, N.J. "It's tough out here, and not knowing if you'll have a job next month is frightening."
Like the depressed subjects in the reality experiment, those left out of the Wall Street boom seem to have the most measured view.
At the Cal Cutters barber shop in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, waiting customers acknowledged that times were a bit better for a while, but that now they are right back where they used to be.
"The economy is geared for the rich, and it's never going to change," Emil Wentt, a dog groomer, said over the buzz of clippers and the light jazz coming from tinny speakers. "They get rich off the sweat of the poor." Added Marlon Cooks, 29: "Everything goes up except your paycheck. You have to keep on making your money stretch. That's not my perception, that's reality."
Over at the Calvin P. Parker funeral home, the owner, Anthony E. Smith, sat in a chipped wooden chair in the cramped waiting room. He had a rack of pressed suits in the back but wore a football jersey, jean shorts and sneakers. He could wear one of the suits, he said, but most of his clients are poor and he does not want to alienate them.
Mr. Smith is tired of squeaking by month after month. His focus is on his next funeral and paying tuition for his two daughters. He is trying to refinance his business, but the interest rates he sees advertised and those actually offered by the local banks "might as well be from two different countries," he said.
"Do you know what 'job' means?" Mr. Smith asked. "Not many people know this, but it stands for something: 'Just Over Broke.' When the economy was good people around here had jobs, but they didn't have careers. For people who have never had anything, that job is great. But the job isn't worth anything. Once you've put in your 25 years, guess what, you're broke again. And you're out there looking for another job."
Mr. Smith said that the recent run of prosperity affected his neighbors differently than it did middle- and upper-middle-class people. 
"We weren't thinking about big investments or portfolios," he said. "If they could pay their mortgage, feed their kids, and maybe have a night out every now and then, great. That doesn't mean we don't have aspirations for greater things. It's just been that it's been so rough for so long that we're content to do little more than survive."
Others extract their realistic outlook from the well of memory. Kenneth Crosby, 89, of Verona, N.J., said he remembered truly hard times.
"When I was a kid, there was a real fear that there would not be enough money to put food on the table," he said as he watered his lawn. "There was lots of prosperity in the 20's, much like the past few years, and then the market crashed. That was a true problem for everyone. People today think that cutting a two-week vacation down to 10 days is a financial problem.
"Well, they ain't seen nothing yet."

Trading Rice a Knicks Overreaction

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Shandon Anderson and Howard Eisley are durable, multidimensional players who have not missed a game because of injury in almost five years. They give the Knicks depth, playoff experience and instant offense.
 But their trade for Glen Rice and a couple of throw-ins in a three-team deal Friday was less about fortifying rosters than it was a used-car sale between franchises that no longer wanted them. 
 They are not lemons, and maybe Anderson, who came from Houston, and Eisley, who came from Dallas, can change the on-court chemistry enough for the Knicks to make a genuine run at the N.B.A. finals.
Yet, less than a year after the Patrick Ewing trade, the Knicks have essentially admitted they made a huge mistake. 
Scott Layden, the team president, and Jeff Van Gundy, the coach, get a measure of credit for making a move, for not staying with Rice, who was sent to Houston, because of stubborn pride.
But the few times Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston and Rice were all healthy and in an offensive rhythm, the three-swingmen rotation was not a bust. Sprewell slashed, Houston jab-stepped and shot, and Rice showed some semblance of a post-up game no one knew he still possessed.
Did Rice make noise behind the scenes about his sixth-man role? Yes. But so did Sprewell during the Knicks' 1999 run to the finals before he forced Van Gundy to start him.
The point is, no one in the Eastern Conference is head and shoulders above everyone else. Not Philadelphia. Not Toronto. And certainly not Orlando, which added Ewing and Horace Grant to a group of young legs they will have trouble keeping up with. 
Irrespective of their first-round exit, the Knicks were not that far from the 76ers. It is almost as if their fickle fans pulled the trigger on this deal, imploring the front office to do anything, rather than watch everybody else change their rosters.
Rice may not have been the answer. But as a solid professional who was negotiating injuries while he tried to find his niche in New York, he and the Knicks deserved more than one season together. 
Change for change's sake is not a courageous strategy. It is reactive rather than proactive, making a deal because everyone else is making a deal.
The Knicks used to go out and acquire somebody else's star because they could not develop their own. They are not even doing that anymore.
Would this town really revolt if they took a step back and rebuilt for one season, rather than continually throwing this illusion of a title at the masses, ticket increase after annual ticket increase? The waiting list is, what, 15,000 people now?

Luxury Tax May Limit Mason
In an Eastern Conference rife with change and contenders, some executives believe Anthony Mason's brawn can swing the pendulum for the franchise that acquires him. He is big, ornery and coming off an All-Star season.
But as of this weekend, Mason, a veteran forward, is also unemployed, looking for work in a changing National Basketball Association marketplace.
The Miami Heat, his current team, does not want to re-sign him. Beyond the fact that Mason likes to play on the same low block as Alonzo Mourning, Pat Riley, the Heat's president and coach, is leery of putting the team on pace to pay a luxury tax, which takes effect for the first time at the end of next season. 
With most of this summer's key free agents remaining with their teams, Mason has become an odd man out in the league's new economic system. Though Milwaukee and Philadelphia have shown interest, numerous sign-and-trade possibilities have yet to materialize.
"Something will get done," Mason's agent, Don Cronson, said last week. "But it's just a lot more difficult now. The fear of the luxury tax has essentially made players clamp down on movement. Anthony Mason could very well represent the balance of power in the East and he's stuck?"
Cronson will not go so far as to accuse N.B.A. owners of colluding, but "something is going on," the agent said. When Cronson watched Horace Grant and Patrick Ewing sign for a pittance with Orlando, he surveyed a landscape in which one midlevel salary exception is parceled out to two established veterans. 
"There are some teams that have decided, 'We're not going $1 over the luxury tax,' " Cronson said. "In the past, teams would be flexible. Now everyone is saying, 'My owner told me. . . .' Something happened in the ether out there to cause this."
The luxury tax is one of two ways the owners financially protected themselves when the last collective bargaining agreement was signed in 1999. For the first time this season, players will give back 10 percent of their salaries, money that will be placed in an escrow fund. If player compensation is above 55 percent of basketball-related income -- a certainty -- the money will go to the owners. 
As for the luxury tax, if a team's payroll for this season is above a fixed figure, that team will have to pay a dollar-for-dollar tax on the difference. The number will not be calculated until after the season, but franchises are expecting it to be about $54 million.
Mason averaged 16.1 points, 9.6 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 40.7 minutes last season, helping Miami recover on the court from Mourning's kidney ailment, which sidelined him for almost the entire season. Mason shot 48 percent from the field and 78 percent from the line.
In one of the better stories of the season, when he was named to the Eastern Conference All-Star team as a reserve in February he became the oldest first-time All-Star since 1957.
When he seemed to be putting his knucklehead past behind, Mason was praised by Riley and others around the league for his commitment to the game. Yet when a woman recently charged Mason with assault at the Jersey Shore, all the old demons resurfaced. No formal charges have been brought against Mason.
"Of all the factors, that's the last factor on the list," Cronson said. "Before any of those issues, the home team not signing him and the iron limitations of the luxury tax have hurt him more than anything else."
Either way, Mason will eventually sign with some team and will make a decent sum of money. But at 34 years old, he was hoping to cash in for his career work. Instead, with most of the summer free-agent money gone, Mason's fate is in the hands of Riley.

An All-Star Charity Game
The All-Star Classic for Wheelchair Charities has always had some strong talent to hype it. But the class assembled for the event's 10th anniversary may be the strongest one.
Committed to play in the game Sept. 16 at Madison Square Garden are Chris Webber, Reggie Miller, Allan Houston, Tim Thomas, Lamar Odom, Elton Brand and Darius Miles of the Clippers and the former Hofstra star Speedy Claxton. Vince Carter is also a possibility.
The game returns to the Garden after it was played in the Nassau Coliseum last summer. Over $1 million has been raised since 1991, most of which has gone to patient treatment at Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island. 
Tickets are available through the Garden box office and Ticketmaster.

HEADLINE: Political Briefing; 
Nation's Governors Ponder Politics

BYLINE:  By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
When they were not demanding more federal money and fewer federal regulations, the nation's governors mainly talked politics last week at their annual meeting in Providence, R.I.
 It is an issue unusually dear to their hearts, given that since World War II about three dozen governors have run for president. 
(Four of the last five presidents were former governors.) But beyond that, 38 states will elect governors this year and next year. 
 Republicans seemed somewhat less sanguine than Democrats about prospects in those contests. They noted that they would be defending 25 of the 29 governorships they control, while the Democrats would be defending only 11 of their 19. (Independents are governors in two states.)
Equally serious, the Republican leaders said, the economy is sputtering; many of the governorships they must defend are in states that Al Gore carried in the 2000 presidential race; and many will be open seats, with the advantage of incumbency gone.
And what of presidential prospects for current governors?
Democrats lamented that for the first time in years only one of their group, Gray Davis of California, was being mentioned as a possible candidate. And his name was not coming up all that often.
As for the 18 other Democrats, the vagaries of time and geography seem to be at play. Many are still in their first term and many are from low-profile states.
Among Republican governors, there was no talk of potential presidents -- just talk of the former governor who already is president. Before the 2000 election, there was talk that several had the right combination of issues, geography and experience. But no more, not with President Bush already looking like a man running for re-election.

HEADLINE: The House That Rudy Built 

BYLINE:  By Nicholas Dawidoff; Nicholas Dawidoff is the author of "The Catcher Was a Spy" and the editor of a coming Library of America anthology of baseball writing.

 BODY:
Fred Wilpon became a New York real-estate plutocrat, the builder of tall towers along gilded blocks of Manhattan avenues, by excelling at the art of the calculated risk. The grandson of an immigrant Brooklyn street peddler, Wilpon left Bensonhurst on a full scholarship to the University of Michigan, and by age 30, he was back in New York, betting everything he had on reviving faded uptown properties -- and making lavish returns. Later, Wilpon was in the East Village before the boutiques, and he saw potential in Bedford-Stuyvesant when others saw only vacant lots and broken glass. "He has," says his son Jeffrey, "a nose for this stuff." 
 But there are the rare times when he doesn't need it. In Wilpon's business, every so often a proposal comes along that is so lush in its promise of profit and so elegant in its appeal to the deal maker's particular aesthetic that it requires no shrewd discerning at all. Early in 1998, Wilpon received just such an offer from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 Wilpon, now 64, is not simply a real-estate developer. Along with his partner, the publishing heir Nelson Doubleday, he owns the New York Mets, and it was for this reason that the mayor of New York had come calling. Some months before, the mayor had met with George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees. Steinbrenner, Wilpon learned, had told the mayor that he hoped a baseball stadium could be built on Staten Island to house a Yankee minor-league team. This made sense. Minor-league baseball attendance was booming as never before -- good for the Boss -- and the northeastern coast of Staten Island was badly in need of an economic fillip -- good for the mayor. What the pair now wanted from the Mets amounted to what people in real estate, like Fred Wilpon, refer to as the ceding of territorial rights. Because the Yankees and the Mets share baseball jurisdiction in the city, the Yankees could not place even a minor-league competitor in the area without the Mets' blessing.
On the face of things, such a blessing would have been highly unlikely. Just a year before, the Mets had hoped to place a minor-league team on Long Island, only to have their efforts blocked by the Yankees. There lingered, as the mayor puts it, "a certain amount of resentment." But the Brooklyn-born Giuliani also knew something about Fred Wilpon that went beyond his existence as a wise man of property. That is, Wilpon had been a childhood habitue of Ebbets Field, the ballpark the Dodgers left behind when they moved to Los Angeles in 1957. The mayor says he believed Wilpon was like almost everyone else from that generation of Brooklyn natives -- a nostalgic, still recovering from the loss of the Dodgers. With all that in mind, he threw Wilpon his very fat pitch: you give Steinbrenner Staten Island, he'll give you Brooklyn, and the city will build small ballparks for each of you, design them to your specifications and rent them to you on long-term leases for nominal considerations. By last fall, two pairs of steam shovels had broken ground. 
In Staten Island, word that a baseball park was rising in the old railroad yards, along the shoreline near the St. George ferry terminal, excited the locals. Across the Narrows, in the Borough of Churches, the same news was received like something on the order of the second coming. Wilpon immediately became a modern-day duke of Flatbush: he was the hometown boy who made good across the river and then brought the prodigal pastime back to the game's most impassioned fans. The new team was named the Cyclones, and before the season even began, 80 percent of the entire summer's worth of tickets were sold. Wilpon quickly added a thousand more seats to his ballpark, and soon those, too, were going like cheesecakes. 
And yet there were others in Brooklyn, skeptics, to whom Wilpon merited no more than a plangent "fuhgeddaboudit." In place of the Dodgers, Wilpon was serving up these Cyclones, who would slap their singles and ground-rule their doubles against outfits like the Lowell Spinners, the Batavia Muckdogs and the Mahoning Valley Scrappers. The Cyclones were to be a low-level Mets farm team, members of the short season (76 games) Class A New York-Penn League, meaning that Wilpon had presented a fabled city of strivers with just the imprimatur it always dreaded: he was the major leaguer who made Brooklyn into a minor-league town.
"They don't look minor league at all," Wilpon was saying. he was seated in a luxury box at KeySpan Park, the home of the Cyclones, inspecting his charges, who were displaying competence beyond their classification while drubbing the Vermont Expos. That same observation applied even more accurately to Wilpon's surroundings, for they are what have very quickly made the Brooklyn Cyclones a truly compelling proposition. Wilpon did not simply broker the dual feat of importing the sport of the provinces into New York City while returning professional baseball to Brooklyn. He situated his team in the midst of one of the world's most famous entertainment settings, the five-mile spit of sand jutting into the sea known as Coney Island. The ground on which the young Cyclones were blowing away the baby Expos once held Steeplechase Park, the first of the Coney Island grand-scale amusement compounds. For generations of Americans, Coney Island was synonymous with escape, thrills, adventure, seduction and pleasure, making this among the more inspired locales ever to be seeded with a professional baseball park. The builder built well. The ballpark's graceless corporate nomenclature aside, the ambience is such that everywhere Wilpon turned his head now, baseball was meeting with carnival to winsome effect. 
Just below him, along the interior concourse that frames the top row of seats in the stadium, vendors hawked soft ice cream, lemonade, handmade Brooklyn Italian ices, cotton candy, Brooklyn beer and Nathan's genuine Coney Island frankfurters. Lining up for these regional delicacies was a crowd that looked decidedly more like New York than the swarm of louts and swells who -- along with unseemly ticket prices -- have made the trip to Yankee or Shea Stadiums a decidedly mixed proposition for members of the metropolitan area's nonexecutive classes. With Cyclones tickets ranging from $5 to $10, here everybody could pay, and a little bit of everybody had. There were young men in do-rags, young women sporting pink hair, Girl Scout troops and their leaders, high-school lads shaded by baseball caps and yarmulkes, college students in hand-held contact with their inamorati and moms, pops and offspring aplenty. 
Wilpon said that "we don't want to trade on the Dodgers -- we want to fit into this community," and at perfunctory glance, the appearances supported the notion. It is true that to Wilpon's right the radio booth was emblazoned with the notice "Catbird Seat" in homage to that fabled vernacularist, the Dodgers broadcaster Red Barber. Down on the field, intertwined with the Cyclones "C" above the bill on their caps, the Cyclones did sport an iconic white Dodger "B." And the surfeit of advertisements painted on the outfield fences in fact included a tempting proposition from a Brooklyn haberdashery to Cyclones batsmen: "Hit This Sign . . . Win a Suit!" -- a shameless little madeleine recalling the old pledge from Abe Stark clothiers on the Ebbets Field wall. 
Another swatch of the new barrier, however, promised to remunerate a line drive off itself with a free ride for the whole ballpark on the Wonder Wheel. And right there, in vibrant illumination just beyond the fence in left field, spun the famous Ferris. There was also Astroland, the glittering arcades of Surf Avenue, and brightest of all, that Zeus of roller coasters, the Cyclone itself. To straightaway center field, Wilpon -- and his patrons -- could see strollers along the boardwalk, bathers drying out on the sand, gulls plunging from violet-hued twilight skies and sailboats bobbing in the Atlantic. Around in right was the spiffily repainted 271-foot-tall Parachute Jump tower (sans parachutes, alas). While it is true that KeySpan Park's sound system is both relentless and loud -- a craven feature of so many current professional ballparks -- Wilpon had circled the floodlights in rings of bright neon and sheltered the grandstand under enormous blue-and-yellow-striped beach umbrellas. It was, in the end, a new Coney Island amusement ballpark, and Wilpon was feeling rather proud of it.
"Where'd all these people come from?" he wondered. "They weren't here last year." Then he was riffing on baseball ("It's the American way!"), explaining that the soaring minor-league profits around the country are a function of local ownership and confessing "a father's pride" that 39-year-old Jeffrey Wilpon is the man in charge of day-to-day operations for this already lucrative first-year franchise. Wilpon was wearing a checked shirt, butter-soft black loafers and a quantity of brilliantine that swept back the hair from his tanned, lean face. His wife of 41 years, Judy, was a few feet away. Wilpon may now live in a large home on Long Island, but he still serves Dr. Brown's cream soda to his guests, maintains close boyhood friendships -- one old Brooklyn pal is Sandy Koufax -- and enjoys talking about his immigrant Jewish grandmother, who pushed a fruits-and-vegetables cart along the streets of Williamsburg; his father, who presided over a small Brooklyn funeral parlor on Coney Island Avenue; and his sister Iris's husband, Saul Katz, his partner ever since way back when they had nothing.
Yet although Wilpon is a sentimental person, he has the ears of a man who has heard a lot of requests and the ease of someone with experience in deflecting them. Wilpon is said to be seeking the better part of $500 million from the city to build the Mets a new ballpark in Queens. (His favored design resembles Ebbets Field -- with a retractable roof.) When the matter of these negotiations arose, Wilpon suddenly noted a nifty play by the Cyclones shortstop: "They pick it! I like it!" Mention of his relations with his Mets co-owner, Nelson Doubleday, which are said to be strident, produced only a garland for the Cyclones pitcher: "Hey, this kid's got pretty good stuff!" Then Guy Conti, a Mets roving minor-league instructor, stopped by to pay his respects, and Wilpon listened avidly as Conti gave impromptu talent evaluations, including testimony to the virtues of the Cyclones' most promising player, the fleet, vividly named center fielder from Puerto Rico, Angel Pagan. Two innings later, Pagan walked, stole second and third and then scored on a wild pitch, generating much jubilation below and more of the same in the owner's box.
That is the usual situation at KeySpan Park these days. All 7,500 seats sell out, the first-place Cyclones win and even when they don't, the audience seems merely ecstatic. Sometimes the play is ragged: exuberant overthrows, haphazard infielding, 55-foot fastballs and undisciplined swinging. But nobody, not even New Yorkers, it seems, heads to minor-league games expecting to see Jackie Robinson, Mike Piazza or, for that matter, Del Bissonette. (You remember Del: "The Dodgers have Del Bissonette/No meal has he ever missed yet/The question that rises/Is one that surprises/Who paid for all Del Bissonette?") 
Perhaps flawless baseball is precisely what the Cyclones fans don't wish for. They go to Brooklyn for many of the same reasons Americans all over the country now attend minor-league games in greater profusion than at any time since the 1940's, the glory days of bush-league ball. There are the KeySpan Park sight lines -- not a bad or distant view in the house. There is harmless between-innings fun, like the dizzy bat race. There is the opportunity to glimpse up close -- and maybe even chat with -- the Mets heroes of yore, Bobby Ojeda and Howard Johnson, who are Cyclones coaches. Best of all is the chance to see the players when their future is in doubt, when they are not wealthy, jaded and truculent but merely young athletes chasing an elusive ambition for $850 a month -- making them a lot like the people paying to see them. 
One recent evening, from their seats behind third base, Erika Warmbrunn, a Broadway stagehand, and Peter Guernsey, her stagehand boyfriend, were comparing the experience to "time traveling." 
"It's baseball in the 40's," she said, "when it really was America's game. A-Rod strikes out, and he's still guaranteed how many tens of thousands of dollars per at-bat? Here, a kid strikes out, and somebody who's watching says, 'That's it for him,' and the kid is gone. That's drama. That's real life. All that, and look where we're sitting for eight bucks." 
A few yards away, in the Cyclones dugout, was Bobby Ojeda, who went 18-5 pitching for the world-champion 1986 Mets. Eight years before that, he spent a New York-Penn League summer in Elmira, where he made $500 a month and was losing weight eating hot dogs every day and "sleeping in hotels named after somebody's dog."
"But I remember the realization 'I'm being paid for this!"' he said. "It was a special, special time." Most former major leaguers of Ojeda and Howard Johnson's pedigree would rather be driving a golf cart than riding the Class A buses again, but Ojeda lives close by, in New Jersey, has higher aspirations in baseball and recognizes that he is the human analogue to this version of minor-league ball; literally Class A but more truly First-Class-A. The well-appointed big-city ballpark and the proximity to Shea Stadium make a man feel better about his chances of "chasing a dream," as Ojeda calls the majors. "These kids were here at the right place at the right time," he says. "This is as good as it gets at this level."
Angel Pagan would agree. Pagan spent last summer in Kingsport, Tenn., and began this one at an upper-level Mets Class A team in Columbia, S.C. He was hitting .300 and felt, therefore, somewhat aggrieved when Guy Conti told him the Mets wanted him to go down and play center field for Brooklyn. But the next time Conti encountered Pagan, even though the 20-year-old was sleeping on a cot in a temporarily converted classroom at a Catholic school in Bay Ridge, he now pleaded to stay where he was. "I love it here, and I don't want to move," Pagan was saying now while signing autographs for an eager throng beside the dugout. "Last year in Kingsport, there were 1,000 people a night. Here there are 7,500 a night. In Kingsport, you just see trees. Here, there's lots of things." Most of Pagan's roommates shuttle between their dormitory rooms and the ballpark, spending spare time doodling on the school chalkboards, but two weeks into the season, Pagan had ridden the Cyclone and explored a little of Coney Island. "Last year, my mother sent me Latin food Express Mail," he says, "but there are Latin restaurants on Mermaid Avenue. Tonight I had pork, rice and beans -- my favorite." 
What is revelation for Ojeda and Pagan is rediscovery for Eddy Rosenthal. Rosenthal is a Brooklyn warehouse distributor who went to Ebbets Field as a child, and he thinks the Cyclones are "the best thing that ever happened to Brooklyn." 
"When we were young, the place was mobbed," Eddie says. "It was a carnival on the side streets. There were booths and games and fortunetellers and fireworks. We'd walk on the boardwalk. Then the neighborhood changed, and it got dangerous. You didn't want to go on the boardwalk anymore."
At the turn of the century, Coney Island was the real crossroads of the world, and its millions of shimmering lights were the first sight of America for arriving European immigrants. In 1897, a Brooklyn entrepreneur named George Tilyou opened Steeplechase Park, the first Coney amusement city, and soon there was Luna Park and then Dreamland, places so fantastic in their design -- a luxurious hotel shaped like an elephant was just the start of it -- that Coney became the physical symbol of the American machine age. Everybody went. In the famed Weegee photograph taken in July 1940, there are a million people on the beach. Yet television, automobiles, shifting demographics and changing public tastes gradually obviated the big Brooklyn amusement parks. The neighborhood became dangerous, with bodies washing up on the beach and gunshots punctuating the evening air that once had been filled with calliope music. 
Now, with his new stadium, Fred Wilpon was explaining that he hoped to use the minor-league baseball revival to inspire a Coney Island revival. "I used to come here with my father," he said. "We've tried to integrate the Coney Island we knew and what we know Coney Island will be. The reason for this location, aside from the fact that it's beautiful, was the need for a first-class attraction people could come to with the family at reasonable prices and have safe, attractive fun. It has all the infrastructure. It'll become a vital community again. When the redevelopment of 42nd Street was conceived, they said it couldn't be done. Look at 42nd Street now! I know this area, and I know the potential."
A five-minute walk down Surf Avenue from the ballpark, at his continuously running freak show, Dick Zigun was willing to believe that Fred Wilpon just might be a sort of George Tilyou for the Disney era, an impresario who understood the pleasure-seeking tastes of his time in a way that would once again lure crowds to the Brooklyn shore. Zigun operates the annual Mermaid Parade and the nonprofit concern Coney Island USA, headquartered in his musty little sideshow gallery of sword swallowers and bed-of-nails acts. "Financially, we haven't seen any change yet," he says. "But in terms of people's impression of Coney Island, there is already a significant change."
Not everybody has been persuaded. Kevin Baker, the author of "Dreamland," a novel set at turn-of-the-century Coney Island, and the leader of historical tours of the area, says he believes that Fred Wilpon is the beneficiary of "corporate welfare," a man making a profit that was handed to him by a lame-duck mayor concerned with ballpark legacies. "Nobody consulted the public about whether we'd like to pay for these new ballparks," he says. "They're great, but what do people who don't go to the games get? A tax bill. And New Yorkers who do go are being double-taxed because they have to pay for their seats. It's a Coney Island scam."
The most prominent student of the financial effect of ballparks on their surrounding neighborhoods is a Harvard-trained Smith College economist named Andrew Zimbalist, the editor, with Roger Noll, of "Sports, Jobs and Taxes." Zimbalist says that while it is reasonable for a community to claim there are "cultural benefits" to having a minor-league stadium in its midst, "there is simply no economic argument for the city as a whole to subsidize a ballpark at Coney Island on economic grounds."
Naturally, Mayor Giuliani considers this the worst sort of prevarication. "Andrew Zimbalist is Castro's economist," he says. "He does not understand a capitalist economy." The point, the mayor explains, is that the ballpark "allows people to rediscover Coney Island. It's a way of showing off Coney Island so people come back for other things besides baseball." As to why there was no referendum for taxpayers to say whether or not they wanted to build Fred Wilpon and George Steinbrenner these new minor-league ballparks, the mayor's answer is: "Because they would have voted it down. That's why you need a leader. Somebody who has some vision." His legacy, he says, will be forging "the anchor of the economic redevelopment of two neighborhoods that desperately need it."
In the sleek Fifth Avenue skyscraper where his company, Sterling Equities, keeps its headquarters, Fred Wilpon considered this modern phenomenon of municipalities building ballparks for team owners to use in private enterprise. "I know what economists say," Wilpon said, "but I also know what the history is when baseball teams vacate a city." It was then suggested to him that, in this case, nobody was leaving. The minor-league teams, in fact, seemed to want nothing more than to come to New York. Wasn't the city needlessly paying for him to turn a profit? Couldn't he have built his own ballpark and still made out fine? Wouldn't he maybe even have forgone some of the profits just for the satisfaction of helping out the old neighborhood? 
Wilpon was on his way to a meeting. Pausing in his building's Italian marble lobby, he stood there, in a pinstriped bespoke suit stitched for him by a tailor who has also outfitted several presidents, and considered his motives with the Cyclones. Since this is baseball today, they are a mingle of pleasures and profits. "It wasn't all money," he said. "I have a passion for this. I would have done it if I knew we'd break even." Then he mused: "If I knew we'd lose money, would I have done it? Probably. Yes. On an emotional basis, not on a business basis."

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS; 
Gabrielle Trebat, James Ryan Jr.

 BODY:
Gabrielle Louise Trebat, the daughter of Margaret and Thomas Trebat of Westport, Conn., was married there yesterday to James Anthony Ryan Jr., a son of Priscilla Ryan and Dr. James Ryan of Washington. The Rev. Allen Novotny, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at the Assumption Church. 
 Ms. Trebat, 27, will keep her name. She is an associate at the Council on Competitiveness, a nonpartisan economic policy research institute in Washington. She graduated from Duke University and received a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia. Her father is a managing director for economic and market analysis at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. Her mother teaches mathematics at Fairfield High School in Connecticut. 
 Mr. Ryan, 37, is the chief counsel and director of floor policy for Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the assistant majority leader and Senate Democratic whip. The bridegroom graduated from Loyola College in Maryland, in Baltimore, and received a law degree from the Catholic University of America. His mother is a real estate agent with W. C. & A. N. Miller in Washington. His father is a psychoanalyst in Washington.
The couple met on Capitol Hill in the fall of 1995. Mr. Ryan was working for Senator Reid, and Ms. Trebat was working for Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. They would chat when they ran into each other in the halls of the Hart Senate Office Building. But both were in relationships at the time.
By 1997, however, they were both single, and Mr. Ryan asked Ms. Trebat out.
"It was a great date," Ms. Trebat remembered. "I felt immediately comfortable with him. We had a lot in common professionally. He is also quick-witted and made me laugh, which is very important."
But Ms. Trebat had arranged to begin graduate studies at Columbia in a month and a half, and so the couple began a long-distance relationship. Mr. Ryan ultimately made plans to join her after the senatorial election of 1998. 
"I was literally on the train on my way up to New York to look for a place to live, when I got a call from Senator Reid," Mr. Ryan remembered. "He told me he had been elected whip, and offered me the opportunity to serve with him." After talking to Ms. Trebat over the weekend, Mr. Ryan accepted the offer and the couple continued their long-distance relationship.
But Mr. Ryan never gave up hope that they would one day live in the same city again.
"I was looking for some reason to convince Gabrielle to move back to Washington." he said. Then, in the summer of 2000, Vice President Al Gore selected Mr. Lieberman to be his running mate.
"I called the Lieberman office, and they invited me back to work with the staff, and I accepted," Ms. Trebat said. "I did it half out of love for Jimmy and half out of loyalty for Lieberman," she said, adding, "I knew the campaign job would be temporary -- only a couple of months -- but I stayed in Washington for love."

A New Threat to the President's Agenda: The Tax Cut

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE way President Bush and his allies on Capitol Hill had it figured, passing a big tax cut would do more than score political points and boost the weakened economy. It would also take much of the projected budget surplus off the table, therefore imposing fiscal discipline on Congress and depriving the Democrats of the oxygen that sustains them in the battles over the size of government.
 Democrats are indeed gasping. They are already warning that Congress will face painful tradeoffs when it returns from its summer recess next month and begins wrangling in earnest with Mr. Bush over next year's spending bills and the array of policy choices within them. 
 But Mr. Bush cannot breathe freely, either. Just two months after he signed it into law, the tax cut that once seemed an unalloyed triumph now threatens to complicate the rest of his agenda and expose him to political peril.
From his plans for modernizing the military and developing a national missile defense to his aspirations of becoming the education president and tackling long-term issues like Social Security, Mr. Bush might have trouble paying the tab. At the same time, he has left himself open to accusations from Democrats that the tax cut will plunge the government back into budget deficits of a sort.
The buffer left in the surplus following his tax cut appears to be eroding rapidly because of the flagging economy. Both Congress and the White House will update their surplus projections by the end of the month. It is possible the new figures will show the budget in the current fiscal year dipping into money that Democrats and most Republicans had considered off limits -- the excess revenues being generated by Medicare. 
Raiding Medicare, as the Democrats put it, would be a tricky enough charge for the White House to deal with. But it could get worse. Within a year or two, the government may again start spending the Social Security surplus, breaching a bulwark against fiscal irresponsibility agreed to by both parties and the administration.
Already, Democrats have settled on the line of argument they intend to stress as they head toward next year's midterm elections: Mr. Bush squandered the surplus, endangered the pillars of the social welfare system and blew an opportunity to address a host of pressing national problems -- all in order to pay for a tax cut for the rich.
But Mr. Bush's vulnerability does not end there. With money tight, he now faces difficulty making good on the expensive promises at the heart of his own platform, risking disappointment for supporters with priorities beyond the tax cut. 
"The same people who said the tax cut would stop the Democrats' plans for universal preschool and a big school construction initiative are somehow stunned now to realize that there's also no money for the defense buildup or the missile defense plans they thought were in the bag with a Republican president," said Gene Sperling, President Bill Clinton's economic policy advisor.
NO one at the White House, however, seems to have any regrets over the size of the tax cut. Administration officials say the best way to ensure a bright fiscal future and give the nation maximum flexibility to address its problems is to promote a strong economy. The best way to strengthen the economy, they say, is to cut taxes.
"An argument can be made, at least until economic growth returns, that the tax cut should have been bigger," said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the Office of Management and Budget.
If the budget squeeze forces Congress to cut back on what the administration considers wasteful or duplicative government programs to make room for Mr. Bush's initiatives, he said, all the better.
"If the lower surpluses stop the appropriators from spending more money, as they've done the last three or four years, and if the tax cuts help the economy, then it's a double win," said Richard E. May, a former Republican staff director for the House Budget Committee.
But history suggests it is difficult to kill programs and rein in spending, even with a budget-cutting Republican in the White House. Mr. Bush has already been rebuffed -- even by his own party -- for proposing in his budget this year that Congress slash hometown pork-barrel projects that are dear to legislators of all stripes. 
Moreover, some Republican strategists say there are already rumblings of concern from within the party about whether the administration bet too heavily on the tax cut.
If the tax cut pays off with an economic rebound and a contented electorate, they say, Mr. Bush will have won even if his other initiatives suffer. But, they say, without a strong economy, he will be on the defensive, forced to defend the tax cut as more important than providing retirees with affordable prescription drug coverage, improving schools and overhauling Social Security. 
"The Republican Party in the year 2001 lives and dies, eats and breathes by the tax cut," said Marshall Wittmann, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research organization. "If the tax cuts don't lead to a brighter economic future, then all the broken promises come back to haunt them."
The most acute problem for Mr. Bush so far has been with military spending. He has already been forced to limit his request for additional money for the Pentagon next year to a level far lower than the military had been led to believe would be available. And now that request -- for $18 billion more than he asked for early this year, a total of $329 billion -- might be more than Congress can finance without slashing spending in other areas.
Some conservatives have openly accused Mr. Bush of betraying his commitment to a strong national defense, undermining what until now has been solid support for the president from his party's right.
But Mr. Bush could also face problems in his efforts to stake out a place in the political center on issues like education and health care. The education bills that Mr. Bush is pushing through Congress call for spending increases larger than what the budget can accommodate without cutting something else.
Should the surplus continue to shrink, Congress could have difficulty paying for one of its most ambitious goals, establishing a program to help retirees cover the cost of prescription medicines. And Mr. Bush's plans for overhauling Social Security and rewriting the tax code, key elements of his effort to cast himself as a reformer, would become that much more difficult.
"Defense is a harbinger of problems to come in other parts of the budget," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
"There may be very conservative elements within the Bush administration who are content to have a tight budget so they have an answer to everyone who has an idea that costs money," he said. "But there's a big risk that a lot of this will come back to haunt him, and will limit his freedom of action."

HEADLINE: Harkin and Lugar Join Forces to Take on Farm Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Patching up a bitter disagreement over how much emergency aid to give farmers this year, the ranking members of the Senate Agriculture Committee are joining forces to draft a 10-year farm bill they can both support.
 Their main goal is to rein in subsidies to large farmers that date to the Depression and to emphasize land conservation and other environmental incentives instead. 
 Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa, the Democratic chairman of the committee, and Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the ranking Republican, said in interviews that they opposed a bill drafted in the House.
They said the House approach was mired in old, failed methods of supporting farmers. If the full Senate adopted their approach instead, it would set up a major policy debate this fall. 
At issue is whether the huge $171.1 billion farm bill will continue to focus on subsidies for large farmers who grow basic crops like cotton, corn and wheat, as in the House measure, or whether the money will be spread to promote trade, conservation efforts, rural development and environmental protection, as in the proposed Senate bill.
In the debate last week over how much emergency aid to give to farmers, Mr. Lugar prevailed over Mr. Harkin, who wanted to spend more than the Bush administration and the House wanted to spend. Faced with a threatened veto by President Bush, Mr. Harkin and his allies in the Democratic leadership backed down.
But Mr. Harkin said that argument was a "bump in the road" compared with the fight over the 10-year farm bill that is still to come. And in the next round, he and Mr. Lugar expect to be on the same side. "Even though we come from different starting points, we're ending up at the same place," Mr. Harkin said. 
Their common goal is to counter the bill written by members of the two parties in the House, where a committee passed its comprehensive farm bill last month, a year ahead of time, in the hopes of securing money for farmers over the next several years before dwindling federal surpluses dry up.
Senator Harkin said his committee would have its version ready for debate by the end of September. 
The House committee's bill is supported by the powerful farmers' lobbies. But the Senate bill, as tentatively outlined by Mr. Harkin and Mr. Lugar, may find an unexpected ally in the Agriculture Department, which will present its own farm policy in September.
Secretary of Agriculture Ann M. Veneman has made increased trade her focus, arguing that American farmers would improve their lot by reaching more of the global market.
In the name of open trade, she has appeared willing to limit federal farm payments, telling the World Trade Organization in June that more than $10 billion in farm subsidies in the 1998 to 1999 marketing year were "trade distorting." 
Representative Larry Combest, Republican of Texas and the Agriculture Committee chairman, shot back that Ms. Veneman's attitude was the "equivalent to a unilateral disarmament that cedes ground and gains nothing in return."
But Mr. Lugar said that the bill Mr. Combest's committee produced was misguided. "It's mostly a division of the spoils for the major commodity crop producers," Senator Lugar said. "Many of the safety nets we already have for farmers actually stimulate overproduction and depress prices." 
Senator Harkin, too, criticized what he called the "blind" continuation of subsidies. "I'm questioning whether we should continue to support every bushel, bale and pound that's being produced in this country," he said. "We've got an abundance of production."
Mr. Combest said his approach would avoid depending on imported food. "I never want to get in a situation where we depend on foreign food like we depend on foreign energy," he said. 
But some agricultural economists believe the food security argument has been stretched too far. "If you're really a market-oriented economist, it would be much better to just phase these subsidy programs out because the subsidies are so huge they distort the market," Prof. Bruce Gardner of the University of Maryland said.
In figures released this week, the Agriculture Department reported that farm income will reach a record high of $61 billion in 2001 and that land prices have risen by 4.6 percent in the last year. 
To Mr. Lugar and Mr. Harkin, that is evidence that more can be spent on conservation and the environment.

HEADLINE: William Jefferson Bush 

 BODY:
George W. Bush's speech about stem cell research last week was a wonder. There was a paragraph for every listener. Until the president announced, at the very end of the address, that he had decided to support funding for stem cell research under extremely limited circumstances, advocates of every possible option probably believed he was preparing to come down on their side. It was a little like one of those old movies in which the detective explains why each person in the room might be the guilty party before dramatically pointing to the true culprit.
 The substance of Mr. Bush's decision may not do much for stem cell research. There aren't likely to be enough cells available under his narrow regulations to give this promising avenue of research the government support it needs. But Americans who do not regularly worry about the population of stem cell lines will probably feel the president made a reasonable compromise. 
 Mr. Bush, whose thoughts about his decision appear on the opposite page, is turning out to be a skilled triangulator. Like Bill Clinton before him, he has developed a gift for wriggling out of controversies by seizing the initiative and creating a third option. In the case of stem cell research, and earlier in the fight over the patients' bill of rights, Mr. Bush was confronted by a popular cause that was anathema to important blocs of his supporters. Instead of fighting, or collapsing, he cobbled a plan of his own that had a surface resemblance to the original but eliminated the things his base most disliked.
The president's supporters might rightly point out that this is exactly what political leaders are supposed to do. His opponents might then retort that the Republicans weren't all that impressed when Bill Clinton was the one doing the trick.
The similarities between our current president and his predecessor are becoming striking, but they go only so far. Certainly Mr. Bush's supporters aren't loudly sighing with exasperation the way liberal Democrats did when Mr. Clinton defused a crisis by co-opting the Republican position. Perhaps that's because Mr. Bush's forays to the center have been mainly cosmetic. He is the master of the bipartisan photo opportunity.
Bill Clinton's greatest triumph came at the very beginning of his administration, when he managed to ram a tax hike through Congress. That may not have been the sole cause of the boom that followed, but it certainly helped. Mr. Bush got his tax bill through, too, and his own presidency may well rise or fall on what that massive reduction in federal revenue does to the economy.
Despite his skills, Mr. Clinton failed to achieve much of his agenda beyond those early tax increases. He was, of course, hobbled by an epic run of personal scandals. It's hard to imagine that Mr. Bush can match that string of disasters. But since the tax cut, Bush initiatives seem to have undergone miniaturization, evolving from dramatic overhauls to mere tweaks as they moved through Congress. Privatization of Social Security may turn out to be the issue that proves that Mr. Bush has a second act -- unless it becomes his own version of the Clinton health care plan.
Mr. Bush may not be imitating Mr. Clinton so much as responding to the same stimuli. American voters are not very interested in politics, and they have little patience for partisan bickering. The best way for a president to remain popular is to look as if he's taking the road that rises above it all.

HEADLINE: A Makeover for Cuban-Americans 

 BODY:
A little reform proved too much for nearly two dozen of the most hard-line board members of the Cuban American National Foundation. They angrily resigned last week, protesting the conservative exile group's efforts to moderate its image, however tepid those efforts may be. The conflict within the Miami-based foundation that has long been influential in setting United States policy toward Cuba reflects a broader and healthy debate taking place within the Cuban-American community. That debate may eventually make it possible to set aside misguided policies intended to hasten Fidel Castro's departure from power that have had the opposite effect. 
 The Elian Gonzalez saga helped expose the extremism of Florida's Cuban-American political leadership. People who view the cold war as history and not a daily struggle were appalled at the effort to keep Elian, the young Cuban refugee, from his father. Cuban-Americans who have never lived in the country their parents fled find it hard to match the older generation's inflexible zeal. They are less concerned about the struggle against Mr. Castro and more concerned about their role in American society and opportunities in a post-Communist Cuba. 
 A backlash against the older generation's intransigence is also starting to be felt in Washington. At a time when America touts increased commerce as a moderating influence on China's Communists and other repressive regimes, the unyielding approach to Cuba is anchored in outdated domestic political calculations. These center on the assumption that Cuban-Americans are a monolithic community that shuns all contact with Cuba. The fact that this assumption is no longer true should lead to the re-examination of outdated policies. Already farm-state Republicans support selling food to Cuba. The House of Representatives recently voted to lift the ban on travel to the island, and President Bush has decided not to carry out the provision of the Helms-Burton Act that would penalize third parties for trading with Cuba. 
The Cuban American National Foundation, now led by Jorge Mas Santos, the American-born, 38-year-old son of its founder, Jorge Mas Canosa, has been trying to soften its image in this changing climate. Even symbolic moves have caused an uproar among old believers, such as his lobbying for Miami to host the Latin Grammy Awards ceremony next month. The older generation of exile leaders resisted endorsing any event that could provide a forum for Castro-approved artists, but Mr. Mas Santos rightly noted that it is Communist Cuba, not the United States, that opposes freedom of expression. Some of his father's collaborators have also been irritated by Mr. Mas Santos's efforts to reach out to Democratic politicians. 
Despite these moves, the foundation remains a powerful advocate for a toughening of the economic embargo and other counterproductive policies. The foundation's tentative steps toward the center may show a willingness to adapt to an ever more pluralistic Cuban-American community. But the group must go further, and reverse some of its more fundamental policies, if it is to help free Cuba from its dictatorship.

HEADLINE: Rigid Rules Will Damage Schools 

BYLINE:  By Thomas J. Kane and Douglas O. Staiger; Thomas J. Kane is a professor of policy studies and economics at the University of California at Los Angeles. Douglas O. Staiger is an associate professor of economics at Dartmouth. Both are associates at the National Bureau of Economic Research.

 BODY:
As school was about to let out this summer, both houses of Congress voted for a dramatic expansion of the federal role in the education of our children. A committee is at work now to bring the two bills together, but whatever the specific result, the center of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act will be identifying schools that are not raising test scores fast enough to satisfy the federal government and then penalizing or reorganizing them. Once a school has failed to clear the new federal hurdle, the local school district will be required to intervene.
 The trouble with this law in the making is that both the House and Senate versions would disrupt successful reforms that are already under way in many schools around the country. Unless Congress can agree to rewrite the formula for pinpointing a failing school, as some states and some members of Congress are now urging, this education bill -- the most ambitious federal initiative in education in three decades and a centerpiece of President Bush's plans for his presidency -- is likely to end as a fiasco. 
 The central flaw is that both versions of this bill place far too much emphasis on year-to-year changes in test scores. Under either, every school in America would have to generate an increase in test scores each and every year or face penalties like having to allow its students to transfer to another public school, being converted into a charter school or being taken over by a private contractor.
However, the path to improved performance is rarely a straight line. Because the average elementary school has only 68 children in each grade, a few bright kids one year or a group of rowdy friends the next can cause fluctuations in test performance even if a school is on the right track.
Chance fluctuations are a typical problem in tracking trends, as the federal government itself recognizes in gathering other kinds of statistics. The best way to keep them from causing misinterpretations of the overall picture is to use a large sample. The Department of Labor, for example, tracks the performance of the labor market with a phone survey of 60,000 households each month. Yet now Congress is proposing to track the performance of the typical American elementary school with a sample of students in each grade that is only a thousandth of that size.
With our colleague Jeffrey Geppert of Stanford, we studied the test scores in two states that have done well, investigating how their schools would have fared under the proposed legislation. Between 1994 and 1999, North Carolina and Texas were the envy of the educational world, achieving increases of 2 to 5 percentage points every year in the proportion of their students who were proficient in reading and math. However, the steady progress at the state level masked an uneven, zigzag pattern of improvement at the typical school. Indeed, we estimate that more than 98 percent of the schools in North Carolina and Texas would have failed to live up to the proposed federal expectation in at least one year between 1994 and 1999. At the typical school, two steps forward were often followed by one step back.
More than three-quarters of the schools in North Carolina and Texas would have been required to offer public school options to their students if either version of the new education bill had been in effect. Under the Senate bill a quarter of the schools in both states would have been required to restructure themselves sometime in those five years -- by laying off most of their staffs, becoming public charter schools or turning themselves over to private operators. Under the more stringent House bill, roughly three-quarters of the schools would have been required to restructure themselves.
Both bills would be particularly harsh on racially diverse schools. Each school would be expected to achieve not only an increase in test scores for the school as a whole, but increases for each and every racial or ethnic group as well. Because each group's scores fluctuate depending upon the particular students being tested each year, it is rare to see every group's performance moving upward in the same year. Black and Latino students are more likely than white students to be enrolled in highly diverse schools, so their schools would be more likely than others to be arbitrarily disrupted by a poorly designed formula.
Over the past decade, many states have invested in their own systems for improving school performance -- sometimes with incentives as well as penalties: for instance, California is expecting to spend $677 million this year on bonuses for schools and teachers showing the greatest improvement, as measured primarily through test scores. States have taken a wide variety of approaches to using test scores to rate schools: some look at changes in test scores from one year to the next, some adjust for entering students' test performance, some require schools to achieve a minimum percentage of proficiency in a given year. There is no agreement yet on which system is most effective in encouraging schools to focus on student performance. Until such a consensus develops, it would be foolish to cut short the state experimentation and impose a single federal formula.
Congress can still pass effective legislation to create more accountability in education. But the present bills need changing.
States should be allowed to continue to develop their own rating systems for schools, using school test scores, while being required to take specific actions within five years in some minimum percentage of schools. States with the lowest scores on a nationally comparable test, like the National Assessment of Educational Progress, should be required to take action in a higher percentage of their schools than the states with better performance.
Schools should have to report the test performance of students in each racial and ethnic group, but sanctions based on one group's performance should be withheld until there is real evidence that disadvantaged minority students are being allowed to lag behind. The secretary of education should develop a way to determine this with statistically justifiable methods.
In their current bills, the House and Senate have set a very high bar -- so high that it is likely that virtually all school systems would be found to be inadequate, with many schools failing. And if that happens, the worst schools would be lost in the crowd. The resources and energy required to reform them would probably be dissipated. For these schools, a poorly designed federal rule can be worse than no rule at all.

New visibility for 1998 copyright protection law, with online enthusiasts confused and frustrated.

BYLINE:  By Amy Harmon 

 BODY:
CALL it the digital copyright equivalent of having your cake but not being able to eat it. The case of Dmitri Sklyarov, a Russian computer programmer arrested last month in Las Vegas, is drawing attention to a double bind in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 law that some legal experts say extends rights to consumers even as it effectively prevents them from exercising those rights. 
 The law of which Mr. Sklyarov ran afoul makes it illegal to manufacture or distribute a device designed to bypass technology that protects copyright material. His offense was to develop software that can disable the safeguards that are supposed to prevent electronic books from being distributed en masse over the Internet. 
 The law also makes it illegal for individuals to use such a program -- even to make a back-up copy of a book or movie or song for themselves, the type of copies traditionally allowed under copyright law. That is where the double bind comes in. Actually making such copies for personal use is not illegal. But it is against the law to break through the copy-protection measure to make the legal copies. 
If this seems confusing, it confuses others, including Representative Rick Boucher, a Virginia Democrat and longtime critic of the law. Mr. Boucher has said he plans to introduce legislation that would eliminate the double bind.
Even under the law, there is an explicit exception to the rules. Congress, concerned about the negative effect that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act might have on consumers' ability to make legal copies, asked the Library of Congress to make regular reports on the law's effect. Last fall, Congress adopted the library's recommendation that when the copyright safeguards malfunction on "literary works, including computer programs and databases," that an individual has legally purchased, the person be allowed to use technology like the software Mr. Sklyarov developed to regain reading access to the work.
The Library of Congress is now considering whether to recommend other exceptions to the law. Many libraries and other educational institutions want an exception that would let individuals circumvent a copy-control technology in order to copy portions of a work for use in parody, scholarship or criticism -- purposes protected under the "fair use" doctrine of traditional copyright law.
In the same spirit, Mr. Boucher's legislation would make circumvention illegal only if the primary purpose was to violate copyrights. 
A question, of course, is how anyone would ever be able to obtain and use the tools that would legally allow them to circumvent copy-protection technology if the people that make and distribute them are thrown in jail or prosecuted in civil trials. 
"If you can't go out and buy a device like this, it makes the ability to exercise your rights under the exception very, very difficult," said Laura Gasaway, director of the Law Library at the University of North Carolina. Ms. Gasaway's experience with a faulty access-control measure on a CD-ROM database helped persuade the Library of Congress to recommend the exception for malfunctioning technology.
While some users of digital media have wrestled with the 1998 copyright law's seeming contradictions, it is the Sklyarov case -- the first criminal prosecution under the law -- that is exposing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to greater public scrutiny. 
Marybeth Peters, the chief of the United States Copyright Office, said that the exception was still meaningful, even without a market for anti-circumvention devices, because it allowed individuals to figure out for themselves how to go around a technological control measure. 
"Many of the people I know can come up with a program to do it themselves, without being in the business of doing it," Ms. Peters said. 
But Roger Sperberg, an e-book enthusiast, said that he could not determine how to regain access to several electronic books he had bought after a virus swept through his PC. The e-book software allows him to "activate" the books on only two computers. But he had already used one, on his desktop computer. If he activates the books again on this same computer -- as the virus has made necessary -- he says he will not be able to reactivate them for use on his hand-held e-book device. 
"I hate being treated like I'm a professional thief," said Mr. Sperberg, who wrote a column about his situation for Ebookweb, a site devoted to discussion of electronic books. "I'm allowed to figure it out on my own, but no one is allowed to sell me a program? Why?"
Allan Adler, vice president for legal and governmental affairs at the Association of American Publishers, has an explanation. "There is no device that can distinguish between a fair use and a non-fair use," Mr. Adler said. "So unfortunately we're still stuck with a situation where people feel they've been given the go-ahead to circumvent the access controls, but they don't have the means to do it."
ElcomSoft, the company in Moscow for which Mr. Sklyarov works, sold its e-book circumvention software over the Internet for $99. The company said the product was aimed at consumers who wanted to make backups or to read books on several computers.
But ElcomSoft withdrew the product after being threatened with legal action by Adobe Systems, whose encryption technology is compromised by the program. Adobe complained to the Justice Department, which led to Mr. Sklyarov's arrest at a hackers' conference in Las Vegas. Released on bail last week in San Jose, Calif., Mr. Sklyarov is awaiting an arraignment hearing on Aug. 23. 
Given the fledgling market for e-books, the number of consumers who have had occasion to legally circumvent flawed access controls is no doubt tiny. And those who would have paid $99 for the privilege may be tinier still. But there is certainly no shortage of malfunctioning technology when it comes to digital media. 
Shoshana Samole, 29, of San Francisco, would have appreciated the right to find and use an anti-circumvention device during the 20 hours or so she recently spent tinkering with rental DVD movies, trying to get them to play in her computer's DVD drive. 
Ms. Samole has often watched movies on the same computer. But "Fight Club" would not play. Nor would "Boogie Nights." The video store could not help her. Her computer maker wanted $25 for a technical support call. And she could find no fixes on the Internet -- perhaps because in a civil trial last year, a federal judge found that distributing an anti-circumvention program for DVD's violated the 1998 law. 
Ms. Samole said she ended up downloading a pirated version of "Fight Club," which is how she intends to obtain her movies in the future. "I'm completely alienated," she said. "I'm never going to rent a DVD again."
Some copyright experts maintain that even without additional amendments or exceptions, there is a broader right implicit in the 1998 law -- consumers' traditional right to make limited uses of movies, books and music without the copyright holder's permission. Since, they argue, that right is based on First Amendment freedoms, these experts contend that the government may have some obligation to make sure that people can exercise it -- and not just the most technically savvy.
"The inequity is of greatest concern to the law where there's a constitutional interest at stake," said Pamela Samuelson, co-director of the Center for Law and Technology at the University of California at Berkeley. "If there is a constitutional-based interest in fair use, it shouldn't just be someone with a Ph.D. in computer science who can circumvent an access control -- just like you can't say people who own property can vote, but poor people can't."

Big Makeover for Dutch Media Data Company

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Talk about reshaping a company. Just seven years ago, VNU N.V. was a sleepy Dutch purveyor of content, through its ownership of newspapers and television stations in the Netherlands and an array of magazines across Europe. But as it watched its leading Dutch rivals, Elsevier and Wolters Kluwer, embark on global expansion programs, VNU worried that it would fall far behind. 
 "We were not as advanced as they were," VNU's chief financial officer, Frans Cremers, recalled. "We were the ugly duckling." 
 The transformation has been striking. 
Through acquisitions totaling more than $8 billion since 1994, VNU has turned itself into a leading provider of information about the media and consumers for use by media companies and advertisers. And many of its key assets are based in the United States. 
VNU now has 145 trade newspapers and magazines including Adweek, Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter. It owns Soundscan, the leader in tracking retail sales of recorded music. And the company has reunited two long-separated siblings by acquiring Nielsen Media Research, the television measurement business, and A. C. Nielsen, the giant global compiler of data on sales of packaged goods. 
VNU also owns and operates more than 90 trade shows around the world each year, and it publishes or has stakes in advertising-supported telephone directories in Europe and Latin America.
The idea, according to VNU executives, is to escape the vagaries of consumer advertising by offering businesses the types of information and services that remain in demand regardless of the economic cycle. 
VNU's business is "business intelligence and business tools," according to Gerald Hobbs, chairman and chief executive of VNU USA. 
Mr. Hobbs, who joined VNU when it bought BPI Inc., the parent of Billboard, in 1994, now oversees all the company's United States operations, which this year could represent slightly more than half of VNU's revenue of $4.7 billion euros ($4.2 billion), according to Nicola Stewart, who follows VNU for Commerzbank. As recently as 1994, 90 percent of the company's revenue came from the Netherlands 
Although VNU still has its headquarters in Haarlem, the Netherlands, its chief executive, Robert van den Bergh, spends about a week a month in the United States. 
"I am trying to build a really, truly international company, a company that has its people spread around the world," he said. "That is where the future of big companies is, being really international." 
Even so, some analysts are skeptical about the ability of the top level-management to oversee its far-flung holdings. 
"The bet on VNU is that they can make all these deals work and integrate these companies," said Michael Nathanson, who follows overseas media companies for Sanford Bernstein & Company. "The issue is that they have no proven expertise in these various industries and they are operating in a wide variety of countries." 
Mr. van den Bergh acknowledges the enormity of the task. "I am not afraid to say loudly that it is a challenge," he said. "Affinity is easy to talk about, but difficult to organize. Our main goal is that every division makes its own money and has its own goals." 
At least one insider, Michael Shallet, says that VNU has taken the right management approach. Mr. Shallet, who was a co-founder of Soundscan and is now its president, recalled a meeting of all senior managers that VNU convened last September in Cannes, France. 
"I remember thinking that they are like a quilt of federated states," said Mr. Shallet, who sold 60 percent of Soundscan to VNU in 1998 and the rest this year, for undisclosed sums. "VNU is very hands off, and they were not the kind of people who tried to inject a corporate culture here. But they were very clear on their overall goals on how the company should operate and earnings growth." 
Soundscan is part of VNU's largest unit, the marketing and media information division, which includes Nielsen Media, acquired two years ago for $2.5 billion, and A. C. Nielsen, for which VNU paid $2.5 billion earlier this year. 
As their names suggest, Nielsen Media and A. C. Nielsen were previously part of the same company, which was acquired by Dun & Bradstreet in 1987. Then in 1995, when Dun & Bradstreet split itself into three publicly traded companies, they were separated. 
For VNU, the appeal of owning both Nielsen businesses rests in their relatively predictable revenue structure. Typically, clients sign long-term agreements, sometimes as long as five years, to receive the data. 
A. C. Nielsen gets two-thirds of its revenue abroad, from clients, including Nestle and Coca-Cola, that want data on TV ratings and on packaged goods sales. Nielsen Media's revenue, meanwhile, is virtually all from clients in the United States -- broadcasters and advertisers intent on knowing how many people are watching which television programs at what time.
John A. Dimling, chief executive of Nielsen Media Research, noted that the tradition of A. C. Nielsen's focusing on the foreign markets predates the Dun & Bradstreet period. But he said the two Nielsen units now hoped to reinforce each other -- perhaps with A. C. Nielsen's adopting Nielsen Media's "more sophisticated" TV metering technology, while the two combine point-of-sale data with TV audience data in the United States and abroad. 
Steve Schmidt, A. C. Nielsen's president for the Americas, predicts that such collaboration will help consumer packaged-goods companies better understand their customers.
"You can have two shows with a five rating, but the demographic profile of the viewers might be very different," Mr. Schmidt noted. "A. C. Nielsen does a separate survey of consumer behavior in a wide number of households. If you apply that data to the data about viewers watching a program, you can help consumer packaged-goods companies target their media spending to better reach their group." 
Jon Swallen, senior vice president and co-director for media knowledge at McCann-Erickson, praises VNU for reuniting the two Nielsens because the move "has lowered the walls between market research people and the TV audience research people." 
"But VNU is late into the game," Mr. Swallen said. "It is a field that is pretty well established. Unilever, Procter & Gamble and others have already invested a lot into this research." 
And there has already been a major setback. The retailing giant Wal-Mart has decided to stop providing data on sales of products to A. C. Nielsen to keep the information proprietary. "Wal-Mart's pullback is clearly a disappointment," said Mr. Hobbs. "In the short run, it is not a significant impact. But in the long term, it is hard to tell." 
It may take time and effort to evaluate the economic payoff of VNU's acquisition binge. Investors, for now, seem skeptical. VNU's stock, which trades over-the-counter in the United States, has fallen from a 52-week high of $54.50 on Sept. 7, 2000, to a close of $34.07 last Friday. 
Some analysts also complain that the company's financial data can be hard to sort out. 
The most recent VNU financial figures were released in March 2001 and covered the full year 2000. VNU reported revenue of 3.38 billion euros (about $3 billion), a 20 percent increase from the previous year. Only in a footnote did the company indicate that 6 percent of revenue growth came from acquisitions and divestitures and 4 percent from currency transactions.
As Mr. Nathanson at Sanford Bernstein noted, "When a company is as acquisitive as they are, it is important to figure out what is organic revenue growth, by division, through the years." But Mr. Cremers, the chief financial officer, says the company has never provided anything but accurate numbers in its transformation from ugly duckling to swan. 
In any case, next month, when VNU is scheduled to report its financial results for the first half of 2001, investors and analysts will be closely watching to see how the company accounts for all the feathers.

At a time when many dot-coms are failing, Style.com opens its campaign with a flourish.

BYLINE:  By David Handelman 

 BODY:
IN a skidding economy, with dot-coms crashing left and right, one fledgling e-commerce Web site has just boldly introduced an $11 million media campaign.
 The site, Style.com, has splashy double-page ads appearing in Vogue, Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, W and 10 other major national magazines, and wrapped around copies of Women's Wear Daily at New York's coming fall fashion shows. Style.com is owned by Advance Publications, which just happens to own all the above-mentioned titles, and it is the umbrella site for Advance's fashion flagships, Vogue and W. 
 So the ballyhooed $11 million actually includes roughly $4 million in "media value" -- the price Advance would extract from outside advertisers, but not what the site actually has to spend. But the rest of the budget is quite real, and Advance is placing ads in several regional and specialized magazines it does not own, like Time Out New York, Hamptons, Angeleno and Surface. It is wrapping them around the International Herald Tribune at the European fashion shows and putting them on New York phone kiosks and billboards in Times Square and SoHo and on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. (It also is sending by direct-mail 260,000 copies of a catalog and has purchased keywords like "fashion show" from search engines like Google and MSN.) 
Devised by Badger Kry, the four ads in the campaign carry the motto "runways are everywhere" and depict models, clad in designer merchandise, in everyday New York scenarios, like one sporting a psychedelic animal-print Roberto Cavalli bikini in an Avenue C Laundromat.
Although Advance jumped into the Internet in 1995 with the popular food and travel site Epicurious.com (which later spun off travel into Concierge.com) and the less-successful romance site Swoon.com (which is about to be closed), it had long been criticized for its sluggish start developing Web sites for its franchise magazines, while other publishers like Time Warner were jumping in head first. (Glamour's site continues to seem low-priority; as of last week it still featured a welcome letter from and photograph of a former editor, Bonnie Fuller, who was deposed months ago.)
This year, just as that reluctance finally seems prescient, the company has instead moved ahead with the introduction of the New Yorker site in February, and the much more ambitious Style.com, which only took shape after Advance bought Fairchild Publications (home to W, Women's Wear Daily and Jane) in August 1999.
Style.com introduced in primitive form a year ago, added commerce in March and goes into full swing next month. It features encyclopedic coverage of fashion shows, reports on fashion trends and fashionable parties, snippets of editorial content from the magazines, and, in partnership with Neiman Marcus, a "shop" of designer apparel and accessories -- much of it featured in Vogue and W.
The site's managing director, Goli Sheikholeslami, says that Advance's Web strategy was not slow, just "not as loud as other people."
She added, "We never spent the 30 to 40 million dollars other dot-coms were spending to launch their brands."
And instead of making mere magazine companion sites, Advance focused on a long-term approach, "How to build a business that will grow, and attract the kind of audience that is attractive to advertisers."
Advertisers have included Polo.com, Banana Republic, Clairol and the Discover card.
Considering the lasting power of Vogue's own brand, the decision to create a separate identity for the Web seems unusual, though in keeping with Epicurious (the site for Gourmet and Bon Appetit). 
One reason, said Ms. Sheikholeslami, was to maintain the magazines' "editorial integrity" by keeping the commerce separate; another was to accommodate the later inclusion of other magazines, even the male GQ and Details. 
Among Style.com's 44 vendors are such names as Calvin Klein (the site's best seller), Donna Karan and Oscar de la Renta. There are also up-and-comers like Tuleh, lower price-point lines like Dolce & Gabbana and Kors and the avant-garde upstart Miguel Adrover.
Like its parent magazines, the site has to service both consumers and designers. So, unlike other fashion retail Web sites like Net-A-Porter .com and BlueFly.com, Style.com does not mark down because, Ms. Sheikholeslami said, "designers are very sensitive about it."
Ms. Sheikholeslami said the ultimate goal is for Style.com to earn half its revenue from ads and half from its commissions on sales through Neiman Marcus. But Alison Fried, general manager of the Time Warner site Instyle.com, which has a partnership with NeimanMarcus .com, says that such commerce is "a nice service to provide for consumers, but unless you have unbelievable scale, you'll never make substantial money going down that road."
Last November, Ms. Fried said, Instyle.com canceled plans for a commerce Web site. "You need millions of eyeballs, and only a small percentage of them ever actually buy." she said. "I don't believe that any magazine that's online has sufficient scale to make money that way."
For these projects, the ideal would be to have magazine pages replicated online, on which consumers could click items and purchase them, but with so many vendors that proves quite difficult to pull off. Indeed, even Style.com's ads are indicative of this problem: two of the four outfits turn out to not be available for sale on the site.

DirecTV to Expand Its Capacity
No matter who ends up owning DirecTV, Hughes Electronics is proceeding with a plan to launch the DirecTV 4S satellite, designed to more than double DirecTV's channel capacity -- to about 750 from 320 now. Just as important, special spot-beam antennas will be able to aim signals so precisely at many of the nation's largest cities that many more local TV stations can be efficiently added to the satellite service. As a result, metropolitan areas like New York and Los Angeles will have all local broadcast stations available by satellite, up from the current handfuls of stations. C4.

Slight Gain for CNN Headline News
The debut of the revamped CNN Headline News, which has been given a supposedly hipper look and a younger editorial emphasis, was not without its bumps. Critics roasted the changes, saying the information-filled screen and moving graphics were dizzying and the pop-infused background music was too intrusive. And despite a torrent of media attention about the revamping and the new anchor, Andrea Thompson, CNN Headline News's audience did not increase much in its first week. But its ratings did improve modestly. C9.

HEADLINE: Despite Reports of Brutality, Genoese Support Their Police 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: GENOA, Italy, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
An elderly priest unlocking the door of his church on the square where a young protester was shot dead by police officers three weeks ago summed up what seems to be the prevailing feeling of the Genoese in the aftermath of the recent summit meeting here.
 "Time passes," he said. 
 "There was tumult, and violence is always terrible. People are certainly upset these protesters came and burned hundreds of cars and broke windows. But you could say in a way it went well -- there was only one person killed." 
The priest, the Rev. Giovanni Timossi, pastor of Our Lady of Salvation church on Piazza Gaetano Alimonda, rushed into the street after that one person, Carlo Giuliani, 23, was shot. He wanted to give the young man last rites but was held back by security officials.
Still, like the overwhelming majority of people interviewed here this weekend, Father Timossi made clear that he felt more sympathy for the police than for the protesters -- despite widespread reports of brutality against demonstrators during the meetings July 20 to 22 of the eight major industrial nations. 
"For two days, the police were attacked, offended, pelted with stones," he said. Finally, "frustrated and depressed, they did what they had to do."
In front of the church, there is a makeshift shrine for Mr. Giuliani: a pile of floral bouquets, mostly dead now, alongside poems, news clippings, pictures of Bob Marley and Che Guevara. Several young backpackers were looking these over this afternoon, along with a local man, Pietro Giammona, 42. His 4 1/2-year-old daughter, Francesca, was there with him, drawing a picture on which her father had written, "To Carlo, from Francesca."
"We should leave a sign here, otherwise it will all be forgotten," Mr. Giammona said. He said he had not thought much about economic or industrial globalization one way or the other before the meeting, but had joined the protests in anger over what he saw as police overreaction. "Some people care," he said.
A number of protesters are still in jail, including Susanna Thomas of New Jersey, a student at Bryn Mawr. Her case is to be reviewed Monday at a court hearing where she is to appear with 3 other Americans and 16 Austrians, part of a group that performs street theater as protest.
The Genoa police chief has acknowledged that excessive force was used in some cases, and three top officers have been removed. The worst reports came out of a local preschool, where a number of apparently nonviolent protesters had been staying. In the middle of the night, 92 demonstrators sleeping at the school were dragged from their beds, beaten and taken to jail.
"They were definitely on a punitive mission here," Luca Cerbo, 38, said in front of the preschool. Mr. Cerbo blamed the center-right government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, which was elected this spring: "We wanted this government, and now we got it."
A parliamentary inquiry into the protests and the violence and at least half a dozen criminal investigations are under way. But many here say they do not need official reports.
Fabrizio Margiotta, 37, who runs a newsstand on Piazza Verdi, said he only faults the police for not intervening sooner. "This was real, true guerrilla warfare," he said. 
Franco Guazzini, 52, who watched looting from his window, said: "I can't believe it's the police who are on trial. I love Genoa, and suffered a lot to see it so beautiful, all dressed up and ready to welcome our important guests, and then to hear everyone in the world speaking of Genoa in this terrible way."
Though an estimated $20 million in damage was done, surprisingly few traces remain: some graffiti, a few broken windows. The ancient port itself looks almost like a movie set, with new wooden benches, freshly potted plants and bright facades painted onto old buildings.
Some tourists said they had come specifically to see how the city had come through the riots. "In fact, it's much more beautiful now" than before Italy spent $100 million sprucing up Genoa for the summit meeting, said Linetta Passalacqua of Parma, who was sitting with her grown son near the fountains in front of Palazzo Ducale, where the meetings was held.
Roberto Atzei, who lives on Corso Torino, where the worst of the rioting occurred, said most of his neighbors had already begun to put the unpleasantness behind them. "The Genoese are strong and not easily moved," said Mr. Atzei, who works in a hospital pharmacy.
Even Piazza Tommaseo, where businesses were heavily damaged, is mostly clean today, though still marked with graffiti in English declaring "Vegan Power" and "Disorder Is a Must!"
A man who owns a sandwich shop there said he saw the summit meeting as a disaster for small-business owners like himself. He boarded up his store and stayed away. But "all the other windows on the piazza were smashed," he said. "People are really upset because the police had orders not to do anything, and by the time they were allowed to advance, the damage was done." He too feels terrible for the police.
At a police station around the corner, an officer at the front desk said he and his colleagues had not really known what to do when a crowd of protesters marched on the building, throwing rocks and a Molotov cocktail.
"Even if there were excesses, and probably there were, it's the police who are suffering now," said the 40-year-old officer, who would not give his name.
When protesters appeared outside the station, "At first we just got out of the way," he said, smiling a little sheepishly. "Then we put on helmets and bulletproof vests and stood outside. They were throwing stones this big!" he said, holding his hands to indicate rocks the size of salad plates. 
"These weren't peaceful demonstrations, or even demonstrations against globalization," the officer said. "I myself have strong feelings that third world debt should be forgiven -- but these protesters didn't solve anything by ruining what some other people had worked a lifetime to build. How does attacking a market address globalization?"
He described many of those arrested as spoiled children of the bourgeoisie. When they were arrested, he said, they cried, " 'My father is such-and-such, a respected person,' then we'd find gas masks in their backpacks." 
Then the officer picked up a newspaper on his desk and pointed to an article with the headline "Unjustified Violence." "Every paper is full of this!" he said, and pointed again, this time at a picture of an officer kicking a protester in the head. Two days earlier, he said, that officer had himself been attacked.
"I don't justify anything violent that happened," the officer went on, "but if the media showed everything that happened here, people would have a different view -- the view people here in Genoa have."

HEADLINE: Influential Connecticut Welfare Plan Is Tested in Hard Times 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE FLANDERS 

 BODY:
Six years after Connecticut began one of the nation's more aggressive welfare reform efforts, the number of people on public assistance has been cut by more than half, to 25,000 from 58,000. Over the full six years, about 60,000 families have moved off the rolls, and state officials and researchers say that many of those former recipients have found work.
 The state, which began its effort a year before the 1996 national welfare reform legislation was adopted, used a new financial incentive for those who found work and short but flexible time limits to achieve what even its critics regard as something of a success. 
 But across the six years, as was true in many other states, Connecticut's welfare experiment was blessed by a helpful constellation of economic stars: a booming economy, a growing state budget surplus and a steady flow of federal welfare dollars all made it easier for people to leave the rolls and easier for the state to be relaxed about families who needed more time to adjust.
Now, however, Connecticut is confronting the question that has hung over the national welfare reform effort since it began: Can success in moving people off the rolls be sustained when the economy weakens and federal money for long-term welfare recipients begins to dry up? 
Against a darkening economic backdrop, Connecticut this year had the first major wrangle over its budget since 1991. Fears about declining tax revenues led to an unexpected scramble to limit spending, and Gov. John G. Rowland and legislators ended up cutting into the state's welfare budget for savings.
New legislation, as a result, has hardened the state's time limits on welfare benefits and has made it more difficult for people to qualify for extended support. There will also be tougher penalties for people who do not comply with work requirements or other welfare rules. These changes are expected to bring budget savings of around $28 million over the next two years, largely by a quicker shrinking of the rolls.
State officials argue that the changes are modest; the goal, they say, is simply to re-emphasize some of the tough-love principles of reform.
"The changes that the governor put forward were to try to fine-tune what we already thought was a good program," said Patricia A. Wilson-Coker, the state's commissioner of social services. "It's a continuation of moving people forward and recognizing they're better off for having done so."
But to others, including people directly involved in the variety of welfare-to-work programs under way across Connecticut, the state's action amounts to the retreat from ambitious thinking that they predicted would occur at the first sign of tougher economic times.
"I find it unconscionable," said Shelley Geballe, an official with Connecticut Voices for Children, a New Haven organization that works with welfare recipients. "The changes will stop benefits for people on welfare who are playing by the rules, and cut programs that help low-wage working families. The safety nets and the bootstrap parts of the system are both being cut."
The biggest changes relate to the state time limit, the 21-month cap on benefits that was one of the shortest in the nation when it was instituted in 1995. But in practice, the limits had been only loosely enforced, and officials could grant extensions in benefits to anyone who was making a "good faith effort" to comply with the welfare-to-work program. Around 40 percent, or nearly 4,800 of the families now on welfare, have had their benefits extended beyond the formal time limit.
Under the new rules, most families will not be able to obtain extensions after they have been on welfare for a total of 39 months unless they can show that their efforts to find work have been hampered by severe mental or physical problems or learning disabilities. To push people toward their deadlines faster, the state has also ruled that a single day on welfare in a given month will be officially counted as a month.
For all the tough initial talk by Connecticut officials -- short time limits and reduced benefits to newcomers -- the state has become known for the more generous aspects of its programs, particularly the earnings incentive it extended to people to mix welfare and work.
Before 1995, Connecticut residents on welfare could not earn very much outside income without triggering cuts in their weekly welfare check -- as is still the case in most states. But in its welfare reforms, Connecticut opted to let recipients earn appreciable amounts of outside income and still receive their full welfare allotment, at least for the first 21 months.
The theory behind the earnings incentive was that by making it less risky for people on welfare to take jobs, the state could increase the chance that they might eventually find steady work. By all accounts, the program paid off, helping to move thousands from welfare to work, especially people with little education or experience who would usually find it hardest to find a job.
A three-year study of welfare reform in Connecticut by the Manpower Development Resource Corporation, an independent research organization, tracked people on welfare in the new system alongside a randomly selected group that was still operating on the pre-1996 welfare rules. It found that employment among people with little job experience and no high school diploma was nearly 40 percent higher under the new rules.
To be sure, the state's welfare reforms have had their critics among advocates for the poor, who pointed out that the people in the study who had moved out of welfare had not seen any lasting increase in income. But from the standpoint of state officials, the increase in employment, by itself, marked an important victory. 
"We have to remember that the goal of the reform program was not to get people out of poverty, but to achieve financial independence, to get off welfare," a senior state official said.
And for those families who reached the 21-month time limit without finding a steady job, even the critics agree that there was usually a second chance.
"When welfare reform was originally introduced, there wasn't much talk about extensions," said the Rev. Bonita Grubbs, director of Christian Community Action, a nonprofit organization that provides support for the homeless in New Haven. "As legislative sessions came and went, we saw a softening of the policy to allow for individuals to get extensions if they could show they were working or looking for work."
As in other states, relaxed enforcement of the time limit helped protect the state against the charge that families were being thrown onto the street.
Until this year's budget debate, it had also helped to postpone a debate about how to handle the families who did not leave the rolls.
Now, 583 families, or just more than 2 percent of households on welfare, are on course to reach the federal five-year limit by October. If the state's rules for extending welfare benefits had not been changed, there was a strong possibility that the families would stay on welfare beyond five years, and the cost of their benefits might have to be met by the state.
With an eye on the weakening economy, Governor Rowland and legislators agreed that a tightening of the state time limits was overdue.
For officials, the changes make good on the founding principles of the reform: that welfare should be temporary and not a way of life. But to critics, the new budget has the state spending less to help people move from welfare to work at just the time when it ought to be spending more, because the remaining families are likely to be those who are least able to find jobs.
Stephen Ristau, president of the Connecticut Council of Family Service Agencies, which runs the state's safety net programs, said the tougher sanctions raise the prospect that for the first time, people who have been actively looking for work will be cut off.
Just over half of the heads of households approaching the five-year deadline are working. Average earnings among this group are about $105 per week, part of which would usually be deducted from their welfare benefits, typically $540 a month for a family of three.
In addition to this group, there are roughly 1,500 families, many of whom are working, who are not yet facing the federal deadline, but who could be cut from the rolls as a result of the state's tougher time limits.
"We all wonder what's going to happen to these people, particularly the ones who have had the most problems finding work," said State Senator Mary Ann Handley, who co-chairs the General Assembly's Human Services Committee. "If you can't find work in this kind of economy, you must have a massive problem."
For Ms. Grubbs, these worries are a natural consequence of the state's earlier, more hands-off approach to moving people off welfare. "The whole emphasis was to push people into getting jobs, and there were a lot of people who actually went to work because they were job-ready and they had skills, and that was fine," she said. "But with that kind of emphasis, a lot of other things get discounted. You end up with a number of people at the bottom of the triangle who have many, many more challenges."
Ms. Wilson-Coker, the state social services commissioner, argues that the budget leaves plenty of room to respond to those challenges as they arise. In principle, a variety of health and family support programs, along with other noncash support, will be available to people whose benefits expire after October.
Under the rules adopted by the legislature, people will also be able to keep their benefits after 39 months if they have two or more serious barriers to employment, like drug addiction, severe learning disabilities and mental or physical health problems. And any teenage mothers on welfare will be exempt from work requirements and required to go to school. 
But, as in other states where recipients are approaching the five-year federal limit, many are concerned that just as the demand for real investment in moving the deeply troubled into work is increasing, budget revenues are starting to decline.
One of the casualties of the budget deal, for instance, was a $1 million pilot program to provide work-study stipends to welfare recipients who were trying to go back to school.
"There are a lot of support programs in place here that don't exist in other places: that's the good news for Connecticut," Mr. Ristau said. "The question is: do we have the resources for the second phase of welfare reform and are we willing to commit them to the kind of programs that the hardest-to-serve families may need? The answer coming out of this year's budget debate seems to be: 'not now.' "

HEADLINE: In Optus Deal, Australians Ponder How to Trust Singapore 

BYLINE:  By BECKY GAYLORD 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
The deal announced in March to sell Australia's No. 2 phone company, Cable and Wireless Optus, to Singapore Telecommunications is running into stiffening opposition because of concerns about the Singapore government's reputation for eavesdropping and spying at home and abroad.
 SingTel, as the buyer is known, is 78 percent owned by the Singapore government and its chairman, Lee Hsien Yang, is a son of Singapore's leading political figure, the longtime prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. Acquiring Optus from its British parent, Cable and Wireless, would give SingTel control of satellite systems that carry sensitive communications for both the Australian military and the United States government, in addition to satellite and ground networks handling ordinary phone calls, television feeds and Internet traffic. 
 SingTel has already extended the deadline of its offer twice, to allow more time for Australian regulators to consider the deal. A decision is now expected in early September. Executives of the company have expressed confidence that outstanding issues will be resolved and the deal will win approval, and there is as yet no sign that opponents are swaying the government their way.
But the longer the deal has languished, the louder the opposition has grown, from a diverse chorus of critics: corporate leaders, civil libertarians and military and intelligence analysts.
Advocacy groups like Privacy International have for years accused the Singaporean government of aggressively using surveillance, legally or illegally, to promote social control and limit domestic opposition. Cameron Murphy, secretary of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, said, "If they breach the law in Singapore through SingTel, why wouldn't they do it in Australia through Optus?"
Singapore and Australia are close allies, and the Australian government has said it is not worried about security. The defense minister, Peter Reith, announced in late June that a binding agreement had been reached with SingTel and Optus to protect defense communications in the event that SingTel's acquisition is approved. An Optus spokesman, Steve Wright, said the company expects a green light soon from the United States as well. "We understand that all issues have been cleared," he said.
One corporate executive who has opposed the deal is Kerry Stokes, chairman of the Seven Network, which owns television stations here. "Given the Singapore Government's and SingTel's record of intrusive and often covert surveillance, the question of who's watching the gatekeepers becomes a very serious one," Mr. Stokes's company wrote in a submission to the Foreign Investment Review Board. Optus's satellite links carry the network's transmissions.
There has also been opposition from some intelligence analysts, including Warren Reed, a former Australian intelligence officer. Mr. Reed said in a television interview last week that he believes Singapore has been actively spying on Australia for years. "They're getting some of our most closely guarded secrets," he said.
The body now reviewing the deal, one of the biggest in Australian history, is the Foreign Investment Review Board, which must rule on whether it would be in the national interest. Australia's treasurer, the official responsible for finance and the economy, has the final say.
Rejections are not without recent precedent. In April, the treasurer, Peter Costello, blocked a $5 billion bid by Royal Dutch/Shell to buy Australian's largest energy company, Woodside Petroleum Ltd. on national-interest grounds.

HEADLINE: 'For Dummies' Parent Company Is Reported Close to Sale 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
The publisher John Wiley & Sons is close to an agreement to buy Hungry Minds Inc., which publishes the "For Dummies" series of how-to books, for about $90 million in cash and will also assume about $90 million more in debt, executives close to the talks said yesterday.
 The companies hope to announce the deal today, the executives said. But they did not rule out the possibility of a competing offer from another company. 
 The proposed deal would rescue Hungry Minds from a deadline on Wednesday that has been set by creditors. Unable to meet debt payments, Hungry Minds said in March that it had retained Morgan Stanley as a financial adviser and was putting itself up for sale as part of an agreement with its lenders to pay off the debts. 
The company's financial problems reflect a sharply disappointing year in much of the book-publishing industry, which has suffered from slowing sales and heavy returns of unsold books going back to the Christmas season. 
The deal, if agreed to, would mark the rise and fall of a counterintuitive, and once highly successful book marketing gimmick: building a brand around a tongue-in-cheek insult to their readers' intelligence.
The company's "Dummies" series was started a decade ago as guides to help bewildered users of personal computers and software.
The series' success propelled the company's growth, but sales in its core market have sharply slowed. Since 1994, the company faced stiff competition from the "Idiots" guides of Pearson's Penguin Putnam book-publishing division.
Hungry Minds has tried to extend the series into far-flung areas like "Aromatherapy for Dummies" by following the same formula, but it has been unable to reverse the slowdown in sales. In May, the company said its sales of about $44 million for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31 were $20 million below those of the previous year and below its expectations, mainly because of declining sales of technical books.
In the last few years, Hungry Minds also made acquisitions that left it with a heavy load of debt in gaining well-known brands including the Cliffs Notes study guides, Frommer's travel guides, the Webster's New World Dictionary, Betty Crocker cookbooks and Howell's dog owners guides.
The company also publishes many technical books about computers. The International Data Group, based in Boston, owns 80 percent of Hungry Minds, which was formerly known as IDG Books Worldwide.
The company adopted the name Hungry Minds from the online education company HungryMinds.com, which it acquired last summer.
In previous statements, Hungry Minds has said that it received several bids. Late last week, John Wiley & Sons was left as the leading bidder for the entire company.
Wiley, based in New York, publishes scientific, technical and medical journals, educational books and textbooks, and professional and retail books about business. Hungry Minds' computer books would complement Wiley's technical and professional publishing businesses.
Wiley is expected to sell some of the company's other lines of books, like the dictionaries or the dog books.
Few of the large publishers would be interested in acquiring all of Hungry Minds grab bag of book series because many already own competing lines, like the Fodor travel guides published by the Random House unit of Bertelsmann or Penguin Putnam's Idiot's guides. Hungry Minds' Cliffs Notes series also faces stiff competition from the Barnes & Noble series of study guides, called Spark Notes.
But people close to the deal said that other large publishers and Barnes & Noble had expressed interest in exploring the acquisition of certain series. Spokesmen for the other publishers and for Barnes & Noble were either unavailable or declined to comment yesterday. 
Wiley is one of the last few midsize book-publishing companies in the United States that are not part of a larger media company. In the last few months, Harcourt General, another publisher of books and scholarly journals, was acquired by Reed Elsevier. The book publisher Houghton Mifflin also agreed to acquired by Vivendi Universal. But Wiley has quietly grown through a number of small acquisitions.

HEADLINE: As Redistricting Unfolds, Power Is Used to Get More of It 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Over the last decade, much of the political power in Texas has shifted to Republicans, and the party once intended to use this new strength to redraw the lines of Congressional districts this year so that Republicans could pick up a half-dozen or more seats in the 2002 elections.
 But those plans may have been thwarted. The Legislature was unable to agree on a redistricting plan, and the matter will probably be decided this fall by a panel of three federal judges, two of whom were appointed by President Bill Clinton. 
 In California, the situation is somewhat reversed. With a Democratic governor and strong Democratic majorities in the Legislature, Democrats anticipated picking up several new seats from redistricting. But tension among Democrats over Hispanic demands for more power and the perilous position of Representative Gary A. Condit, a Democrat from Modesto, have led Democrats to lower their sights considerably. 
Texas, which will gain two Congressional seats because of population growth, for a total of 32, and California, which will gain one, for 53, are among the biggest battlegrounds in the war over redistricting that arises every decade after new census figures are released.
But other bitter battles, each with its own characteristics, are being fought in nearly every state -- from Massachusetts, where the Democratic speaker of the House is at odds with a popular Democratic congressman and seems intent on taking his seat away, to Oregon, where the Democratic governor just vetoed the redistricting plan drafted by the Republican-controlled Legislature.
"It's political hardball, state by state, and anything can happen," said Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, who is in charge of national Republican redistricting strategy.
Mr. Davis predicted that when the November 2002 elections are over, Republicans would be 8 to 10 seats ahead from redistricting. He calculated that Republicans won an additional 25 to 30 seats from redistricting 10 years ago, an important factor in his party's capture of control of the House in the 1994 elections. (Republicans now have 221 seats to 210 for the Democrats with 2 independents and 2 vacancies.) 
Mr. Davis's Democratic counterpart, Representative Martin Frost of Texas, conceded that his party suffered badly from redistricting in the 1990's. But lessons were learned, Mr. Frost said, and he expects the parties will break even in redistricting this time.
Independent analysts say that Republicans may have an advantage but that the net swing from redistricting is not likely to be more than four seats. "Candidate recruiting, the state of the economy, the condition of the Bush presidency and some other factors will matter more than redistricting," said Amy Walter, who follows the topic for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan magazine that tracks House races.
But with the House now so closely divided between the parties and the prospect that lawmakers once elected will keep their seats for many years, the difference of a few seats could determine which party controls the House for the next decade.
Only a handful of states have completed redistricting. Many legislatures will take up the issue this fall. Some states, including New York, will not begin the process until next year.
These are the fundamental rules: Under the Constitution, each of the 50 states is entitled to one seat in the House. The other 385 seats are allotted to the states according to population. After each decennial census, adjustments are made. 
As a result of the 1990 census, 12 seats shifted. Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas gained two seats each and California, Colorado, Nevada and North Carolina each gained one. New York and Pennsylvania each lost two seats. Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Wisconsin each lost one.
Even if the size of their Congressional delegation is unchanged, states must go through the process of redistricting to account for population shifts in the state. The Constitution requires Congressional districts to be nearly equal in population.
In five states (Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, New Jersey and Washington), Congressional redistricting is done by a commission. In all the rest, it is addressed first by the legislatures and the governors. When both houses of the legislature and the governor's office are not controlled by the same party, an agreement often cannot be reached, and the redistricting map is then often drawn by a court.
In redistricting cases, legal authorities say, the political affiliation of the judges involved often makes a big difference. "It is one of the most political things judges do," said Sheldon Goldman, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts who specializes in the judiciary. "After Bush v. Gore," Mr. Goldman said, referring to the Supreme Court decision that ended the Florida recount after the presidential election last year, "no one in his right mind can say politics never enters electoral decisions."
This is why Republicans in Texas are concerned about having the lines of Congressional districts determined by a judicial panel dominated by Democrats. The trial in federal court is scheduled for October.
The states where most of the political fireworks can be expected are those where one party controls both houses of the legislature and the governor's office. Republicans have that situation in eight states with 97 Congressional seats and Democrats in eight states with 103 seats.
Republicans are especially counting on using their control to improve their position in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida and Michigan.
In Michigan, one of the few states where redistricting has been completed, Republicans exercised their strength. Representative David E. Bonior, the Democratic whip, was thrown into a largely Republican district, and he is leaving Congress to run for governor. Two other Michigan Democrats, Representatives John D. Dingell and Lynn Rivers, will have to run against each other. 
The Michigan delegation now consists of nine Democrats and seven Republicans. The best guess is that after the next election, there will be nine Republicans and six Democrats.
Democrats hope to reciprocate in Maryland, Georgia, Alabama and California. No political expert would be surprised, for example, if Democrats rearranged the lines in Maryland next year so they gain two seats. In Indiana, where redistricting was completed last spring, districts now represented by two Republicans were merged. The lines were drawn by a commission with a Democratic majority after the divided Legislature could not reach an agreement.
But California, where the Legislature plans to finish redistricting next month, may be less fruitful for Democrats than might have been expected. One reason is that four vulnerable Republicans were defeated in the last election, meaning that the lowest-hanging fruit has already been picked.
Another reason is that the biggest growth in the state's population and in Democratic strength has come from Hispanics in and around Los Angeles. Rather than ousting Republicans, the main Democratic goal in redistricting is likely to be satisfying the demand of Hispanic voters for more representation. Democrats would like to do this without harming Democratic incumbents like Representatives Maxine Waters, who is black, and Howard L. Berman, who is white, and whose districts have big Hispanic populations.
In addition, because of the notoriety growing out of the case of the missing intern Chandra Ann Levy, Mr. Condit's re-election prospects are in jeopardy.
When the redistricting process began 10 years ago, Democrats held a 100-seat advantage in the House. But despite large black populations, there were no black representatives from Alabama, Florida, Virginia and the Carolinas and only one from Georgia, a situation that Democrats found embarrassing and that the Republican Justice Department found did not comply with voting rights laws.
When the Congressional map was redrawn, heavily black districts were created in all these states. As a result, blacks were elected to the House in all these states, but the concentration of black voters led to the development of overwhelmingly white districts that elected Republicans.
The black Democrats who were elected in the 1990's have become entrenched, Representative Frost said, and can be re-elected in districts with a smaller proportion of blacks. He said that in Southern states where Democrats control redistricting, like Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina, the party will try to make sure that blacks are spread more evenly among districts where voters are likely to vote for Democrats, white or black, for Congress.
In New York, the assumption before the census figures were in was that of the two Congressional seats the state stood to lose, one would come from a New York City Democrat and the other from an upstate Republican.
But the final census numbers showed that the city's proportion of the state's population actually increased in the 1990's, making it difficult to take away a Congressional seat. The latest thinking is that when the new lines are drawn next year, the most vulnerable Democrat could be Eliot L. Engel, whose district extends from the Bronx into Westchester County. The most vulnerable Republicans will probably be Benjamin A. Gilman, of Middletown, and Amo Houghton of Corning.

HEADLINE: Even Blockbusters Find Fame Fleeting In a Multiplex Age 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
Much of the story is up there on the marquees: "Jurassic Park III" on two screens. "Planet of the Apes" on three screens. "Rush Hour 2" on four screens.
 But the rest is inside the nation's proliferating multiplexes this summer: unlike in the past, nearly everyone can find a seat for even the hottest movie on the opening weekend. The resulting box-office statistics show an unprecedented parade of films opening to huge ticket sales ($68.5 million for the first three days of "Planet of the Apes," for instance) only to plummet in the second weekend (down 60 percent for "Apes"). Movie after movie has done that this summer, yet many of them will emerge as sizable hits. "Apes," despite the drop, is expected to make nearly $200 million in North American theaters alone. 
 Something profound is happening at the megaplexes, and it has little to do with what appears on the screen. Rather, it is about how those movies are being seen. 
The summer hits of 2001 are making about as much money as hits from previous summers, but they are making it quicker, making more of it than ever on opening weekend.
Movies are opening on more screens, generating staggering grosses and then plummeting off the radar. Many executives in Hollywood see this trend, which they call "front loading," as a fundamental change in the way summer movies are being watched, not so much a mutation in audience behavior as the natural, evolutionary result of America's 25-year obsession with a movie's opening weekend. 
Perhaps it was inevitable that a fast-food culture thriving on speed and disposability would eventually create fast movies.
"It's another example of the instant gratification society in which we live," said Tom Rothman, co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, which includes the 20th Century Fox film studio.
The repercussions will almost certainly include an increase in the kind of movies best suited for splashy summer openings (at the expense of more original fare), as well as battles between the studios that distribute the films and the theater chains that exhibit them over how to split the opening weekend revenue.
In the future, when digital distribution comes and movies are shipped electronically rather than on metal reels, these trends will only be magnified, as they will when studios become more adept at opening films not merely all over the country but all over the world on the same day.
"The rules are being rewritten as we speak," Mr. Rothman said.

Perishable Profits
The explosion of multiplexes, where it is easy to open a movie in more than one auditorium, has created a situation in which the shelf life of a film -- even a hit -- has been dramatically reduced. Four decades ago successful movies were in theaters for a year or more. Later, successes were measured in months and then, as the science of the wide release flowered, in weeks.
This summer it could almost be measured in days: a huge opening, a rapid plunge, and a few weeks later the hit movie is just a speck in the rear-view mirror. Hollywood has responded with movies created to be pop-culture events. The studios are releasing them with machine-gun regularity rather than bunching them around the holidays.
"Over the last five to seven years the landscape of American cinemas has changed," said Dan Fellman, president for distribution at Warner Brothers. "In the past, when a big movie would open, you might think: 'I won't even bother. It'll be sold out. I'd have to get there an hour early.' Now the movie's showing on five screens, so you go. You know you're going to get in. Nobody gets turned away. The result? Movies burn out quicker."
Partly this has to do with the quality and nature of this year's summer movies. But many in Hollywood believe that it also reveals something larger at work.
For more than 25 years one of the main stories of American moviegoing, especially during the lucrative summer season, has been the steadily increasing importance of the opening weekend. The inevitable result has been a film culture dominated by movies intended to have thermonuclear openings -- sequels, remakes, special-effects blockbusters, stories featuring established characters from comic books, television series and video games -- and the creation of megaplexes where such films can be shown on several screens. The trend seems to have reached a new peak.
"This is the first time that people are really seeing the power of the megaplexes," said Jeff Blake, president for worldwide distribution and marketing of Columbia Pictures. 
Once upon a time, and not so long ago, a summer blockbuster might open in 2,000 theaters and experience a drop in ticket sales between the first and second weekends of 30 percent or less. The good ones, the hits, had what distributors delighted in calling legs. They would play for weeks, sometimes months. If a big movie dipped more than 40 percent in its second weekend, it was considered a debacle. Heads would roll. 
But no more.
This summer, even would-be blockbusters have routinely opened in more than 3,000 theaters. Since more and more megaplexes are putting movies on multiple screens, that usually translates into 4,000, 5,000 or sometimes more prints blasting at screens on opening weekend. (If a movie is showing on three screens at the same megaplex, it still counts as only one theater in the weekend box-office statistics.) 
And it has also become not just possible, but common for such films to drop off 50 percent or more in their second weekends and still be major hits, earning $150 million and up.
"These are very significant trends," said John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners. "Not too long ago a thousand prints was an awful lot of prints to have out there. In the old days if you went to see a movie on opening weekend, and it was sold out, you had to wait two and a half hours for the next one. Now the next show's coming up in a half-hour."

Beyond Hits, Events
In the 1960's and earlier, most movies were released in a handful of theaters in the biggest cities. Weeks later they made their way to second-tier cities and to suburbs and finally into the rural heartland. In 1975, however, "Jaws," which opened in only 409 theaters, became an overnight phenomenon. Hollywood realized that it was possible to create films that were not merely successful, but cash-generating, pop-culture events, movies that almost everyone wanted to see quickly.
Yet even in the early 1980's, when studios were beginning to exploit this technique, the number of screens remained low. "Return of the Jedi" opened in only 1,002 theaters in 1983, a wide release in its day. But the numbers inched up.
As Hollywood began to pay more attention to opening weekend grosses, so did the news media. In the early 80's weekend box-office statistics, once limited to the trade papers, began to appear in general newspapers and broadcast reports, and studios began to use the results ("The No. 1 Movie in America!") to promote films. Given this self-inflicted pressure, for more than a decade Hollywood movies have approached opening days with a built-in set of box-office expectations; their success or failure has been marked by how well they performed against those expectations.
Not until 1996 and "Mission: Impossible" did the first film open in more than 3,000 theaters. Four years later "Mission: Impossible 2" became the first film to open in more than 3,500 theaters. 
Now such openings are common. "The Mummy Returns" kicked off the summer season in May by opening in 3,401 theaters. "Shrek" followed in 3,587 theaters, "Pearl Harbor" in 3,214. And on and on: "Dr. Dolittle 2" in 3,049, "A.I." in 3,242, "Scary Movie 2" in 3,220, "Jurassic Park III" in 3,434, "Rush Hour 2" in 3,118 and, this weekend, "American Pie 2" in 3,063. ("Pie" earned an estimated $45.1 million in its first three days, the largest opening ever for an R-rated comedy.)
The second weekend drop-offs were as dramatic as the openings. "The Mummy Returns" fell 50 percent, as did "Pearl Harbor." "A.I." fell 52 percent, "Rush Hour 2" 53 percent. "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within," which had opened on 2,649 screens, fell a staggering 68 percent.
"We've seen these kind of drop-offs in the past, but they were in the wake of a big holiday weekend opening, like a Memorial Day or a Fourth of July," said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a company that monitors box-office results. "This year we're getting these holidaylike opening weekends almost every weekend. Legs are becoming a thing of the past."
The only old-style hit this summer, the kind of movie with legs, has been DreamWorks' computer-animated "Shrek," which actually had its box-office figures go up slightly in its second weekend and has held on to become the season's undisputed champ, passing $260 million in sales.
Not everyone agrees that the drop-offs have been caused by the number of screens. Many think part of the reason is what's on the screen. "Shrek" built its success on a strong opening followed by word of mouth. People loved it, went to see it again and told friends to go see it, too.
"I think it's really the movies," said Brett Ratner, who directed "Rush Hour 2." "What happened was that because people had been worried there would be strikes this summer by actors and writers, a lot of movies were really rushed, and it made for some lesser quality work."

In the Studios' Interest
However valid those sentiments, they still don't account for the huge surge in opening weekend grosses, which many in the industry say points to something less ephemeral than the ebb and flow of movie quality. And in that, they say, are serious economic repercussions.
In most contracts movie studios get a higher percentage of the ticket sales they split with theater chains in the opening weekend than they do in subsequent weekends. The most dramatic of these is the so-called 90-10 split, in which 90 percent of box-office revenue goes to the studio on the opening weekend. Under that arrangement it is clearly in the studios' interest to earn as much of the gross in the opening weekend as possible.
"They're delighted at the studios," said Mr. Fithian of the theater owners' group. "We're not necessarily delighted in exhibition."
This comes as the exhibitors are trying to recover from a building binge in the late 90's that increased the number of screens in the United States to more than 38,000 from 27,000 in 1995. Some of the chains have been seeking relief by trying to strike agreements in which they split the same percentage of the weekly gross, whether it's opening weekend or not. If this summer's trend continues, they may push even harder.
The studios take a different view. Having a new blockbuster arriving every weekend -- something Mr. Fithian says the theater owners are happy with -- means there are fewer summer scheduling lulls, the studios argue. The cinemas may not be sold out as often, they say, but neither are they sitting empty as often. And since theater owners make most of their profits at the concession stands, this is to their benefit.
"The one place you still have to stand in line is at the concession stand," said Mr. Rothman of Fox Entertainment.
Still unclear is what impact the coming world of digital distribution will have. Almost certainly, most agree, it will further magnify the importance of the opening weekend. 
Instead of being limited by the number of film prints they have been shipped, cinema operators will, with digital distribution, be able to shift the number of screens on which a film is playing by flicking a switch.
How much flexibility will there be over the course of the opening weekend to shift movies to more or fewer and larger or smaller theaters to accommodate actual turnout?
"We think the best situation would be when we can make that decision on the fly," Mr. Fithian said, speaking for the theater operators.
Studios, fearful that a movie that does not roar out of the gate will quickly be shunted into megaplex oblivion, are skeptical about giving up that much control.
"If the technology gets to the point where supply and demand can be manipulated in real time, on the fly and on the first weekend, it would be very amazing to see what would happen," Mr. Dergarabedian said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 16, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Monday about the effect of proliferating multiplexes on ticket sales for summer films referred incompletely to the division of revenues on opening weekends. The studios receive 90 percent of box-office revenues on opening weekend, but only after the theater chain has taken a guaranteed minimum, negotiated with the studio.

HEADLINE: Black Leaders Continue Spreading Out Their Mayoral Endorsements 

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
The splintering of endorsements from black elected officials, religious leaders and civic groups in the mayor's race continued yesterday. One of Harlem's prominent ministers, the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, said he was supporting Mark Green's bid for the Democratic nomination, while a fraternal organization of black police officers threw its weight behind one of Mr. Green's three rivals, Alan G. Hevesi.
 The two endorsements -- one offered outside the Abyssinian Baptist Church on West 138th Street, where Mr. Butts presides, the other on the steps of City Hall -- came as another Democratic mayoral candidate, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, repeated yesterday that he was still soliciting the backing of several black leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton. 
 If Mr. Ferrer manages to snag Mr. Sharpton's endorsement, along with those of C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, and Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, he would clearly have impressive support among many of the city's leading black Democrats. That has become more likely in recent days with Mr. Rangel's disclosure that he is trying to create a black-Latino coalition that would consider endorsing Mr. Ferrer.
But yesterday's endorsements by Mr. Butts and the New York City Police Department Guardians Association, the fraternal police group, mean that Mr. Green and Mr. Hevesi -- and to a lesser extent Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker -- will also enter the Sept. 11 mayoral primary with the support of significant black figures.
"Mark Green stands for the kind of city in which we all wish to live," Mr. Butts said after spending the morning leading services at Abyssinian. "A city that presses for the needs of those furthest down and furthest out, while also recognizing the deeds of those who have served to make this city the great place that it is."
The split among the endorsements is a sign of the growing geographic and economic diversity among blacks in New York City today. Harlem once was the dominant base of black political power, but that power is increasingly shared with southeast Queens and central Brooklyn, sections of the city where Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Green in particular have been pursuing black voters.
Mr. Hevesi, for example, has won the backing of the Rev. Floyd Flake, a former member of the Congressional Black Caucus who is pastor at the 13,000-member Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens, as well as that of Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., leader of the Brooklyn Democratic Party. He was also endorsed recently by Abner Louima, the black man who was beaten and sodomized by police officers at a Brooklyn station house in 1997.
Mr. Green, meanwhile, has captured the backing of former Mayor David N. Dinkins and Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the chairman of the Manhattan Democratic Party. Yesterday, Mr. Green also picked up the endorsement of the Rev. James E. F. Lawrence, the pastor at Metropolitan A.M.E. Church. Mr. Lawrence's endorsement took Mr. Green and at least one opponent, Mr. Vallone, by surprise. It came as Mr. Vallone was on his way to address Metropolitan's congregation, an appearance he abruptly canceled. 
Mr. Vallone has fewer prominent names among his black supporters, but he cites a list of 22 black pastors who are supporting his campaign, including the Rev. Alfloyd Alston of Antioch Baptist Church in Harlem.
Yesterday morning, Mr. Vallone had breakfast with a group that calls itself Concerned African Americans of Flushing, with which he discussed his plan to provide free health insurance to more city children.
The various endorsements among black leaders is proving a bit confusing to some voters, like Ernestine Jenkins, a lawyer who lives in Brooklyn and belongs to Abyssinian. 
"In a lot of ways, all of the candidates are probably similar," she said as Mr. Butts was about to announce his endorsement. "At some point, you will have to look at it all and just make a choice."
The four major Democratic and two Republican mayoral candidates spent another busy Sunday campaigning yesterday, appearing not only at churches, but also at parades, street fairs and other events.
The biggest draw was the Dominican Day Parade. Mr. Hevesi, marching enthusiastically and waving to the crowd, expressed satisfaction with his endorsement by the Guardians, which represents about 4,000 black police officers, school crossing guards and other city officers.
"Zero tolerance of bigotry," he said. "That's a big theme of our campaign." 
Marching near the front of the parade, Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman and Republican candidate, drew scattered cheers from the crowd as he darted from one side of the Avenue of the Americas to the other. 
Commenting on the attention he has received for spending $16 million of his own money on his campaign thus far -- far more than any opponent's spending -- Mr. Bloomberg said: "In life a lot of people say a lot of things. You have to do what you think is right."
Mr. Bloomberg's rival for the Republican nomination, Herman Badillo, also attended the Dominican parade, as did Mr. Ferrer, Mr. Green, Mr. Vallone and many candidates for other city offices.
"It's nice for the Dominican people that all these people are here," said Sonia Rodriguez of Queens, referring to the candidates. "I've been coming to the parade for 15 years and it's never happened before."

HEADLINE: Wending Through Time, a Cosmic Web 

BYLINE:  By JAMES GLANZ 

 BODY:
If the story of the universe were made into a summer movie, starting with the biggest, baddest explosion ever and building up to the glorious development of stars, galaxies and human life, what sort of flick would it be?
 Whatever its genre, it would more than satisfy Samuel Goldwyn's famous demand for a story that "starts with an earthquake and works its way up to a climax," because an earthquake looks like a mosquito's hiccup next to the Big Bang explosion in which the universe was born. On the other hand, the complexity of the tale would make it longer than "Apocalypse Now Redux," brainier than "A.I.," more populated with dramatis personae than "The Anniversary Party." 
 Despite the challenge of the material, what could put the movie over the top are its stunning visuals and the subtle but unbroken thread that connects virtually every important event in the story. Those advantages are the result of a gorgeous feature of the universe that determines its destiny and permeates space like a vast, three-dimensional system of rivers, tributaries, streams, creeks and rivulets: the cosmic web. 
Though it is little known outside the circle of cosmologists who study it, it is a central part of explanations of how the force of gravity has created all structure in the cosmos -- from swarms of galaxies to the building blocks of life -- since those first fiery moments of creation.
Increasing computing power and advances in the development of algorithms, or computer codes representing subtle physics, have deepened scientists' understanding of the web and revealed its links to recent observational discoveries in the cosmos.
"It's like the cartography of the universe," said Dr. Wayne Hu, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago. "Things start collapsing by gravity and start forming this giant pattern."
Once they begin forming, early in cosmic history, the rivers of the cosmic web flow with ordinary gas and more exotic stuff called dark matter.
Where the rivers intersect, material slowly collects, over billions of years, into giant agglomerations akin to lakes.
Gradually, stars and galaxies form out of that raw material, popping up like towns and cities along the branches of the cosmic web, and even more prolifically where the branches intersect. Between the branches and nodes there develop great dark regions called voids. Remarkably, the web itself remains mostly invisible, except to special telescopes and in computer simulations of cosmic evolution.
"It's pretty clear that if you could see the cosmic web in its full glory, it would be quite visually stunning," said Dr. Craig Hogan, an astrophysicist at the University of Washington. The computer simulations, Dr. Hogan said, reveal that "the web itself makes great cinema."
And it is the thematic tapestry that links a whole series of recent astronomical discoveries involving various epochs of cosmic history.
Those discoveries involve things like the cosmic microwave background radiation, the faint afterglow of the Big Bang; the cosmic dark ages, the time before stars and galaxies began shining in the heavens; the cosmic renaissance, which occurred as light from the first stars began to appear; and the huge structures, like clusters of galaxies, that formed later in cosmic history and dominate the skies today.
But the most impressive aspect of the cosmic web may be its sheer scale, sprawling over billions of light-years of space and, even now, expanding along with the universe like a smiley face on an inflating balloon.
"It's the largest scale on which structure exists today," said Dr. Adrian Melott, an astrophysicist at the University of Kansas, adding that the pattern was simply "a reflection of the laws of gravity."
If the story of the web were made into a movie, it would begin as the universe emerged from the Big Bang as a nearly featureless soup of hot expanding gas some 13 billion years ago. Then, it passed through an age of darkness and eventually began twinkling with stars and galaxies that now fill the heavens with their light. Near the end of the tale -- the climax, if one thinks in Goldwynian terms -- humans appear on the third rock from one of those stars, the Sun.
What made things interesting is that, like any explosion, the Big Bang did make a noise, albeit a tiny one, said Dr. Nickolay Y. Gnedin, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado. Troubling the gas were faint sound waves "smaller than any whisper we can hear," Dr. Gnedin said. That whisper would become the seeds of the cosmic web.
For the first half-million years or so, however, the universe remained hot and dense, merely stretching out those sound waves as it expanded. Then the gases cooled enough to allow electrons and hydrogen nuclei to combine into neutral atoms, and the universe became transparent to low-frequency infrared radiation bearing an imprint of the faint ripples of sound.
Like a mysterious character who appears only in the first and last scenes of a drama, that radiation, its wavelength gradually stretched by cosmic expansion, would travel through the universe almost undisturbed for billions of years, carrying an imprint of the cosmos at roughly 500,000 years after the Big Bang.
"That's the earliest epoch we can see from Earth," said Dr. Renyue Cen, an astrophysicist at Princeton.
Called the cosmic microwave background radiation, it was discovered accidentally in 1965. Last May, several teams of astronomers announced that they had used the radiation to get the most detailed map of those primordial ripples ever made.
"What we see today in terms of great voids and this cosmic web is a direct consequence of those early seeds," Dr. Cen said.
To understand why, return to the opening scene of the story, when the background radiation was set free.
The release itself froze the sound waves in place, silencing the young universe but leaving a slight lumpiness in the gases, mostly neutral hydrogen, Dr. Cen said. The sound waves stop vibrating but leave behind their density patterns, which stretch with the universe.
The increasingly cold and tenuous universe, continuing in its eternal expansion, then entered a barren, quiet and dark phase that was hundreds of millions of years long. Scientists call that forbidding period, quite appropriately, the dark ages.
But thanks to the primordial lumpiness, scientists believe, there was a stirring in the cosmic darkness. Because the lumps had a little extra gravitational pull, they began gathering more matter, at the expense of their surroundings.
"With time, the slightly more concentrated regions acquire more mass and become more and more concentrated," said Dr. Lars Hernquist, an astronomy professor at Harvard.
As this concentration proceeded, a striking pattern began to emerge. Just as a bedsheet, if pinched and lifted at several points, will develop a network of wrinkles that connect the highest points, the cosmic gases formed a web of somewhat concentrated filaments running between the lumps.
Several effects slowly deepened the pattern, said Dr. Jeremiah P. Ostriker, a cosmologist who is provost of Princeton. Some of the mathematics behind the pattern were first worked out in Moscow in the 1970's by Yakov Zeldovich, a physicist who deduced that roundish lumps should tend to collapse into pancakes. Intersecting pancakes form filaments, and intersecting filaments make more lumps.
The filaments of the web, Dr. Ostriker said, then act like rivers, collecting material from the surrounding regions, or voids, that are less concentrated and funneling it to the lumpy places.
Over billions of years, Dr. Ostriker said, this process "empties out the voids in between and then it tends to empty out the filaments."
Scientists believe that at first, two distinct types of matter moved in step along the pattern. Other evidence has shown that roughly 90 percent of the mass in the universe is so-called dark matter, probably mysterious particles that interact with one another and the rest of the universe only through gravitational forces. The rest is the ordinary matter of which today's stars, planets and people are made.
During the early dark ages, however, there were no stars (and certainly no planets or people). But as the concentrations of matter grew, the ordinary matter began to do what ordinary matter does, radiating away some of its heat as it was compressed. That allowed it to collapse further, forming the first stars -- possibly when the universe was no more than 100 million years old.
"The first stars to form will form in special areas, these densest areas of the web," said Dr. August E. Evrard, an astrophysicist at the University of Michigan. Later in cosmic history, Dr. Evrard said, "there's a remembrance of things past," and huge clusters of galaxies will begin to form at those same spots.
But those first twinklings probably did little to pierce the gloom of the dark ages because the neutral hydrogen permeating the universe was opaque to the mostly ultraviolet light of those hot young stars, which were probably much more massive than the Sun. Only in small, bubblelike regions around the stars would their radiation be able to ionize the hydrogen, creating regions free of the cosmic fog.
As hundreds of millions of years passed, more and more stars formed; at some critical moment their bubbles began to merge, and the fog suddenly lifted. Just this month, two teams of astronomers said they had pinpointed that moment, the end of the dark ages, at about 900 million years after the Big Bang.
At that point in cosmic history, the picture would move briskly toward its denouement. Elements much heavier than hydrogen are generated in the nuclear furnaces of stars and spread through the cosmos in stellar explosions, becoming building blocks for life in at least one particularly congenial planetary system.
Dr. Dmitri Y. Pogosyan, an astrophysicist at the University of Toronto's Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, said scientists had mostly satisfied themselves that computer simulations starting with the early seeds revealed by the cosmic microwave background did reproduce the cosmic web as it is observed in the skies today.
He said, however, that a number of outstanding questions remained, like the details of galaxy formation and just how "webby" the real sky is. Exhaustive maps of galaxy distributions now being produced by projects like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2-Degree Field survey may answer those questions, Dr. Pogosyan said.
Until those issues are finally settled, said Dr. Melott, of the University of Kansas, the cosmic web may remain something more like a "made for cable TV" production than a full-length feature because, he said, the story is still "kind of patched together."
That may be true. But didn't "Pearl Harbor" prove that an imperfect story line is no barrier to putting viewers in the seats as long as the graphics are good?

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK: C. J. PETERS; 
A Baffling Viral Outbreak? He's on the Trail

BYLINE:  By ABIGAIL ZUGER 

DATELINE: GALVESTON, Tex. 

 BODY:
It was high noon on a midsummer day, temperature 94 and rising, the sky a hot white bowl, the gulf breeze a hot wet breath. In a tiny fan-cooled taqueria down the street from his laboratory, Dr. C. J. Peters, known to many as one of the scientists who battled a deadly Ebola virus outbreak in the 1994 best seller "The Hot Zone," sprinkled a little extra Tabasco sauce over his steaming fajitas.
 "Oh, I don't mind the heat that much," he said. "I guess I sweat just about the same as anyone else." 
 Actually, between hot climates and anxious moments, Dr. Peters, 60, has probably sweated just a bit more than average in the course of a distinguished career pursuing deadly new viral diseases around the world. 
He has smuggled vials containing noxious germs past airport customs agents; he has seen a colleague sicken and die during an outbreak, and worried that others would also succumb; he has eaten guinea pig in Ecuador and termites in Africa; he has even been immortalized in highly fictionalized form in the 1995 movie thriller "Outbreak" (either by Dustin Hoffman or Rene Russo; he said he was not sure which one).
Now, after a career primarily in government service, first in the Army's Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md., then at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the Texas native has come home to this hot zone as a civilian again, six months into a new job as professor of pathology, microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.
His preferred footwear of socks and sandals is no longer a violation of uniform; his Texas vowels blend smoothly with the native drawl; and he says that at least for now, he is happy to be away from the front lines, no longer at the beck and call of microbes tugging his attention to distant parts of the world.
As chief of the special pathogens branch at the C.D.C. for eight years, Dr. Peters was responsible for mustering equipment and personnel when the agency was called for help in outbreaks and for running the laboratory investigation that made sense of the data afterward.
"He made critically important contributions to C.D.C.'s efforts to respond to many of the challenges posed by emerging infections," said Dr. James M. Hughes, director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases at the agency. "When he called me at home at night or over the weekend, it meant that we were about to embark on another interesting and challenging response to a major public health emergency."
Now Dr. Peters is hoping to look at even bigger puzzles -- the innumerable unanswered biological questions of how and why viruses suddenly attack humans with diseases that have never been seen before.
The big lure of the Galveston job, he said, was the planned Biosafety Level 4 laboratory here, which he will direct. It is one of a handful in North America (five at last count) that enable space-suited scientists to probe viruses, like Ebola, that are so contagious and difficult to treat that they must be studied under the most protected laboratory conditions.
Dr. Peters's arrival in this faded city, where the medical school and its affiliates are by far the biggest game in town, has an appealing historical resonance. In the 19th century, Galveston itself, then a thriving commercial center, was regularly overwhelmed by outbreaks of yellow fever -- one of the viral diseases that brings a certain sparkle to Dr. Peters's eyes. The first medical school in Texas was established here in 1891 specifically to treat yellow fever victims.
In a symmetric turn of events, Galveston is now filling up with world-class scientists who specialize in the hundreds of obscure viruses that suddenly leap out from insects and animals to people.
Some of these viruses ride in the innards of mosquitoes, ticks and other insects, which can then transmit them with a bite. Others are carried by rodents -- field mice, house mice and even, occasionally, pet hamsters. Still others, like the Ebola virus and its relatives, seem to appear out of nowhere, blasting through a village (or a herd of livestock or a shipment of laboratory animals) and killing half or more of their victims before disappearing again.
Most infect humans only in developing countries -- yellow fever, for example, has not been contracted in the United States since the early 20th century. But because the diseases have such an intimate connection to the weather, agriculture and economy of a region, the experts are never all that surprised when a virus shows up in a new species of victim or a new place.
"Evolution is still progressing," Dr. Peters said. "The viruses are evolving, and the hosts are evolving, too. I don't think anyone appreciates how complicated the biology is."
He is still unpacking boxes, dealing with forms for enrolling in a health plan and trying to coax the Japanese maple he and his wife, Susan, brought from Atlanta out of a bad slump. But his conversation is a whirl of wide-ranging questions and research plans that flash from one obscure virus to another at a dizzying clip.
In 1993 Dr. Peters led the C.D.C. team that figured out why young healthy people in the nation's Southwest were suddenly dying from a devastating pneumonia. The disease was caused by a new member of the species hantavirus, carried by deer mice. The virus causes too few human cases -- only about 20 a year in the United States -- to enable scientists to study it properly. Dr. Peters plans to study its habits and disease-causing abilities in animal models instead.
He wants to do more work on the Rift Valley fever virus, which he has been investigating for years. This virus explodes periodically in a band across Africa, especially during wet seasons. Mosquitoes infect livestock and people; people butchering sick animals can be infected, too. Of 100 people who come down with Rift Valley fever, 98 will have a mild flu for a few days, but 2 will develop a desperate, progressive illness, with bleeding into the eyes, the stomach and the intestines, and they will have a high likelihood of dying.
There is one clue to the outcome of infection: the cells of monkeys who survive the disease manufacture a protective molecule called interferon far more promptly than those who die. But no one knows why survivors are lucky enough to have cells that do this.
"I want to get back into that area -- the genetics of host resistance," Dr. Peters said. He is also planning to collaborate with a Galveston colleague on the creation of an animal vaccine against Rift Valley fever.
And then there is West Nile virus, which Dr. Peters knew well long before it arrived in the Western Hemisphere in 1999 (possibly in the belly of an infected Middle Eastern mosquito that hopped a flight to New York).
The West Nile virus is a cousin of the yellow fever virus, but it is spread by a different kind of mosquito and affects the brain rather than the liver and the intestines. There is no treatment for either. With colleagues in Galveston's structural biology department, Dr. Peters is planning to look for molecules that can fit neatly into slots in these viruses and stop them from attacking human cells.
After completing medical school at Johns Hopkins and a residency at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, Dr. Peters joined the National Health Service as an alternative to military service. He arrived at his first posting in Panama in unforgettable style, said Dr. Karl M. Johnson, a renowned virologist who was Dr. Peters's supervisor then. He was at the wheel of a silver Pontiac convertible he had driven straight down through Mexico. He was also so late that he was almost AWOL, and he had a brewing case of hepatitis from the food along the way.
"He was marvelously wild," Dr. Johnson said. "But from the start it was clear that, when he wanted to, he had a fine mind. His science is very solid, and the breadth of his interests is unique."
After working in Panama with an assortment of obscure and dangerous viruses, Dr. Peters was hooked on the field.
Which one of the hundreds of frightening viruses of his acquaintance really makes him sweat? It is not the Ebola virus, prime nightmare material for the readers of Richard Preston's "The Hot Zone," with its graphic descriptions of the bloody death throes of its monkey and human victims. Instead, it is the Nipah virus that haunts Dr. Peters. This recently discovered distant relative of the measles virus exploded through pig farms in Malaysia and Singapore three years ago, killing hundreds of farmers and their animals with a brain infection. There is neither a vaccine nor a treatment to protect against Nipah infection when (not if, Dr. Peters said) it returns.
Many of his research plans await the construction of the medical school's $12.5 million ultrasafe Biosafety Level 4 laboratory, which is expected to be completed early in 2003.
Government regulations require this kind of laboratory for research on deadly airborne germs for which no vaccines are available to protect workers. The labs are encased in protective machinery: pumps suck air out through filters that trap viral particles, and ovens sterilize all discarded waste. Researchers suit up in anterooms with one-piece polyvinyl suits, helmets and two sets of gloves; in the laboratory they breathe air piped directly into their suits through a hose, and most lab benches are encased in transparent hoods for additional air filtration.
The administrators of the Galveston medical campus have had their own set of nightmares over the new laboratory -- specifically, about the wisdom of building it on a skinny barrier island with "the potential for experiencing violent weather," in the cautious words of Dr. Adrian A. Perachio, the medical school's vice president for research. 
A giant hurricane demolished Galveston in 1900, prompting the city to erect a giant sea wall and shore up the island against it for protection against future blasts. Hurricanes regularly revisit the city (the last in 1989), prompting evacuations and damaging property.
The new laboratory will be nestled in a niche in a medical school building that has been standing since 1926.
"I'm not worried," Dr. Peters said. "It's 30 feet above the surge, and the walls can stand 140-mile-per-hour winds." An evacuation protocol will be begin the moment a hurricane warning is declared, he said. The laboratory will be shut down in 90 minutes. All infectious agents will be burned, and infected laboratory animals will be sacrificed to prevent any virus from escaping.
Dr. Peters is unfazed at the prospect of his lab periodically vaporizing itself at the behest of the weather. "It's one of the prices you pay," he said, for establishing a home base in this somewhat unlikely new center for ominous infectious diseases.
Virus experts have been heading to Galveston for a decade now, lured by unusually generous financial support from the medical school, the prospect of collaborating with renowned colleagues and the proximity to Central and South America, where much of their field work is done.
"The infectious disease environment here is unique," said Dr. Stanley M. Lemon, the dean of medicine. Grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to Galveston researchers have soared from $4.3 million in 1995 to more than $10 million this year.
"It is easily the best place of its kind in the country, if not the world," Dr. Johnson, the virologist, said.
Workdays for these scientists lack the continuous high drama implied by books like "The Hot Zone." In fact, Dr. Peters wrote his own far more tempered memoir, "Virus Hunter," published in 1997 to set the record straight. (Sales have been respectable, but the book has been far from a best seller.)
"People have to know more about these viruses," Dr. Peters said. They should be aware, he said, that while the Hollywood take on killer viruses is fiction, the basic premise is true. New patterns of weather, tourism, commerce and politics will continue to lead disease-causing microbes directly to vulnerable hosts, exploding into outbreaks of new infections.
In South America, for instance, yellow fever is in the jungles, he said, and the species of mosquito that transmits the virus in cities, once eradicated from South America with DDT after World War II, has returned since widespread spraying stopped. When will trade, tourism or subtle climatic shifts bring yellow fever back to Galveston, not safely encased in a lab vial but in a mosquito out roaming the city? 
"We're all waiting," Dr. Peters said.

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA; 
Leading Charleston to Its Past

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C. 

 BODY:
Few places preserve and market their history as lovingly as Charleston, but until now many people here have been reluctant to face the important role this city played in the African slave trade.
 Charleston was the principal port of entry for African slaves into British North America. After repressing this collective memory for generations, city officials have concluded that the time is right to begin planning a slavery museum that would be the largest of its kind in the United States. 
 The museum could become a national and perhaps international attraction, especially among African-American, and Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said it would fuel Charleston's tourist-driven economic boom.
It would also be one of the most daring steps yet taken to bring the story of slavery to large numbers of people in the South, where there are still many monuments to Confederate heroes and where generations of politicians embraced the view that slave life was not all that bad. 
The depth of those attitudes was reflected in the recent battle over the flying of a Confederate banner over South Carolina's State Capitol in Columbia. Last year a compromise was reached in which the banner was moved to a nearby spot, but the conflict and left a residue of bitterness. Debates over questions like the right of labor organizers sometimes take on racial overtones here. 
"For a long time I would have said that people here aren't ready to take another look at this history of ours, maybe a more honest look, but that's not the case anymore," Mayor Riley said. "Not just this community but the whole country has matured in terms of our willingness to confront slavery. We as a culture need to do this as part of our progress in coming together and healing."
Mayor Riley is working on two projects aimed at telling the story of the slave trade here. The first will be a small museum in a downtown building known as the Slave Mart, which is the only place in Charleston where slaves are known to have been bought and sold. Renovation of the Slave Mart is under way, and the museum is expected to open within a year. It will be part of a statewide network of sites connected to African-American history.
A much larger and more ambitious plan to build a museum of slavery is also on the drawing boards. Mayor Riley said he had considered the idea in the past, but that it became especially attractive after the city demolished a housing project and found itself with a 10-acre waterfront site adjacent to the aquarium. 
He estimated that the museum would cost $30 million to $35 million, most of which he hopes to raise from private donors, he said, adding that planning and construction would be "a five-year project." "It would be a story museum that would talk about this tragic human practice, which is very old, then about how the slave trade began in Africa, about the passage, which was horrific, and about the sale of slaves and their lives here," the mayor said. "It would go beyond emancipation to about 1900, covering the period of Jim Crow in the South, the search for economic opportunity and the transition of a people from slavery to freedom in that time."
"I see this as a national museum that would be of interest to African- Americans and everyone else in our country," he said. "The Holocaust Museum in Washington is interesting to all people. Museums about Native Americans are interesting to all people. This is a part of our nation's history that just hasn't been presented."
Mayor Riley, a Democrat, has not yet asked the City Council to approve spending public money on the museum. But his enormous popularity -- he has been in office since 1975 and routinely wins re-election with more than two-thirds of the vote -- suggests that other officials will fall into line behind him.
"It's a decisive factor," said Yvonne Evans, a City Council member. "There have been a few things he wanted that he hasn't gotten, but not very many." Ms. Evans said the City Council might approve the project as early as this year. The project has not yet aroused widespread interest in Charleston's African-American residents, who make up about one-third of the total population, but the Rev. Joseph Darby, a local pastor, predicted that interest would rise with the approach of the groundbreaking.
"If it's a museum that emphasizes not only tragedy but also triumph over adversity by many Americans of African descent, if it's tasteful and sensitive and frank, it will be a good thing," he said. "This is South Carolina. We have people here who think that Appomattox was a cease-fire, that the Civil War wasn't fought about slavery and that good treatment of slaves was the rule rather than the exception."
The few small museums in places like Louisiana and Maryland that tell parts of the story of slavery do not approach the scale of what is planned for Charleston. A plan for a national museum of African-American history, offered in the 1980's by the Smithsonian Institution, foundered for a variety of reasons, but a new version has won the support of several influential members of Congress. They are sponsoring a bill to provide $25 million in public and private funds for a museum that would include exhibits about slavery and the civil rights movement. 
Charleston emerged as a center of the slave trade during the 18th century. About 40 percent of all slaves brought into the British colonies of North America first landed here. By the 1770's ships were disgorging more than 4,000 slaves here each year. The census of 1790 showed 107,000 slaves in South Carolina, about 42 percent of the population.
With such a large slave population, it was perhaps inevitable that rumors of uprisings periodically terrified local whites. The most famous of these planned revolts was thwarted in 1822 with the arrest and subsequent hanging of a free black man, Denmark Vesey, who was allegedly plotting a mass murder of whites. Some today doubt that Vesey's plan was as bloody as it was then portrayed, among them Mayor Riley.
In an outer corridor of Charleston's municipal auditorium there hangs an unmarked painting of a black man, visible only from the back, addressing a congregation. It is said to depict Vesey. People here, however, remain uncertain how to deal with his story. The planned new museum will try to present it in a balanced manner, but no approach to either Vesey or slavery in general can be expected to pass without controversy.
The way complex historical stories like this are presented in museums has become increasingly controversial as various groups seek to have their perspectives represented. Planners of the Charleston museum are braced for debate.
"Replication of the past in museums has become a very politically charged subject," said Richard Rabinowitz, who heads a New York consulting concern that is working with Charleston officials to plan the slavery museum. "There are going to be people in Charleston who will ask why we're bringing up all this old stuff all over again. But there are a lot of people there, not just in the Afro-American community, who sense that this is an untold story that has to be brought to the surface. It's a fundamental fact we have to come to grips with."
In January Mr. Rabinowitz held a workshop here for about 25 city officials and other residents to discuss what he called "the scope and focus and scale and purposes of such a museum." He delivered a report to Mayor Riley in March, and since then the two men have had what he called "some very general conversations about how to move ahead, although the city hasn't made a final decision yet."
"The heart of the issue would be the role of Charleston in the creation of the economic system, physical landscape and political order that was built around slavery," he said. "Charleston is one of the places where this narrative was most powerfully played out."
Organizers of the annual Spoleto Festival, which brings people from across the South and beyond to Charleston for 17 days of theater, music and dance, have begun making their own efforts to explore this aspect of Charleston's history. A city-sponsored agency that works with festival organizers has hired an experienced museum curator, Mary Jane Jacob, to spend three years working with visual artists who are interested in local history.
"I was here 10 years ago, and there wasn't such a receptivity to dealing with issues of slavery and African-American history," Ms. Jacob said. "That's changed now. People understand that the economy of this region was built on the back of people forced to labor." 
One black artist who participated in this year's festival, Colin Quashie, built a free-standing window and moved it to several spots around Charleston where African-American history unfolded but where there is no marker or memorial. 
"Charleston is a town that sells itself on its history, but it only markets certain kinds of history," Mr. Quashie said. "Huge numbers of African-Americans in this country have ancestors who came through Charleston. This is our Ellis Island. But there's a constant overlooking of this, and people find it very, very irritating. It's not about inclusion until they figure out a way to market it."
Planning for the slavery museum is in its early stages, and no one has yet publicly opposed it. Even Mayor Riley's support and the likelihood that the museum would bring economic benefit to the city, however, may not be enough to erase attitudes that are deeply entrenched here.
"This is a very difficult thing for us to face, not just because of the history itself, but because that history directly shapes the way we look at the world today," said Neill Bogan, a Mississippi-born historian and artist who is conducting research in Charleston. "If we change the way we perceive history, we change what we think of the Confederacy and of this overpowering heritage we've assimilated over generations. That affects politics, social relations and our whole culture. It has implications that people aren't always anxious to face."

Technology Shares Rise Modestly on Light Trading Day

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Technology stocks climbed yesterday as Wall Street bet that embattled chip makers like Intel might turn the corner, but other stocks ended little changed as the murky economic outlook kept investor enthusiasm in check on one of the year's lightest trading days.
 "There's not a great deal of interest out there," said Ned Collins, a trader at Daiwa Securities America. "Maybe the guys that are taking the day off to play in golf tournaments are the ones who were selling last week, so there is nobody left to sell." 
 Goldman, Sachs helped to touch off a modest technology rally by upgrading Intel and other chip makers, but investors remained wary after the chip sector's seesaw performance over the last few weeks. Battered chip makers gained after brokerage houses said a bottom may be in sight, but the rallies lost steam as dismal earnings came back to haunt the sector. 
The Nasdaq composite index rose 25.78 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,982.25, breaking a six-session losing streak. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.34 of a point, to 10,415.91. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 1.13 points, to 1,191.29.
The market has been trading in a range over the last month as investors wait for hints of an economic pickup. The Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates six times this year and is expected to cut them again at its policy-setting meeting next week to bolster growth.
"We know there is a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines waiting to come in, but we need to see better earnings guidance before we see the typical investor recommit to equities," said Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors, which oversees $65 billion.
In a bullish note, Goldman, Sachs added Intel, Analog Devices and Maxim Integrated Products to its "recommended list" in anticipation of a recovery in the sector.
Intel rose 61 cents, to $30.56, helping to lift the Nasdaq and supporting the Dow. Analog Devices advanced $1.54, to $48.99, and Maxim jumped $3, to $51.19. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index, the leading gauge of the sector, rose 1.76 percent.
Oracle, the most active issue on Nasdaq, climbed 53 cents, to $15.69, reversing an early loss. Analysts trimmed their revenue estimates for the company, which said it might have problems meeting earlier forecasts for flat year-over-year revenue in its fiscal first quarter.
In the retail sector, Wal-Mart Stores fell $1.40, to $52.20, and Home Depot declined 36 cents, to $48.10. Both dragged on the Dow ahead of their earnings, which are scheduled to be reported today.
Investors this week will take cues from a heavy economic calendar that includes July retail sales, which are expected to be on the weak side, set for release today. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Bonds gained on expectations that a consumer spending slump will encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates next week for the seventh time this year and again in coming months.
The price of the benchmark 10-year bond rose 6/32, to 100 10/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.96 percent from 4.98 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond rose 3/32, to 98 4/32. Its yield fell to 5.50 percent from 5.51 percent.
Evidence of a consumer spending slowdown may come as soon as today, when the government is expected to report that July retail sales fell 0.2 percent, according to analysts' estimates. 
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: In Tijuana, a New Kind of Drug Peril 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
If ever there was a free market, it is here on Revolution Avenue.
 A short walk from the American border, surrounded by gaudy bars and gewgaws, hundreds of pharmacies sell millions of dollars' worth of medicine for a song. 
 They seem like a godsend to older Americans seeking prescription drugs they cannot afford back in the United States, the only major developed nation without price or profit controls on medicine.
The buyers come from all over, sometimes on tour buses advertising "Mexican drug runs," often carrying shopping lists for friends and family. They find great bargains -- their favorite prescription drugs cost up to 80 percent more in the United States -- and a staggering selection. Generics not found in the United States are available here, where patent protections expire more quickly. So are some new and experimental drugs. Prescriptions for almost anything can be had for a price. 
"Like Alice's Restaurant," said Dr. Elaine Kennedy, an internist from Lawrence, Kan., peering with professional curiosity into the pharmacies on Revolution Avenue, "you can get anything you want."
Business at border pharmacies has been booming since the mid-1990's -- ever since President Clinton's health-care plan collapsed, managed-care and health-maintenance organizations came to dominate American medicine, and prescription drug costs started climbing 10 to 15 percent annually. Though sales slowed this year with the American economy, they may soon rise again. 
Last month the House of Representatives, unable to agree on prescription-drug benefits for older Americans, instead passed a bill allowing them to buy from Mexico by mail or over the Internet.
"Great idea," said Dolores Huff of Maurepas, La., whose husband, Warren, was buying Vioxx, an anti-inflammatory drug, saving $50 on a month's supply.
It may be. But there is trouble in this pharmaceutical paradise. The boom in border pharmacies, driven by American dollars, American drug prices and American health-care policies, has started to generate a global market in counterfeit, adulterated and stolen medicine that mimics the international narcotics trade.
"Companies in India and China are heavily involved in manufacturing counterfeit drugs that eventually make their way to the Mexican border and into the hands of U.S. consumers," said John D. Glover, a former F.B.I. agent who is director of corporate security at the BristolMyers Squibb Company. "Mexican organized-criminal elements are involved in the distribution and sales."
According to studies cited in Congressional testimony, the shelves also hold medicines that have been donated or sold at cost to poor countries, stolen by corrupt officials, then diverted to Mexico.
"The diversion trade seems to be supported in part by frustrated Americans seeking cheaper drugs," including "seniors who are on tight budgets and cannot afford the medications they require," said Donald deKieffer, a Washington lawyer who has investigated the diversion and counterfeiting of drugs on behalf of pharmaceutical companies. He and Mr. Glover recently testified in Congress against mail-order and Internet sales of drugs.
The drug companies oppose the House measure for several reasons, including the threat it represents to their profits. But they point out that criminal practices involving counterfeit and diverted drugs raise the question of whether some border pharmacies, wittingly or not, are selling something worthless -- or dangerous. 
The customer cannot readily know. The man in the white coat behind the counter may be a pharmacist. He may not.
"We have concerns about the quality of medicine people buy," said Richard F. Gonzales, the American consul general in Tijuana. "We understand it's a good deal if people can buy their medicine for 40 cents a pill instead of a dollar. But our question is: how good is this stuff?"
The Americans shopping in Tijuana take it on faith that they are buying the same medicine they would find at home, if they could afford it. Mostly, that is true. No hard evidence suggests that a great deal of the medicine sold here is fake or adulterated.
"Eighty percent of my clientele are older Americans without health insurance, and what they are buying is made by Mexican subsidiary companies of international pharmaceutical corporations, including American companies," said Jacobo Veinbergs, manager of the Medicine Store on Revolution Avenue.
Still, consumer warnings and professional consultations are hard to find at the border pharmacies, and American shoppers may not always know what they are taking. 
Dr. Kennedy, visiting Tijuana on a day trip from a medical convention in San Diego, said she saw "very new, very expensive drugs" for sale, including some "very dangerous drugs" with toxic side effects, "all at bargain prices."
"I have plenty of patients who take the quickest route to Mexico and come back with drugs for themselves and others," she said. "I have raised the question of quality control with my patients, and I think they understand they are taking a risk. And I can see where they would be very inclined to cut corners and buy these medications here."
American and Mexican officials say they cannot quantify or control the traffic in pharmaceuticals. They have other priorities -- cocaine and heroin, to name two. 
Tijuana alone has 1,400 pharmacies making tens of thousands of sales a day. United States Customs agents say that if they tried to enforce conflicting American regulations, the most lenient of which permit importing a 90-day supply of medicine for personal use, they would have to inspect every shaving kit and fanny pack, backing up border traffic beyond the horizon.
Academic and government experts suggest that the cross-border commerce in medicine runs to many hundreds of millions of dollars a year. They say perhaps one-third of all Americans visiting Mexico return with pharmaceuticals, although many lack prescriptions.
And of those who return with drugs, they say, perhaps one-quarter are carrying readily abused sedatives and steroids. An estimated four million Americans are addicted to painkillers, and hundreds of thousands swallow or inject banned anabolic steroids. Those looking to get high or get big, rather than get well, can get anything they want here.
This infuriates Roberto Mota, a pharmacist at the Viva Pharmacy on Revolution Avenue. 
"The great majority of my customers are older Americans coming here for lower prices on cardiac medicine, antidepressants and so on," he said. "Maybe 10 percent are kids looking for drugs, and maybe 10 percent of the pharmacies here will sell them. But it's difficult to say, because it's really impossible to regulate."
At the interestingly named Trip Pharmacy -- "English Spoken. Clean Bathrooms. Free Parking" -- just off Revolution Avenue, an American complaining vaguely of a bad back was instantly offered OxyCotin, a form of synthetic morphine sometimes called "hillbilly heroin" because of its extensive abuse in some rural areas; Vicodin, a painkiller popular in Hollywood; and Valium, Percodan, codeine and several other widely abused and heavily controlled prescription drugs.
No prescription? No problem. And no paperwork: "You know these are controlled substances?" the man behind the counter said. "You know this is illegal?"
At Viva Tijuana, a five-acre shopping center with 40 pharmacies a two-minute walk from the border, one business stands out: PharmVet, ostenstibly a pet-supply store. True, there were six cans of Friskies cat food and a 50-pound bag of puppy chow on display. But there were also rows and rows of anabolic steroids and synthetic testosterone, made in Australia and Mexico. United States law forbids possession or distribution of anabolics for nonmedical use. The American black market is an estimated $400 million a year.
The steroids on sale at PharmVet were supposedly for horses. But the beefy San Diego high school students shopping there were probably not thoroughbred breeders. Neither was an American man in his 30's at a nearby pharmacy who plunked down $258 in cash for two small packets of Sostenon, another anabolic steroid.
"The trouble," said Mr. Veinbergs, manager of the Medicine Store, "is these American kids coming to buy anabolics, or Valium, or Rohypnol," the hypnotic "date rape" drug banned in the United States. "They can find someone who will sell it. You will find unscrupulous people everywhere in this world. You will find corruption everywhere."
But even if a crooked drug trade is creeping up against the low-cost drugstores that bargain-seeking Americans crave, questions of corruption and contraband are beside the point for Dolores Huff and her peers. They say the border pharmacies are their answer to the problem of high-priced American prescription drugs.
"The point," she said, "is the cost. And so long as our public officials and our pharmaceutical companies keep the price of medicine fixed, whenever we go to Mexico, whenever someone we know goes to Mexico, or whenever someone we know has someone going for them, we are going to make a shopping list."

HEADLINE: F.A.A. Orders Troubled Freight Carrier to Suspend Flights 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration forced Emery Worldwide Airlines, a cargo airline with its hub in Dayton, Ohio, to ground its fleet of planes today because of extensive maintenance problems.
 The F.A.A. described a litany of problems with the airline, which it said had accumulated more than 100 violations, mostly for ignoring maintenance problems or fixing things poorly. 
 For example, in February and April, crews reported problems with the cabin pressurization system of one of the airline's DC-10's 17 times before it was fixed. Also this year, mechanics installed the wrong valve on a landing gear hydraulic system, so that the gear would not lower, forcing the crew to skid to a stop on the engine housing on a runway in Nashville. Mechanics were supposed to check the system before letting the plane fly but apparently did not. 
A company spokesman said that the company would fly a full schedule tonight, using contractor airplanes, and deliver all its shipments without interruption. But he also raised the possibility that Emery might never fly again. A spokesman for the pilots' union said that in the current slump in the air freight business the company might have engineered its own suspension as a money-saving move.
The F.A.A.'s action came a week before a scheduled hearing -- now postponed -- by the National Transportation Safety Board into the crash of an Emery DC-8 soon after takeoff from Sacramento on Feb. 16, 2000. The crash killed all three crew members, and the plane exploded in a used car lot that had been crowded a few hours earlier with people attending a car auction. Investigators suspect a problem with an outside company that performs maintenance for Emery under contract. F.A.A. officials said the problems that forced the airline's grounding concerned maintenance by its own mechanics.
The member of the safety board who will conduct the hearing into the Sacramento crash, John Goglia, a maintenance expert, said that the crash "has a number of similarities to ValuJet," referring to the DC-9 passenger plane that crashed in the Florida Everglades in May 1996, killing 110 people. The immediate cause of the crash was hazardous cargo, but a deeper problem was ValuJet's failure to supervise a maintenance contractor -- and the F.A.A.'s failure to supervise either the airline or the maintenance firm. 
"We went through this drill already," Mr. Goglia said. "Why are we back here again? What happened that they didn't get the message?"
The safety board hearing has been postponed because, Mr. Goglia said, he could not get the attention of Emery's senior management at this point.
The decision by the F.A.A. to seek the grounding of Emery's fleet was reported today in The Washington Post.
Emery Worldwide is a subsidiary of CNF Inc., the former Consolidated Freightways. It also builds truck trailers and carries freight by truck and ship, and provides logistics services.
F.A.A. officials said today that the agency had been intensely monitoring Emery since the beginning of 2000 and acted now because it had built a strong legal case and had "a lack of confidence in the carrier's ability or willingness to perform," said Ava L. Mims, the deputy director of the F.A.A.'s Flight Standards Service. 
But an official of the Air Line Pilots Association, the union that represents the approximately 500 pilots at Emery, said the final straw might have been what happened to a DC-8 with a broken fuel gauge on a flight last week from Sacramento to Dayton. One engine shut down for lack of fuel, and the crew decided to land at St. Louis because they did not know how much fuel the plane was carrying.
A company spokesman said he was not aware of that flight.
The union official, Capt. Thomas G. Rachford, said that in the last year and a half the Emery fleet had had 3 depressurizations in flight, 2 occasions on which jet engines stopped working, 25 occasions in which engines overheated, and one case of a main cargo door opening during takeoff. "We were convinced we were going to kill somebody," Mr. Rachford said.
Ms. Mims said the F.A.A. built its case partly on information in complaints from the pilots. Those pilots will now be without work for at least a month and probably much longer. In all, 800 people will be furloughed, the company said.
Mr. Rachford, who said he had flown for Emery for nine years, said that his union would seek to have Emery pilots paid even though the airline was grounded. Senior pilots are paid about $130,000 a year, he said.
Mr. Rachford said that Emery had recently laid off some pilots and wanted to lay off more, and might be seeking to return to the days when all its freight was carried by contractors.
But James R. Allen, a company spokesman, denied that this was the company's strategy and said Emery intended to fly again.
Mr. Allen added, however, that under the terms of the shutdown agreement, the F.A.A. would take the next month to determine what steps Emery would have to take to resume flying.
"We have to take into consideration how much that will cost, and how long it will take," he said. "We need to consider whether these conditions are realistic." He said the company realized it had problems but had been addressing them, and was surprised by the ultimatum it was given last Saturday, to shut down for an "interim" period or face permanent revocation of its certificate to fly.
The company will do what is in the best interest of shareholders and customers, he said, and the F.A.A. "may put a set of conditions on us so onerous that it's not possible."
Last week the company was operating 38 planes, he said, 30 of its own and 8 under contract; tonight it will also fly 38, all contractors, he said.
"There's a recession, not a shortage of aircraft," he said.
Ryanair flies 10 aircraft that it leases from Emery and that are painted in Emery's colors, but are operated under Ryanair's certificate, according to Ms. Mims. They will not be affected by the agreement. Other carriers also fly on a contract basis. 
Mr. Allen said that Emery Worldwide Airlines existed to carry the freight of a related company, the Emery Worldwide Freight Company, and that until this week, 60 percent of the Emery cargo was shipped on the Emery airline and 40 percent on other planes or by truck. The company specializes in packages of 70 pounds or more, he said.
Mr. Rachford said that parceling out the shipments among other small carriers would not help safety; it would multiply the number of operations that the F.A.A. would have to oversee, he said.

HEADLINE: Cendant Buying Cheap Tickets Inc. for $425 Million 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The Cendant Corporation, a company that is one of the country's most creative deal makers, took another step on its plan to become a major Internet travel agency yesterday, agreeing to buy Cheap Tickets Inc. for $425 million in cash.
 Cheap Tickets, based in Honolulu, specializes in deep-discount fares, a portion of the travel industry that is growing as the economic downturn causes business travel to fall off sharply. 
 For Cendant, the deal is intended to expand its rapidly growing array of travel booking services, including Galileo International, a computer reservation network it agreed to buy in June for $2.9 billion. 
In part, Cendant's moves are meant to tap into the rapid rise of Internet travel services, one of the most successful forms of online commerce. They are also intended to send customers to its travel brands, including Avis, Ramada and Days Inn. 
As with its deal for Galileo, Cendant's purchase of Cheap Tickets raises fears that the company will promote its own affiliates at the expense of competing hotel and car rental companies. "If you are Hilton or Marriott, you have to be concerned that your product won't be displayed in a fair and impartial way," said Henry H. Harteveldt, an analyst with Forrester Research. 
Cendant argues that its travel agency and its reservation systems will treat all suppliers equally. At the same time, it promises investors that the deal will help it sell more rooms, cars and bookings in its resort time-share exchange system.
"We are clearly in the business of offering our customers the broadest possible supply and not favoring any one provider," said Sam Katz, the chief executive of Cendant's travel distribution business. 
Built by a former investment banker, Henry Silverman, with the intent to own brand names but few physical assets, Cendant, of New York, franchises hotel chains like Ramada and real estate companies like Coldwell Banker and Century 21. After rapid growth, and a 1997 merger with CUC International, the company stumbled, subsequently acknowledging that it had overstated its revenue.
And it had to retreat from a plan to keep the Avis car-rental brand and reservation system while spinning off ownership of the actual cars into another company.
Cendant already owns a large travel agency that serves members of travel clubs it sells through credit card companies and on the Internet as Travelers Advantage.
The company proposes to chop up the pieces of its acquisitions and reassemble them in typically byzantine fashion. The Internet portion of Cheap Tickets, which represents 40 percent of its bookings, along with Trip.com, a Web site owned by Galileo, will be combined with Cendant's own effort to create an online travel agency called Travel Portal Inc.
Cendant created a particularly unusual structure to keep the cost of building Travel Portal from reducing its profit. The company is actually owned by a trust established to benefit the hotel and time-share operators who have bought franchises from Cendant. While the portal is not legally controlled by Cendant, thus removing its losses from Cendant's income statement, the company is governed by extensive business agreements with Cendant. If Travel Portal does make money in the future, Cendant will be able to buy it.
It hopes to build a full-service online travel agency that will operate using the Trip.com name. It will compete in a crowded field. Barry Diller's USA Networks, which already owns the Hotel Reservations Network, agreed this year to buy Expedia, the No. 2 online travel service, from Microsoft. The Sabre Group controls Travelocity.com, the No. 1 online service. And a number of the leading airlines have created Orbitz.com, which says it has access to special fares not available to many others.
Cheap Tickets will help Cendant differentiate Trip.com by providing access to its own specially negotiated discount fares. Cheap Tickets functions as a consolidator; it buys blocks of air tickets at discount prices from airlines and resells them by phone and over the Internet at a markup. As business travel slows, the carriers are turning more to companies like Cheap Tickets and Priceline.com, as well as their own fare sales, to fill empty seats.
Mr. Katz said Cendant would feature packages combining air, hotel and car rental on which it can make higher markups than on typical travel reservations. Airlines have pushed commissions for Internet sales down to a maximum of $10.
"What we really focus on is making money," he said. "And selling airline tickets is not a great way to make money."
Henry A. Diamond, an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, said that Cendant may also profit by ultimately selling its online travel business, much as it sold its online real estate portal, Move.com, to Homestore.com, for a gain of $600 million.
"The ultimate plan may be to create a travel portal, then monetize that value by selling it to a larger player," Mr. Diamond said. 
Cendant agreed to pay $16.50 for each Cheap Tickets share, a premium of $4.65 over the closing price last Friday. The company declared that the $425 million acquisition price was offset by $145 million in cash it has. 
Cendant said the deal would add 1 to 2 cents a share to its earnings next year and 3 cents in 2003. In 2001, Cheap Tickets expects to sell 2.6 million tickets worth $800 million.
In trading yesterday, Cheap Tickets shares rose $4.48, to $16.33. Cendant gained 42 cents, closing at $19.62.
Jake Fuller, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners, said Cheap Tickets had long needed a parent with deep pockets because it was falling behind both in technology and marketing to richer rivals. "They were a small player that was losing ground," he said. "In the second quarter their Internet bookings were up by 30 percent, but bigger players were growing much faster."

HEADLINE: In Harlem, a Venerated Store Has Nearly Everything Except a Future 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Never have so many people seemed so cheerless at the sight of so many bargains. 
 Bargain World on 125th Street in Harlem is living up to its name in these dog days of August: almost everything in the store is 20 to 50 percent off. But the customers' good fortune is attributable to bad news. The discount department store, which carries just about everything except clothing and food, is closing -- "closing forever," as one sign outside the store says. 
 And so for loyal customers who have shopped at the store for 10, 20, 30 or more years, saving a bit on a baby stroller or new dish set is small compensation for a greater loss. For 40 years, Bargain World has been at the same location, 8 West 125th Street, and it has been an institution. 
It will be missed. 
"I'm angry," said Sarah Brisbane, who has been shopping at the store for 15 years. "They have a lot of old-time things no one else has, like little lampshades for the bathroom. You're not going to find stuff like that anyplace else on 125th Street."
The owner, Arthur Rosen, who took over the business from his father, Abraham, is 57. He wants to retire. His children are not interested in replacing him. He says he spent four years looking for a successor with the right financial backing and retail experience. He found no one.
But he did find a company, whose name he will not reveal, that plans to develop a boutique hotel at the site. The company signed a 75-year-lease.
"I have to provide for my wife and children," he said. 
On July 30, the same day that former President Bill Clinton inaugurated his new office, which is on the same block, Mr. Rosen gathered his 40 employees after work. He told them that the store was closing. 
The news came as a blow. Some of them have worked at the store for decades and view it as a family. Some see it simply as a job, but one badly needed. 
Many said they had no idea what was coming, only that they would be going. Most said they did not know what they would do next.
"For now, I'm going to take it easy," said Daphne Gordon, 52, who has been at the store for 21 years. "Then I'll make a plan."
How to describe Bargain World? It is four floors packed with furniture, sheets, dinette sets, televisions, lamps and light bulbs, curtains, chandeliers and comforters, toys, towels and much, much more. 
It is a place where salespeople know customers and customers know the owners and customers' parents knew the owners' parents. It is the place to go to find the thing you have looked for everywhere -- that bathroom ensemble in red, say -- but can find only at Bargain World. 
"I am shocked because my mom was buying here when Arthur's mother and father were here, and my mom is 72," said Artrelle Dukes, 43, who was waiting to pay for a set of dishes that her daughter would take back to college. 
In line, customers traded rumors about what was coming next. Bargain World has been there through Harlem's peaks and valleys; they did not expect it to go now, just when their neighborhood, and 125th Street in particular, are on an upswing. 
Bargain World survived riots and recessions. It survived an electrical fire in 1980 that burned the building to the ground. The Rosens rebuilt. And they survived a mugging outside the store in 1981, in which the father was pistol-whipped and the son shot in the stomach. They stayed. Abraham Rosen, who opened his first store in Harlem in 1938, retired in 1983 and died in 1996.
His son sought to preserve Bargain World as a store for the community, he said yesterday. He supported the community by sponsoring sports teams and donating to churches and block associations.
That loyalty did not go unrewarded. After a gunman walked into Freddy's clothing store down the street in 1995 and set a fire that killed seven employees, in what police described as a racially motivated incident, protesters descended on Bargain World, saying they wanted the white-owned store to close. But customers came to show their support, and the store stayed open.
Since the going-out-of-business sale began on Aug. 5, the customers have come in droves. "Where will I shop? Where will I find the things I need?" they ask Mr. Rosen. He has no answer for them. 
Many customers said they also worried about employees like Lorraine Myers, 53, who has been working at the store since 1982.
Employees said they had heard that the store would close on Sept. 30. Mr. Rosen said no date was fixed.
Told a hotel was coming in Bargain World's place, Ms. Brisbane said: "We need that like a hole in the head. A hotel. And I bet you I'll never be able to afford it." 
Still steaming, she prepared to take her leave. 
"You must come again before we close," Ms. Myers said from behind the counter.

HEADLINE: Hope and Worry for Young American Woman Held in Genoa 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: GENOA, Italy, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Susanna Thomas, the young New Jersey woman arrested with a group of demonstrators after the Group of 8 economic meeting here three weeks ago, came out of a closed courtroom here today looking exhausted after three hours of questioning by prosecutors.
 As she passed by, she seemed to be trying to pull her mouth into a smile, but could not manage it. 
 Though her official bail hearing was postponed, her American lawyer, Richard D. Atkins, in Philadelphia, said her family, in Warren, N.J., had every reason to hope that she would be released soon. "She came across as very credible today, and the prosecutor asked us to prepare a request for her freedom, which I don't think they would do if they weren't going to grant it." 
Even if the motion is granted, she might not be freed right away, as Wednesday is a public holiday, the Feast of the Assumption.
Andrea Sandra, the lawyer for the 25 arrested as part of Publix, an Austrian theater group that demonstrates with street performances, seemed less optimistic. Mr. Sandra, counsel for a local coalition of peaceful protesters, said today that he was worried because prosecutors did have some evidence that could be interpreted as incriminating.
But the lawyer for the Austrians, Wilfried Embacher, of Vienna, said he expected his 18 clients to be released within 24 hours. He said he was surprised that the group had been unable to get the attention of the American government. "I called the American Embassy, but they didn't care," he said. "If there had been interest in the U.S., maybe Italy would have thought more about it, but there was no interest."
The Genoa police have been accused of brutality in their handling of the protesters. One young Italian man was shot dead in the protests at the summit meeting, about 200 people were injured and some 300 were arrested. Outrage about the police has built across Europe, where thousands have marched in protest.
Ms. Thomas is a Quaker whose family has said she was traveling with the group doing research for her Bryn Mawr senior thesis on nonviolent social protest. Prosecutors have accused Publix of conspiring with the violent Black Bloc anarchist movement that rioted during the meetings. 
Everyone arrested with Publix is a foreigner here, including two other Americans whose names were not released, one Australian, one Swede, two Slovaks and 18 Austrians. They face the possibility of 8-to-15-year prison terms on charges of rioting and conspiring to commit unlawful acts. Bail hearings for most of them were set for today and Tuesday, though no one had yet been released by this evening.
When asked whether he took any comfort in the fact that Ms. Thomas is an American whose case has been highly publicized, Mr. Sandra said no. "I'm not sure these kids are friends of your president," he said.
One problem for the defense, he said, was that the group had been stopped on an obscure mountain road between Genoa and Pisa, with no good explanation for why they were there or where they were going. "Some said Frankfurt, Susanna said Paris, and some made no sense" because they named destinations in the opposite direction, he said.
Ten more demonstrators, Germans stopped separately on the same road, have had their bail hearings and been held over for trial.
Mr. Sandra also said prosecutors are focusing on a meeting some members of the theater group attended in Slovenia, where he said "the police have evidence that pretty clearly there were groups that studied guerrilla warfare."
The parents, Rick and Cathy Thomas, said that their daughter was with the group in Slovenia but had never taken part in any guerrilla training. They and her Italian lawyer, Gilberto Pagani, stressed that nothing that could be construed as incriminating evidence had been found among her belongings. 
Yet Mr. Sandra, who says he has received threats warning him away from the case, said he was concerned that all members of the group could still be held responsible for what the police did find. Spreading out some photos from files on his desk, he mentioned handcuffs and "a very detailed map of Genoa, marking in pen the exact location of the riots, and most unfortunate, pictures of the riots showing they were at the demonstrations all over the city. That's our worst problem."
Then Mr. Sandra headed over to the courthouse, where there seemed to be a party going on.
A handful of protesters against the policies of the Group of 8 and other financial institutions arrived carrying a pony-shaped sign that said, "No Global Trojan Horse," as others applauded. Another man was modeling his anti-police T-shirt "The Real Black Bloc is You" for photographers who came close to outnumbering the protesters.
Off to one side, a woman quietly held a sign that said, "To the police force: Give me back some hope that you're not all fighters and fascists, but at the service of citizens."

HEADLINE: Wall Street May Be Spoiler For New York's Economy 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
To most of the men who would be New York City's next mayor -- and to the current denizens of many municipal offices -- the economic outlook still seems relatively rosy.
 Sure, the national economy is suffering, they acknowledge. Sure, the city's boom may slow a bit. But in interviews and on the stump, the candidates tend to echo professional budgeteers whose fiscal forecast is still "fair to partly cloudy." 
 Two subway stops south of City Hall, however, the economic outlook is distinctly dire. Wall Street is suffering through its worst patch in a decade. Profits are plunging, jobs are vanishing and bonuses are shriveling (for those who stay employed). Analysts who track the securities business stop short of predicting that plagues of locusts will ravage Lower Manhattan -- but only just. 
Given how important Wall Street is to the city's economy -- not to mention its tax revenues -- both forecasts cannot be right. The state comptroller's office estimates that though the securities firms provide less than 5 percent of the jobs in the city, they pay almost 20 percent of the wages.
Thousands of people who work on Wall Street -- perhaps as many as 30,000 -- are facing pink slips, and that doesn't include all the barbers, bartenders and bauble-sellers who depend, indirectly, on Wall Street. Its trade group, the Securities Industry Association, says that each job supports two in other fields, like law, consulting or printing.
That group also predicts that bonus payments will fall steeply this year, by 30 percent or 40 percent. That works out to a drop of roughly $4 billion from last year -- the loss of which would ripple through expensive stores and pricey co-ops to City Hall, which would collect a lot less of the income and sales taxes that have kept its coffers full.
No wonder people who know Wall Street are gloomy -- and not just Michael R. Bloomberg, who once worked on Wall Street and is far more downbeat than his rival mayoral candidates, Republican and Democrat.
Listen to Felix G. Rohatyn, who has been an investment banker, an architect of the bailout that saved the city during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's and, more recently, ambassador to France. The situation on Wall Street "is brutal, and it's going to be very brutal," he said recently. "The city inevitably has to feel it, and the next mayor is going to have to deal with it."
And all the newcomers in City Hall and on the Council are going to have to move fast, he added. The downturn "won't leave a lot of time for practice."
If few of the city's many candidates acknowledge that dreary future, they have some good reasons. One is simply strategic: gloom seldom plays well on the campaign trail. (Nobody wants to vote for Eeyore.)
And there are structural reasons that politicos and financiers seem to live in different economic galaxies. Few investment bankers understand the intricacies of the city budget; few bureaucrats understand the profound changes that are racking Wall Street.
But the combination of incomprehensions worries some watchdogs, who fear that city officials and workers will still be celebrating the boom times long after they've gone bust. "I'm concerned that these years of surpluses have lulled everyone into a sense of complacency," said Marcia Van Wagner, an economist for the Citizens Budget Commission, a civic monitor.
To be sure, nobody is predicting a return to the "Drop Dead" days of the fiscal crisis in the 1970's, or even to the dog days of the early 1990's, when the city lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. For one thing, the recent boom on Wall Street was accompanied by a burst of economic activity outside of Manhattan, which did not happen in the late 1980's. Real estate developers have not been putting up skyscrapers first and looking for tenants later, as they did 15 years ago.
And compared to earlier decades, the city now has a far better grip on its finances -- and plenty of watchdogs looking over its shoulder. "I'd say New York has about the strongest longterm financial planning process" of any major city, said Robin Prunty, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, which gives the city's bonds an A rating. 
One secret of the city's fiscal success in recent years has been to systematically underestimate the amount of money likely to flow into its coffers, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani conceded last month at a meeting of the State Financial Control Board. "Never predict a good year, but always predict a bad year," he said, and you end up with a surplus. "We're not leaving a problem for the next administration."
Fiscal watchdogs think he is probably right for the short term. But one drawback of the mayor's "cry wolf" strategy is that if a wolf actually shows up, many do not believe it.
That could well be a problem in New York City -- and has already helped cause budget impasses in states including Michigan, Wisconsin, Tennessee and North Carolina, said Robert Kurtter, a senior vice president of Moody's Investors Service Inc., another bond rating agency. Legislators in those states had gotten used to discounting low revenue estimates during a decade-long economic expansion, and are finding it hard to accept that this year there won't be extra money, he said.
In New York City, the budget is in balance for this fiscal year, which ends in June, mostly because of a huge surplus left over from the boom times. But the out-years, as they are known in budget lingo, show rivers of red ink: $3.3 billion for the next fiscal year, growing to $4.9 billion in the 2005 fiscal year, according to the city's Independent Budget Office.
It is hard to get worked up about future budget gaps, because they have been forecast for years, and never materialized. Wall Street profits have ridden to the rescue, according to H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller. If that extra cash does not materialize, he warned recently, the city will have to cut at least $1.7 billion -- 25,000 jobs -- and try to get vast amounts of money from the state and federal governments, which may themselves be strapped.
True to his strategy, the mayor predicted that 2001 would be a very bad year for Wall Street. The Office of Management and Budget assumed that securities firms would have profits of just $5.5 billion, down from a record-breaking $21 billion in 2000.
Since these firms have made more than $7 billion just in the first half of the year, according to the Securities Industry Association, some budget officials have argued that there is nothing to worry about, at least in this fiscal year.
The mayor's budget assumes that the firms will make $10.2 billion next year, which is more than they made in 1998 (a bad year for the bond business) but far less than they made in 1999 or 2000. 
Returning to the profit levels of three years ago may not sound so bad -- but for Wall Street, it would be. (And not everyone thinks the firms will make even that much money.) The problem is that the firms pumped up their businesses in the late 1990's, when it seemed as if every amateur wanted to play the market, every tiny company wanted to sell stock to the public, and every big company wanted to buy another big company -- or two or three. 
The securities firms added thousands of analysts, investment bankers, brokers and traders. They paid them billions of dollars in bonuses. They spent money on new buildings, computer systems, advertising and limousines. And now they find that they don't need all those people -- and may never need them again.
"It's very typical of the industry as you get close to the top of a bubble," said Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers. "A year later, when the correction comes, there's a move to put everything into reverse."
Even if the market recovers, no one is expecting the business to return to the level of a year ago. "The shakeout will be completed by the middle of next year, but the growth rate will be only half of what it was," said William C. Freund, director of Center for the Study of Securities Markets at Pace University.
That's because there have been some fundamental shifts in Wall Street's business, analysts and executives say. Amateur investors have been so burned by the bear market that it may take a generation for them to regain interest in stocks. Companies are less interested in doing deals or selling shares, and those that are have increased their demands on the brokerage firms (asking, for example, for big loans from their investment bankers). The one business that has been doing well recently, selling bonds, may be running out of steam.
And trading stocks, which used to bring in the bucks even when share prices fell, has become far less profitable now. That's because regulators forced the brokerage firms to trade shares in pennies, rather than eighths or sixteenths; it may sound like a technical change, but it has taken a big bite out of profits.
So Wall Street has a lot of cutting to do. While the firms have announced more than 20,000 layoffs worldwide, it took a long time for them to start jettisoning people in earnest. So far, securities employment in the city has fallen by only about 5,000, to 185,000, since its peak a year ago.
But firms have been quietly cutting more jobs this summer, and more layoffs are on the way. "There is a sense of more to come, that the likelihood is we'll see additional cuts at the end of the summer," said Joan Zimmerman, an executive recruiter at G. Z. Stephens. "Some people think 15 percent, but it might be higher."
For those who remain, lower bonuses are in store, though the amounts won't be set until the fall. But if they fall by half this year, to $6 billion from $12 billion, "that's sufficient to knock a full percentage point off the growth rate of personal income for the whole state," said Rae D. Rosen, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Like other industries, Wall Street does tend to sing the blues when it wants something from the city (usually tax breaks). In December, the New York Stock Exchange signed a deal with the city and state to build a new trading complex in lower Manhattan -- in return for than $600 million in subsidies.
Richard A. Grasso, the exchange's chairman, said he was not concerned that the new mayor would be less supportive of Wall Street than the current one. "One thing they have all said is that without the New York Stock Exchange, the securities industry, this economy is in trouble," he said.
This may explain why the Street has not seemed to rally behind any one candidate, and why it appears to be treating the election as background noise, as one investment banker put it.
But Mr. Rohatyn said there was another reason why Wall Street was not worried about the mayoral election. "I think the financial world is worried about what will happen to itself," he said. "And it should be."

ROHN SAYS 2001 RESULTS WILL NOT MEET FORECASTS

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
Rohn Industries, a telecommunications equipment provider, warned yesterday that it would not meet its 2001 financial forecasts because of spending cuts by customers amid the global economic slowdown. Rohn, based in Peoria, Ill., estimated that revenue this year could be 15 percent lower than its previous forecast of $300 million, while earnings could be as much as 40 percent lower. Rohn said last month that earnings would be at the lower end of a range of 51 cents to 56 cents a share before one-time items.

 Loudcloud Inc., which manages Web sites for corporations, said it would sell services individually rather than only as a large package. 
Individually sold services will include Web security and database management, said Jeff Kupietzky, general manager of the solutions group at Loudcloud. The change is meant to attract more customers, because businesses are cutting spending amid a weak economy. Loudcloud, founded by Marc Andreessen, above, who helped develop Netscape's Internet browser, cut its fiscal 2002 sales estimate in June to $53 million from $57 million. Stock in Loudcloud, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has dropped 74 percent since March.

HEADLINE: Girl Describes Ordeal of Rape And Captivity 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: FARMINGDALE, N.Y., Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Calling it one of the worst sex crimes they had seen, investigators described today how a Long Island couple lured a 15-year-old Massachusetts girl over the Internet, kidnapped her and sexually abused her for a week.
 The girl, who disappeared from her hometown, Wrentham, Mass., on Aug. 3, was also sexually abused by a friend of the couple, the police and prosecutors said. She was able to get free of her captors after using her cell phone to call the police from the modest brown ranch house where she was being held. 
 At a news conference today, Nassau County officials announced that they had arrested the couple, James Warren and Beth Loschin, and the couple's friend, Michael Montez of Queens.
Officials charged that the girl was abducted by the Long Island couple after she and Mr. Warren made contact in an Internet chat room. 
The police said today that the Long Island couple, who are not married, drove to Massachusetts to pick the girl up and then held her for a weeklong ordeal of sexual, physical and psychological abuse. During the week, the couple loaned their captive to Mr. Montez for two days of sexual slavery in Queens, officials say. 
"In addition to the utter depravity of this crime and the lasting damage such an ordeal inflicts on a child, the fact that the victim and the Nassau defendants met in an online chat room is terrifying to us all, especially those of us who are parents," District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens said in a statement. "It is among the most despicable cases of sexual assault on a minor that I have seen in my 10 years as district attorney."
According to the authorities, Mr. Warren was charged with kidnapping, 10 counts of sodomy, 6 counts of rape and 1 count of sexual abuse; Ms. Loschin was charged with 8 counts of sodomy and 1 count of sexual abuse; and Mr. Montez, who was arrested Saturday, was charged with 3 counts of kidnapping, 5 counts of rape, 5 counts of sodomy and endangering the welfare of a child.
Mr. Warren and Ms. Loschin pleaded not guilty at their arraignment on Sunday. He was held without bail while she was held in $80,000 bail.
Mr. Montez, 35, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment tonight, and was ordered held without bail. 
For a week after the girl disappeared, her parents searched for her. The police in Wrentham posted fliers and e-mailed her and left messages on her cell phone. And a local newspaper wrote a story about her seemingly inexplicable disappearance.
The girl, whom the police did not identify, was discovered on Friday night after she called the Wrentham police on the cell phone. They called the Nassau police, who went to Ms. Loschin's Farmingdale house, where they said the girl had been imprisoned. 
At a news conference today, officials gave a chilling description of the charges. They said that Mr. Warren, 41, of Hampton Bays met the girl about two months ago in an Internet chat room where he discussed sex with her. On Aug. 3, he and Ms. Loschin, 46, drove to pick her up outside a mall where she worked in Wrentham. The torture began immediately, when the couple handcuffed the girl in the back seat and Mr. Warren sexually abused her as Ms. Loschin drove, the police said.
That night, they stopped at a motel in Exeter, R.I., and drugged and sexually assaulted the girl again before driving her to Long Island, where she was assaulted and subjected to "humiliating and dehumanizing acts," mostly in Ms. Loschin's house in Farmingdale but also on the beach in Hampton Bays and in Mr. Montez's home in Astoria, the police said.
Word of the crimes, and of the arrests, came on a steamy day as many children milled around near Ms. Loschin's house in this working-class town in eastern Nassau County. The allegations stunned Ms. Loschin's neighbors. Many cars slowly drove by Ms. Loschin's house on Lockwood Avenue, its front windows hidden by overgrown shrubs and its front and back lawns strewn with garbage. Her family, neighbors said, lived in the house in Farmingdale for about 40 years.
"My comment is that they be put away and the key thrown in the trash," Bernadette Lipari, standing on her front stoop, said of Ms. Loschin and Mr. Warren, her 9-year-old daughter nearby.
The police said they were investigating whether the abduction was part of a wider child-kidnapping ring. They confiscated a computer from the suspects and are examining its files, Detective Lt. Vincent Robustelli of the Nassau police said.
William R. Keating, the district attorney in Norfolk County, Mass., and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are assisting in the inquiry.
"We are still determining whether we will seek additional charges here," said David Traub, a spokesman for Mr. Keating. "And that will hinge at least partially on whether the New York charges address the bulk of the criminal behavior."
Lieutenant Robustelli said that Mr. Warren, a self-employed computer technician, had been arrested in Connecticut in 1979 and charged with risk of injury to a child, and was convicted of assault. 
He was sentenced in 1981 and told the police he served three years, according to Lieutenant Robustelli. The lieutenant said Ms. Loschin, an unemployed accountant, had no prior criminal record.
The victim in the case had had trouble at home with her parents and had run away once before, the police said. So, they said, she initially agreed to go with Mr. Warren and Ms. Loschin. What happened turned out to be more than she ever sought or imagined, the police said.
"She willingly reached out to these people, had conversations with at least one of them in a chat room, agreed to have a meeting with this person and then, from there, I don't think she understood what she was getting into," Lieutenant Robustelli said.
According to the criminal complaint in Queens, the girl was made to wear high heels and black lingerie and delivered to Mr. Montez's third-floor apartment on 38th Street and told that if she did not do what he wanted, the Long Island couple "would beat her more than they already had done and would kill her and get rid of her."
According to the complaint, Mr. Montez stuffed toilet paper in the girl's ears, wrapped bandages around her eyes and ears, put her in a closet, attached a rope to a collar around her neck and tied it and her arms to a clothes rack.
"She cried hysterically," the complaint said.
Last Wednesday, the Long Island couple took the girl back to Farmingdale, the police said. Detective Stephen Hearon of the Wrentham police got a call from the girl on Thursday saying that she was safe and heading to California. She called again at 10:20 a.m. on Friday, saying she was in Los Angeles. She said to tell her mother that she loved her.
But the police traced her signal to a cellular phone tower on Long Island and said they suspected that the girl had been forced to make both calls under duress, as a ruse to throw them off. Then, about 8:55 p.m. that night, she was left alone in the Long Island house and called a third time, saying that she needed help.
"She said, 'You know, I told you before that I was out in Los Angeles? That was not true. They told me to say that. So start looking for me,' " said Detective Robert O'Connell, who was working with Detective Hearon when the girl called. "We asked her to find some mail in the house. She found a package" that provided the address where she was.
Detective O'Connell called the Nassau police, who rescued the girl and made the arrests.
"She is lucky," said Detective O'Connell, who said the couple came back while the girl was on the phone with the police and her call was abruptly cut off. "It definitely could have been a lot worse."

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing Business Friendliness Ranking 

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 New York finished 43rd in the nation in a new ranking of how friendly states are to small businesses and entrepreneurs. The ranking was issued by the Small Business Survival Committee, a Washington group that speaks out on behalf of small companies' interests as well as against government spending it opposes, like publicly financed sports arenas. 
The new ranking was based on 17 factors that the group said can harm a state's business environment and over which state and local governments have influence. They include the burden imposed by taxes, the price of electricity, workers' compensation costs, crime rates and minimum wages. Nevada finished first in the group's survey, followed by South Dakota, Washington, Wyoming and Florida. At the other end of the scale, New York was followed by California, New Mexico, Minnesota, Kansas, Maine, Hawaii and Rhode Island. Connecticut was ranked 33rd and New Jersey 37th. New York has usually averaged about 15th in the country in monthly private-sector job creation statistics, according to Stephen Kagann, the Pataki administration's chief economist, and since 1995 the state has created 805,700 private-sector jobs.

 Officials from both teams thought uneven cutouts in the field could affect players' footing at the 30-year-old stadium. The Eagles are scheduled to move into a new football-only stadium for the 2003 season. 
 Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will decide today if the exhibition game will be made up. Both teams have two games to play within the next 11 days. 
 The starting time, scheduled for 7:30 p.m., was originally pushed back 35 minutes. At 8:09, the stadium announcer said the game was temporarily suspended. Fans, who were offered a full refund, immediately began booing.
 Fifteen minutes later, the game was officially postponed by Peter Hadhazy, the N.F.L.'s director of game operations. No one questioned the decision.
 "It was completely unanimous from everybody's perspective," said Joe Banner, the Eagles' president. "The field is not suitable to playing."
 "We're disappointed. We've been going through this for years. It's not acceptable. The conditions this team is forced to play in are absolutely unacceptable and an embarrassment to the city of Philadelphia."
 The last N.F.L. game canceled without starting was Aug. 19, 1995, at the Astrodome. The San Diego Chargers were unable to play the Houston Oilers because the turf was determined to be unsafe.
 The Eagles, who share Veterans Stadium with baseball's Phillies, use large squares of turf to cover the areas surrounding infield dirt patches. Banner said the problem involved three areas of the new NexTurf, installed for this baseball season, covering the pitcher's mound and first and second base.
 Players noticed the uneven turf during a routine walk-through before the game. Grounds crews added layers of dirt under the cutouts to try to remedy the problem, to no avail.
 "The surface underneath the turf was not smoothed properly, so that when you lay the turf on it you've got, not a ripple, but ruts to the point where it was unsafe," Banner said. "You could twist an ankle or a knee too easily."
 The Vet is notorious for problems with its turf. Numerous players were injured after hitting the surface or tripping over a cutout.
 The quality of the playing surface was such a concern that the league instituted a turf review program to make sure it was up to standards. But those problems were supposed to be resolved when the old surface was torn up after last season and replaced with the softer NexTurf.

RADIO SHOW FOR PARCELLS: Bill Parcells, who coached the Giants to two Super Bowl titles and resigned as coach of the Jets after the 1999 season, is returning to broadcasting, this time with his own weekly football show on Sporting News Radio.
 The "Bill Parcells Football Show"will feature Parcells in an hourlong show along with the Boston Globe columnist Will McDonough and the radio personality Bruce Murray, the Sporting News Radio spokeswoman Jennifer Hadden said yesterday. The show will make its debut Sept. 6 and broadcast Thursdays at 5 p.m Eastern, she said, with the final show on Jan. 24.
 Mark Gentzkow, vice president for programming and broadcasting of Sporting News Radio, declined to discuss the terms of the deal. Parcells, who has worked for NBC-TV, could not be reached for comment.
 Sporting News Radio, based in Northbrook, Ill., has a network of more than 400 stations nationwide, including Boston, New York and Los Angeles.

DOLPHINS EDGE BUCCANEERS: Mike Quinn's 43-yard touchdown pass to Robert Baker on the final play of the game gave Miami a 17-14 preseason victory over Tampa Bay last night.
 The tipped game-winner capped a sloppy night for the Bucs, who sputtered offensively in quarterback Brad Johnson's debut for the team many consider the favorite to represent the N.F.C. in the Super Bowl.
 Joe Hamilton's 6-yard touchdown pass to Aaron Stecker gave Tampa Bay a 14-10 lead with 1 minute 9 seconds remaining, but Quinn promptly marched Miami into position to win the game.

SCHOTTENHEIMER SEARCHING FOR A QUARTERBACK: Burdened by two injured quarterbacks, Washington Redskins Coach Marty Schottenheimer is trying to find another arm for Friday night's game against Atlanta.
 Jeff George has tendinitis in his shoulder, and Todd Husak strained a rib muscle during warm-ups before Sunday night's 20-0 loss in Kansas City.
 Schottenheimer says he is not looking to trade. Instead, he is limiting himself to a crop of unemployed veterans, including Danny Kanell, Jim Druckenmiller, Moses Moreno and the former Redskins quarterback John Friesz.
 The only other quarterbacks in camp are the fourth-round draft pick Sage Rosenfels from Iowa State, who played most of the second half Sunday night, and the undrafted rookie Mike Watkins from Louisville.

SEAHAWKS' SPRINGS OUT WITH TORN HAMSTRING: Seattle cornerback Shawn Springs could miss four to six weeks with a torn left hamstring, Coach Mike Holmgren said.
 Springs, selected to the Pro Bowl in 1998, was injured during the first quarter of the Seahawks' 28-21 preseason loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday. Holmgren said the Seahawks will get a second opinion on the injury, which could force Springs to miss the start of the regular season. Seattle opens the season on Sept. 9 against the Cleveland Browns. (Bloomberg News)

JAGUARS' BRYANT TAKEN TO HOSPITAL AFTER PRACTICE: Jacksonville cornerback Fernando Bryant, who was ill with the flu, was taken to the hospital after practice yesterday when he complained of dizziness.
 Despite being sick, the 24-year-old Bryant practiced yesterday afternoon in 92 degree temperatures, with humidity that made it feel like 103.
 The team spokesman Dan Edwards said Bryant felt lightheaded at the team dinner, and trainers called an ambulance to take him to Baptist Medical Center, where he was hooked to an IV to replenish fluids. Edwards said Bryant was taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Says It Plans to Eliminate 3,500 Jobs in the Coming Year 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Citigroup Inc. is planning to eliminate 3,500 jobs in the coming year as slumping financial markets bite into the company's profit, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Citigroup said a $177 million charge taken in the second quarter would cover severance payments for the workers laid off. About 2,150 of the jobs to be eliminated are in the United States, Citigroup said in a quarterly filing to the S.E.C. The cuts amount to 1.4 percent of Citigroup's 242,000 employees at the end of 2000. 
 Citigroup is paring its work force as the financial-services industry tries to cope with its toughest year for profits since 1994.
"If revenues for the brokerage group don't accelerate after Labor Day, we think more meaningful expense reduction in employment is likely," said Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, which cut investment bankers this year. 
Citigroup's chairman, Sanford I. Weill, had kept Citigroup's profit growing as the economy slowed by buying businesses and reducing costs. Citigroup's earnings per share have risen more than 25 percent each year since 1999.
This month, Citigroup bought Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival S.A. for about $12.5 billion to expand in the faster-growing Mexican market and to help market products to Hispanic customers. Last month, it bought European American Bank in New York for $1.95 billion.
Earnings growth is expected to slow this year, in part because of the halting economy. Profit from operations in the second quarter rose 13 percent, to $3.79 billion, or 74 cents a share, driven by earnings at consumer businesses. Citigroup's consumer businesses include Citibank and Travelers' insurance.
Mr. Weill said in July that the company had cut 1,800 jobs this year at its Salomon Smith Barney investment bank and its Citibank corporate banking business.
So far in 2001, laying off employees has cost the company almost $300 million. The company took a $101 million charge in the first quarter to cover the costs of dismissing 1,200 employees, mainly in the investment bank.

HEADLINE: Outlooks Vary at Europe Ad Companies 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Two large European advertising companies reported first-half results today that offered starkly different views of the sharp downturn in ad spending.
 The Cordiant Communications Group of Britain, whose clients include Heineken and Hyundai, said there were few signs that ad spending would soon recover as the slowdown in North America spread to Europe and Asia. 
 By contrast, the Publicis Groupe, the French company that created a campaign to introduce the euro, offered a more bullish outlook, saying that ad spending could pick up late this year. 
Analysts tended to take Cordiant's more cautious view of an industry that has been bludgeoned by a steep decline in spending.
"We're not seeing any turnaround yet," said Neil Blackley, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "We don't expect to see year-over-year growth until the second quarter of 2002."
Some analysts noted that Cordiant, in offering a more bearish outlook, might be trying to regain credibility after previously setting targets that were too aggressive. Cordiant had originally forecast 5 percent revenue growth this year. In June, it advised analysts to lower their estimates, and it said today that it expected revenue for all of 2001 to be flat. Excluding acquisitions, revenue grew 0.2 percent in the first six months of the year, to $:209 million ($298 million).
Cordiant, which owns Bates Worldwide in the United States, also said it would take a $14.3 million charge this year to cover the elimination of hundreds of jobs.
"We're telling it how it is," said Michael Bungey, Cordiant's chief executive. "There is no upturn as far as we can see this year, and there is increasing evidence of softness in Europe."
Helping insulate Publicis is an aggressive push for new business; United Airlines and VoiceStream are among its new clients. So far this year, Publicis lags only the WPP Group in net new billing dollars, according to Credit Suisse First Boston.
For the first six months of the year, Publicis reported $1.3 billion in net new business, compared with $300 million at Cordiant.
Moreover, Cordiant has greater exposure to some volatile markets in the Asia-Pacific region. It is, for example, the leading agency company in Australia, a market that has had a severe downturn the last year. 
Publicis, by contrast, derives less than 10 percent of its revenue from the region. The company, which owns Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide among other agencies, said that billings, excluding the effect of acquisitions, grew 6.3 percent, to 7.5 billion euros ($6.7 billion), in the first six months of the year, outpacing the 2 percent average growth for the industry. Billings include the total amount of money spent by clients; revenue is only the portion of billings directly attributable to the agency.

Delusions of Prosperity

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; Thomas L. Friedman is on vacation.

 BODY:
Three years ago, after the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, U.S. financial markets were in crisis. For a few weeks it looked as if the economy would succumb to panic, to self-fulfilling pessimism. Then the Fed surprised the markets by cutting rates without waiting for its next scheduled meeting. Confidence was quickly restored, and Alan Greenspan was promoted to demigod status. 
 But it has been more than seven months since Mr. Greenspan tried to work his magic a second time, again surprising the markets with an inter-meeting cut. Since then he has cut again and again. Yet the Fed's latest survey of the economy offers few signs that a turnaround is imminent. 
 This slowdown, it turns out, is different. We are not in the midst of a financial panic, and recovery isn't simply a matter of restoring confidence. Indeed, excessive confidence may be part of the problem. Instead of being the victims of self-fulfilling pessimism, we may be suffering from self-defeating optimism.
 The driving force behind the current slowdown is a plunge in business investment. It now seems clear that over the last few years businesses spent too much on equipment and software, and that they will be cautious about further spending until their excess capacity has been worked off. And the Fed cannot do much to change their minds, since equipment spending is not particularly sensitive to interest rates. 
 Still, as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers says, you don't have to refill a flat tire through the puncture. To reflate the economy, the Fed doesn't have to restore business investment; any kind of increase in demand will do. 
 How might demand increase? Consumers, who already have low savings and high debt, probably can't contribute much. But housing, which is highly sensitive to interest rates, could help lead a recovery. Even more important would be a turnaround in the U.S. trade balance. America's deficit has lately been running at 4.5 percent of G.D.P., three percentage points higher than it was as recently as 1997. Reversing that trend -- which would mean both exporting more and buying domestic instead of imported goods -- could deliver a big boost to the economy.
 But there has been a peculiar disconnect between Fed policy and the financial variables that affect housing and trade. Housing demand depends on long-term rather than short-term interest rates -- and though the Fed has cut short rates from 6.5 to 3.75 percent since the beginning of the year, the 10-year rate is slightly higher than it was on Jan. 1. The trade balance depends on the value of the dollar -- and the dollar, which usually falls when the Fed loosens monetary policy, has actually risen over the past seven months. 
 There are, I would argue, three reasons that the dollar and long-term interest rates have not moved in the right direction. First, for what it's worth, Bush administration officials have been saying all the wrong things. I don't know if anyone in the financial markets still takes Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill seriously, but his extravagant statements on behalf of a strong dollar -- he recently declared that if he changed his mind on the subject, he would hire Yankee Stadium and a brass band to announce it -- are the opposite of helpful.
 Second, the Bush tax cut -- which offers only small tax cuts in the near future but promises much bigger cuts in the more distant future -- is exactly the kind of fiscal policy that you would expect to drive up long-term interest rates and have a depressing effect on the economy. 
 Most important, however, is the way both long-term interest rates and the dollar have been sustained by investor optimism -- by the belief that Mr. Greenspan can do again what he did in 1998. This belief deters investors from buying long-term bonds, because they expect interest rates to rise again; it induces investors to keep buying dollars, because they are still bullish on America. And so optimism, paradoxically, helps keep the bad times rolling.
 Sooner or later, of course, investors will realize that 2001 isn't 1998. When they do, mortgage rates and the dollar will come way down, and the conditions for a recovery led by housing and exports will be in place. But for the time being delusions of an instant return to prosperity stand in the way of a real economic turnaround.

HEADLINE: From Alberta, Energy's Good Guy (And Bad Guy); 
The Premier Is Happy To Supply U.S., but Insists On Key Role in Decisions

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: CALGARY, Alberta 

 BODY:
The oil industry here was still in its infancy when Ralph Klein was growing up. So instead of working on oil rigs, as many young Calgary men do nowadays, he spent time laying concrete sidewalks with his father, Phil, a part-time masonry contractor who also wrestled on the professional circuit under the name "Killer Klein."
 "Sometimes he was the good guy," Mr. Klein said of his father's wrestling persona, "but usually he was the heel." 
 Now that the younger Mr. Klein is the premier of Alberta, Canada's leading energy-producing province -- a chunk of mountains, prairies and forests larger than France that holds vast amounts of oil and natural gas -- he spends a fair amount of time visiting the oil rigs that have become the symbol of Alberta's economic success. And like his father, he has developed dual identities, at least when it comes to exploitation of the province's natural resources. 
Usually, he seems to be one of the good guys, the friendly fellow with cowboy boots and a big grin who dropped out of high school but went on to become premier. That was the face he wore when he recently visited Washington and told Vice President Dick Cheney that Alberta was ready to sell as much energy as the United States wants to buy. He then invited Mr. Cheney to fish the Bow River.
Although Mr. Cheney has not yet decided whether to cast a line in the Bow, Washington welcomed Mr. Klein because his willingness to deal fits well with President Bush's plan for a continental energy policy aimed at reducing dependence on oil from outside North America.
But when he needs to, Mr. Klein, 59, is ready to play the heel. He has made clear that he will try to block future energy deals with the United States if Alberta's interests are not taken sufficiently into account. And he has the power to do so.
Canada's Constitution makes Mr. Klein a kingpin of Canadian energy. Provinces, not the federal government in Ottawa, control most natural resources. And Alberta has most of Canada's energy resources.
"We would intervene," Mr. Klein said in an interview. For instance, he said, he wants any natural gas pipeline from Alaska that passes through his province to give local refineries the chance to strip away some byproducts used to make petrochemicals. That may be, he acknowledged, "a self-serving interest," but it is one on which he would not give an inch.
In recent years, Canada's energy wealth has been spread around a bit. Atlantic provinces have started producing offshore oil; a natural gas pipeline has been built from Sable Island off Nova Scotia to Massachusetts, and demand is rising for electricity from Quebec's dams.
But Alberta remains the mother lode of Canadian power. The province produced 65 percent of Canada's crude oil, 80 percent of its natural gas and 100 percent of its bitumen, a usable oil made from Alberta's inland sea of oil sands -- the largest such deposits in the world.
In some respects, Alberta is already the equivalent of a North American energy sheikdom. The province supplies more than 900,000 barrels of oil to the United States every day, and sends 2.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas a year across the border, some of it going as far as Brooklyn.
Mr. Klein, as Alberta's leader, has been eager to keep open the valves that allow energy to flow across the border to the United States.
But if he disagrees with decisions made elsewhere, he could become one of the biggest roadblocks to Canada's participation in a continental energy policy. He recognizes the right of the Canadian government to sign international agreements, he says, but insists that Alberta and the other provinces be closely involved in negotiations from the beginning.
"Not including the provinces would be like Joe and Peter talking about selling Ralph's house without Ralph's involvement," Mr. Klein remarked.
Canadian officials -- used to wrestling with the provinces over jurisdictional matters -- have so far been careful but firm in responding to Mr. Klein's demands for a seat at the energy-policy negotiating table.
"When it comes to representing Canada in any international forum, obviously that is the responsibility of the government of Canada," said Ralph Goodale, the federal minister of natural resources, "and we will discharge that responsibility on behalf of all Canadians." Mr. Klein's anxiety about being excluded from the negotiating table is misplaced, he said, because at this time there is no table.
"There is no continental energy policy as such," Mr. Goodale said. "What we're pursuing is an expansion and the proper functioning of the North American energy markets."
Whatever the effort is called, the United States is intent on securing further stable sources of energy to help ease potential shortages like the one that disrupted California early this year. A task force led by Vice President Cheney concluded that one of the best ways to enhance the United States' energy security is to increase the flow of oil, natural gas and electricity from Mexico and Canada, partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement that already provide a significant portion of American energy needs.
Canada was the United States' largest source of foreign oil last year, providing 15 percent of imports. Mexico, which provided roughly 12 percent, was not far behind the second- and third-leading suppliers, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
In natural gas, Canada -- and Alberta -- dominate. The United States imports about 15 percent of the natural gas it uses, and most of that comes from Alberta.
Mr. Klein, of course, is not the only public official involved in pursuing a continentwide energy policy. After meeting in April, President Bush, President Vicente Fox of Mexico and Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada agreed to form a North American Energy Working Group, made up of senior officials from each country.
The group convened for the first time in Washington at the end of June and set an agenda for a number of issues including pipeline construction, cross-border power regulation and research into new technologies.
Of all those involved, few will occupy a more prominent position than Mr. Klein. Yet, unlike Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush, who have worked extensively in the energy industries, most of what Mr. Klein learned about energy comes from his time in office and before that as a local television and radio reporter.
"It's impossible to be in the news business here without knowing something about the oil industry," he said.
After 11 years as a popular local television personality, known to haunt Calgary night spots and show up late for work, Mr. Klein ran successfully for mayor of his hometown. He was re-elected twice, in 1983 and 1986, and played host to the 1988 Winter Olympic Games here.
In 1989 he moved to the provincial legislature, and became Alberta's environment minister. His style of governing is often described as laid-back, and voters seem to find it easy to identify with him. In 1992 he was elected leader of the provincial wing of the Progressive Conservative Party, and later in the year was sworn in as premier of Alberta.
He has been re-elected twice; in fact he has never lost an election. Mr. Klein is now Canada's senior province leader, and one of the country's most popular politicians.
In his approach toward government and public spending, Mr. Klein is considered a close cousin to fiscal conservatives in the United States. He was the first of Canada's province leaders to successfully attack government spending, whittling down the deficit and reducing taxes. Alberta is the only province without a local sales tax, and its personal income taxes are the lowest in Canada.
"He understands this province very well, and he knows what works and what doesn't work in politics," said David Bercuson, a professor of political science at the University of Calgary. "Ralph has the knack of listening to people."
For instance, when an energy-deregulation bill took effect early this year and prices spiked, Mr. Klein pushed a $4 billion rebate through the legislature to cover the added costs and then some. The rebates helped a number of Albertans avoid paying anything for energy this past winter.
Not everyone was pleased. "Investing $4 billion in energy efficiency initiatives would have been a better use of the money than dishing out checks," said Robert G. Hornung, policy director of the Pembina Institute, an environmental research center in Alberta. "But there was a provincial election this spring, and the two events were unquestionably related."
Mr. Klein's budget-roping skills owe plenty to the energy boom in Alberta. Rising prices for oil and natural gas have produced a flood of revenue.
And recently, American oil companies have scooped up Albertan producers, taking advantage of the weakened Canadian dollar to secure a position in the further development of Canada's energy resources, as was the case with the $4 billion purchase by Conoco of Gulf Canada.
"There's no question that the industry is pleased with the direction the Alberta government has traveled," said Brian C. Dutton, an oil and gas analyst with UBS Warburg in Toronto. 
Of Canada's 10 provinces, Alberta is in many ways the most like parts of the United States. In attitude and approach to business and to taxes, Alberta has more in common with Texas than with neighboring Saskatchewan.
"The oil industry quite frankly wouldn't have evolved and wouldn't be where it is today, had it not been for American companies," Mr. Klein said. "When you go to the Calgary Petroleum Club, you think you're in Texas."
The continued influx of Americans into Calgary has even forced the Petroleum Club's general manager, R. J. Thomas, to relax the dress code, allowing open-neck shirts all week instead of just on Fridays. The club recently added a stage and Las Vegas lighting to the upper-floor dining room.
"It's the big look, American-style," Mr. Thomas said.
Mr. Klein's attitudes are a far cry from the National Energy Program of the 1970's (when Mr. Chretien was Canada's energy minister and tried to keep American hands off Canadian energy.)
Nobody in Ottawa is now thinking of reviving the National Energy Program, but federal officials are wary of wildcat provincial leaders. They are also sensitive to efforts to overhaul the regulatory process on Canada's side of the border in any way that appears to undermine Canadian sovereignty. And all plans to expand Canada's energy exports will be reviewed by environmentalists.
Mr. Klein's name is regularly heard as a potential leader of the national Progressive Conservative Party, but he says he is happy to remain in Alberta.
And while his predecessors have sometimes been called "blue-eyed sheiks," Mr. Klein said he preferred to avoid any of the obvious nicknames.
The Sultan of Oil Sands? The Prairie Potentate?
"Call me Ralph," said "Killer" Klein's plain-speaking son. "Just Ralph."

HEADLINE: Russians Resist Rumsfeld Effort To Set Aside ABM Treaty 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld met President Vladimir V. Putin and his defense minister today for talks that threw into sharp relief the disagreements over whether to deploy missile defenses, how to slash nuclear arsenals and whether arms control talks can even be the tool to bridge their differences.
 It was a day when Mr. Putin spoke of negotiations and Mr. Rumsfeld spoke of consultations to create a new relationship in which treaties are unnecessary. 
 When Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov said any missile defense deployment would have to be tightly linked to reducing warheads, Mr. Rumsfeld only agreed that the two issues were related.
"We still think that the ABM treaty is one of the major important elements of the complex of international treaties on which the international stability is based," Mr. Ivanov said.
Later, Mr. Rumsfeld urged again that "the Antiballistic Missile Treaty be set aside, and new arrangements between our two countries be established, so that we will in fact be able to take steps to no longer be vulnerable to handfuls of ballistic missiles."
But in welcoming Mr. Rumsfeld to the Kremlin, Mr. Putin said that the treaty was unequivocably a part of the security relationship between the two countries and that it was bundled with current treaties that limit nuclear arsenals. "For us, it is unconditionally linked with both the Start II and Start I Treaties," he said, referring to strategic arms reduction treaties negotiated between Washington and Moscow. "I would like to underline that."
If the two countries are to move forward in their talks, Mr. Putin said, Russia requires specifics on proposed levels of offensive weapons, a timetable for cuts, understandings on verification and transparency and confidence-building. In essence, Mr. Putin was demanding detailed and formal negotiations. 
Mr. Rumsfeld demurred. Afterward, he said, "With respect to how these discussions and consultations will evolve, I think that's an open question." The absence of cold war hostilities simply makes arms talks unnecessary, he added.
President Bush, after meeting Mr. Putin last month in Genoa, ordered his national security team to begin consulting with Russia on missile defenses and reducing arsenals. The president envisions a framework of relations that would dispose of treaties and seek to bind the United States and Russia more broadly and more loosely through trade and economic and military ties.
A senior Pentagon official said, "The dialogue is proceeding as we expected it would." Mr. Rumsfeld stressed that he would not discuss specific proposals for shrinking the offensive arsenal because a strategic Pentagon review will be completed "in the next month or two." Asked to describe the direction the study would push the arsenal, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "There is no doubt in my mind that we'll be able to go down to substantially lower numbers." 
Mr. Rumsfeld also said the United States could not possibly brief the Russians on its exact plan because it is in initial research, development and testing. The tentative schedule for testing is widely expected to violate ABM limits by late next spring.
Mr. Rumsfeld's mission was to illustrate the administration's broader approach to security ties with the Russians, and he trumpeted the virtue of investment.

HEADLINE: Bush Says He Will Veto Any Bill Broadening His Stem Cell Policy 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Aug. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he would veto any legislation that tried to push federal support for embryonic stem cell research beyond the parameters he has specified, which confine public financing to stem cell "lines," or self-sustaining colonies, already derived from embryos.
 Mr. Bush said his speech on the issue last week, in which he opposed government financing of research on any additional stem cells and the further destruction of embryos that extracting them would entail, outlined "what I think is right for America, and any piece of legislation that undermines what I think is right will be vetoed." 
 "I spent a lot of time on the subject," Mr. Bush added as he spoke to reporters after a ceremony on his ranch for the signing of legislation giving agricultural businesses and farmers $5.5 billion in additional federal aid this year. "I laid out the policy I think is right for America. And I'm not going to change my mind." 
Since Mr. Bush announced his decision, in a television address on Thursday night, it has been questioned by advocates on both sides of the issue.
Opponents of any federal support for the research, including many social conservatives, have said that Mr. Bush must not go a millimeter further than he already has, and his words today offered them reassurance, which may prove unnecessary. Although a bill in the Senate would allow federal financing for the extraction of more stem cell lines from frozen embryos that are to be discarded, such legislation is unlikely to gather momentum this year. Research supporters, in Congress and among patients' advocacy groups, say they want to see if scientists find the existing stem cell lines sufficient before mounting any new campaign.
But many lawmakers and scientists hope that Mr. Bush might take a broader approach in the future than he has so far. In his speech, he articulated such strong sympathy for the view that frozen embryos be used that it seemed, until the end of his remarks, that he might endorse it.
Administration officials have said over the last several days, however, that Mr. Bush meant to close off that possibility, and his own comments today were an emphatic confirmation.
They also amounted to a pledge that, in the opinion of many scientists, he may ultimately be tempted to break. If the research on stem cells progresses quickly enough, then it is possible that by 2004, when he would be running for re-election, discoveries based on private research using newly derived embryonic stem cells could lead to clinical trials of new therapies. And Mr. Bush could find himself in an uncomfortable position if he refused to let federally supported scientists participate in those studies.
"People have got all kinds of opinions," Mr. Bush acknowledged today, later adding: "Understand that there's a moral issue -- moral issue, plus there's a chance that we can save people's lives. And I've laid out the path to do that."
As Mr. Bush signed the farm legislation today, and mused yet again about the meaning of his month away from the White House, he repeatedly spoke of the American heartland and the "values" it represented. That word, which he used at least a dozen times, is music to many social conservatives' ears.
"We want our families to be on the farms and ranch," Mr. Bush said from a podium set up amid the 1,600 acres of his property. "After all, farm families represent the best of America. They represent the values that have made this country unique and different -- values of love and family, values of respect for nature."
Before he spoke, country music blared from speakers as an audience of more than 40 Texas farmers and their families sat on stacks of hay and watched Mr. Bush drive toward the podium in a white pickup truck. He emerged in an outfit of brown boots, blue jeans and a green open-collar shirt.
The bill he signed provides $5.5 billion for agricultural businesses and farmers beyond the regular appropriation for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. 
"It's necessary," Mr. Bush said, asserting that agriculture was "part of our national security mix," because not producing enough domestic food for Americans would "complicate our foreign policy."
But what Mr. Bush was providing with a stroke of his pen was $2 billion less than Democrats had wanted. It was also less additional aid than Congress had appropriated and President Bill Clinton had approved in each of the last three years.
Administration officials said it was nonetheless sufficient, citing increases in livestock and crop prices in recent months that eased what had been a crisis for many farmers.
Mr. Bush has billed his monthlong hiatus from Washington as a journey "home to the heartland." His activities and remarks here, as well as those planned for a trip he will take to Colorado and New Mexico in coming days, consistently allude to what he casts as solid, steadfast American values.
All of that is intended to turn a month away from Washington into a continuing political statement. 
"To me, to be out on the land helps a president keep perspective," Mr. Bush said today. "You know, I haven't been a president all that long, but I can assure you, perspective is important."
Mr. Bush's plentiful oratorical gumbo of "heartland" and "values" references has at times forced him and his aides to answer questions about whether they are extolling some regions of the country over others.
"Washington is a great town," Mr. Bush said. But, he added, "the strength of the country is in our heartland."
Then, seemingly backpedaling a bit, he said, "There's a lot of people, wonderful people, that live on the coast of the country."
As the president mingled several times with reporters today, he also said he was monitoring various world events from his ranch. Asked about Argentina's economic woes, he said that administration officials were holding meetings about it "every single day" and that his administration's message to the government there was that it must "implement the reforms that recently passed through their legislature."
He also applauded the signing today of a political settlement in Macedonia. In fact, he mentioned it at first as a way of changing the topic of discussion from stem cell research, which he indicated that he had, for now, said everything about that he cared or planned to say.

HEADLINE: Remembering a Tax Cut, And Revisiting a Debate 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: GOLETA, Calif., Aug. 13 

 BODY:
On a fogbound summer morning 20 years ago today, at a simple leather-topped table outside his mountain ranch house here, Ronald Reagan signed the landmark package of tax and budget reductions that he hoped would be a centerpiece of his administration and a cornerstone of his White House legacy.
 Today, on a cloudless California afternoon, with checks from the biggest federal tax cut since Mr. Reagan's landing in mailboxes nationwide, his son Michael and a few dozen fellow keepers of the flame came here to celebrate what the younger Mr. Reagan, in a live broadcast of his nationally syndicated radio talk show, called "the largest tax cut in the history of mankind." 
 "Because Ronald Reagan did this in 1981, you're able to get your tax cuts today," Michael Reagan, 56, said in a brief ceremony before the broadcast on the lawn of Rancho del Cielo, his father's beloved ranch in the sky. "Because somebody followed up in the future, G. W. Bush."
Politicians debate the costs and benefits of President Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut, with Republicans and Democrats worrying about the ways in which it will force curbs on spending for their pet projects from missile defense to health care.
And partisans of both camps have never stopped debating the effects of Mr. Reagan's 1981 tax cut, and the deficits it helped spawn when promised spending cuts failed to materialize.
The Young America's Foundation, the conservative group that bought the Reagan ranch three years ago to use in its mission of inspiring conservative values in college students nationwide, sponsored today's events, and left little doubt about its view. It issued handouts crediting the Reagan tax cut with prompting the economic boom of the past 20 years and with creating so much new wealth that, when the cold war ended, a windfall in tax revenues turned budget deficits to surpluses.
"We feel this is where Ronald Reagan's ideas came to life, and this was the most important day here," said Floyd G. Brown, the foundation's executive director and a former Republican political operative best known for creating the Willie Horton television commercial used against Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign. "That's why we bring young people up here to keep his ideas alive."
Mr. Reagan's first guest on his radio program today, former Representative Jack Kemp, the legislative author of the tax bill, telephoned from a meeting in Aspen, Colo., to praise the current tax cut as fine, as far as it goes. But he noted that it was to be phased in over 10 years and that, "I think we should have cut capital gains taxes in half."
For their part, Democrats are quick to note that by as early as 1982, President Reagan himself was forced to ask Congress for a tax increase to help offset what could have been disastrous budget consequences, and subsequent tax increases under George Bush and Bill Clinton undid most if not all of the rest.
Now, as they have for most of the past 50 years, total federal, state and local taxes stand at more than a quarter of the gross national product, a reality that the Reagan cuts only briefly dented.
But marginal income tax rates remain capped at 40 percent, well below their past highs, and there is little support in either party for raising them.
"Without putting too much emphasis on '81, one thing that did come through was an emphasis on lower rates as the primary way to improve the efficiency of the tax system," said C. Eugene Steurele, who was a top tax policy official in the Reagan Treasury Department and is now a senior fellow at the Urban Institute in Washington. "The push toward lower rates in exchange for a broader base was a relative improvement."
Economists may debate the relative size of the Reagan and Bush tax cuts, with some contending Mr. Reagan's was much bigger and others arguing they were about the same, but historians may have little trouble deciding who had the better ranch. Mr. Bush's spread is 1,200 acres near dry and dusty Crawford, Tex. But Mr. Reagan's 688 acres here are lush, shaded by glens of live oaks, with mountain and ocean vistas sweeping away from every bend in the road.
For Michael Reagan, whose 90-year-old father is confined to his home in Bel Air in Los Angeles by Alzheimer's disease, today was bittersweet.
It was his first broadcast since the death of his older sister, Maureen, of cancer last week, and he choked up at one point in recalling that it was she who "made me a Reagan," by urging her parents, Ronald Reagan and his first wife, the actress Jane Wyman, to adopt a boy.
It was also only his second visit to the ranch, the scene of family Thanksgiving dinners, since his stepmother, Nancy Reagan, decided to sell it.
"For such a long period of time, I just didn't want to come up here," Mr. Reagan said in an interview before the broadcast in the enclosed porch of the ranch house, surrounded by the family's furniture, his father's Secret Service baseball cap, and many memories. "I was really hurt when it got sold. I was actually ticked off, because I just thought it was one of those things that would stay in the family for generations. So I stopped coming."
Then Mr. Brown, who himself once was a host on a conservative talk show in Seattle, persuaded Mr. Reagan to come take a look at the Young America's Foundation's preservation efforts, and Mr. Reagan said, "When I see it, I see Dad."
Some 100 college students nationwide, along with local Republican supporters, paid their own way to come to today's ceremonies and were shuttled up a winding 7-mile mountain road that leads from the Pacific Ocean to tour the simple white stucco ranch house, the oldest part of which was built in 1872. Mr. Reagan remodeled it extensively himself, laying paving stones and building wooden corrals and fences.
"You have to come out and see it to see how he actually lived," said Sean Clark, 21, a senior political science major who came with his friend Justin Wade, 22, an engineering major. Both said most of their fellow students and their professors "hate" Mr. Reagan, and both can barely remember his presidency, but they have come to admire him by comparison with current leaders.
"He was somebody you could look at and say, 'Wow, he's our president,' " Mr. Clark said.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 16, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about a ceremony at Ronald Reagan's former ranch to commemorate the 20th anniversary of his tax and budget reductions misstated the size of President Bush's ranch in a comparison. The Bush ranch is about 1,600 acres, not 1,200.

HEADLINE: RESTAURANTS; 
At a Hip New Hotel, Food to Write Home About

BYLINE:  By William Grimes 

 BODY:
SOME chefs are highly imaginative but can't quite seem to make their dreams come true on the plate. Others have a firm grasp of the fundamentals but don't have any brilliant ideas. (Type 2 is twice as valuable as Type 1.) Then there are the chefs, like Rick Laakkonen at Ilo, who seem to be effortlessly inventive but solidly grounded in the fundamentals of flavor, texture and harmony. No matter how wild his flights of fancy, they wind up seeming natural, even inevitable. Everything works in an understandable way. Ilo, a Finnish word meaning something like "bliss," is in a hotel. This, too, seems both natural and inevitable these days. New York's buoyant economy has translated into a hotel boom, which in turn has translated into a new generation of hotel restaurants that have redefined the category. As recently as a decade ago, a hotel restaurant was staid, formal and luxurious. It served French food to an elderly clientele. 
 The new boutique hotels and sharp entrepreneurs like Ian Schrager have changed the rules. To make an impression, a new hotel in Manhattan must be designed to the hilt. If downtown, it must transmit a supermodel vibe. Supermodels don't actually have to show up, but it is vital that the hotel's design suggest in every possible way that they might. There must be a slouchy lounge and bar. And there must be a serious restaurant on the ground floor. There is simply no other way. 
 A restaurant like Town, Olives, Thom or DB adds allure to a hotel. The hotel, if the right people stay there, adds allure to the restaurant. This may be a rare instance of genuine synergy. Whatever you call it, it has changed the face of dining in New York.
Ilo, in the Bryant Park Hotel, follows the script. Two sidewalk planters with long twigs bundled tightly into cubes strike a contemporary note of high-design desolation. A lounge scattered with low-slung settees and served by a small bar draws a dedicated afterwork crowd of an indeterminate age -- not too young, not too old. The transition from lounge to restaurant is minimal. Six stone steps run the breadth of the lounge. Ascend them, and you are in Ilo. It's as uneventful as walking from the living room into the dining room in a private home.
Ilo does not hit you over the head with its intentions. But there's an early tipoff. The restaurant pours a 1990 Pommery Champagne by the glass from a magnum bottle. This extravagant gesture, pure indulgence, sets the tone. The giggles and whoops from the lounge say "funny-colored martini." The soft pop of a Champagne cork in the restaurant, and tiny, civilized bubbles, says something very different.
Mr. Laakkonen, who cooked most recently at the River Cafe, and before that at Luxe and Petrossian, creates complex dishes that seem simple. He knows how to coax pure flavors from his ingredients, and how to keep those flavors clear and distinct. The traffic never gets snarled. Major ingredients bask in the spotlight. The busy supporting cast contributes a witty remark here, a colorful phrase there, but the actors manage not to step on each other's toes. Artichoke soup, despite an arresting bird's nest of sliced mushrooms and truffles in the center of the bowl, and cloudlike puffs of the soft Sicilian cheese called serro, remains deeply, profoundly, essence of artichoke. Grilled quail, as meaty and tender as any in recent memory, stand out heroically from their busy tableau, where a feather-light cheese flan is surrounded by spicy minced peppers, chilies, coriander and lime.
Mr. Laakkonen loves odd ingredients. His "tidal pool" may simply be an excuse to use percebes or goose barnacles, a tube-shaped Spanish delicacy, with a texture like octopus, which shares bowl space with Olympia oysters, sea urchin, wakame seaweed, and silver ear and wood ear mushrooms. A stunning broth, poured at the table, poaches the oysters and sea urchins. The pool, it turns out, is a teeming seafood fantasy, with each pristine tidbit afloat on a little ocean.
Ilo's rabbit shows that a dish can be rustic and rarefied at the same time. The rabbit is done country style, pan-roasted with olives and accented with oregano and preserved lemon. The slick addition here is cannelloni stuffed with sheep's milk ricotta that's flecked with bits of bitter dandelion. Every ingredient in the dish is as humble as a wooden shoe. The orchestration makes it perfectly at home on a white tablecloth. Sea scallops, seared to a crisp and then surrounded by artichokes, morels and pearl onions, are thoughtfully served with chewy chickpea pappardelle that are ideal for the mopping-up phase.
I often flinch at tasting menus, since everyone at the table eats the same thing, a critic's nightmare. But I made an exception when I saw the special beef menu at Ilo, and I was richly rewarded. The portions are mercifully calibrated to a normal appetite, and I was relieved to see the beef feast begin with a small but eye-catching terrine of oxtail wrapped in ribbons of beef tongue and topped with a concentrated beef gelee. Pickled green tomatoes and pearl onions made a tart, refreshing relish. When a steaming casserole of tripe arrived, thickened with black chickpeas and spicy chunks of chipolata in a fino sherry sauce, I was solidly behind Mr. Laakkonen on the beef question. And I thanked him silently for choosing a chilled apricot soup for dessert.
The soup is a regular on the dessert menu. It is a blazing slick of yellow, punctuated by a bright red stack of cherry sorbet disks topped with an orange tuile. Patrick Coston, who did the desserts at Mercer Kitchen, has a taste for bright, tart flavors, and he gives it full license in a multipart citrus showcase, intended for two diners, that includes blood-orange granite, warm orange cake, lemon layer cake and vanilla-lime parfait. I'm not sure that anyone needs quite that much citrus, although the components, taken individually, score high on the pleasure scale. Still, halfway through the plate, I began hankering after the almond and butterscotch gateau, glazed with caramel, and the strawberry and passion fruit tart, with its sweet pool of pistachio anglaise.
Ilo's cheese cart is a serious, well-organized but not overwhelming affair with some unusual, even quirky cheeses. One of the surprises is maccagnette alle noci, a flat, circular, walnut-crusted cheese from Lombardy that tastes a lot like salami. The wine list, as the Pommery might suggest, is well thought out, and the sommelier, Kim Anderson, presents it in an unusually informative and ingratiating way. She has opinions, and she doesn't waffle around when asked for them. It's worth waving her over, because the 250 or so wines on the list include many unusual grapes (gagliopo and negroamaro come to mind) and lesser known regions. Where, exactly, do you find a Cotes du Marmandais? Madeira needs a missionary, and it has one in Ms. Anderson, who is happy to pour an 1834 malvasia or a 1795 terrantez.
Manhattan has always specialized in culture shock. The new hotel culture may be the most powerful signal yet devised to tell visitors they have come to a different place. The restaurant off the lobby is no longer the place you avoid. It's the place you can't get into.

The Bank of Japan said today that it would further loosen credit in an economy in which short-term financing can already be raised at virtually no cost.
 The move stunned analysts and investors, who expected the bank's governor, Masaru Hayami, and its policy board to continue resisting calls by politicians and others for looser money. The announcement came after a two-day meeting of the policy board. 
 To inject liquidity into the financial system and help fight deflation, the bank said it would step up its purchases of government bonds 50 percent, to 600 billion yen ($4.9 billion) a month. And it will increase the target amount of cash to be kept on deposit with it by the nation's commercial banks 20 percent, to 6 trillion yen ($49 billion). This money is reinvested in the short-term money markets. 
Both steps were taken to expand the money supply and the ability of financial institutions to lend and invest. They were the first by the central bank since March, when, somewhat reluctantly, the policy board reduced short-term interest rates essentially to zero and also increased the target for banks' deposits with it. Mr. Hayami had repeatedly said that those steps were adequate.
But evidence of deterioration in the economy has been accumulating, as are signs that the global economic slowdown is taking a toll in Japan, leading many economists here to conclude that an eventual loosening was inevitable. Few, however, expected it now. 
Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Hayami noted that Japan's production was falling, corporate earnings were dropping and capital investment was waning. Economic softness in the United States is likely to linger for a while, he said, while credit deterioration and worries about the soundness of Japan's big banks have beaten down bank stocks.
"One cannot help but think that the downside risks to the economy are becoming a reality," Mr. Hayami said, summing up the policy board's reasoning. "We judged that we are now in a phase that requires additional easing measures." 
Because Mr. Hayami had consistently said that new measures by the bank were unnecessary, most analysts expected no change in bank policy before autumn.
The surprise announcement sent stocks soaring, with the Nikkei 225-stock index rising 440.39 points, or nearly 4 percent, to 11,917.95.
But analysts doubted the moves would have any long-term effect on the markets beyond the shock value of a day or two.
Atsushi Mizuno, chief economist at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo, said the timing of the meeting had played a role in the decision. The board, which usually gathers every other week, had no more meetings scheduled until mid-September. "That," he said, "made the risk of waiting even greater."
But he, too, wondered how much practical impact would come from trying to pump money into the economy through the banks.
"Banks are writing off bad loans and lending less, so total lending is declining," he said. "The central bank is boosting lending to those who do not need money. The excess money has been flowing into government bonds." 
Mr. Hayami said he also was uncertain of the impact of today's moves.
"I don't know to what extent the measure will stimulate companies, generate greater demand and raise prices," he said. "But for the moment, this is all we can do."
Mr. Hayami denied that the board had given in to government pressure. But analysts said they detected a whiff of political compromise in his remarks.
Though there is no room left for interest rate reductions to help the situation, Mr. Hayami said the bank-reserve target could be raised further if necessary. 
But he ruled out setting an inflation target, a policy both politicians and investors have called for.
"Inflation targeting is something you do when you have inflation," he said. "I have never heard of it being carried out during times of deflation."
Perhaps more to the point, analysts said, Mr. Hayami wants the central bank to avoid being held hostage to too many numerical goals.

HEADLINE: School Vouchers Along the Color Line 

BYLINE:  By David A. Bositis; David A. Bositis is senior political analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a group that researches issues involving black Americans.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For the past 10 years, African-Americans have been caught up in the school-voucher debate. Many black parents have become desperate for solutions to the problems of their children's schools. Vouchers are one solution being offered, and many black parents have grasped at them. But this is less an endorsement of vouchers than an indication of how bad some schools have become.
 Each year between 1996 and 2000, I conducted parallel national surveys of African-Americans and the rest of the population on education issues, including school vouchers. More African-Americans supported school vouchers than opposed them, and blacks consistently supported them more than whites did. In October 2000, 57 percent of blacks supported vouchers but only 49 percent of whites did. 
 But it seems clear that black support for vouchers is mainly a rejection of the status quo -- that is, poorly performing schools and students -- rather than an endorsement of this particular reform. Surveys by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies over the past five years showed the dissatisfaction. Only 38 percent of blacks rated their local public schools as excellent or good, while 23 percent rated them as poor and the balance considered them fair. The 1998 survey also included a number of questions on the financial aspects of school vouchers, and the responses clearly indicated that many respondents had no concrete idea what a voucher program might look like.
There are other twists to this interesting story. Three-quarters of African-Americans younger than 35 supported vouchers, as did 62 percent of those between 35 and 50. However, blacks older than 50 oppose vouchers by 48 percent to 44 percent. Politically this is important, because older people are far more likely to vote than are younger people. And because most African-Americans are reluctant to vote for Republicans, Democrats who oppose vouchers may not risk losing many black votes as a result.
Whites have a somewhat different take on vouchers, though their generational differences about vouchers are similar to those of blacks. Older whites don't like the idea -- they are even more hostile to vouchers than are older blacks. In my most recent survey, 52 percent of whites over 50 opposed vouchers while 41 percent supported them.
But white suburbanites bring a very different perspective to the voucher debate. They like their local public schools. Over the past five years, the surveys I have conducted found 57 percent of whites rating their local public schools as excellent or good, while only 14 percent rated them as poor. While a plurality of whites (49 percent) favor school vouchers, that support is based more on partisanship and ideology than on a rejection of the education status quo.
So younger African-Americans support vouchers, and people over 50 -- white and black -- as well as white suburbanites are generally cool to them. With that juxtaposition, if you were to call Las Vegas for the line on this issue, I don't think there would be much question about the odds. And whenever school vouchers have appeared as a ballot issue, the public has said no.
Virtually all black leaders oppose school vouchers. Conservatives often suggest that these leaders are out of touch with the black public. That is certainly not true if you limit the black public to those who tend to vote, an older group.
It is also said that black leaders are in thrall to teachers' unions. However, I think concern about unions is a comparatively small part of their opposition. If white conservatives are pushing school vouchers, then black leaders are generally going to be suspicious. In their view, white conservatives, traditionally, have cared so little about the lives of black Americans that when they do manifest concern the black reaction should be to look for a hidden agenda.
Many white Southerners, for example, withdrew their children from public schools in reaction to desegregation. Many black leaders -- and older blacks who can recall the era of massive white resistance to desegregation -- believe school vouchers would represent a transfer of public money to subsidize those white parents who prefer that their children attend all-white schools.
However, as this generation passes, it is possible to imagine further growth in black support for school vouchers. The kind of thorough reform that would improve public schools -- for black children and everyone else -- still lacks real momentum and, with state budgets in distress, the necessary money. Politicians appealing to middle-aged and younger black voters might find vouchers a good way to promise change without having to find much money to pay for it. They might also attract white voters for the same reason -- with the additional, if unstated, appeal of school reform without integration.
Many white Americans today seem to be comfortable with segregation in schools (and elsewhere), though a line is drawn at intentional or explicit discrimination. Vouchers may be well suited to reinforcing this pattern. Older white conservatives and African-Americans, with their longer memories, can perhaps imagine this prospect more easily; but it would be younger Americans who would have to live with it.

U.S. Trade Deficit Worries I.M.F.

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund said today that the United States' broad trade deficit, the current account, was unsustainable and could put the dollar's value at some risk.
 In an annual assessment of the American economy, the I.M.F. did not reach a conclusion about its direction, saying that the outlook was uncertain and depended on several factors. 
 "Directors indicated that the size of the U.S. current account deficit did not appear sustainable in the longer term," the report said, "and that it raised concerns that the dollar might be at risk for a sharp depreciation, particularly if productivity proved disappointing." 
The current account is the broadest gauge of trade in goods and services, and reflects the reliance of the United States on inflows of money from abroad. It has been running at more than 4 percent of the gross domestic product for the last few years, a level some specialists say cannot be sustained. Despite the economic slowdown, the deficit has not substantially decreased.
On the currency markets, the dollar dropped against the yen and the euro today after the report was released. In New York, the euro settled at 90.23 cents, up from 89.79 cents on Monday. The yen strengthened to a rate of 121.74 to the dollar, from 122.48 late Monday.
"In the current environment, where the dollar is on the defensive," said Bob Lynch of BNP Paribas in New York, "they did catch the market a little off guard, and ended up weighing on the dollar." 
The I.M.F. report, without making forecasts, said that productivity and confidence in the consumer and business sectors were the keys to the future of the United States economy. 
It added that although evidence suggested a favorable outlook for productivity, a less optimistic outcome could pose a "significant challenge" for American policy. Business productivity rebounded in the second quarter, up 2.5 percent.
The I.M.F. said it welcomed the flexible policy stance that American authorities had taken, in particular the Federal Reserve's aggressive easing of interest rates. It said this easing might have to be continued if the economic data remained weak.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Fall a Bit, Despite Home Depot's Strong Earnings

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks retreated slightly yesterday as an upbeat earnings report from the home improvement retailer Home Depot failed to erase concerns over the flagging economy.
 "Pragmatically, the best thing you can do is sit on your hands," said Donna Van Vlack, director of trading at Brandywine Asset Management, which oversees $7 billion. "There is just nothing compelling out there." 
 Better-than-expected retail sales in July fed the hope that the main engine of economic growth in the United States -- consumer spending -- is still holding up. Home Depot's earnings rose 10 percent, beating Wall Street estimates. 
But Wal-Mart Stores reported a scant 2 percent increase in profits. The company also warned that its third-quarter profits would land at the low end of forecasts.
The market has been trapped in a tight trading range in the last few weeks as skittish investors have demanded clearer evidence of an economic recovery before spending money on stocks. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates six times this year to revive the economy and is expected to cut them at its next policy-setting meeting on Tuesday.
The Nasdaq composite index lost 17.72 points, or 0.89 percent, to end at 1,964.53. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 3.74 points, or 0.04 percent, to 10,412.17. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 4.56 points, or 0.38 percent, at 1,186.73. 
"We are in a period of transition, and when you are in a period of transition, you are not going to get continuous direction," said John Davidson, the chief investment officer at Circle Trust, which has $8 billion under management. "I would advise people that if they wait, they are going to have greater certainty, but they will be getting in at higher prices. Ultimately, this market will drift higher."
Home Depot, a component of the Dow, rose $1.20, to $49.30. Wal-Mart, another component of the Dow index, rose 16 cents, to $52.36. The S& P retail index gained 0.93 percent, as retailers proved to be one of the few bright spots during the session.
The chip equipment maker Applied Materials fell $1.16, to $43.65. After the markets closed, it reported third-quarter earnings that beat analysts' estimates, and it rose to $44.88. The data storage company Network Appliance was off $1.23 at $12.76. It reported a small first-quarter operating profit after the close, and its shares rose to $12.90.
Mitchell Energy and Development rose 31 percent after Devon Energy said it would buy the company. The deal will make Devon the second-largest United States independent natural gas producer behind the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. Mitchell jumped $14.18, to $59.83, while Devon added 50 cents, to $50.76.
Best Buy moved up $2.80, to $61.09. The retailer plans to buy the Canadian electronics retailer Future Shop for $377 million.

Treasury Prices Flat
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Bonds erased early losses as investors concluded that signs of stronger retail sales left intact the prospects for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week.
"The Fed is not going to stop cutting rates, and simply hope for the best," said Mitch Stapley, who manages $4 billion at Fifth Third Investment Advisors in Grand Rapids, Mich.
The price of the benchmark 10-year note was unchanged at 100 10/32. Its yield was also unchanged, at 4.96 percent. The 30-year bond was unchanged at 98 4/32. Its yield held steady at 5.50 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

HEADLINE: Budget Dispute Stalls a Plan to Build New Schools 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Battling overcrowded schools and a rapidly dwindling construction budget, the New York City Board of Education has been in need of some bright ideas.
 More than a year ago, the Schoolhouse Foundation, a nonprofit group, presented one. It proposed selling bonds to build new schools without using any of the Board of Education's construction budget, then leasing the buildings to the school system for 15 to 20 years before turning them over, debt free. 
 The proposal generated enthusiasm in City Hall and at the Board of Education headquarters in Downtown Brooklyn, and a presentation on the plan was put on the board's agenda for March 15, 2000. But the presentation was canceled, and more than a year later, the project has yet to be approved. The Schoolhouse Foundation has firmed up plans for raising up to $200 million from private investors to build three schools -- an elementary, a middle and a high school -- and has secured an option to buy several acres in Forest Hills, Queens, the area with some of the city's most overcrowded schools. 
The proposal remains on the drawing board, apparently caught up in a budget dispute between Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy and City Hall. For the lack of a few million dollars -- essentially the cost of starting the construction -- $170 million of new school construction is postponed, at least temporarily. 
Board of Education members said they had expected that the proposal would be ready for their approval at their Aug. 20 meeting. "I think it is a great idea," said Ninfa Segarra, president of the board and an appointee of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "Whenever we can come up with alternative ways to expand the number of schools built, we welcome it." 
David Klasfeld, the deputy chancellor for operations, said yesterday that the proposal was "a valuable project that we're trying to see if we can proceed with." 
The foundation is the brainchild of Kevin McCabe, who worked for more than two decades in city government, recently as chief of staff to the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone. He left that job in 1998 to run Mr. Vallone's campaign for governor. Since then he has been working in the entertainment field, developing amphitheater projects in Portland, Ore., Minneapolis and New York.
Mr. McCabe describes the foundation's purpose as more than just shaking up the field in New York City. It is also to inspire others, in the city and across the country.
"School overcrowding is a huge issue nationwide," he said. "We want to break the ice and be the people who set some precedents for a different way to build schools."
Turning the construction of public schools over to private companies or community groups has been done before, most recently in Niagara Falls, N.Y., where Honeywell similarly built a new school, which it has leased to the city.
But while those efforts have usually involved one building, the scale of Mr. McCabe's first project is much larger: three schools, serving more than 2,300 students from kindergarten through 12th grade, spread across a single campus at Metropolitan Avenue and 69th Avenue in Forest Hills. 
Leelai Demoz, executive director of the foundation, said that if the preparation of the land got under way this fall, construction could begin in the spring and the schools could open in fall 2003.
To pay for the construction without tapping the school construction budget, the Schoolhouse Foundation plans to raise up to $200 million by selling tax-exempt bonds to private investors through the city's Industrial Development Authority, with the help of J. P. Morgan Chase. The foundation would then lease the schools to the Board of Education for the term of the bonds, probably 15 or 20 years, using the lease payments of $12 million to $14 million a year to pay the interest and principal on the bonds. After the bonds are retired, the buildings will be sold to the board for $1.
The plans for the schools were already under development at the School Construction Authority. The use of the land has been approved by the City Council. The property is owned by Forest City Ratner, which several years ago had intended to build a multiplex theater on the site, a project that was vigorously opposed by neighborhood residents and ultimately by the Giuliani administration. It has granted an option, which runs through September, to the foundation to buy the property.
Even if it gets under way, the success of the project is by no means certain. For starters, the staff of the Schoolhouse Foundation is hardly crowded with construction experts. Its executive director, Mr. Demoz, is an actor and documentary film producer whose short subject about Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African singing group, was nominated for an Academy Award this year. 
But Mr. Demoz and Mr. McCabe said the project would rely on an experienced construction manager and was likely to be closely watched by the School Construction Authority. 
Though the Schoolhouse Foundation has been in the works for at least two years, it could hardly be getting under way at a more propitious time, it would seem. Last week, Mr. Levy announced that according to the latest estimates from the School Construction Authority, the Board of Education faces a $2.8 billion shortfall if it tries to complete all of the projects in its current five-year, $7 billion plan for school construction and renovation, which runs through June 2004. One likely solution is to eliminate or delay some new school projects. Given that prospect, Mr. McCabe said his proposal was particularly timely.
But Board of Education officials say that because of problems involving not the capital budget, but the board's separate $11.5 billion annual expense budget, they are not sure that the board can afford to make the lease payments required to get the foundation project going. 
The advantage of the Schoolhouse Foundation's proposal is that the Board of Education could use its annual expense budget to pay the cost of leasing the schools, producing schools that could accommodate 2,300 students but leaving the troubled capital budget unencumbered. But Mr. Levy has been fighting Mayor Giuliani and Mr. Vallone over the size of the expense budget. Mr. Levy asserts that the recently approved expense budget actually leaves the school system with $120 million less than it had in the school year that ended in June. The difference, Mr. Levy has said, comes from mandated salary expenses and other cost increases, including inflation.
The foundation's proposal would cost the Board of Education about $180,000 a month for the first few years, or $2.2 million a year, which represents the cost of leasing the land while construction gets under way. Thereafter, the annual cost would be $12 million to $14 million. But with a $120 million budget gap, that may be too much to spare, even for a project that would deliver $170 million worth of new schools.
Mr. McCabe is no stranger to the intrigues of city government. But he retains cautious optimism that the project will soon be breaking ground.
"We'd like to set the example for other people who might be discouraged by the size and scope of the system," he said, "and show there are alternative solutions to big problems."

HEADLINE: Cars and Fuel Kept Sales From Rising Last Month 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Retail sales were flat for a second consecutive month in July, held back by slumping auto purchases and lower gasoline prices, the government reported today. But gains outside those sectors showed consumers were still willing to spend.
 The Commerce Department said retail sales apart from cars and trucks rose slightly, climbing 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.2 percent in June. Sales of motor vehicles and parts dropped 0.5 percent in July, reversing a 0.5 percent gain in June. 
 Analysts and the stock markets viewed the overall report as mildly bullish, reflecting an unbowed consumer sector. Stocks initially rallied on the numbers but then gave up ground on earnings concerns later in the session.
"While consumers are no longer spending every penny they have, they are still visiting the malls," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
Economists had expected retail sales to dip 0.2 percent in July. Without autos, they had forecast that sales would edge up 0.1 percent.
The overall figure was also dragged lower by the fall in gasoline prices. Purchases at gas stations fell 4.2 percent, the largest one-month drop since data collection began in 1992. Because retail sales are not adjusted for price changes, the effect was to depress the overall sales figure. Excluding sales at gas stations, total July sales rose 0.3 percent.
Economists watch retail sales closely because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. Consumer spending has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise lackluster economic picture recently. The economy grew at an anemic 0.7 percent pace in the second quarter.
Where the economy heads in the third and fourth quarters will heavily depend on how well the consumer sector holds up, and economists see some encouraging signs in the July report.
"It's marginally better than we thought," said Carol Stone, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New York. "Moderate increases in store groups other than autos and gas stations looked pretty good."

Earnings Beat Expectations, Applied Materials Reports

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, August 14 

 BODY:
Applied Materials, the world's largest manufacturer of chip-making equipment, reported third-quarter earnings today that beat Wall Street's expectations by 2 cents a share but said it could predict no end to the industry slump. 
 With a decreased need for semiconductors worldwide, sales at Applied Materials were cut in half over the last 12 months. Revenue for the third quarter, ended July 29, were $1.33 billion, down from $2.73 billion in the period a year earlier and $1.91 billion in the second quarter. 
 Tight controls over spending, however, allowed the company to edge past its own profit forecasts and analysts' grim predictions. Applied Materials reported earnings, excluding one-time items, of $41 million, or 5 cents a share. Wall Street had expected earnings of 3 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
In a conference call after the release, analysts congratulated the company's management team for offering a pleasant surprise -- a rare occurrence these days. But their expectations have been lowered significantly since last year, when chip makers, trying to keep up with record demand for their products, bought as much equipment as Applied Materials could build.
Applied Materials, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said its earnings declined 85 percent from the second quarter and 93 percent from the third quarter last year, when it earned $604 million, or 70 cents a share.
James C. Morgan, the chairman and chief executive, said the company was continuing to spend heavily on research and development in preparation for an eventual upturn in the business. But he could not predict when that might happen.
"The industry continues to bounce along at the bottom," Mr. Morgan said.
Indeed, Applied Materials booked $1.21 billion in new orders, an 11 percent decline from the second quarter, and 63 percent less than in the period last year. Joseph R. Bronson, the chief financial officer and executive vice president, said he expected orders to continue at roughly the same level during the current quarter.
Sue Billat, a senior analyst with Robertson Stephens, praised the company for reporting 40 percent gross margins and profit of 5 cents a share during such a steep slowdown, and doing it without major layoffs. The company's work force declined to 19,000 employees, from 20,000 in the second quarter. "These guys are warriors," Ms. Billat said. "I think they did a marvelous job in tough times."
Shares in Applied Materials lost $1.16, or 3 percent, to close at $43.65 before the earnings release. After hours, they rose to $44.90. 
The chip equipment industry is often the last and hardest hit in a widespread high-technology slowdown. When corporations and consumers stop buying electronic devices like cell phones and personal computers, those manufacturers reduce their purchases of chips. When that happens, chip makers slow their purchases of the manufacturing equipment. But analysts said that Applied Materials' strength has been its ability to gain market share during a downturn and maintain it when the environment improves, and many expect that to happen again.
The downturn comes at a time when chip makers are changing their manufacturing processes more drastically than usual, as they move from aluminum wiring to copper, from 8-inch silicon wafers to 12-inch, and from 0.18-micron circuit lines to 0.15 micron and less.
The slowdown, coupled with decreased efficiency as the company learns to make equipment for these new technologies, contributed to a decline in Applied Materials' gross margins, which fell to 40 percent, from 45 percent in the second quarter and 51 percent in the third quarter last year. Mr. Bronson, the chief financial officer, said he expected gross margins to improve as the company became more comfortable with the new technologies.

HEADLINE: Attacks Raise Fears in Haiti Of Uprising By Ex-Soldiers 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Deadly attacks on the police by gunmen in military uniforms have raised fears here that remnants of the disbanded army may be preparing a bid for power a decade after ousting the country's current president in a coup.
 Five police officers were killed and 14 wounded on July 28 when the gunmen stormed police installations in the capital and in three provincial towns, shouting, "Long live the army!" 
 At the funeral for officers killed in the raids, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide urged former soldiers not to join any attempts to overthrow him.
"Don't let yourself be manipulated by people who are thirsty for power," President Aristide told the gathering. "In the first years of the 21st century, it's time not to militarize power but to democratize power." 
Haiti's army has been feared since it was founded in 1915, during a United States occupation that lasted until 1934. Before being disbanded in 1995, the army relentlessly pillaged the public treasury, overthrew governments and tortured citizens.
The army also trained some of the top leaders of the Tontons Macoutes, the paramilitary force employed by Francois Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude Duvalier, to keep an iron grip on the country for nearly 30 years. Today the only national security force in Haiti is its police.
The army's return could bring a violent uproar to a poverty-stricken country that has been trying desperately to temper disorder and strengthen a nascent democracy.
Mr. Aristide and members of his political party, Lavalas Family, have frequently said that "certain sectors" are plotting a coup.
"They haven't gotten it out of their heads yet," the president of the Senate, Yvon Neptune, said shortly after the assaults last month, "and they still think that it is possible for the army to return."
Fueling those suspicions are public statements from some former military officers.
"In all countries the military has a role: ensuring stability in the country," said Himmler Rebu, former commander of a special unit that tried to overthrow President Prosper Avril in 1989. Mr. Avril himself had seized power in a coup and was charged in June with the torture and false arrests of opposition members in 1989 and 1990.
"Haiti needs a military," Mr. Rebu said in a recent interview. "The real security of the country is the army."
Haiti's army overthrew Mr. Aristide in a coup in 1991 and then, with the support of paramilitary forces, terrorized his strongholds. Thousands of Haitians are believed to have been killed in the turmoil.
After Mr. Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, regained power with the backing of American troops three years later, he disbanded the army and replaced it with a civilian police force.
The military's former officers are scattered through the police force and the government. Senator Dany Toussaint, a former police chief, and Richard Salomon, a close Aristide ally, are among those with military backgrounds.
The political opposition group Convergence, an eclectic 15-party alliance that includes some of Mr. Aristide's right-wing foes who aided his overthrow, now argues that the police force is corrupt, understaffed and controlled by Mr. Aristide.
In February, Convergence named Gerard Gourge "provisional president" of Haiti in a move to challenge President Aristide's authority. In March, Mr. Gourge rallied nearly 1,000 former soldiers in a demonstration to call for the army's return.
"In principle, we support the need for the military to return," said Jose Jacques Nicolas, a Convergence member who represents the National Christian Movement for Haiti. "It's a necessity for the country, for the country's political organization, for the country's development. A country without a military force is left to be destroyed."
But Mr. Nicolas said that he condemned much of the former army's behavior and that a new military would have to be better organized and more professional.
Convergence has not pushed for the army's return during its weekly news conferences, which suggests a division over the issue. Micha Gaillard, a member of the leftist National Congress of Democratic Movements, also a part of Convergence, said the army was not crucial to achieving Haiti's security goals.
"It's not necessary to bring back the army," he said, "but to integrate the former soldiers into the police to give security to the population."
Human rights workers agree. They say that Haiti is not an attractive target for a foreign military takeover, that there are no outside threats and that a military would succumb to the same political temptations as the police force. The answer, they say, lies in reforming the police force.

HEADLINE: F.T.C. Begins Inquiry Into Unocal's Patents 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission has begun an investigation into whether the Unocal Corporation engaged in anti-competitive practices in developing patents for the production of cleaner-burning gasoline, officials at the commission and the company said yesterday.
 The inquiry is the latest chapter in a protracted fight between Unocal, an independent oil company, and many much larger oil conglomerates about whether Unocal had the right to patent processes to make cleaner-burning fuels and whether the companies should be paying royalties on those patents. 
 The companies, backed by a number of experts, contend that the elaborate efforts their refineries must make to avoid running afoul of Unocal's patent claims have slowed the refining process, limiting supplies of cleaner gasoline and driving up prices. Unocal strongly denies that its patents contribute to higher fuel prices. 
The F.T.C. began the investigation into Unocal, based in El Segundo, Calif., after a request that ExxonMobil filed in March. So far, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and other companies arrayed against Unocal have lost every legal appeal to invalidate the patents.
But the trade commission, should it rule against Unocal, could effectively strip the patents from the company, which has a market capitalization of about $8.6 billion. A agency spokesman declined to say how long the inquiry might take.
The dispute can be traced back to a collaboration begun in the late 1980's between the state of California and a consortium of oil companies, including Unocal, to develop guidelines for a cleaner-burning gasoline. During the process, the companies and the state determined what the pollution emissions of the fuel should be and how it should be blended. 
The other companies in the group, largely led by Exxon Mobil, say Unocal used the information and secretly patented the blending processes for cleaner-burning, or reformulated, gasoline. Unocal argues that the agreement governing the consortium did not compel it to tell others of their research.
"The other companies didn't cover their legal backsides as well as they could have," said George Beranek, a market analyst with the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting group. 
Unocal charges about 1.2 cents to 3.4 cents for every gallon of reformulated gasoline produced under a license to use its patent, and indeed some refiners have contracted to get such licenses.
But the biggest refiners, like Exxon Mobil, now make reformulated gasoline by "blending around" the patents, which slows the refining process, crimps supplies of reformulated gasoline and drives up prices, they argue. Last year, in an investigation into high fuel prices in the Midwest, the F.T.C. concluded that the efforts of refiners to avoid infringing on Unocal's patents contributed to constrained supplies of reformulated gasoline in the region. 
Barry Lane, a Unocal spokesman, denied the patents had such an impact, and pointed to lower prices for reformulated gasoline this year as proof. "There is no evidence whatsoever," Mr. Lane said, "that our patents have had a negative impact on supply."
Trade groups and industry experts dispute Unocal's view. Refineries spend more regardless of whether they blend around the patents or pay Unocal royalties on them. "It's a huge chunk of refiners' margins in making gasoline," said Philip K. Verleger, an independent economist. "Their margins are about $5 or $6 a barrel now, and the royalties are like a 20 percent tax on that."
Should the F.T.C. find evidence of anti-competitive practices, it has several options, a spokesman said. The commission could simply close the case and reserve the right to take action later. It could forge a consent agreement with Unocal in which the company might drop its demands for royalty payments without admitting wrongdoing. If an agreement cannot be reached, the commission could file suit against Unocal in federal court or in its own administrative law court. It could also ask the Justice Department to file suit seeking damages against Unocal.

HEADLINE: US Air, Denied United Merger, to SketchNew Strategy 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In 1998, top executives from US Airways met with analysts and promised to transform the airline into a "world-class carrier of choice."
 Two years later, the same executives said they had decided to sell US Airways to UAL, the parent company of United Airlines. 
 This morning, less than a month after the Justice Department blocked the deal with United, Rakesh Gangwal, the chief executive of US Airways, and Stephen M. Wolf, its chairman, will sketch out the airline's future to an increasingly skeptical group of Wall Street analysts. 
In advance of the meeting, the analysts offered a laundry list of things that US Airways could or should do to buttress its position in potentially lucrative East Coast markets against bigger carriers like American and United and lower-cost competitors like Southwest Airlines, AirTran and JetBlue Airways. 
But even as they suggested options, the analysts seemed less than confident that US Airways could put together a coherent strategy and pull it off. 
"The level of cynicism in the investment community about this airline is pretty high," said James M. Higgins, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "Can they prosper? No. Can they justify growing? No. I don't expect any major breakthroughs." 
Investors seemed less than optimistic before the meeting. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of the US Airways Group fell 36 cents yesterday, to $17.65. They are down more than 50 percent this year.
In the wake of the collapsed deal with United, US Airways is not likely to seek another merger partner, the analysts said. And management has ruled out breaking up the company. 
To function as a stand-alone enterprise, US Airways needs to do several things fairly quickly, the analysts said. 
It must cut costs to deal with the sluggish economy and slumping business travel. It would have to become part of a global alliance to compete with big domestic carriers. And it must significantly expand its fleet of regional jets to take on the low-cost carriers. 
Robert Johnson, a board member at US Airways, said some of these strategies would most likely be part of management's presentation to analysts. 
In an interview published on Monday in Aviation Daily, Mr. Johnson predicted that the presentation would focus on "strategic growth of regional jet flying, new alliances and lower costs" as the keys to the airline's future. 
US Airways indicated last week, when it announced it would post a third-quarter loss exceeding $160 million, that it was in a cost-cutting mode. The carrier said it expected to take a pretax charge around $405 million to write down assets. 
Further steps are likely to be disclosed at the meeting this morning, the analysts said.
"I think they will ground a significant part of their fleet," said Julius Maldutis of CIBC World Markets. In addition, he said, "it would not surprise me if they cancel or postpone some of the 50 Airbus aircraft due for delivery this year, and the 50 scheduled to be delivered in 2003."
The analysts were not optimistic that the company could win meaningful concessions from its unions to cut labor costs. "The company might seek labor concessions," said Samuel Buttrick of UBS Warburg. "I am not particularly hopeful in that regard. Labor will say, 'Been there, done that.' " 
Mr. Higgins of Credit Suisse First Boston said: "To get labor to come around and give concessions on productivity and pay would be a good start. But I think their labor groups are in complete denial about the company's ability to compete." 
Joining an international alliance would be a plus, the analysts said. 
"US Airways is the largest domestic carrier without any important participation in a global alliance," Mr. Buttrick said. "Getting participation is on the short list." 
Mr. Higgins said US Airways would be most comfortable joining the Star alliance, led by United Airlines. "That is the one they could contribute the most to, and which most needs them," he said. 
And while US Airways' pilots may resist efforts to reduce their salaries, they have displayed a willingness to negotiate an expansion of the airline's regional jet fleet. It remains to be seen whether they would be willing to endorse the sort of aggressive expansion plan that US Airways management would like to carry out.
The airline now has 70 regional jets. Management would like that to grow to 300. 
"Relative to the size of its system, US Airways has a greater need for regional jets than any other carrier," said Brian Harris, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "The East Coast is much richer in terms of small and medium-sized cities than other parts of the country, and they are ideal candidates for regional jets."
With more than $1 billion in cash, US Airways can afford to take some time to put its strategy into practice, the analysts said. But it cannot wait long.
"They have a year or two," said Raymond E. Neidl of ABN Amro Securities. "They still have time, but they don't have time to fiddle."

HEADLINE: Alltel in Hostile $6.1 Billion Bid for Phone Rival 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
The Alltel Corporation, the large telecommunications company, made an unsolicited $6.1 billion takeover bid yesterday for CenturyTel Inc., a smaller rival that provides phone services in rural areas, suburbs and small towns.
 The hostile offer by Alltel, which would also assume $3 billion in debt, represents the company's latest move to capture more market share at a time when valuations for telecommunications companies are considerably lower than they have been in the recent past. 
 It also represents the latest move in Alltel's acquisition strategy. Last year, the company became the nation's fifth-largest wireless company -- with 6.1 million wireless customers -- through acquisitions of properties owned by SBC Communications in New Orleans and Baton Rogue, La. Alltel, based in Little Rock, Ark., is also the nation's sixth-largest local telephone company. 
The unsolicited bid for CenturyTel, based in Monroe, La., was made in a letter sent yesterday to the company's vice chairman and president, Glen F. Post III. The offer, for either $43 a share in cash or 0.6934 of an Alltel share for each CenturyTel share, represents a 40 percent premium to CenturyTel's closing price of $30.62, which was up 15 cents. Shares of Alltel rose 51 cents, to $61.06. 
The offer was immediately met with skepticism by executives at CenturyTel, who released a statement that said the offer was identical to a bid Alltel had already made to purchase the company on July 26. CenturyTel's board rejected that offer. "CenturyTel's board has determined that the company is not for sale," the statement added.
Alltel officials said that even if CenturyTel formally rejected their offer, they would continue to pursue a takeover by taking the bid directly to shareholders. In the letter to Mr. Post, Alltel's president and chief operating officer, Scott T. Ford, wrote about the benefits of the merger of the two companies and then said, "Under these circumstances, we believe that your stockholders would agree with this assessment and enthusiastically support the merger."
After noting that 7 of CenturyTel's top 10 institutional shareholders have also invested in Alltel, he added, "In light of the significance of this offer to the CenturyTel and the Alltel stockholders, we are publicly releasing the text of this letter."
Alltel hired Merrill Lynch and Stephens Inc. to advise it on the offer. Alltel is motivated to acquire CenturyTel as a way to shore up its position in the United States' telecommunications market, which has had its share of bad financial news in recent months. A combined company would have one of the largest shares of rural subscribers, with about 7.2 million wireless customers and more than $10 billion in revenue.
Taking over CenturyTel would give Alltel strong footholds in northern Louisiana, Mississippi, Michigan and Wisconsin. Most of Alltel's business is concentrated on the Eastern Seaboard and in Kansas, Nebraska and the Southwest. There is no overlap in the two companies' wireless businesses.
CenturyTel has not been immune to the bad financial news coming out of the sector. On Aug. 4, the company reported slightly lower second-quarter earnings, despite a 22.6 percent revenue rise, and cut its full-year revenue forecast because of continued weakness in the economy.
But some Alltel officials suggested yesterday that CenturyTel's results were a result of poor management practices. CenturyTel officials did not return calls seeking comment.
Alltel fared slightly better. Its second-quarter profits fell but met analysts' estimates as wireless revenue rose 9 percent and it added more subscribers than expected.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate; 
A Warehouse Turns Into Retail Space

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
One of the largest buildings in the meatpacking district is nearing the end of a conversion that will turn it into 72,100 square feet of office and retail space.
 The six-story building, a former loft-style warehouse at 29 Ninth Avenue and 13th Street in Manhattan, is a recent example of an industrial building being transformed in one of the city's grittiest neighborhoods. Work was started this year despite an economic slowdown that some real estate brokers say has had a harsh impact in neighborhoods like the meatpacking area. 
 Built in 1898, 29 Ninth Avenue was most recently a home to Hanover Moving and Storage, which used it to store office furniture. But earlier this year, Steven Greenes, a Manhattan lawyer who owned the property, sold it for $8.1 million to a partnership of four Manhattan-based real estate developers: Charles Blaichman, Joseph Daly, Philip Katz and William Schaffel. 
According to Mr. Blaichman, the partnership liked the building's proximity to the triangle of land that is bordered by Gansevoort Street to the south, 14th Street to the north and Ninth Avenue to the west, an area that he said looked something like a European square. 
Renovations on the building are expected to cost about $7 million, he said. The building's facade, which now includes a new storefront, is almost finished. As for its interior, current plans call for exposed brick walls, a new mechanical system, a new lobby and two new elevators. 
Sinvin Realty has been marketing the property since May 2000 on behalf of the new owners. And, according to Christopher Owles, a Sinvin managing director, the building now has two tenants. One of them is Jean-Georges Vongerichten, a four-star New York chef who has signed a lease for 15,000 feet of ground and basement space for an Asian restaurant that may open as early as 2002. The second tenant is Vitra, the Swiss furniture design company, which signed a lease in July for 1,800 square feet of retail space on the building's ground floor and 10,300 square feet on its second floor for showroom offices.
According to Mr. Owles, Vitra began looking for space in the city in early 2000 in areas like SoHo, Chelsea and the Flatiron district. But the company had a hard time finding enough affordable ground-floor space in a building that had both the right location and right look. 
"One thing that Vitra doesn't like is being predictable, like going to SoHo, where every other European furniture company is," he said.
Mr. Owles said his firm currently had an unsigned lease out for the third floor of the building and was negotiating with another prospective tenant, who wants the rest of the building for hotel use. He added that Sinvin had been asking for $75 a square foot for ground-floor space and is now asking $42 a square foot for upper-floor space, with the exception of the third floor. There, he said, the asking rent is $38 a square foot, because that floor offers views on only two sides, rather than three.
In general, asking rents for commercial space in the meatpacking district average $30 to $45 a square foot, while rents for retail ground-floor space are in the range of $60 to $80 a square foot, Mr. Owles said.
Some real estate brokers, however, say that the meatpacking district is being hit especially hard during the slowing economy.
"This is an area that really flourished during the dot-com frenzy when there was no space on Park Avenue South or lower Fifth Avenue, but now you can get much better space in better buildings at the same rent elsewhere in the city," said Tim Kucha, a senior director at Plymouth Partners, a Manhattan-based brokerage firm that primarily represents tenants. 
Mr. Kucha said one drawback to the meatpacking district was still the lack of nearby public transportation.
As a result, he said, space that was going for an asking rate of $45 a square foot late last year is now available for a signing rent of about $25 a square foot.
Mr. Owles said his company had not noticed a downturn. He said demand for high-end office space in the meatpacking district currently exceeded the supply of available space, which he estimated was about 100,000 square feet. "We have people looking for between 5,000 and 50,000 square feet of space in the meat market right now, and it's the middle of summer," he said. 
Some recent arrivals clearly do not want to be anywhere else. Mr. Vongerichten, for example, said his new restaurant would be designed to look like an old spice market, to evoke the market feeling of the neighborhood. "I love this area," he said.

HEADLINE: State Legislators Gather, With Budget Woes High on Agenda 

BYLINE:  By ROSS E. MILLOY 

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
More than 7,000 state legislators, their staff members and assorted camp followers gathered here this week for the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures, four days of hobnobbing and debate on issues from the peculiar to the profound.
 In the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center here, booths for Mothers Against Drunk Driving competed for visitors with the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors, the National Anti-Vivisection Society and even the American Association for Nude Recreation. 
 "We're here to educate lawmakers about the family-oriented nature of nude recreation and to show that we do not belong under adult entertainment laws that try to ban nudity," said Rebecca Dobrinski, the nudist group's public policy spokeswoman.
Although Ms. Dobrinski's booth was quite popular among conference attendees, most legislators had weightier topics on their minds, in particular looming budget crunches as health and education costs rise and tax revenues slow. 
This year, for the first time since the early 1990's, about a third of the states have had to deal with budget shortfalls, according to a fiscal report prepared by the conference's fiscal affairs office.
Most states were prepared to weather the storm, said Corina L. Eckl, fiscal affairs program director for the conference, because of budget reserves built up during the booming economy of the 1990's.
"But now as the economy is slowing, and their expenditures are increasing in so many areas, those reserves are declining, and declining rapidly," Ms. Eckl said.
Based upon a survey of 46 states, Ms. Eckl's report found that spending by the states grew 9.1 percent in the last year, driven largely by higher Medicaid costs. By contrast, revenues grew only 4.5 percent. Twenty-five states had to provide supplemental appropriations for Medicaid costs in 2001, Ms. Eckl said.
No states had budget shortfalls in the 2000 fiscal year, but 17 grappled with shortfalls this year. And despite slower revenue growth, the states will enact net tax cuts for the seventh consecutive year. But the 2001 net tax reduction -- $1.8 billion -- is substantially less than last year's record cut of $9.9 billion, the report notes.
The states still have more than $34 billion in reserves, about 8.2 percent of general fund spending in the 2001 fiscal year, and Ms. Eckl expects state revenues to grow only 2.4 percent over that level. Appropriations are expected to grow 2.3 percent, giving state lawmakers little room to maneuver. Medicaid will capture the largest percentage of new spending, expected to grow 8.7 percent, according to the report.
The president of the conference, Jim Costa, a Democratic state senator from California, said it appeared that state lawmakers would face some difficult fiscal decisions.
"State legislatures gave the green light to funding new programs, enacting tax cuts and building rainy-day funds in the 1990's," Mr. Costa said. "The yellow light is on now, and state legislatures will be more cautious in making budget decisions."
The federal government, meanwhile, last year posted the largest budget surplus as a percentage of the gross domestic product -- $237 billion or 2.4 percent -- since 1948, according to the conference's budget and taxation committee.
Tension between the states and Washington seemed almost palpable as the panel debated resolutions calling for the reform of entitlement programs, like Medicaid, and elimination of the federal deficit.
But as much as money, control was an issue much on the minds of people at this year's conference.
"The states want more flexibility to design the programs," said Ray Hanley, director of the Arkansas Medical Services Division, which deals with Medicaid issues. "Whether it's allowing the states to charge more reasonable cost sharing to the recipients or setting income levels to determine who gets benefits, the states need to have the ability to more effectively manage these programs."
Control issues arose again when the conference's committee on election reform issued its final report today and called for numerous procedural changes after last fall's disputed presidential election.
Recommendations were made in 10 areas, including the administration of elections and the use of federal block grants to pay for improving election technology, systems and ballot design.
"The federal government should not try to pre-empt this area," said State Senator Stephen I. Cohen of Tennessee, a Democratic member of the committee. "They should try to help, of course, but this is the province of the states."

HEADLINE: Tobacco Companies Accused Of Still Aiming Ads at Youths 

BYLINE:  By By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
As part of a settlement with the states in 1998, the biggest tobacco companies said they would stop advertising in magazines with significant numbers of young readers. Three years later, that promise is largely unfulfilled.
 Ads from three of the four major tobacco companies continue to appear in magazines like Rolling Stone, People, Entertainment Weekly, Sports Illustrated and TV Guide. 
 Rolling Stone's latest issue features the young female stars of "American Pie 2" on the cover, as well as articles about kung fu movies and rap music. It also contains advertisements for Winston and Camel cigarettes. The Winston ad is a two-page spread near the front of the magazine. 
Three of the four biggest tobacco companies -- R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard -- say they continue such advertising because the limits they agreed to in 1998 were only guidelines, not laws. By contrast, Philip Morris, the largest tobacco company, has followed the guidelines. A year ago, it stopped advertising in 50 magazines with young readers. 
Bill Lockyer, the attorney general of California who participated in the settlement three years ago, disputed the tobacco companies' version. 
In the 1998 settlement, the tobacco companies signed on to follow guidelines agreed to by most of the 46 attorneys general involved in the suit: that cigarette advertisements not appear in magazines if more than 15 percent of the readers are under 18, or if more than two million of the readers are under 18. 
Mr. Lockyer said the companies were violating what they had pledged in writing. According to the agreement, the companies promised never to "take any action directly or indirectly to target youth" in the "advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products." He is suing R. J. Reynolds over it.
"R. J. Reynolds and other companies agreed not to market to kids, and based on our surveys, they still are," he said.
Mr. Lockyer says that based on his research, Americans age 12 to 17 will be exposed to at least 50 cigarette ads in magazines each year. He adds that the tobacco companies have a compelling reason to violate the settlement. 
"They kill their customers every year," he said, "and they need to recruit new ones." 
Two forms of research that became available for the first time only last spring make it clearer how many young magazine readers there are. Spurred in part by the issue of tobacco advertising, Mediamark Research and the Simmons Market Research Bureau have in recent months begun to release specific data on readers 12 to 18. 
For example, People magazine would fall under the settlement terms because it has 2.7 million readers under 18, according to numbers from Simmons. But the latest issue of People carries a two-page ad for Newports, a product of Lorillard. 
Sports Illustrated has 4.9 million readers under 18, according to data from Mediamark. But the magazine still carries ads for Camel cigarettes, which are made by R. J. Reynolds, and other brands.
The magazine reaped close to $40 million in ad revenue from tobacco ads last year, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a organization that monitors magazine advertising.
And 23 percent of Rolling Stone's readers are under 18, according to both the Simmons Teen Survey and the Simmons National Consumer Survey. But Rolling Stone still carries ads for R. J. Reynolds brands in practically every issue. And a Rolling Stone executive expects to double the number of Reynolds ads next year. Rolling Stone also carries Brown & Williamson ads. 
True, the child-friendly Joe Camel -- rendered illegal by the settlement -- no longer appears in Rolling Stone. But it is not rare to find teenage favorites on the cover, like Sarah Michelle Gellar, the star of the TV show "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," and an ad for Kool, a product of Brown & Williamson, on the back.
A study to be released by The New England Journal of Medicine today reports that the settlement appears to have had little effect on cigarette advertising in magazines and on the exposure of young people to those advertisements.
Of the four tobacco companies, R. J. Reynolds has the broadest view of what constitutes an adult magazine. It is so broad that in March, Mr. Lockyer, the attorney general of California, sued the company, accusing it of having "continuously and systematically targeted youth" by placing large numbers of cigarette ads in magazines with a substantial teenage readership. The attorneys general of Oregon, New York, Ohio and Washington joined the lawsuit. A date for the trial is expected to be set on Friday. 
Jan Smith, a spokeswoman for R. J. Reynolds, said it had chosen to follow a standard different from that promoted by the attorneys general. 
"We do not advertise in magazines that target minors," she said. "We only advertise in magazines that are read by adults." She said that in order to accept R. J. Reynolds advertising, less than 25 percent of a magazine's readership must be under 18, or if that information is not available, the median age of the magazine's readers ought to be 23.
She said Reynolds also looked at the editorial content of the magazine and considered the presence of other advertisers -- for example, for cars or liquor -- to gauge whether it was truly a publication for adults. 
Ms. Smith said the tobacco industry should be held to a similar standard as the liquor industry, which has been praised by the Federal Trade Commission for following voluntary restrictions that, according to a 1999 F.T.C. report, restrict advertising to magazines that can show that 60 to 70 percent of their readers are of legal drinking age.
"Isn't it ironic that a 60 or 70 percent standard gets a big pat on the back, yet our standard is higher than that?" she said. 
Steve Kottak, a spokesman for Brown & Williamson, said it intended to market only to adults and did not advertise in magazines with readerships of more than 15 percent under 18. But he said the company did not follow the guideline that it not advertise in magazines with more than two million readers under 18. 
"The purpose of our advertising is to encourage adult smokers to choose our brand," Mr. Kottak said. "The intended audience is 21 years or older. We select publications on that basis. We also follow the recommendation of the National Association of Attorneys General in advertising in magazines with under-18 readership no greater than 15 percent." 
But Mr. Kottak added that the company did advertise in magazines with more than two million readers under 18. 
A spokesman for Lorillard, Steve Watson, said that after discussions with the attorneys general last year, it withdrew its ads from Rolling Stone and Sports Illustrated. 
He said the company made a responsible effort to aim only at adult audiences, but had also overlooked the two-million-reader rule. According to data from Mediamark, TV Guide has over five million readers under 18. 
"We are making a responsible effort to target only adult audiences," Mr. Watson said. "We will look at new research as it comes in." 
Magazine publishers said they were comfortable with the tobacco ads. The publisher of People, Peter Bauer, said in a statement that magazines were not legally restrained from accepting tobacco ads and that the guidelines applied to the tobacco companies, which could choose to follow them or not. 
"People is primarily written for 36 million adults who are mature enough to make informed decisions regarding the purchase of the legal products advertised in our pages," he said. 
Robert F. Gregory, publisher of Rolling Stone, said he had no comment. 
Michael Rooney, publisher of ESPN magazine, said that he did not have qualms about accepting ads from Brown & Williamson and R. J. Reynolds even though the magazine did have a large teenage readership. "I think we do our job and they do theirs," he said. 
Some publications refuse cigarette ads. The New York Times stopped accepting cigarette ads on May 1, 1999; at that time, at least a dozen other American newspapers also rejected them.
Ms. Smith of R. J. Reynolds said there was only one way to assure that underage readers would never be exposed to tobacco ads in magazines.
"That would be to ban all cigarette advertising in magazines," she said. "And that was not the intent of the settlement agreement. We never agreed to that."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 16, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about tobacco industry advertising misstated the nature of guidelines that discourage ads aimed at young people. The guidelines -- which deal with ads in magazines with more than two million readers younger than 18 or more than 15 percent of readers younger than 18 -- are not part of the master settlement agreement between the companies and the attorneys general of 46 states. The agreement included a pledge by the companies not "to take any action directly or indirectly to target youth." It required the attorneys general to develop guidelines for enforcement. Enforcement is still negotiated case by case between the companies and the National Association of Attorneys General.
The article also misstated the role of Bill Lockyer, the attorney general of California, in the settlement talks. Though he took an active interest, he did not take office until after the agreement was signed.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Who's Reading"According to recommendations of state attorneys general, tobacco advertising should appear only in magazines that can show that less than 15 percent of readers are under 18, or that no more than two million of the readers are under that age.

HEADLINE: Pataki Says He Will Sue Over Budget 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki declared today that he would sue the Legislature for passing a stripped-down version of his budget, after making no progress in the first meeting he has held with legislative leaders this year.
 "We cannot allow to stand an action that I believe clearly violates the Constitution," the governor said. 
 If Mr. Pataki does sue, it would be the first time in modern history that a New York governor has taken the Legislature to court over a budget. The threat also underscores the constitutional struggle over which branch of government shapes the state's spending that was set in motion two weeks ago, when the Legislature passed a pared-down version of the budget that the governor proposed earlier this year. 
Governor Pataki has vowed not to shut down the government. He promised that the state would continue to operate under the budget the Legislature has passed while the courts wrestle with the constitutional questions. He added that he would not try to veto those parts of the budget he considers unconstitutional. 
Twelve days ago, legislative leaders put aside partisan differences among themselves and eliminated more than $4 billion in spending from the governor's budget. They also struck out several passages that would have changed school aid formulas and Medicaid reimbursements to nursing homes, among other things. 
Their intention was to force Mr. Pataki to agree to additional spending that would include some of their programs, especially hundreds of millions more for schools. 
The divisions between the governor and the legislative leaders have worsened in the last week, with Mr. Pataki traveling around the state attacking the Legislature while Assembly Democrats have blamed the governor's frequent absences from Albany for the impasse.
He had not even called a meeting with the leaders, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, an upstate Republican, during this entire year. 
The deep rifts were exposed again today, when the three finally met in Mr. Pataki's office. They failed to reach an agreement on any major issue, from a plan to allow Indian-run casinos in western New York, to proposals to relax the state's harsh penalties for drug offenses.
They also were unable to resolve the main stumbling block in negotiations this year: how much money the state can afford to spend. Mr. Pataki continues to maintain that the state cannot afford more than the $83.6 billion he proposed in January because of the shaky economy. Mr. Silver has proposed about $2 billion more in spending, most of it for schools, while Mr. Bruno wants to add about $1 billion, including seed money for biotechnology industries.
"I don't think we settled anything," Mr. Silver said as he emerged from the governor's office. "I think we settled on a desire to have people talk, and continue to talk about resolution, a final resolution, of the budget for this year, and the session for this year."
Mr. Bruno said legislative aides from both houses would begin discussions on a supplementary budget, but he acknowledged that it was unclear if the governor's aides would take part in those talks. "We didn't get into what his role will be," he said.
Both Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno expressed confidence they would prevail in court. The State Constitution says legislators must act on the governor's proposed budget bills before drawing up their own spending bills. In addition, the lawmakers are allowed only to strike out an appropriation, reduce it or add extra money in a separate line. The governor can veto any additions.
In 1993, the state's highest court hampered the Legislature even more. The court ruled in New York State Bankers Association vs. Wetzler that lawmakers can change only numbers, not language, in the governor's budget bills. That meant the Legislature could no longer alter the language describing the purpose for which the money could be used.
Governor Pataki has used that ruling masterfully, putting changes to current law into the descriptions of appropriations, and placing the Legislature in the unhappy position of having to accept his policy changes to spend the money.
Lawyers for the Assembly and the Senate argue that the 1993 ruling should also prohibit the governor from shoehorning changes to law into a description of how the money should be spent. The governor's lawyers disagree.
The courts are already dealing with a similar suit. In 1998, several lawmakers, led by Mr. Silver, sued the governor after he vetoed more than 1,300 lines in that year's spending plan. At issue in that case is whether the governor can use his veto power to strike out wording in a set of bills that historically accompany appropriations. Those bills spell out in greater detail how the state's resources are to be used.
The $79.6 billion budget the Legislature produced two weeks ago had scores of painful cuts. The lawmakers also took out several large lump-sum accounts, including a $150 million fund for acquiring parkland and $58 million fund for grants to small cities, because they could not negotiate how the money would be spent.
Money for preschool programs in public schools and smaller class sizes that the governor left out of his budget was not put back either, making it a virtual certainty that those programs will not be expanded this year as planned.
Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno both said tonight that they would pass a supplementary budget adding more spending, with or without the governor's participation. But they added that they did not have the votes to override the governor should he decide to slice that supplementary budget to shreds with his veto pen.
"I would prefer a three-way agreement on a realistic budget," Mr. Silver said.

HEADLINE: Metro Business Briefing Jobs Lost In New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) 

 BODY:
 New Jersey's economy continued to slow last month, as the state lost about 5,200 private sector jobs, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor. 
Most of the losses were in manufacturing, especially printing, but employment in business services also fell sharply. The unemployment rate dropped to 4 percent from 4.5 percent, after adjustment for seasonal factors, but analysts attributed that decline to a smaller-than-usual number of students looking for summer jobs.

HEADLINE: N.F.L.: NOTEBOOK; 
Dallas Puts Its Offense In the Hands of Carter

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Dallas Cowboys released the veteran Tony Banks yesterday to make the rookie Quincy Carter their starting quarterback.
 Carter was Dallas's top draft pick and immediately was labeled the long-term replacement to Troy Aikman. Banks had signed a few weeks earlier with the promise that he was the short-term solution and would be the starter this season. 
 But after three weeks of training camp and two preseason games, Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, and Dave Campo, the head coach, said they decided to change their offensive philosophy to a ball-control attack they said best suits Carter and the new second-stringer, Anthony Wright. 
 "It wasn't that Tony Banks went backward, it's that those guys elevated themselves to the point where we feel for this particular season and the future this in the best interest of the football team," Campo said at the team's camp in Oxnard, Calif.
 Carter, the 53rd overall pick and a former minor leaguer for the Chicago Cubs, had a 20-9 record in three seasons at Georgia. He completed 9 of 15 passes for 167 yards and 2 touchdowns in his preseason debut against Oakland and was 6 of 11 for 48 yards Saturday against Denver, although he did move Dallas into field-goal range twice.
 "We did not and could not have known the maturity and sharpness Quincy Carter has exhibited," Jones said.
 Carter, Wright and Clint Stoerner, the third-stringer, have a combined two N.F.L. starts, all by Wright, and a total of five regular-season appearances.
 Banks, who lost starting jobs in St. Louis and Baltimore, but never in the preseason, had a one-year contract worth $500,000 with no signing bonus, a huge bargain for a starting quarterback. In two preseason games, Banks was 6 of 14 for 54 yards.
 "I guess I'm not Jerry's guy," Banks said. "You all saw practice and saw how I was playing. I didn't see this coming. I feel like my dad hit me with a baseball bat. It was the last thing I was expecting. All I know is the offensive coordinator and the quarterback coach had no idea what was going on. That should tell you something."

EAGLES
 A day after the preseason opener was canceled at Veterans Stadium because the field was ruled unplayable, Philadelphia city officials tried to determine what exactly went wrong and vowed to have the turf in shape for the rest of the Eagles' season.
 Monday night's game between the Eagles and the defending Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens was called off after officials, coaches and players from both teams thought the uneven, mushy turf could affect players' footing.
 An engineering firm inspected the field for several hours yesterday and was expected to provide recommendations to the city, which owns the stadium.
 The grounds crew had immediately begun preparing the field for football Sunday after the Phillies' six-game homestand. It was the first time that the stadium's new turf, called NeXturf, had been converted from baseball to football.
 N.F.L. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue officially canceled the game yesterday after a conference call with the Eagles' owner, Jeff Lurie, their president, Joe Banner, and the Ravens' president, David Modell.
 The teams' preseason schedules are too crowded to allow the game to be made up, an N.F.L. spokesman, Greg Aiello, said. Each has a game this Saturday and again Aug. 23.
 The Eagles lost $5 million to $10 million because of the cancellation but hoped to recoup at least some of that through insurance, Banner said. The Eagles said they would offer a full refund to an estimated 45,000 fans.
 The Eagles are scheduled to move into a new, football-only stadium for the 2003 season. 

LABOR TALKS
 Having made little progress in labor talks with its officials, the N.F.L. raised its offer yesterday to a 40 percent increase in salary for this season and nearly doubled salaries by 2003.
 While a league spokesman, Greg Aiello, called the offer "fair and reasonable," the agent representing the union in the talks said it was unsatisfactory.
 The N.F.L. and its officials, all of whom are part-timers who have regular outside jobs, have made little progress in discussions since the current contract expired in March. A meeting in Chicago on Sunday involving several officials and several owners as well as the negotiators also failed to move things along.
 After that meeting, league officials said they might start training replacement officials from small colleges and NFL Europe to step in for the regulars. The season opens Sept. 9.

VIKINGS
 Offensive lineman Everett Lindsay, who spent his first six N.F.L. seasons with Minnesota, was traded by the Cleveland Browns back to the Vikings yesterday to help fill the gap caused by the death two weeks ago of Korey Stringer.
 Lindsay had started all 16 games at right guard for the Browns last year after being signed as a free agent from Baltimore. He began his career playing six seasons with the Vikings.
 Minnesota needed more depth on the offensive line, following the death of Stringer from heat stroke. Rob Brzezinski, the team's vice president for football administration, said he believed that Lindsay could serve as a backup at all five line positions. The Browns will receive a draft choice in return. 

REDSKINS
 Washington sent Danny Kanell back to the minors yesterday, making the rookie Sage Rosenfels the starter for Friday night's exhibition game against the Atlanta Falcons.
 With both Jeff George and Todd Husak hurt, the Redskins had Kanell, a former Giants and Falcons quarterback, practice with the team in Carlisle, Pa. He is playing minor league baseball with the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League, batting .216 as a first baseman.
 After the workout, Coach Marty Schottenheimer decided against signing Kanell, explaining that he was looking for more than a warm body to get the team through training camp and exhibition games. The coach said he will now consider other unemployed quarterbacks, including Tony Banks, whom Dallas released yesterday.
 "If we bring somebody in, I want them to have a legitimate opportunity to compete to be on the team," Schottenheimer said. "I want to see what alternatives are available."
 The coach did not completely rule out Kanell. "He's O.K. physically, he just hasn't thrown the ball in about 30 days," Schottenheimer said.
 Rosenfels played for Iowa State last season. 

BENGALS
 The Cincinnati Bengals will be without free safety Darryl Williams for six weeks after he injured his left ankle during camp workouts on Monday.
 The Bengals initially described the injury as a severe sprain. But Williams was sent back to Cincinnati to see a doctor, and Dr. Angelo Colosimo, an orthopedic surgeion, diagnosed the injury Monday night as partially torn ligaments in the ankle.

HEADLINE: Enron's Chief Executive Quits After Only 6 Months in Job 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. with ALEX BERENSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of the Enron Corporation, stunned Wall Street today by announcing that he would quit after just six months in the job, calling the move a "purely personal decision."
 But the abruptness of the departure left many analysts questioning whether a series of setbacks the company has suffered played a part in the decision. 
 Kenneth Lay, Enron's 59-year-old chairman, will step back into the position he left early this year after 15 years as chief executive.
Mr. Lay, who originally recruited Mr. Skilling to Enron, said tonight that he had agreed to stay on through the end of 2005 to "make sure we've got plenty of time to work out an orderly succession." 
Mr. Skilling, 47, had been at the heart of the transformation of Enron from an old-line natural gas pipeline company to the biggest and most aggressive of the new breed of unregulated energy traders that buy and sell billions of dollars of electricity and other commodities daily.
That strategy helped Enron's stock price soar during the last decade. But this year the company's shares have fallen sharply, as Enron has suffered from problems with its new broadband telecommunications trading unit, its investment in a large power plant in India, and criticism from officials in California, who blame Enron and other energy companies for the collapse of the state's electricity market.
A former energy consultant at McKinsey & Company who joined Enron in 1990, Mr. Skilling built its energy-trading operations into the company's most profitable unit, accounting for nearly $1.7 billion -- or 85 percent -- of operating income last year. He became president and chief operating officer in 1997, and in February of this year became chief executive.
On a conference call, Mr. Skilling said he could not "stress enough that this has nothing to do with Enron." He added that "the reasons for leaving the business are personal, but I'd just as soon keep that private."
Mr. Skilling, who is divorced, has joint custody of three teenage children -- a daughter, 17, and two sons, 14 and 11 -- with his ex-wife. Mr. Skilling, who will leave the board but will serve as a consultant to the company, will not receive any severance package because his departure is voluntary, Mr. Lay said.
Since May 2000, Mr. Skilling has sold at least 450,000 Enron shares worth at least $33 million, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. He still owns about 1.1 million shares, the filings show.
"Absolutely no accounting issue," Mr. Lay told analysts, "no trading issue, no reserve issue, no previously unknown problem issues" are behind the departure. There will be "no change in the performance or outlook of the company going forward," he added.
He also said the company was on track to meet analysts' earnings expectations, which are about $1.80 a share this year and $2.15 next year.
On the call, Mr. Skilling said that "in general there have been a lot of issues" that have buffeted the company this year, but he said that he believed Enron had already surmounted most of them. "Now is the time" to step down, he said, "because I think we've got a lot of these things behind us."
Nonetheless, the move jolted analysts, who, despite the stock's recent slide and the company's other problems, saw Mr. Skilling as the unquestioned leader to follow Mr. Lay.
In after-hours trading, shares of Enron fell about 8 percent, to $39.55. That fall follows a plunge of almost 50 percent since January in the stock, which had closed in regular trading at $42.93, up 78 cents. The news of the executive changes came after the market closed.
"I'm surprised and I'm stunned," said Philip K. Verleger, an energy economist with the Brattle Group, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "Skilling was the guy who executed the growth in the trading business."
Investors have become increasingly concerned that a surge in new power plant construction will lead to a glut of electricity within a few years and lower the value of Enron's role as a middleman between plant owners and electricity users. In addition, the company's efforts to enter the water business have fared poorly, and its broadband trading operation has become a cash drain.
Mr. Skilling's promotion early this year came after several crucial Enron executives resigned. These included Rebecca Mark, who at one time was considered a rival for the top job.
Ms. Mark became chief executive of the Azurix Corporation in 1999 after Enron spun off the company, its global water business. But its financial performance was disappointing, and Ms. Mark left the company last year. Enron later agreed to buy back Azurix stock for less than half what public shareholders had paid.

DEERE WILL PARE ITS FARM EQUIPMENT PRODUCTION BY 25%

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Deere & Company, the largest tractor maker, said yesterday that it planned to cut production 25 percent, resulting in a fourth-quarter loss that will erase most of its profit this year as bad weather and the slow economy hurt sales. The company also said that its fiscal third-quarter net income fell 58 percent, to $71.8 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $172.4 million, or 72 cents, a year ago. 
Sales in the period ended July 31 fell 1.4 percent, to $3.58 billion from $3.63 billion. Deere, based in Moline, Ill., is scaling back production of large tractors, combines and cotton-pickers as four years of bumper corn, wheat and soybean crops have depressed prices, leaving farmers with less to spend on equipment.

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
The low-fare airlines fly profitably above the turmoil as the giants struggle with the downturn.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
WANTED: To meet the rapid growth of Europe's largest low-fare airline, up to 50 Boeing 737's. Please forward detailed specifications and prices to Ryanair.com, the low-fares airline."
 An airline looking to buy planes? In this business climate? The full-page want-ad, in last week's edition of Flight International magazine, illustrates a bit of the chaos now afflicting the airline business, which had been humming along just fine until business travel spending plunged off a cliff starting in February. Partly a means to chide struggling competitors, but mostly reflecting a genuine demand for aircraft, the ad suggests how aggressively small, low-fare airlines have been moving to snatch customers away from the bigger carriers. 
 The latest sign of that chaos came Monday night when Midway Airlines, blaming "a calamitous drop in business travel" and competition from Southwest and other low-fare airlines, filed for bankruptcy-law protection and made sharp reductions in its flight schedules. 
And the major airlines continued slashing fares. US Airways said yesterday that it was cutting fares on routes to nine European destinations for travel into early next year.
As the low-fare airlines generally prosper, however, the majors have also loosened business-ticket restrictions while cutting back on some routes, and even retiring older, high-maintenance clunkers from their aircraft fleets. 
Among the low-fare carriers, Southwest reported robust second-quarter profits and increased its capacity -- the number of seats available per mile traveled -- by nearly 11 percent in June. Another low-fare airline, AirTran Airways, is doing so well that the stock of its parent company, AirTran Holdings Inc., will move today from the American Stock Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange. JetBlue Airways, which began low-fare operations last year, plans to double operations out of its base at Kennedy International Airport in New York.
"It's like they're real estate buyers -- bad times are good for them," Bill Dane, a senior aviation analyst at the research firm Forecast International/DMS, said of some low-fare carriers that he noted were now hoping to "swoop down and pick up" bargain planes as larger competitors make cuts to improve efficiencies.
Not many carriers, by the way, are looking to unload late models of planes like the Boeing 737, which has become hugely popular in recent years as airlines replaced bigger airplanes on some routes. Besides being cheaper to operate, smaller jets open up more routes among smaller cities, and feed hub airports.
At the same time, there has been an explosive growth in so-called regional jets, which typically carry 40 to 100 or so passengers. While demand for these twin-engine planes could flag if airline economic conditions continue to worsen, current orders are robust. 
Though the trend means more overall flights in the domestic skies, many on planes holding fewer people, airlines love regional jets.
"Increasingly, you are going to see an expansion of regional jets," said Leo F. Mullin, the chairman and chief executive of Delta Air Lines, the largest regional jet user.
"We have about 150 or so regional jets now; we're going to have over 300 by the year 2004," he said. "Out of Delta's roughly $15 billion in revenue, about $2 billion comes from the feed produced by these regional carriers."
Besides increased air traffic, there are other problems inherent in the shift to greater use of small jets. At Delta's Comair regional airline subsidiary, pilots went on strike for 89 days earlier this year. This was one illustration, industry analysts say, of labor difficulties that major airlines can face as they depend more on regional jets flown by crews who make less money than the crews of big airliners.
The leading manufacturers of regional jets are Bombardier of Canada and Embraer of Brazil, both of which are planning to increasing production of higher-capacity models in the 100-plus seat range. At the same time, the two top makers of big airliners, Boeing and Airbus Industrie, are rushing to produce new models like the Boeing 717 and Airbus A318 to compete in the larger-capacity end of the regional jet market. 
On the other hand, the major domestic carriers -- all of whom except Continental Airlines reported second-quarter losses -- have been curtailing some routes and making plans to retire some bigger planes on domestic routes.
These moves represent small reductions in capacity growth. But with business travel demand already down, the route cuts and aircraft retirements are not expected to have any major impact on customers, who have been finding planes less crowded -- and upgrades to first-class cabins more available -- this summer, even as travelers enjoy fare cuts that analysts anticipate will last well into the fall.
Most of the fleet reductions are in older planes that cost more to operate. AMR's American Airlines said this month that it planned to retire 58 aircraft, among them 21 Boeing 727's, which require a cockpit crew of three and seat 163 to 189 passengers. Yet at the same time, American has been increasing its fleet of 737-800's, which seat 146 and require a cockpit crew of only two.
Similarly, Northwest Airlines, which has announced a reduction of 1,500 in its work force, is considering early retirement of some wide-body DC-10's. On the other hand, Northwest plans to have a total increase of 35 percent in its fleet by 2005.
With the streamlining, overall domestic capacity will grow only slightly this year, and at less-than-earlier-projected rates next year. But given the fierce competition for business travelers, analysts say, airlines remain wary of cost-cutting that would substantially reduce in-flight services.
"I think there's more smoke than fire," Mr. Dane of Forecast International said of the recently announced cutbacks by the major airlines.
James W. Peppe, an airline analyst at OneTravel.com, an online travel firm, said: "They are only cutting corners in small ways. I'm sure if they can put a meal on your tray that's a little last costly, they're doing it -- though I'm not sure how that's possible."
"But really, what other kind of services are there on the plane to cut," especially in coach? he asked. "They can't change the space for the worse in economy. What more can they do to cut costs on service that they haven't already done?"

HEADLINE: New Currency Feeding Jitters For Europeans 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Will chaos reign when much of Europe starts changing over to euro coins and notes on Jan. 1? Will lines clog the aisles of supermarkets as cashiers fumble trying to figure out euro change? Will citizens hoard their new euro coins as collectors' items? Will people feel so ill at ease with the new prices that they just won't buy anything beyond the basics?
 If all goes well, the conversion to euro notes and coins could give new power and legitimacy to the common currency being adopted by 12 of the 15 European Union countries. 
 Trade could grow, and investment from abroad rise. Some see the move to the euro, now worth about 90 American cents, as a major turning point in the unification of Europe.
But even as the European Central Bank gets set to unveil the final design of the new notes and coins next month, exactly what will happen on "E-day" -- one of the Continent's biggest peacetime undertakings -- remains a subject of intense debate. After years of planning for the switchover, European Union and Central Bank officials say they are counting on an orderly transition. Still, they admit to worries. 
"Concerns, there are lots of them," said Benjamin L. Angel, the European Union official in charge of the practical aspects of the transition. "You can't help but have them when you have such a massive, historic event."
Across the European Union doomsayers abound, and anxiety is growing, much as it did with the Year 2000 computer scare. The logistics of the conversion are mind-boggling, and leave room for any number of disasters from a rise in money laundering, counterfeiting and bank heists to inflation set off by retailers rounding up prices as they convert to euros three years after banks and stock exchanges adopted the currency.
Worries range from banks that are offering employees free gym time to get them fit enough to haul extra sacks of money to the shortage of armored trucks in Finland, a large and sparsely populated country that has only 150 such vehicles to convey the new coins and notes to outlying stores and A.T.M.'s. 
As of Jan. 1, about 50 billion new coins and 14.5 billion euro notes are to be pumped into circulation. If the bank notes were laid end to end, one bank official said earlier this year, they would reach to the moon and back twice. Another said that trying to distribute the new money was the equivalent of sending 500,000 trucks out onto the roads of Europe to transport 24 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower.
Some psychologists have warned that impact of the transition may send people into a kind of economic hibernation. Consumers and retailers could be infuriated if they see the wide discrepancies in prices between countries. Even charities and religious organizations could suffer.
A front-page article last month in the French daily Le Figaro said that French churches were fretting. Most parishioners apparently put either 5- or 10-franc pieces into the collection plate. But no equivalent exists in euros. Depending on whether they choose bigger or smaller coins, the churches could be facing a 30 percent drop in revenue.
Increasingly, consumer groups and retail associations are complaining of a lack of readiness. "I think we are headed for catastrophe," Christian Huard, the president of a large group representing French consumers, said last month. On Aug. 9, Holger Wenzel, the director of the German Retail Association, attacked the German government on much the same grounds and denounced banks for taking advantage of the situation by planning exchange fees.
Europeans appear ill-informed about their new currency. A recent European Union survey showed that support for the changeover was growing in the 12 affected countries -- France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Finland, Luxembourg, Austria and Greece. (Three European Union members -- Britain, Sweden and Denmark -- voted not to join.) But about half those surveyed in France, Italy and Portugal did not know that the euro was destined to go into circulation in four months.
Surveys show that few consumers have any idea of the value of a euro, despite a growing amount of dual price ticketing. A European Union report issued at the end of March said that 80 percent did not remember a single price in euros.
One in five did not understand that their old national currencies would disappear when the euro was introduced. One in four did not understand that euro notes and coins issued in their own countries would be legal tender elsewhere in Europe.
European Union officials think that this lack of information may change quickly in the next few months. As of September, the European Central Bank will start a major media blitz. Through the fall, most European banks will start sending their customers checkbooks in euros. Until now, euros have been used only in electronic payments and in bookkeeping.
The switchover is complex: not only do the new bills and coins have to be distributed, but the old notes and coins have to be collected. By most estimates there are even more of them, though no one knows for sure how much cash people have had squirreled away in cookie jars and under mattresses. Some banks have even taken steps to reinforce their floors because of the additional weight of money in their vaults.
Most of the conversion will take place as citizens withdraw new money from the bank and get euro change back from stores when they make purchases. But will the stores be willing to keep more cash than usual on hand? And what will happen when transactions become burdened with two currencies?
Mr. Angel, the European Union official, said that McDonald's had found that waits doubled or tripled when their employees had to handle two currencies and that mistakes in change were rampant. He said the fast-food chain was planning to double personnel at cash registers. 
A major supermarket chain, he said, found its lines increased from an average of 5 people to 20, a situation that crippled movement in its stores. To ease the transition, the chain has decided to offer a rare service in Europe -- baggers.
But surveys show that the vast majority of small and medium-size businesses have yet to do anything to prepare. Even sales of calculators to convert the currency have been extremely slow, Mr. Angel said.
And what if European armored-car drivers should decide to strike? Dutch and French drivers have already threatened to do so.
The situation could vary widely depending on the country and how it prepares. The European Central Bank will start a $90 million television and print campaign to inform the public starting next month. But some countries -- Portugal has even enlisted the church to help educate older people -- have already embarked on publicity campaigns aimed at easing the changeover.
National habits could also play a part in how things go. In some countries, such as Ireland, consumers go often to A.T.M.'s and take out small amounts. In others like Austria, they tend to take out large bills.
The impact of the change will reach far beyond the 12 countries using the euro. In Poland, for instance, distrust of the banking system remains strong, especially among older and rural people. Some experts estimate that Poles may hold as much as $2 billion in cash hoarded at home, much of it in German marks -- the hard currency of choice in many parts of formerly Communist Europe. The Polish central bank has already kicked off an information campaign.
Bank officials fear the exchange of national currencies will offer criminals a convenient opportunity to introduce counterfeits and launder money. A report by the European Union's fledgling police agency, Europol, recently warned that the high value of the notes may make financial crime easier by enabling criminals to cram more cash into their briefcases when they cross borders. The report warned that the high denominations of the euro bills -- an 500 euro bill is worth about $425 -- could ease money laundering.
In most Eurozone countries, the highest value euro bank note will be worth far more than the current biggest domestic note. In Greece, for instance, the note will be worth 17 times the highest drachma note.
Meanwhile, some experts say the changeover may have a powerful effect on the psyche of Europeans. Some say that the unfamiliar prices, may so discombobulate people that they put off buying anything but immediate necessities, leading to an economic slowdown.
Others say that the euro might help forge a new political awareness. "The euro may be a real catalyst for change," Jacques Birouste, a professor of psychology who studied the psychosocial impact of the new money on European citizens. "This may be the moment where many Europeans for the first time really look at what the European Union means and the transfer of sovereignty, which actually happened years ago. And this may have a lot of impact on the political world."

HEADLINE: POLL IN NEW YORK FINDS ROSIER VIEWS ON CITY'S FUTURE 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
New Yorkers now hold a sunnier view of their city and its future than they have held in nearly a quarter of a century, with many crediting Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for its improved fortunes. Nonetheless, most say they are not concerned about the pending change of leadership at City Hall, and few are paying much attention to the contest to replace him, according to the latest New York Times Poll.
 With the exception of the public school system and the cost and availability of housing, both areas of continuing worry among New Yorkers, the buoyant view of the city was evident almost across the board. Respondents offered an upbeat view of the economy, their families' financial situations, the performance of the Police Department, the safety of the streets and race relations. 
 The number of New Yorkers who said they or a family member had been a victim of a crime in the last year, 10 percent, was the lowest it had been since The Times began asking the question in 1985. Barely one-third of respondents said they would move out of New York City if they could, a drop from 60 percent 10 years ago, before Mr. Giuliani took office. 
Although black respondents continued to hold a bleaker view of some aspects of New York than whites did, the disparity was not as great as it has been in past Times polls.
Even as voters expressed an upbeat view of the state of the city, most did not believe that the change in administration would push New York off course. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they believed that New York would be as good a place to live, or even better, no matter who succeeded Mr. Giuliani. Black voters in particular said they thought life in New York would improve with Mr. Giuliani's departure.
And while Mr. Giuliani's approval rating has edged up above 50 percent for the first time in more than two years in this latest poll, he would apparently have a tougher time winning re-election this year, were it allowed, than he did in 1997, when he defeated Ruth W. Messinger by 14 percentage points. In hypothetical matchups, all four of the major Democrats would run a close race with Mr. Giuliani, the poll found.
Given the overall sense of satisfaction among many New Yorkers, the competitive Democratic primary to succeed Mr. Giuliani has not drawn much attention and remains muddled with a month to go until the Sept. 11 primary. One in five respondents say they have not decided whom to support. 
Among enrolled Democrats, Mark Green, the public advocate, is ahead with 29 percent. Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, followed him with 19 percent. The city comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, had 14 percent, while the the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, drew 12 percent. If no candidate gets above 40 percent in the primary, there will be a runoff between the two highest-scoring candidates on Sept. 25.
But among Democrats who said they definitely intended to vote in the primary, the race looks closer. Mr. Green leads with 30 percent to Mr. Ferrer's 23 percent, a statistically insignificant difference. Mr. Vallone has 14 percent, and Mr. Hevesi essentially ties him with 13 percent.
The difference between Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Vallone was not statistically significant in either group. Nonetheless, Mr. Hevesi's weak showing, particularly after he took the unusual step earlier this year of spending more than $1 million on an early round of television advertisements, could undercut his continuing effort to present himself as the sleeper candidate in the race as he seeks to win the support of elected Democratic leaders and union heads.
A Quinnipiac University poll released yesterday showed a slightly different lineup among Democrats at this stage of the campaign. Among likely voters, Mr. Green was in the lead with 32 percent, Mr. Hevesi followed at 18 percent, and Mr. Vallone and Mr. Ferrer were at 15 and 14, respectively. The margin of sampling error among likely voters was plus or minus five percentage points. 
The number of Republicans questioned in the Times poll was too small to present more than a rough indication of how that contest is shaping up. That said, it does appear that Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire communications executive, is comfortably ahead: he is leading his opponent, Herman Badillo, by nearly six to one among registered Republican voters.
The Times poll was conducted Aug. 5 to 12 with 1,353 New Yorkers, of whom 924 said they were registered to vote. Of those voters, 548 said they were enrolled as Democrats. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four points for Democratic voters, and plus or minus three points for all registered voters. Among those Democrats who said they intend to vote, the margin of error is plus or minus five points.
If history is any guide, the amount of attention voters are paying to the primaries should jump up in the days ahead, as all the candidates go on the air with commercials. Mr. Green released his first advertisement yesterday, thus becoming the fourth Democrat to go on the air. 
The beginning of the official mayoral debates sponsored by the Campaign Finance Board at the end of this month is also likely to spur interest. The standing of the candidates could shift accordingly as attention to their contests picks up and as they engage one another.
As of now, though, 4 out of 10 registered voters say they were not paying much attention to the contest. Nearly 60 percent of Democrats said the Democratic candidates were "all pretty much alike," a point that even some of the candidates have made.
More than half of the respondents said they did not know enough about the candidates to say, or were undecided, whether they held a favorable or unfavorable view of them. That said, none of the candidates posted the kind of high unfavorable rating that would signal trouble.
While voters' impressions of the candidates remain unformed, a few perceptions are taking shape. Although Mr. Green has tried to portray himself as politically moderate, he is clearly viewed as the most liberal of the Democrats. Four of 10 registered voters described his views as liberal. (Not necessarily a bad thing in a Democratic primary in New York.) By contrast, just 18 percent of respondents said the same thing about Mr. Vallone.
Mr. Green is enjoying strong support among black voters, while Mr. Ferrer, who is seeking to become the city's first Puerto Rican mayor, has the overwhelming support of Hispanic voters. Mr. Ferrer has been moving aggressively to line up the support of black leaders as well, and if he succeeds, he could reduce the overall support enjoyed by Mr. Green.
The Times poll found that any oneof the four Democrats would defeat Mr. Bloomberg if the general election were held today. Mr. Green is shaping up as the strongest candidate the Democrats could run against him, leading Mr. Bloomberg by 55 percent to 30 percent, while Mr. Ferrer would be the weakest, defeating him by 46 percent to 36 percent.
Mr. Bloomberg, although new to the political scene, was viewed favorably by one in four voters. And while some Democrats have criticized him for spending millions of dollars of his own money on his campaign -- he has already set a record by spending $16 million on his candidacy -- the poll suggests that his spending is not a problem among voters.
Most respondents said they were not concerned by the prospect of Mr. Bloomberg using his personal fortune to get into Gracie Mansion. And nearly 6 in 10 said they were more bothered by the prospect of candidates' using special-interest money to finance their race for office, which is how Mr. Bloomberg has sought to frame the issue in attacking Democrats for participation in the city's campaign financing system.
The poll also indicated some areas of weakness in Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy. A majority of respondents said they would prefer having someone with experience in government rather than experience in the private sector at the city's helm.
Of the two areas listed as concerns among respondents, nearly three-quarters said the school system was in bad shape. In contrast to four years ago, when an equal number of respondents in a Times poll listed schools and crime as the top issues the next mayor needed to deal with, in this poll, voters were twice as likely to list education as crime as their top concern.
Nearly 60 percent of respondents said they considered the cost and availability of housing to be a very serious problem.
Two-thirds of respondents said it was a bad idea to eliminate the Board of Education as a way of making the mayor more responsible for the schools. About 4 in 10 said they were pleased with the performance of Harold O. Levy, the schools chancellor; a third said they disapproved.
What was most striking about the poll was the extent to which New Yorkers were, at once, happy about the state of the city, generally approving of Mr. Giuliani, yet not worried about his departure.
"It's a natural progression that things will get better," said Gwendolyn Wilson, 69, a teacher, who is black and is supporting Mr. Ferrer, in a follow-up interview. "If the economy continues to strengthen, and people are better off, the quality of life will improve and people become more conscious and aware and better educated. I don't see the city regressing at all."
Only 25 percent said they believed that the city would become a worse place to live in the next 10 to 15 years, the lowest percentage since The Times first asked the question 28 years ago. Eight years ago, before Mr. Giuliani was elected, half of city residents were pessimistic about the long-term course of the city.
And 4 in 10 said Mr. Giuliani's policies had a lot to do with the improvements. Overall, 55 percent said they approved of the job he was doing, compared with 30 percent who disapproved. That is one area in which there was a clear distinction between blacks and whites: nearly one out of every two blacks said they disapproved of his job performance.

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Aug. 5 to 12 in all parts of New York City with 1,353 adults, of whom 924 said they were registered to vote. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish. 
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of city exchanges. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each area in the city was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough, race, sex, age, education, and Hispanic descent.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Yorkers.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus 5 percentage points for white registered voters, 6 points for black registered voters, and 7 points for Hispanic registered voters. For registered Democrats who say they will definitely vote in the Sept. 11 primary election, it is plus or minus 5 percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart and Home Depot Are Able to Increase Profits 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
In the face of a sluggish economy and a tough market for retailers, Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot managed to report today that their earnings rose in the second quarter.
 Still, Wal-Mart said its third-quarter earnings would be at the low end of Wall Street's forecasts and that it would not meet its profit goals for the second half of the year. 
 Home Depot, however, said it would meet analysts' estimates for the third quarter.
"Our goal for the second half of the year remains double-digit earnings growth," Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's president and chief executive, said in a recorded call to investors. "We expect earnings growth in the second half will show improvement over the first half of this year as we leverage our sales and market-share gains, but the growth may not meet our original goals." 
Mr. Scott did not give specific details about the company's earnings goals, but he did say that expenses had risen because of increases in employee wages, medical benefits, utility charges and insurance costs.
The earnings gains at Wal-Mart and Home Depot came as the Commerce Department reported that overall retail sales were unchanged in July for a second consecutive month. Excluding sales of automobiles, however, retail sales edged up 0.2 percent last month.
For its second fiscal quarter ended July 31, Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, reported that net income edged up more than 1 percent, to $1.62 billion, or 36 cents a diluted share, compared with $1.60 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-cent charge for acquiring a minority stake in Walmart .com, the company said it had earned 37 cents a share.
Analysts had expected the company, based in Bentonville, Ark., to earn 36 cents to 39 cents a share, with a consensus estimate of 37 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
Wal-Mart's sales rose 14.5 percent, to $52.80 billion from $46.11 billion.
Despite the company's gloomy comments on its short-term future, analysts said it was making a sound decision in trying to secure longer-term consumer loyalty.
"Clearly they're gaining market share, and with that said their gross margins and their profits are taking a hit because they're just really getting aggressive relative to Kmart and Target and dropping some prices," said Robert F. Buchanan, a retailing industry analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons. "I just think it makes sense at the end of the day. Once you win market share, you're in an excellent position to restore pricing and enjoy substantial prices when the economy returns."
Shares of Wal-Mart rose 16 cents, to $52.36.
Home Depot, the leading home improvement retailer, exceeded analysts' estimates by reporting that its net income rose more than 10 percent, to $924 million, or 39 cents a diluted share, in its second quarter, from $838 million, or 36 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call expected earnings of 36 cents to 38 cents a share, with a consensus estimate of 37 cents a share.
Sales at Home Depot, based in Atlanta, rose 15.5 percent, to $14.58 billion from $12.62 billion. The company opened 71 stores in the quarter. 
Robert. L. Nardelli, president and chief executive of Home Depot, said in a conference call with analysts that sales of energy-efficient products, paints and appliances were primarily responsible for the growth.
Analysts said they were encouraged by the company's forecast because it provided reassurance for investors in a questionable economy. 
"What you saw today from Home Depot is a company that is focused on fixing its internal act, meaning reducing expenses and bringing inventory down," said Gary Balter, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Internal developments at Home Depot give us confidence that they'll achieve their earnings, which is something that we can't say about any other retailer."
Shares of Home Depot jumped $1.20, to $49.30.

HEADLINE: Some Like It Hot 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
"I CAN'T think when it's on," said William Katavolos, an architecture professor.
 "I can't think without it," his wife, Terenia Katavolos, a theater reviewer, said separately. 
 "I love it," said Elizabeth Diller, an architect. "It's a completely aesthetic experience -- the hum and the artifice -- it calms my nerves." 
Ms. Diller's professional and personal partner, Ricardo Scofidio, an architect, said later: "If Elizabeth isn't around, I crank it down. I find heat an interesting phenomenon. It reminds me of what summers used to be like -- slower. Everything is becoming so homogenized. Shouldn't life be a little slower in the summer?"
Mr. Scofidio wrapped up his complaint. "New York has become a three-season town," he said.
As temperatures shot into the hundreds last week, the record-breaking six-day heat wave produced a sudden August chill -- between couples who can't agree about air-conditioning.
For many New Yorkers, A.C. means acrimony: a flash point, not a cooling convenience in the house. As talk turned publicly to B.T.U.'s, and the city went dull with the drone of an alien invasion -- tens of thousands of gray units hovering at windows, freezing people as they slept -- relationships indoors began to buckle in the heat. Or lack of it.
"In the beginning, you feel you're performing some kind of offense by leaving the room," said Mr. Katavolos, who moved out of the bedroom into the living room to sleep when the temperature inside dropped as the temperature outside climbed.
"We separated," Ms. Katavolos said.
"I cannot handle the kind of cold my wife can," said Mr. Katavolos, who cited his World War II experience in the Pacific as background on his ability to both handle heat and appreciate natural settings even in extremes. "The body is supposed to perspire."
The Katavolos' dog, a 17-year-old mongrel, spent the nights trotting anxiously between rooms.
What's so bad about feeling good, when it's 103 degrees in the shade? A salesman on the appliance floor at J&R Music and Computer World on Park Row said that air-conditioner sales averaged 200 units a day last Thursday and Friday, when the heat was hitting its peak. A typical summer day's sales are 30 units, he said. A salesman at Bloom & Krup on East 14th Street said his sales also included fans -- the wet and the panicked were buying them as boosters for the air-conditioners, he explained.
Jeffrey Moore, with his partner, Luis Aleman, rug makers who live and work in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, are two who broke down last week and bought an air-conditioner, despite Mr. Moore's long-standing aversion to the idea.
"I'm not an air-conditioned person," he said. "I find it artificial, and the noise bothers me -- the repetitiousness. But then, by Wednesday, there was no air -- in the universe." Mr. Moore added proudly, "I held out -- I made it through July."
With the new 7,000 B.T.U. air-conditioner roaring, Mr. Aleman hears only the tinkle of ice, the fall of snow.
"It reminds me a little bit of winter; I relax," he said happily. Mr. Aleman was born in Cartagena, Colombia. "I moved from Cartagena to Bogota because it was too hot, then here. Alaska -- next year. It's never too cold. I use blankets if it is."
Mr. Moore gets up in the night in the one-bedroom apartment and, in stealth, readjusts the thermostat while Mr. Aleman sleeps. 
"He likes 78, and I like 72," Mr. Aleman explained, undeceived.
Control, not hot or cold, is the real issue in the air, said Elana Katz, a couples therapist at the Ackerman Institute for the Family in New York who has thawed the chill between clients over air-conditioning, especially in the bedroom.
"Whose preferences govern -- that's when the rubber hits the road," Ms. Katz said. "Who wins? Does the same person always win? It gets complicated if it's always one person who's giving in, for the good of the relationship."
David Rockwell, the architect, described his home in New York as a "complex network of environmental controls," including room-by-room settings for lighting and music, for which he and his wife, Marcia Kirkley, divide the authority "on an hour-to-hour basis," Mr. Rockwell said.
But -- "air-conditioning is the baseline for me," he explained. "I'll give up dimmers and stereo for A.C." Mr. Rockwell likes it cool. His advice to the tropical at heart: "Wear more clothes."
Each camp has its ace to throw onto the table when accounts are called in. Anti-air-conditioning people slap down the allergy card -- a discussion-stopping scare tactic.
"Some air-conditioning systems actually have fungus in them," said Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, a professor of medicine at the University of Virginia. "When you turn them on, you get fungus exposure. It's been proven many times, with car air-conditioners especially." Dr. Platts-Mills added though that only water back-up, or an inadequate filter, would promote the growth of fungus. And air-conditioning, which decreases humidity in the air, decreases the presence of dust mites, and the attack of dust mite allergies.
Air-conditioning advocates play the sleep card. Dr. Joyce Walsleben, the director of the New York University Sleep Disorders Center, who evaluated the data collected in a recent survey of 1,000 Americans' sleep habits, said, "Fifty percent had a huge problem sleeping with heat."
The rub -- "Men and women still prefer to sleep with their significant others," she said. "Sixty-four percent admitted that they sleep better with their partner than without."
Dr. Walsleben's advice was as crisp as a sheet. "Cool down both physically and mentally before you get into bed at night," she said. "Don't add to the heat by arguing over the air-conditioning. A cool eye mask, a cool shower, ear plugs, two twins pushed together that allow you to have your own bedding or blankets -- these are comfort-zone things that make a difference in being able to stay with a partner at night."
While the debate rises and falls with the thermometer, the air-conditioning industry's attitude is cavalier, to say the least, even with flat sales last year, which it blames on the economy and a cool summer in 2000.
"We focus on how to provide comfort to people who want it," said Jon Shaw, a spokesman at Carrier, the world's largest manufacturer of air-conditioning equipment, in a kind of back-handed slap at heat warriors like Mr. Katavolos. With $3.5 billion in global sales of residential air-conditioning systems and a 75 percent "penetration" into American homes, Carrier isn't breaking a sweat about people who don't like the product.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Fall, With the Nasdaq Closing at a 4-Month Low

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks dropped yesterday, sending the technology-based Nasdaq composite index to its lowest level in nearly four months.
 Sagging corporate profits again appeared to be a concern for investors. "People are very cautious," said Rick Meckler, president of Liberty View Management in Jersey City, "and don't have the same willingness to bottom-fish and look out another year." 
 Those who thought that the sluggish economy might have started improving by now, with the help of interest rate cuts, are finding that the troubles are proving to be longer-lasting, with companies expected to post another sharp decline in profits. The stock market has made little progress in the last few weeks as investors avoid buying shares until evidence of an economic turnaround seems apparent. "It's a wait-and-see mode," said Peter Coolidge of Brean Murray & Company in New York. "There is just no catalyst to move stocks one way or another." 
The Nasdaq index fell 45.64 points, or 2.32 percent, to 1,918.89 -- its lowest close since April 16. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average declined less steeply, falling 66.22 points, or 0.64 percent, to 10,345.95. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.71 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,178.02. Market breadth was slightly positive on the New York Stock Exchange; on the Nasdaq, declining issues outnumbered those advancing, 2,123 to 1,535. Volume was 1.07 million shares.
Hewlett-Packard was one stock leading the Dow lower. It declined 76 cents, to close at $24.10, ahead of an earnings report due after the end of trading today.
Dell Computer fell $1.07, to $25.50, also ahead of its earnings announcement today. Credit Suisse First Boston, citing tough industry conditions, trimmed its 2002 earnings projection for Dell by 2.8 percent and cut its 2003 estimates 10 percent.
Veritas Software fell $3.04, to $34.40, after Morgan Stanley analysts raised questions about the performance of some of the company's products. BEA Systems, the electronic commerce software maker, dropped $1.56, to $17.04. The company said that quarterly earnings met estimates, but it lowered its outlook for the rest of the year, noting the softness in the economy.
Applied Materials, the semiconductor-equipment maker, rose 9 cents, to $43.74. It reported quarterly net income down more than 90 percent, yet still surpassed its target of breaking even in the badly slumping chip industry. Applied Materials said orders would remain weak in the fourth quarter, but be in line with those in the third quarter. Sales are expected to be flat, but the company said it expected a profit.
Advanced Micro Devices fell 75 cents, to $14.75, after losing $1.11 on Tuesday. I.B.M. said it has stopped selling desktop PC's in the United States with the company's chips in favor of those made by Intel and might also drop them in Asia. 
Metromedia Fiber Network, of White Plains, fell 44 cents, to 70 cents. The company, which builds high-speed fiber optic communications networks in cities, said that its quarterly loss more than doubled from the period a year earlier and that it was still seeking financing.
Among energy providers, Enron fell $2.68, to $40.25, on the news of Jeffrey Skilling's surprise resignation as chief executive. --------------------

Treasury Prices Lower
By Bloomberg News
Bond prices declined on a report that factory output in July leveled off, suggesting to some that the Federal Reserve might not lower interest rates next week. The central bank, which has cut rates six times this year in an effort to reinvigorate the economy, has been expected to lower the federal funds rate again when it meets on Tuesday.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 8/32, to 100 2/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.99 percent from 4.96 percent on Tuesday. The 30-year bond fell 4/32, to 98. Its yield rose to 5.51 percent from 5.50 percent.

HEADLINE: Administration Reconfigures The Budget Pie 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is making an accounting change involving Social Security that will free $4.3 billion for Congress to use, officials said today.
 The increase could be important as the White House and its Republican allies in Congress try to fend off Democratic assertions that President Bush's tax cuts have drained too much of the surplus to meet government spending priorities. 
 Even with the change, the revised surplus projections for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 will be much lower than the administration and Congressional Budget Office projected earlier this year. The $275 billion surplus, including Social Security, that was forecast by the budget office in May could fall to roughly $160 billion because of the tax cut and slowing economy. 
Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the accounting change more correctly describes revenue from payroll taxes, those dedicated to Social Security and Medicare. "There's a general consensus that the Social Security surplus should be used for debt reduction," one official said.
Democrats described the change as an unprecedented accounting gimmick intended to mask the impact of Mr. Bush's 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut on the budget.
The new $4.3 billion on the side of the budget pie that lawmakers use for tax cuts or spending would be shifted from the politically sensitive Social Security section of the budget. Republicans, especially in the House, have staked much on preventing Social Security from being tapped for government spending.
Also today, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, and other Democrats wrote to Mr. Bush that the upcoming budget revisions would clearly demonstrate the threat to Social Security and Medicare.
"We face the very real prospect that your tax cut, coupled with an economy that is slowing significantly, will have exhausted all of the surplus in the near term and leave no way to fund other functions of government without tapping into Medicare and Social Security," they said.

HEADLINE: Homebuilders' Index Is at a 9-Month High 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
An index measuring optimism among homebuilders rose to a nine-month high in August, a sign of growing demand, an industry survey showed. 
 The National Association of Home Builders' housing market index increased to 62 this month, the highest since November, from 56 in July. 
A reading above 50 signals a majority of builders are positive about market conditions. 
 With builders this optimistic, "housing should stay at a reasonably high level" for the next few months, said Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. 
The report suggests that rising home prices are bringing homebuyers into the market, helping to underpin demand.
"Homebuyers are taking note, preferring to invest in housing rather than in the declining stock market," said Bruce Smith, president of the trade group and a builder from Walnut Creek, Calif.
All the index's components also reached their highest levels since November. An index of current sales rose to 68 in August from 61 in July. An index of expected new-home sales over the next six months increased to 69 from 66. An index measuring traffic of prospective buyers rose to 45 from 40. 
The housing market index is based on a survey that asks builders to rate current sales of single-family homes and to assess the outlook for sales over the next six months. The index runs from zero to 100. The association has been conducting the survey for about 20 years.

HEADLINE: A Fading of Emerging Markets; 
Investors Are Leaving After Years of Financial Crises

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Philip Ehrmann of Gartmore Investment Management in London is still a believer in emerging markets. As head of the Pacific and emerging markets unit and a manager of about $1 billion, he has been trying to persuade investors to move back in to these volatile markets.
 "Over the next two or three years," Mr. Ehrmann says, "this is going to look like a good entry point." 
 Not many people are taking his advice. "Very difficult," is how he described the job of selling emerging markets after a trip to the United States. "It's pretty dark out there." 
Pitch black, in fact.
Even with huge rallies from time to time, the leading index of emerging market stocks is off 43.3 percent since 1993, in dollar terms, and 29 percent in the last year. The last decade is replete with crises that have reduced or erased gains from previous years, like Asia's financial collapse in 1997, Russia's devaluation of the ruble in 1998, Brazil's devaluation in 1999, Turkey's this year, and Argentina's struggle to avoid default on its debt and devaluation of its currency.
Their hopes dashed, investors, big and small, are again heading for the exits -- and this time they may not come back for a while. The net outflow so far this year is $1.3 billion, or 6.6 percent of the assets in stock mutual funds dedicated to emerging markets, according to AMG Data Services. Last year, $1.9 billion moved out of the funds, the third consecutive year for a drain in investments.
But the investor flight has done more than simply bring money back home. It is changing the nature of emerging markets as a place to invest, affecting who is investing and, in turn, altering how Wall Street approaches these markets. This means that even as Western investors continue to hold a stick over the fiscal and monetary policies of many developing countries, they are directing less money to many of them while concentrating on a handful of favorites, like Brazil.
"The emerging market industry is a pale shadow of its former self," said Arturo C. Porzecanski, chief economist for emerging markets at ABN AMRO Securities. "It was hot; people wanted to come work in this area. That is not true anymore."
Even some specialists in the sector now suggest that it might be best for individual investors to stay away.
"It's a trade, not a buy-and-hold market," said Geoffery Dennis, Latin American equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "These are markets that are much more interesting for a short-term investor than a long-term investor."
Once viewed as a separate asset class where investors were encouraged to park some money to properly diversify, these markets have become much more Balkanized. No longer is it considered essential to have at least some exposure to emerging markets promising potentially great rewards for those willing to bear the risk. Indeed, some countries have simply fallen off the investment radar screen.
"The days of a retail investor saying, 'I really want to buy a fund that will give me exposure to Turkey' are over," said Adrian Faure, a head of the newly reorganized global emerging markets research group at Merrill Lynch.
While trading volume in stocks or bonds in these countries is not a perfect measure of investor interest, it has plunged in countries like Chile, the Philippines and Venezuela. "Investments in small countries are hard to justify," said Miguel Gutierrez, a head of emerging markets at J. P. Morgan.
Even in Argentina, whose bond market has been active even as it sold off this year, the bond trading volume is about a third of what it was at the height of the financial crisis that began in Southeast Asia in 1997 and spread to just about every developing country by 1998. The value of traded stocks in 2000 in Argentina was about one-tenth the total in 1997 and not much higher than the total for 1991.
Some of the drop is because many of the hedge funds and speculators that used to trade in these markets are gone, leaving local investors as the mainstay.
"The risk appetite in the international market is changing," said Richie Prager, global head of emerging markets for Bank of America.
The number of new stock issues from developing countries has also dropped sharply. The dollar value of new issues so far this year has fallen more than 70 percent compared with a year earlier, according to Thomson Financial. Direct investment from abroad has also fallen.
Some companies, especially in Latin America, are issuing American depositary receipts so they can trade in New York rather than at home, which undermines the liquidity, or smooth functioning, of domestic markets.
Because of all this, some analysts say that emerging markets are in danger of losing their special status. These markets have been one of many categories, like bonds or commodities, over which investors normally spread money in search of diversification, so that part of their portfolio would rally while other parts were falling. But the benefits of diversification into emerging markets, like the returns, are evaporating because they now tend to follow the lead of Wall Street, especially when American stocks are falling.
On Wall Street, firms are reducing coverage of emerging markets and redirecting it. "We are getting focused on which clients are served with what products in which geographies," Mr. Prager of Bank of America said. And this means, he added, that some countries "don't make the grade."
Bank of America, whose emerging market business is in fixed income, is one of the latest to retrench. In June the bank announced that it was curtailing its presence in countries like Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Venezuela. Argentina is not being reduced or enhanced. Resources will be redirected to other emerging markets, including Brazil, Mexico and wealthier countries that are still in the same class, like Hong Kong and South Korea.
Merrill Lynch has announced a reorganization that includes layoffs of analysts in Latin America. "Across Wall Street, on the buy side and on the sell side, that is the trend," Mr. Faure of Merrill Lynch said.
The reorganization at Merrill Lynch is bringing a broader approach to the work. Emerging market stocks from one country will be compared more rigorously with those in the same industry in other developing countries and, possibly, with those in developed markets.
"The whole approach to emerging markets has become more global over the last five years," Mr. Faure said. "It is much more focused on sectors rather than countries."
Satyen Mehta, the portfolio manager of J. P. Morgan's Emerging Markets Equity Fund, said that one reason for the switch was that more companies from emerging markets have graduated to the global stage than the developing countries themselves.
All this means that the dedicated money manager, the one who was putting money solely into emerging markets, is becoming less influential. More important is the global stock fund that is free to invest around the world, putting little or nothing into emerging markets depending on how they compare with other investments. Money will still flow into some of these markets, but it will probably be pulled out faster when conditions sour.
Even the "good news" for emerging markets is not so positive; the contagion associated with financial crises of the past has diminished, so a problem in one country does not immediately undermine markets in other countries. But one reason the contagion has declined is that investors are not as active in those markets.
Another negative is that many investors had expected these markets to become less volatile, and therefore a little "safer," as emerging countries carried out programs backed by the International Monetary Fund to open their economies, reduce inflation and strengthen their financial systems.
After Asia and Russia, investors were pleasantly surprised when Brazil devalued its currency in January 1999 and there was no new crisis. But the problems in Argentina, and the spillover on neighboring Brazil, show that "safer" is further off than many people thought.
"I believe this crisis will pass," said Peter Gruber, president of Globalvest Management, which oversees investments of about $800 million in Latin America. "And it will be a catalyst for change. But it doesn't mean there won't be another one."
Brazil, in fact, is next on many analysts lists, despite its efforts to open its economy and improve its financial system.
And signs that the Bush administration is easing its opposition to monetary aid for developing countries in turmoil, including $15 billion in loans for Brazil and an acceleration of assistance for Argentina, may be an indication that the situation is much worse than officials thought. (Argentina is negotiating with the I.M.F. for billions of dollars of new assistance.)
But money managers like Mr. Ehrmann argue that with the turmoil in Argentina, the fallout in Brazil and the poor performances come new opportunities. After Russia's bond default and currency devaluation in August 1998, emerging markets plunged. But in 1999 they surged 64 percent.
Mr. Mehta of J. P. Morgan also says that investors have overreacted. In the last three years, he says, emerging markets have performed better than developed markets outside of the United States. 
Emerging markets, based on Morgan Stanley Capital International's free index, are up 4.8 percent while developed markets in the EAFE index (Europe, Australasia and the Far East) are down 2.4 percent.
While both emerging stock and bond markets are down this year, their performances are not as bad as the reports from Turkey and Argentina would suggest. The emerging markets free index is down 8.3 percent, compared with a 10.1 percent decline for the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
The return from emerging market bonds, according to J. P. Morgan's index, is 1.3 percent.
Still, there is only one thing that will reverse the outflow of funds anytime soon, Mr. Ehrmann of Gartmore said. "Performance, performance, performance."
All this leaves Mr. Porzecanski of ABN AMRO wondering. At 51, he has been dealing with emerging markets for 25 years. But he thinks that the crises of the last decade and the poor performances have done serious damage to the image of emerging markets that will take a long time to erase. "By the time I am ready to retire," he said, "it will be right for me to retire."

Entergy Agrees to Acquire Nuclear Reactor in Vermont
Entergy signed a deal to buy the Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor for $180 million, a price about 10 times higher than when bidding for the plant opened in late 1999.
 But the price was still probably less than a quarter of what it would take to build a new reactor, showing how far the current revival of interest in nuclear power would have to go to actually renew the industry. Page C4.

HEADLINE: Arauquita Journal; 
Pipeline Goes 'Boom!' Local Economies Go Bust

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: ARAUQUITA, Colombia, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
The first thunderous blast came at 3:40 p.m. today, quickly followed by a second. A plume of acrid black smoke then rose to the sky, and everyone for miles around knew exactly what had happened: leftist rebels had once more bombed the oil pipeline that runs through this rich oil producing area.
 It is an all too common occurrence here in Colombia's eastern hinterlands, a region of swamps and rice paddies where Occidental Petroleum of Los Angeles has pumped crude for 16 years. 
 With today's bombing, 119 attacks on the pipeline have been recorded this year, up from 96 in all of 2000, a terror campaign that has destroyed farms and crippled local governments that depend on oil royalties to bankroll schools, hospitals and road repairs. 
"It happens so much -- 'boom!' is what you hear -- that you do not even pay attention anymore," said Espedito Gutierrez, 63, a farmer who spoke as the pipeline burned in the background just outside this town. "But it makes you feel like you should just leave this place. It saps your morale. You do not want to work. All your work is suddenly sacrificed."
Just a month ago, rebels blew up the section of pipeline running behind Mr. Gutierrez's small farm, just half a mile from today's explosion. Trees were charred. Oil seeped out across 15 acres. 
With little grassland left for grazing, Mr. Gutierrez now has no alternative but to allow his cattle to continue feeding in the oily mess.
He is one of many victims of a wave of bombings that since 1986, when the first attack was recorded, has resulted in the spilling of 2.6 million barrels of oil, nearly 11 times what was lost in the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska. 
The government has tried to guard the pipeline, but it is simply too long, stretching 500 miles from the Cano Limon oil field to the Caribbean port of Covenas.
"To prevent them from blowing up the pipeline is almost impossible," said Brig. Gen. Carlos Lemus, commander of the local brigade. "We can maybe control it, but it is hard to say we are going to stop it completely."
Two rebel groups are responsible for the attacks, the National Liberation Army and the much larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, both of which have said the bombings are strikes against multinational corporations that they accuse of exploiting Colombian resources.
But here in this largely rural province, Arauca, people say the attacks have done nothing but sow misery for them.
This year's bombings have spilled nearly 220,000 barrels of oil and stopped Occidental from pumping 17 million barrels, causing losses estimated at $400 million. And because local and provincial governments depend on oil royalties to make up the vast majority of their budgets, bills have not been paid, teachers are working without wages and hospitals have canceled non-emergency surgeries.
"You feel bad," said Dr. Brenda Caroprese, who works at the San Vicente Hospital, where 60 percent of the budget comes from royalties. "People come in and they need help. But they cannot pay, and there is nothing we can do to resolve their problems."
Indeed, Dr. Cesar Londono, the hospital's administrator, said he had slashed services, like optometry and speech therapy. The hospital, located in the provincial capital, also called Arauca, lacks intravenous drips, bed sheets and bandages. Some lab tests, even simple ones like those testing people for their blood type, are put off for lack of equipment. On a recent day, the emergency room staff could not even provide painkillers to a teenage girl moaning in pain from a miscarriage. 
The lack of funds has crippled the capital. By this time of year, Arauca expected $7.1 million in royalties. Instead, only $4.1 million has arrived, devastating for a community whose total annual budget is just $14.2 million, said Narda Martinez, who overseas the budget.
"We wrote our budget last year based on what we thought we would have from royalties, but we have not received that money, so we cannot comply with our commitments," Ms. Martinez explained. The lack of money has nearly shut down city projects like the completion of a children's hospital here, which had been scheduled to be finished this year. Rooms that have been completed are now in danger of being damaged by humidity and rain, since there is no money for upkeep.
"What we have here is a white elephant," said the construction foreman, Juan Perez, who is one of only two construction workers at the site. He said the project needed 18 workers.
The provincial government is in even worse shape. About 90 percent of its $74 million budget depends on royalties, said Heriberto Villamizar, who oversees the budget. Nearly 1,000 teachers, he said, have been working without pay since the end of May. And because private contractors have not been paid by the government, those companies are laying off workers.
Residents are scrimping and saving.
"People do not spend, since they are not being paid," said Luis Sandoval, who owns a large ice cream shop in Arauca. "So things get hard for everyone, even for someone selling ice cream."
But it is in the countryside where the pipeline bombings, and the lingering effects, are felt most keenly.
For the farmers who raise small herds of cattle or grow rice and bananas, the bombings have not only ruined fields but also led to an increase in violence.
Indeed, in the last two months an army offensive through the region has put villagers on edge, in part because government troops often accuse them of aiding the guerrillas, several residents said in interviews in a handful of towns across this province.
Nighttime is the worst. Villagers who live near the pipeline know it can blow at any moment. Or that soldiers and rebels might tangle in a firefight. Those who venture out on the road have something else to fear: government planes may strafe suspicious vehicles on the road after curfew, a policy aimed at preventing rebel groups from moving fighters in the dead of night.
"There is nothing but destruction, destruction, destruction," said Maria Cristancho, who farms just outside Arauquita.
Blanca Flor Fajardo, who with her family owns a small plot just west of Arauquita, knows all about destruction. A pipeline bombing three weeks ago destroyed 37 acres of rice, killed most of her ducks and nearly burned down her little house. Now, the lagoon out back is covered in oil.
"There is nothing we can do about it," said Ms. Fajardo, 60. "There is no way to clean it. We cannot do anything about these pipeline attacks. I am just sick of it."
As the pipeline continued burning today, two brothers rode by on bicycles, almost oblivious to the destruction. They have seen it before, they said, and are resigned about what they now face.
"It is terrible, because you cannot work or anything," said Francisco Triana, 18. "There are people who come and blow this up and then they leave. But we are the ones left behind to deal with this."

HEADLINE: Online, the Hiss Defense Doesn't Rest 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
THE Alger Hiss case, which swirled through the second half of the 20th century with low-tech evidence like documents that may or may not have come from a certain manual typewriter, has made it into the 21st century and onto the Internet. And so has the debate.
 It is reflected in a Google search that turns up about 7,900 listings for Hiss -- roughly half the number for Senator Joseph McCarthy, whose anti-Communist crusade was just beginning when the House Un-American Activities Committee heard allegations about Hiss, and about a third of the number for Richard M. Nixon, who rode the Hiss case out of obscurity as a young congressman. 
 And it is reflected in the direction of a five-month-old Web site that is largely the brainchild of Hiss's son Tony. Bucking the trend of scholarship on the Hiss case in the 1990's -- a growing consensus that Hiss, indeed, had most likely been a Soviet agent -- the new site, homepages.nyu.edu/th15, rises to his defense. 
"It seemed the moment to try and redress the balance," said Tony Hiss, a writer and visiting scholar specializing in urban policy at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University. 
Most of the online audience, of course, is too young to have lived through the initial allegations, the Congressional hearings and the two perjury trials that his father faced. The background, in brief, is this: Alger Hiss, a former State Department official, was accused in 1948 of having been part of the Communist underground in the 1930's and of collecting documents to be passed to the Soviet Union. The accuser was Whittaker Chambers, a Time magazine editor who admitted having been a Communist.
So began one of the cold war's enduring debates, the first salvo in what Tony Hiss calls "a fiendishly complicated case, a La Brea tar pit that great minds can sink into and never emerge."
Indeed, historians have long struggled to establish the truth in the Hiss case, which culminated in his conviction in 1950 on perjury charges for having testified that he had not given State Department documents to Chambers. He served 44 months in prison. But even now, nearly five years after Alger Hiss's death at 92, Tony Hiss contends that the conclusion of history is "premature, still." 
Tony Hiss, who turned 60 last week and lives in his father's old apartment in Greenwich Village, maintains that the site reflects more than his own view of a case he grew up in the middle of. "It's not just my personal perspective," he said. "It's a summation of the research and evidence that's been marshaled over the last 50 years that supports his contentions of innocence."
He is also well aware that a Web site will let him take the case for Hiss to a new generation -- whether in scholarly terms or in what his father called "the court of public opinion," where conservatives hail Chambers as a hero, liberal defenders counter that Hiss was framed, and scholars are left to wade through thousands of pages of documents.
Tony Hiss's site went online in March with what he called only "an initial posting," but it totaled more than 1,000 pages, with extracts from 40,000 pages of F.B.I. files released in the 1970's and from 4,000 pages of grand jury minutes unsealed in 1999.
Soon there will be more. Last month Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, ordered that thousands of pages from the House Un-American Activities Committee's files be made public. A coalition of historians and archivists had been pressing for the release of the material, which is measured not in pages or bytes but in linear feet on government warehouse shelves -- 1,275 in all. Tony Hiss is looking forward to posting Hiss-related documents from that trove as they become available.
So far his site has recorded more than 10,000 visits. "It's the best defense mustered of Hiss by the dwindling band of those who believe in Hiss," said David Greenberg, a historian at Columbia University who is working on a book about Nixon and his place in American culture. 
"I don't think anyone is going to treat this site as the repository of truth, except for those who have already made up their minds that Hiss was innocent," Mr. Greenberg added. 
For now, the Hiss site's opening screen is a montage of front-page headlines about Hiss's perjury conviction. "Hiss Verdict: Spy and Liar" declared The Daily News. Perhaps unsurprisingly, considering Tony Hiss's involvement, the Web site asks a question: "Justice . . . or just the beginning?" And visitors can find answers to the question "What do friends and supporters have to say about Alger Hiss?"
Some documents would not be widely accessible were it not for the Web page. "Alger," as Tony Hiss sometimes refers to his father, "left his defense files to the Harvard law library, so not only would you have to schlep up there to see the actual documents, but they're not even there: they're in a climate-controlled warehouse in Framingham, Mass. You'd have to make an appointment and have them trucked in. The traditional procedures of scholarship make it very hard to have access to these materials." 
On the Web site, some documents have been scanned so visitors can download images of half-century-old F.B.I. reports in the PDF format.
"My dad was always confident that sooner or later people would be able to see his story and see that he was telling the truth," Tony Hiss said. "He always said he didn't think that would happen until everything was laid out in front of people and they sifted through the pros and the cons and the accusations and the counterarguments. I think he would have felt this goes a long way toward making that possible." 
Even the site's address has not been without controversy. An N.Y.U. spokesman said that after the online magazine Slate published a column about the Hiss site in March, the university asked Tony Hiss to use a different Web address to designate it more clearly as a personal site rather than an academic one. The spokesman, John Beckman, said that the university felt that the old address, www.nyu.edu/hiss, suggested that the site was sponsored by the university.
"It wasn't a judgment about content," Mr. Beckman said. "The issue was whether it was official work of the university's." Because "my understanding is that he doesn't teach anything with regard to his father's case," the spokesman added, "this is a matter of personal scholarship, and it belongs on a personal home page." 
The site is not Tony Hiss's first effort to have a say in the Hiss case. Though he says he spent his earlier years "trying to have a life that was not about being the son of Alger Hiss," in 1999 he wrote a memoir, "The View From Alger's Window" (Knopf), that told why he believed his father could not have been a spy.
The events in question occurred, of course, before Tony Hiss was born. His faith, he says, rests not so much on anything his father said but on the account of his half-brother, Timothy Hobson, now 74, who told him: "That guy Chambers was in our house maybe once. Dad was not bringing home briefcases stuffed with papers, and Mom was not typing." (Chambers had alleged that Mrs. Hiss had typed some documents on their manual typewriter, a Woodstock; during the hearings, experts were called to testify that imperfections in certain letters proved that the documents could have come only from the Hisses' machine.)
Given its passion and point of view, how can the Hiss site be viewed? In publishing the column about the site in March, Slate had Sam Tanenhaus, the author of "Whittaker Chambers: A Biography" (Random House, 1997), look it over. "I think this belongs in the 'it's a free country' category, and Hiss's supporters have every right to push his case by whatever means pleases them," Slate quoted him as saying. "My only concern would be that the academic/institutional aegis, and the educational angle, might mislead some into supposing this is a balanced, scholarly Web site."
Tony Hiss said he was surprised that anyone would expect it to be a both-sides-now kind of site. "It is the defense, and it makes no bones about that," he said.

HEADLINE: Factory Output Was Barely Down in July 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Two economic reports released today showed factory production slowed its long slide in July and businesses pared their inventory levels in June, both positive signs for the economic outlook.
 The Federal Reserve said overall industrial output -- with factory production being its biggest component -- slipped 0.1 percent in July. It was the 10th consecutive month production declined, and factories, mines and utilities operated at a slow 77 percent of their full capacity. 
 But analysts pointed to the unchanged reading in manufacturing output, calling it a glimmer in a sector that might have put the worst behind it, even though still buffeted by domestic oversupply and a strong dollar that hurts sales overseas. 
"I think we're witnessing a trough," said Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of Manufacturers. "We should be seeing a return to positive industrial production, if not by August, then probably by September."
The Commerce Department reported separately that inventories at businesses fell 0.4 percent in June, their fifth consecutive decline. Business sales fell a sharp 1.4 percent.
The production number was better than Wall Street had been projecting, while the inventory decline was a bit bigger than the 0.3 percent that had been forecast.
Since last year, the manufacturing sector has had the most difficulty in dealing with a slowing economy. Factories shed 49,000 jobs in July, the latest in a string of losses that started in 2000.
Businesses, in a rush to invest in new and more productive equipment, overinvested in expensive items, which left excess capacity when demand fell. That slump in investment in business equipment acted as a drag on economic growth in the first and second quarters of the year, with the second quarter's 0.7 percent pace of growth being the lowest since 1993.
The continued decline in demand led manufacturers to focus on the strength of the dollar against other currencies. A stronger dollar makes American-made goods more expensive in foreign markets. But efforts by the manufacturers' association to persuade the Treasury Department to back down from its unswerving support of the dollar have been rebuffed.
Now signs are emerging that the slump has hit bottom. The Fed's report showed a rebound in the automotive sector, with vehicle production rising to an annual rate of 12.09 million, the fastest pace since October 2000. And while July output posted a 10th consecutive month of decline, it was the smallest decrease since the string of drops began in October.
"The manufacturing recession is over, probably," said Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist with Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis.
Other analysts are less convinced, however, noting that weakness remains in other areas, especially high-techology goods. Production of business equipment was off 0.3 percent in July.
The report on business inventories gave more ambiguous messages. While inventories fell, sales decreased much faster, leaving a crucial measure of inventory bloat higher.
The Commerce Department said that the inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures how long it would take to completely draw down current stocks, rose to 1.43 months in June from 1.42 months in May. The ratio at retailers, however, dipped in June, indicating leaner inventories on store shelves.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The many faces of Adam Smith: Rediscovering 'The Wealth of Nations.'

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
NOT long ago, I asked my research assistant, Melissa Clark, to track down a passage from "The Wealth of Nations" by Adam Smith. Although I expected her to consult the modern edition, she instead requested the original 1776 edition from Princeton's Rare Book Library. The librarian accidentally gave her the fifth edition, published in 1789, and therein she discovered a remarkable signature: George Washington. 
 It is known that Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Hamilton studied "The Wealth of Nations." Washington, too? That prospect "is genuinely thrilling news for historians," said Emma Rothschild, director of the Center for History and Economics at King's College, Cambridge. 
 The Adam Smith that Washington would have read was the unreconstructed Adam Smith, according to Ms. Rothschild, who has a new book out -- "Economic Sentiments: Adam Smith, Condorcet and the Enlightenment" (Harvard University Press). 
Some of Washington's sentiments were clearly Smithian. In his farewell address, for example, he wrote, "Even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences." Smith railed against monopolies and the political influence that accompanies economic power.
In her book -- which is not easy reading at the beach but nonetheless provides unique insights into Smith's thinking -- Ms. Rothschild argues that Smith has been reinvented as a narrow, unyielding defender of unfettered free enterprise. Yes, he emphasized the motivating force of self-interest and gains from free trade, but he also viewed freedom in a broader sense than economic freedom and championed the disadvantaged.
The real Adam Smith was a complex thinker, capable of holding and exploring ideas even when they were in conflict. To understand Smith, Ms. Rothschild says his contributions must be viewed in light of 18th-century institutions.
Smith worried about the encroachment of government on economic activity, but his concerns were directed at least as much toward parish councils, church wardens, big corporations, guilds and religious institutions as to the national government; these institutions were part and parcel of 18th-century government.
Ms. Rothschild stresses that Smith was sometimes tolerant of government intervention, "especially when the object is to reduce poverty." Smith passionately argued, "When the regulation, therefore, is in support of the workman, it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes otherwise when in favour of the masters." He saw a tacit conspiracy on the part of employers "always and everywhere" to keep wages as low as possible.
Smith was a Rawlsian before the philosopher John Rawls, proclaiming: "No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, clothe and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed and lodged."
At the turn of the 19th century, Adam Smith's arguments were invoked by Samuel Whitbread in favor of a minimum wage and by William Pitt against it. "There is something of Smith," Ms. Rothschild wryly observed, "on both sides of the parliamentary debate."
Or consider taxes. Dick Armey does not miss an opportunity to enlist Adam Smith in support of his flat tax. Smith did favor low taxes and argued that subjects "ought to contribute toward the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities." But he also argued, "It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expence, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion."
Would Mr. Armey support a tax on luxury carriages? Smith did.
Smith also supported universal government-financed education because he believed the division of labor destined people to perform monotonous, mind-numbing tasks that eroded their intelligence, not because education led to economic gain. His economic policy had social and moral objectives, not just the maximization of national income. To Smith, enlightenment was for the masses.
Smith saw people as usually rational decision makers, although sometimes seduced by "romantic hopes" to disregard the dangers inherent in their decisions.
Ms. Rothschild's most controversial point is that Smith was skeptical of the notion that an "invisible hand" would lead individuals to unintentionally promote the public interest by pursuing their own self-interest. She even suggests that Smith used the famous metaphor as an ironic joke. This conclusion is speculative and sure to enrage critics. But there can be little doubt that Smith's faith in the invisible hand has been exaggerated by modern commentators. Smith used the metaphor only once in "The Wealth of Nations," applied it narrowly and presented the idea with more than his usual number of caveats.
He persistently worried that if merchants and manufacturers pursued their self-interest by seeking government regulation and privilege, the invisible hand would not work its magic -- a worry that applies with equal force to George W. Bush's energy bill and many other contemporary policies.
Most of postwar economics can be thought of as an effort to determine theoretically and empirically when, and under what conditions, the invisible hand turns out to be all thumbs.
Ms. Rothschild says she does not want to "claim Adam Smith from the right for the left." Her point is that Smith was a nuanced thinker with an unafraid mind, not an ideologue. "The only real sense in which I am a proselytizer," she said, "is to encourage people to read Adam Smith for themselves."
The beauty of Adam Smith -- why he is still worth reading and debating after 225 years -- is that he saw economics as deeply intertwined with human nature, with people's feelings, emotions and thoughts. He eloquently reported what he observed firsthand or learned from history without prejudice or fear. I suspect that that is also why he found it so hard to hew to a consistent line: some observations led to generalities that were incongruent with other generalities drawn from other observations. The elegant properties of laissez-faire rest on assumptions -- including the absence of market power -- that Smith's observations led him to doubt sometimes.
Smith's internal conflicts also demonstrate that deviations from some principles, like proportional taxation and laissez-faire, are sometimes required to satisfy others, like support for the disadvantaged and universal education. These conflicts were on the minds of the founding fathers as well.

HEADLINE: Giuliani-Style Candidate Emerges in Seattle 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Is Seattle ready for Rudolph W. Giuliani? 
 That is not exactly the question before voters in next month's mayoral primary here, but given how often one candidate, Mark Sidran, is referred to as "Seattle's Rudy Giuliani," it gets a little confusing. 
With his advocacy of "civility laws" cracking down on aggressive panhandling, public urination and loitering, and with his promises to get tough on rowdy protesters, Mr. Sidran, the city attorney, has generated considerable attention. That is not easy in a contest in which 11 candidates are vying to oust the incumbent, Paul Schell -- including one challenger who faces charges in attacking Mayor Schell with a bullhorn recently and breaking several bones in his face. 
More than any other major candidate, Mr. Sidran, 50, is hammering away at the theme that people in Seattle are no longer mellow, they are mad. He says they are fed up with disorder in the city, represented daily by a growing population of loiterers that he says lends a distinctly menacing air to downtown areas. 
"I have people all the time comment to me about how they feel safer in Times Square than they do in Pioneer Square," Mr. Sidran said the other day, just after speaking at a Rotary Club lunch where the host introduced him as "our homegrown version of Rudy Giuliani." 
Though he partly demurs in those comparisons to New York's mayor -- "I have, shall we say, a more traditional private life," said the once married and never divorced Mr. Sidran -- he mostly welcomes them. He said that he would emulate Mr. Giuliani, whom he said had shown "the difference a strong mayor, a strong leader, can make to the life of a city." 
In this way, the race here is a referendum on the incumbent, Mr. Schell. It is also a test of one recurring theory -- that Seattleites are too polite to kick their mayor out of office, something they have not done in nearly 50 years. 
But, as David Olson, a political science professor at the University of Washington, puts it, "that thesis is sure being put to the test this year." 
Mr. Schell, 63, has endured an almost epic series of misfortunes in his first term. His plans for what he called a civil "Seattle-style conversation" between protesters and delegates at the World Trade Organization meeting in December 1999 exploded when some of the 40,000 protesters turned violent. A Y2K terrorism alert prompted him to cancel a New Year's celebration, leaving the city quiet while the rest of the planet celebrated the new millennium. 
The dot-com economy has largely collapsed, a Mardi Gras celebration ended in one death and scores of injuries, an earthquake struck the city in February and in March the Boeing Company announced it would move to Chicago. 
Not surprisingly, an embattled Mr. Schell has attracted 11 challengers, with Mr. Sidran and Greg Nickels, a City Council member, generally considered the strongest among them. By all accounts, the mayor is in a dogfight to make the final round of voting -- under Seattle's rules, the top two finishers on Sept. 18 will face each other in November. The race is officially nonpartisan. 
Most analysts predict that two of these three men will make the final cut, but there is no consensus and no consistent polling data to indicate who those two will be. Mr. Nickels received an important boost the other day when Ron Sims, the popular King County Executive, endorsed him with some language that was bluntly critical of Mr. Schell.
And Judy Nicastro, a City Council member who has not endorsed any one, voiced a common feeling about Mr. Schell when she said in an interview: "He's a very nice man with a big heart who means well. But is that what Seattle needs right now? I'm not sure. " 
Because Mr. Nickels and Mr. Schell have similar political views, Mr. Sidran is thought to have a slight advantage, especially among conservative voters and those who, in his relentless depiction, are simply hungry for a change. 
"I've been asking people all around Seattle if they feel better about Seattle than they did four years ago, and I have to say overwhelmingly that the answer has been no," Mr. Sidran said in a speech the other day. 
Mr. Sidran, who has been city attorney for the last 12 years, is probably best known for the "quality of life laws" that he proposed and pushed through City Council. These include toughened penalties for public urination and loitering, and a ban on sitting on the sidewalks in some business districts. 
But while many people in Seattle approve of the measures, they have not endeared Mr. Sidran to the city's considerably sized political left. 
At campaign stops, and in a highly active Web site, the candidate is dogged by a group that calls itself the Sidran Truth Squad, which is fiercely critical of him and says Seattle needs a mayor who stands for "compassion over intolerance" and "First Amendment rights over social and police control."
His major opponents have picked up the theme. Mr. Nickels says Mr. Sidran is "a man who doesn't offer vision, but division." 
Mr. Sidran portrays himself as someone willing to take a stand. 
"The 'Seattle style' historically is this notion that it's not nice and it's not polite to disagree in public or have a vigorous debate," Mr. Sidran said in an interview. "But I'm prepared to try to accomplish things even though I know some people disagree with me and I know there's going to be opposition."
All signs point to Mr. Sidran's making it to the final ballot in November. If that happens, the Guiliani comparisons are sure to intensify. 
"I haven't myself run under the Giuliani label -- these are labels attached by others," Mr. Sidran said. "But if what they mean is that I would be a strong mayor and a strong leader, that I would make a real difference for this city, then I welcome that comparison." 
Whether Seattleites want such a mayor remains to be seen, and the entire election is "a really great test" of where the city is headed, Ms. Nicastro said. "Seattle is no longer Mayberry with high-rises. It's a real, cosmopolitan city with some major cosmopolitan-city issues."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 22, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the election campaign for mayor in Seattle misstated the office of one candidate, Greg Nickels. He is a King County Council member, not a city council member. Because of an editing error, the article referred incorrectly to the likelihood that another candidate, Mark Sidran, would be one of the top two finishers in the primary. Polls show that at least three candidates have strong chances; it is not clear that all signs point to Mr. Sidran's presence on the final ballot.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
During a Bear Market, There's Really No Place Like Home

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
As the American economy struggles to avoid recession, the roof over your head may be more important than you realize.
 Americans' stock portfolios have certainly shrunk, with the market showing no signs of a rapid recovery. Yet consumer spending remains vibrant, and the broad economy above water, despite a 13-month slowdown. And the reason is the family home. 
 If the technology-led boom in stock prices that reached a peak in March 2000 produced a New Economy wealth effect that ramped up consumer spending, then the rising value of Americans' homes is acting as an Old Economy bulwark to prevent a persistent slide.
The impact of the wealth effect has been debated since the Federal Reserve began trying in June 1999 to keep a lid on inflation and slow economic growth by raising interest rates. At the time, Americans were feeling richer, in no small measure because of the rise in stock prices, and they kept spending at such a rapid pace that the Fed found it difficult to restrain growth.
But now, with a sense of wealth harder for many to grasp, attention is being refocused on housing, the traditional source of household assets.
To the surprise of some, the continued strength of the housing market seems to be offsetting some of the decline in stock portfolios, as homeowners refinance their mortgages, either to lower their monthly payments or to borrow money against the rising value of those homes.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is well aware that high home values have made consumers feel wealthier. In fact, he seems to be depending on housing as a buffer against recession until companies, which have severely cut back their capital spending, start to invest again and to rebuild inventories.
"Greenspan is bound and determined that he is going to nurse this thing along by creating a positive wealth effect for housing," said Paul A. McCulley, a portfolio manager at the Pacific Investment Management Company, a bond powerhouse in Newport Beach, Calif.
The six rate cuts by the Fed this year have brought 30-year fixed-rate mortgages down to about 7 percent, just above their recent lows. And a decline in shorter-term Treasury interest rates in anticipation of further Fed rate cuts has pushed one-year adjustable-rate mortgages down to 5.6 percent. Mr. Greenspan's effort means that lending rates should move lower and stay there longer than many analysts have expected, Mr. McCulley said.
Recalling the Fed's earlier direction, he predicted that "Alan Greenspan has raised interest rates for the last time." Mr. Greenspan's term as Federal Reserve chairman ends in June 2004.
Mr. Greenspan has noted housing as an important factor in explaining how much better the economy has held up than expected this year. (He has also said that the $38 billion in tax rebate checks now being mailed will help.)
His heavy emphasis on housing really emerged in answers to some questions before the Senate Banking Committee on July 24.
"I think one of the things that's occurring in the country," Mr. Greenspan said then, "is the evolution of housing into a very sophisticated, complex industry, in the sense that we not only have got standard home-building aspects of home-ownership-related activities, but we're also beginning to find that as home ownership rises and as the market value of homes continues to rise, even in a period when stock prices are falling, we're observing a rather remarkable employment of that so-called home equity wealth in all sorts of household decisions."
He also said that borrowing against rising house prices was not a worrisome long-term trend. Some analysts, though, have been concerned because Americans have borrowed so heavily against their homes in the last two decades that their equity as a percentage of the home's value was at the lowest level on record early this year.
"If unrealized capital gains were declining," Mr. Greenspan said, "which is, of course, what happens when you extract equity from homes, yes, it would be a problem. But there is no evidence of that. Instead, despite the fact of the significant extraction of home equity gains, the level of unrealized capital gains in homes continues to rise apace. So it is not a depleting asset, if I may put it that way. It could be, but fortunately it is not."
Presumably, this is why interest rates have to remain low for a long time, to keep the housing market healthy, unrealized capital gains rising and a sense of the wealth effect intact.
"If the housing market takes a hit," we will be in trouble, said Jay Mueller, an economist at Strong Capital Investment. "But if the broad measure of housing across the country holds up, it will continue to support the economy."
Now what about the negative wealth effect from the stock market? Because stock prices went up so far for so long, shouldn't their decline offset the gains from the home wealth effect?
A recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York says maybe not. It disputes the notion that Americans became aggressive stock investors in the 1990's as they chased Wall Street returns.
The study indicates that the increase in the stock portion of Americans' portfolios was modest. It also suggests that the main reason for the rise in stockholdings was the rise in the value of existing portfolios, not a wild pursuit of more stocks.
"Thus, in clear contrast to the popular view of U.S. households as aggressive portfolio managers," the study says, "our evidence suggests that the typical American investor was largely the passive beneficiary of a bull market."
If correct, this means that the plunge in stock prices will have less of an effect on consumer spending than many fear.
But probably most important, the study contends that real estate -- the home -- is still the largest component of American portfolios, and this is a plus for Mr. Greenspan's strategy for limping through until the economy rebounds.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Where the Money Is"An analysis of the household assets of American families shows that the biggest single holding continues to be the family home. The study treats each household equally, so that the holdings of Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, and his family are given the same weight as those of a family with $100,000 in assets.

HEADLINE: Cuba on the Morning After 

BYLINE:  By William D. Rogers; William D. Rogers, former assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, is co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations' Cuba task force and chairman of the Cuba Policy Foundation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The state of Florida, Dade County and the city of Miami have an extensive plan for handling the departure from power of Fidel Castro. They expect a fiesta of no common size. Cuban exiles danced in Miami's streets when Mr. Castro fainted a few weeks ago. They watched hopefully as he stumbled Monday, in Venezuela, while celebrating his 75th birthday. The end does seem nearer. The average life expectancy for a Cuban man is 68.4 years. Nonetheless, Mr. Castro's father lived to 82, his mother even longer. Having stumbled in Venezuela, Mr. Castro went on to denounce the United States, drink champagne and make merry until dawn. Miami's party had to wait, again.
 The most pressing question, however, is not how to handle the inevitable celebration but what to do the morning after. Mr. Castro's departure will leave a very large hole. He has dominated his country for more than four decades, reigning longer than most dictatorial leaders of the last century and, of course, much longer than the leaders of any of the democracies. Mr. Castro has survived an invasion of 1,200 troops backed by the United States Navy, a nuclear confrontation that came close to incinerating the island and desperate efforts to bring him down by nine American presidents. He now is working on his 10th. 
 For 42 years, he alone has exercised decisive power. Mr. Castro is himself the system, and when he goes he will take the system with him.
The "transition" has been a taboo subject in Cuba, but some there are beginning to speak more openly about it. Not that the issue is treated with clarity. To the suggestion that Mr. Castro is mortal, Cubans respond that though the leader may pass from the scene, "Castroism will live forever."
It is likely that the Cuban inner circle has some understanding that authority will be exercised collegially. Raul Castro, Fidel's brother and head of the armed forces, is tipped as first among equals. But even Raul has stated that no successor will have Fidel's hold on the Cuban people. Therefore, he has said, the United States should normalize its relations with the island while Fidel is alive.
But the point is, of course, that "normalize" is precisely what the United States has refused to do for 40 years. The embargo, as the Cubans call the American policy, bans any trade or commerce with the island.
This policy derives from a utopian conviction that when Mr. Castro goes, all will naturally change for the better. The island will transform itself into a happy free-market democracy. Therefore, the exiles contend -- and they have persuaded Congress to go along -- that we should allow only minimal human contact with Cuba, permit no trade and sue any European company that "traffics" in nationalized property. 
This is where sober second thoughts should kick in. American policy plays into Mr. Castro's hands by giving substance to his charge that the United States, driven by the Cuban exile leadership, threatens Cuba's independence. More important, the dreamy view of post-Castro Cuba that underlies the embargo is belied by history.
No former Communist state has made a soft landing to democracy. When Communism disappeared in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, disaster ensued. The economies of all the members of the former Communist bloc collapsed. Those who could helped themselves to state property. Inequality skyrocketed. Health systems fell apart, life expectancy plummeted, jobs disappeared.
Even today, governments across the former empire function poorly. Human rights are in short supply, dictators abound and corruption is pervasive. Few of the former Soviet bloc economies have recovered the levels of production of a decade ago.
The post-Castro transition could likewise be grim. And if Cuba does mimic post-Communist Eurasia, this will not be a matter of indifference for the United States. Cuba could emerge, as it was in President Fulgencio Batista's days, as a refuge for organized crime; Cuba lies squarely between the narcotics labs in Colombia and ravenous drug markets in the United States. If the transition is unstable and the economy falls apart, there is also the distinct possibility of another wave of raft migration.
What the United States does now can affect the course of the transition after Mr. Castro. We should be searching for ways to make clear to the Cuban people that Washington does not regard them as permanent enemies. We should pursue opportunities for personal, commercial and diplomatic interchange with Cuba and cooperate in narcotics interdiction and international criminal justice.
In particular, we should establish contact with younger Cubans entering into responsible positions in the state enterprises, government departments and universities. There is a generation of Cubans reaching middle age with no memories of the revolution. This generation has enjoyed the broad access to education and the health-care protection possible under Mr. Castro's rule, and it is entirely possible that one legacy of the past 40 years will be the preparation of an educated middle class capable of building a prosperous nation. That legacy would indeed raise Cuba above all similar countries in the Caribbean and Central America, regardless of what systems they may have tried for themselves since 1959.
Above all, we should find ways to transform the image of the Cuban exiles in the United States from a threat to a promise -- a promise of a better future for the 11 million Cubans who stayed on the island -- which builds on the positive contribution that the Cubans here can make to a post-Castro Cuba. They are a remarkable bank of talent, in the arts, in politics, and most notably in business and commercial management. This has been the critical missing factor in the transformation of socialist economies to market systems. And in Miami, as in Cuba, there is an emerging generation ready to work and uninterested in fighting old battles.
Havana has held out a tentative hand of reconciliation. Cuba's foreign minister has said that his government would welcome a more open relationship. Cuba has embraced the exiles who return to visit.
Present United States policy is a collection of devices supposedly designed to bring the Castro regime to an end. It has been a signal failure. More important, for the present situation, it ignores both American and Cuban national interests, post-Castro. Indeed, it is making a dangerously hard landing all the more probable.
It is time for a change here, in anticipation of the coming change there.

HEADLINE: Surveys Find European Public Critical of Bush Policies 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
Ordinary Europeans strongly back their political leaders' unhappiness with American foreign policy on specific issues like the Kyoto environmental treaty and the Bush administration's threat to withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, polls in France, Germany, Great Britain and Italy show.
 Indeed, on those two issues, European leaders command more public support for their criticism than Mr. Bush does in the United States for the policies themselves. 
 The surveys, conducted early this month for The International Herald Tribune, the Pew Research Center and the Council on Foreign Relations, found that at least 73 percent of the public in the four European countries said that President Bush makes decisions "entirely on U.S. interests" without considering European interests. That 73 percent response came from Germany. Among Italians 74 percent felt that way, as did 79 percent of Britons and 85 percent of the French. 
The telephone surveys of about 1,000 people in each country found that vastly more Europeans liked former President Bill Clinton's foreign policy than liked Mr. Bush's. In Italy, for example, 29 percent endorsed current policies, while 71 percent remembered Mr. Clinton's approach approvingly.
Only in Germany did a slight majority express confidence that Mr. Bush would do the right thing in world affairs -- 51 percent compared with 46 percent who disagreed. Fifty-nine percent of Italians, 64 percent of Britons and 75 percent of French respondents said they did not have confidence in him.
For each country the margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points.
Samuel P. Wells, head of West European studies for the Woodrow Wilson Center, said he was surprised by the depth of the Europeans' feelings. "The strength of opinion holds up across borders and across age groups," he said. If the president "wants Allied support for anything," he added, "he's got his work cut out for him." Mr. Wells blamed the administration's approach for the strength of European antipathy, saying it amounted to: "We will listen to you, but we may not hear you."
In Hamburg, Josef Joffe, chief editor of the German newspaper Die Zeit, said that while these opinions were "not cast in concrete or in granite," they reflected "an underlying reality which is hard to deny" -- that President Bush is a unilateralist. He added that the president was very different from his father, who "was very careful in keeping his international ducks lined up. There was a guy who knew that he represented Mr. Big, but who also understood that Mr. Big needed allies for legitimacy."
But Mr. Joffe said the data also reflected a "kind of trans-Atlantic Kulturkampf," or cultural struggle. He said Europe sees itself as kind of morally and socially superior: "Socially, because we care about social justice and an egalitarian distribution of income. Morally, because we don't have the death penalty."
"This may well be psychological compensation for this sense of growing weaker strategically and economically," he added.
The poll found overwhelming opposition to American policy on two crucial issues.
On American rejection of the Kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gases, only 12 percent of Italians approved, as did 10 percent in the other three countries. Americans themselves oppose Mr. Bush's rejection of the treaty, a separate poll showed, by 44 percent, with 29 percent supporting his decision.
On the question of the United States developing a missile defense system "even if it means withdrawing from the A.B.M. Treaty," 24 percent of Italians approved, while 65 percent did not. Among Britons, 20 percent approved and 66 did not, while 14 percent of the French approved and 75 percent disapproved. In Germany, 10 percent approved and 83 percent did not.
In a Pew poll taken in June, Americans were about evenly split, with 39 percent for and 43 percent against.
The polls did find widespread European approval for the administration's decision last month to keep troops in Bosnia and Kosovo. And solid majorities in each country backed Mr. Bush over his support for free trade.
But except for Britain, where the public was about evenly split, at least two-thirds of the public disapproved of Mr. Bush's support for the death penalty in the United States. Those percentages were 67 percent in France, 68 percent in Germany and 73 percent in Italy.
In Britain, which has banned capital punishment, there is considerable support for reinstating it, a move backed by two-thirds of the public in a 1995 poll. In the United States, according to a poll taken in May by CBS News, 66 percent of the public supports the death penalty, while 24 percent opposes it. 
While there was great variation from country to country in confidence that Mr. Bush would "do the right thing regarding world affairs," in every country he enjoyed more public confidence than Russian President Vladimir V. Putin did, the margin was never large. In Germany, 41 percent had confidence in Mr. Putin, compared to 51 percent for Mr. Bush. In Britain, 26 percent had confidence in Mr. Putin, compared to 30 percent for Mr. Bush. In Italy, 23 percent had confidence for the Russian president, and 33 percent in the American. In France, 14 percent had confidence in Mr. Putin and 20 percent in Mr. Bush. 
The polls suggested that the European unhappiness was more with Mr. Bush than with the United States. Asked whether American and European interests had grown closer or farther apart in recent years, only in Britain did a plurality say they had grown apart, a view held by 24 percent compared with 13 percent who said they had grown closer. The French were about evenly divided, while Germans and Italians were considerably more likely to think European and American interests were converging.
